Especially in the latest part of the annals the peasants’ conditions are described as complicated by taxes, storms, diseases and raidings, and the person who wrote the annals clearly favored the Jutish peasants rather than the country’s king in the years 1313-1320.\n\nIn 1773 Langebek gave the annals the title \"Annales Essenbecenses\", with reference to Essenbæk Abbey and the nearby Randers being mentioned in them several times. Also that in the annals there is mentioned several times the castle on Kalø, but not once any of the other castles built by forced labor in 1314, indicates that the annals were written in Djursland, where alone there was a monastery in Essenbæk Parish. Especially persons and places in Jutland - not least bishops in Aarhus - are mentioned in the annals.\n\nThe Annals of Essenbæk were written no earlier than in 1323, which the last notice in them relates to, and no later than in 1367, when Archbishop Nikles Jonsen (Bild) used them to write his Chronicle of the Archbishops of Lund. The Annals of Essenbæk seem to be based on the Annals of Ryd and the Annals of Lund until about 1262, and the rest of them seem to be original.\n\nAfter the Reformation the annals probably went from the last Catholic archbishop Torbern Bille to his brother Klavs Bille, because about 1590 Historiographer Royal Anders Sørensen Vedel owned ”Alia quaedam chronologica of an old scroll, which Mr. Claus Bilde had, ab anno domini 1027 ad annum domini 1323” (\"Alia quaedam chronologica aff en gamle rulle, som hr. Claus Bilde haffde, ab anno domini 1027 ad annum domini 1323\"), and on another partial copy of the annals, which probably around the same time was hand-written for Huitfeldt, there was noted: ”This I have transcribed and noted off a scroll which belonged to Mr. Claus Bilde” (\"Dette haffuer ieg udskreffuit oc noteret af en rulle som hørde her Claus Bilde thiill\"). The annals have since disappeared.\n\nA manuscript, which is probably from around 1500, is the only nearly complete copy of the annals, and is now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis ex donatione de la Gardie L\".\n\nThe manuscript was owned by St. Johannis Stephanius, when in the 17th century he hand-wrote a poor copy of it. The Stephanian manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis ex donatione de la Gardie XXV-XXIX\", which there are also copies of in Stockholm and Hamburg.\n\nThe probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy since came to Danzig, from where Dalin took it to Uppsala in the 18th century. It is now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Universitas Upsaliensis H 112\". \n\nIn 1664 Vedels partial copy was in the university library, and around 1690 Thomas Broder Bircherod hand-wrote a copy of it. Vedels partial copy burned together with the university library of Copenhagen in 1728. The Bircherodian manuscript from about 1690 does not exist now, but in the 18th century Bircherod and Peder Jensen Lucoppidan each hand-wrote a copy of it. The latest Bircherodian manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 402 in folia\", and the Lucoppidan manuscript is now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 561 in folia\".\n\nTwo hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manucript are now found in the manuscript collection \"Codex Bibliotheca Regia Hafniensis signatus Ny kongelig Samling 570 in folia\". \n\nBased on the Lucoppidan manuscript Ernst Joachim von Westphalen in 1743 published the annals in the third volume of \"Monumenta ininedita rerum Germanicarum praecipue Cimbricarum et Megapolensium\". \n\nLangebek owned the two hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manuscript when in 1773, based on them and a copy of the manuscript which is probably from around 1500, he published the annals in the second volume of \"Scriptores Rerum Danicarum\".\n\nBased on the manuscript which is probably from around 1500, the probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy, the two hand-written copies of the Lucoppidan manuscript, and the copy of the Stephanian manuscript in Hamburg Waitz in 1892 published the annals in the 29th volume of \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\".\n\nBased on the manuscript which is probably from around 1500, the probably for Huitfeldt hand-written partial copy, the latest Bircherodian manuscript and the Lucoppidan manuscript Ellen Jørgensen in 1920 published the annals in \"Annales Danici medii ævi\".\n\nIn 1980 Erik Kroman published the annals in \"Danmarks middelalderlige annaler\".\n\n"}

The \"Daily Mail\" has called it \"the portraiture Oscars\".\n\nBritish Petroleum took over sponsorship of the competition in 1989 from John Player & Sons, a tobacco company which had sponsored it from its inception in 1980, and has sponsored it since. The presence of both sponsors has triggered protests, with the group Art Not Oil (part of the international Rising Tide network) being responsible for most of those against BP. In 2016, The Museums Association conducted a formal investigation into BP's sponsorship when Art Not Oil alleged that the company influenced curatorial decisions and used its association with the National Gallery to further its political interests both domestic and international.\n\nThe exhibition opens in June each year and runs until September. First prize is typically £30,000. In the early years of the century, the prize went up from £5,000, and its catchment area was gradually extended from residents of the UK and is now unrestricted.\n\nIn 1993, Tom Hallifax was used to advertise the awards.\n\nIn 2012 the competition received 2,187 entries from 74 countries (including 1,500 from the UK) of which 55 paintings were selected to be exhibited.\n\n\n\nIt has become a BP Portrait Awards convention that a single work is selected to be used prominently on that year's posters and other publicity materials, and for the cover of the year's exhibition catalogue.

{"id": "4170507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4170507", "title": "Bamboo Annals", "text": "Bamboo Annals\n\nThe Bamboo Annals (), also known as the Ji Tomb Annals (), is a chronicle of ancient China.\nIt begins at the earliest legendary times (the Yellow Emperor) and extends to 299 BC, with the later centuries focusing on the history of the State of Wei in the Warring States period. It thus covers a similar period to Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (91 BC). The original may have been lost during the Song dynasty, and the text is known today in two versions, a \"current text\" (or \"modern text\") of disputed authenticity and an incomplete \"ancient text\".\n\nThe original text was interred with King Xiang of Wei (died 296 BC) and re-discovered nearly six centuries later in 281 AD (Western Jin dynasty) in the Jizhong discovery. For this reason, the chronicle survived the burning of the books by Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Other texts recovered from the same tomb included \"Guoyu\", \"I Ching\", and the \"Tale of King Mu\". They were written on bamboo slips, the usual writing material of the Warring States period, and it is from this that the name of the text derives. The strips were arranged in order and transcribed by court scholars, who identified the work as the state chronicle of Wei. According to Du Yu, who saw the original strips, the text began with the Xia dynasty, and used a series of different pre-Han calendars. However, later indirect reports state that it began with the Yellow Emperor. This version, consisting of 13 scrolls, was lost during the Song dynasty.\nA 3-scroll version of the \"Annals\" is mentioned in the \"History of Song\" (1345), but its relationship to the other versions is not known.\n\nThe \"current text\" (今本 \"jīnběn\") is a 2-scroll version of the text printed in the late 16th century. The first scroll contains a sparse narrative of the pre-dynastic emperors (beginning with the Yellow Emperor), the Xia dynasty and the Shang dynasty. The narrative is interspersed with longer passages on portents, which are identical to passages in the late 5th century \"Book of Song\". The second scroll contains a more detailed account of the history of the Western Zhou, the state of Jin and its successor state Wei, and has no portent passages. This version gave years according to the sexagenary cycle, a practice that began in the Han dynasty. Discrepancies between the text and quotations of the earlier text in older books led scholars such as Qian Daxin and Shinzō Shinjō to dismiss the \"current\" version as a forgery, a view still widely held. Other scholars, notably David Nivison and Edward Shaughnessy, argue that substantial parts of it are faithful copies of the original text.\n\nThe \"ancient text\" (古本 \"gǔběn\") is a partial version assembled through painstaking examination of quotations of the lost original in pre-Song works by Zhu Youzeng (late 19th century), Wang Guowei (1917) and Fan Xiangyong (1956). Fang Shiming and Wang Xiuling (1981) have systematically collated all the available quotations, instead of following earlier scholars in trying to merge variant forms of a passage into a single text.\nThe two works that provide the most quotations, the \"Shui Jing Zhu\" (527) and Sima Zhen's \"Shiji Suoyin\" (early 8th century), seem to be based on slightly different versions of the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned by the Peabody Essex Museum as part of its architectural collection, and is open to the public for guided tours.\n\nThe house is a three-story brick structure, rectangular in shape, with a three-story ell extending the rear. The brick is laid in Flemish bond, and the trim is white marble. The roof is surrounded by a low balustrade above a modillioned cornice, and is pierced by two interior brick chimneys. There are marble trim bands separating the floors, and the third floor windows are shortened. All windows have black shutters, and are topped by lintels with a keystone. The main entrance is sheltered by an elliptical portico supported by four Corinthian columns. The doorway is framed by sidelight windows and an elliptical fanlight, with pilasters rising to the base of the portico top. The house interior features lavishly-carved woodwork in the public spaces on the first floor, including fireplace mantels, cornices, internal window shutters, and the stairway balustrades.\n\nThe house was built in 1804 by Samuel McIntire in a Federal style for John and Sarah (West) Gardner. John bought the lot from his father (John Gardner, Sr) whose cousin (John Gardner III) was the grandfather of John Lowell Gardner I. John and Sarah sold the house to her brother, Nathaniel West, to cover shipping losses related to events leading up to the War of 1812. The house was sold, in 1814, to Capt. Joseph White.

The museum was initially endowed during the 1960s with the permanent art collection of Joseph H. Hirshhorn. It was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It was conceived as the United States' museum of contemporary and modern art and currently focuses its collection-building and exhibition-planning mainly on the post–World War II period, with particular emphasis on art made during the last 50 years.\n\nThe Hirshhorn is sited halfway between the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, anchoring the southernmost end of the so-called L'Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall's green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key element of both the 1791 city plan by Pierre L'Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan.\n\nThe building itself is an attraction, an open cylinder elevated on four massive \"legs,\" with a large fountain occupying the central courtyard. Before architect Gordon Bunshaft designed the building, the Smithsonian staff reportedly told him that, if it did not provide a striking contrast to everything else in the city, then it would be unfit for housing a modern art collection. \n\nIn the late 1930s, the United States Congress mandated an art museum for the National Mall. At the time, the only venue for visual art was the National Gallery of Art, which focuses on Dutch, French, and Italian art. During the 1940s World War II shifted the project into the background.\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph H. Hirshhorn, now in his forties and enjoying great success from uranium-mining investments, began creating his collection from classic French Impressionism to works by living artists, American modernism of the early 20th century, and sculpture. Then, in 1955, Hirshhorn sold his uranium interests for more than $50-million. He expanded his collection to warehouses, an apartment in New York City, and an estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, with extensive area for sculpture.\n\nA 1962 sculpture show at New York's Guggenheim Museum awakened an international art community to the breadth of Hirshhorn's holdings. Word of his collection of modern and contemporary paintings also circulated, and institutions in Italy, Israel, Canada, California, and New York City vied for the collection. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley successfully campaigned for a new museum on the National Mall.\n\nIn 1966, an Act of Congress established the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution. Most of the funding was federal, but Hirshhorn later contributed $1-million toward construction. Joseph and his fourth wife, Olga Zatorsky Hirshhorn, visited the White House. The groundbreaking was in 1969 and Abram Lerner was named the founding Director. He oversaw research, conservation, and installation of more than 6,000 items brought from the Hirshhorns' Connecticut estate and other properties to Washington, DC. \n\nJoseph Hirshhorn spoke at the inauguration (1974), saying:\n\nOne million visitors saw the 850-work inaugural show in the first six months.\n\nIn 1984, James T. Demetrion, fourteen-year director of the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa, succeeded Abram Lerner as the Hirshhorn's director. Art collector and retail store founder Sydney Lewis of Richmond, Virginia, succeeded Senator Daniel P. Moynihan as board chairman. Mr. Demetrion held the post for more than 17 years.\n\nNed Rifkin became director in February 2002, returning to the Hirshhorn after directorship positions at the Menil Collection in Texas and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. Rifkin was previously chief curator of the Hirshhorn from 1986 until 1991. In October 2003, Rifkin was named Under Secretary for Art of the Smithsonian.\n\nIn 2005, Olga Viso was named director of the Hirshhorn. Viso joined the curatorial department of the Hirshhorn in 1995 as assistant curator, was named associate curator in 1998, and served as curator of contemporary art from 2000 to 2003. In October 2003, Viso was named deputy director of the Hirshhorn, a post she held until her 2005 promotion to director. After two years, Ms. Viso accepted the position of Director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, departing in December 2007.\n\nChief Curator and Deputy Director Kerry Brougher served as Acting Director for more than a year until an international search led to the hiring of Richard Koshalek, who was named the fifth director of the Hirshhorn in February, 2009.\n\nRichard Koshalek (born 1942) was president of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., from 1999 until January 2009. Before that, he served as director of The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles for nearly 20 years. At both institutions, he was noted for his commitment to new artistic initiatives, including commissioned works, scholarly exhibitions and publications and the building of new facilities that garnered architectural acclaim. He worked with architect Frank Gehry on the design and construction of MOCA's Geffen Contemporary (1983), a renovated warehouse popularly known as the Temporary Contemporary. He also worked with the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki on the museum's permanent home in Los Angeles (1986). Koshalek resigned in 2013 after the Bloomberg Bubble controversy (see below).\n\nOn June 5, 2014, Hirshhorn trustees announced that they had hired Melissa Chiu, director of Asia Society Museum in New York City, to be the Hirshhorn's new director. Chiu, who was born in Darwin, Australia, is a scholar of contemporary Chinese art. Chiu oversaw the Hirshhorn's 40th anniversary celebration in the fall of 2014. Chiu began her tenure at the Hirshhorn in September 2014.\n\nNotable artists in the collection include: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, John Chamberlain, Francis Bacon, Willem de Kooning, Milton Avery, Ellsworth Kelly, Louise Nevelson, Arshile Gorky, Edward Hopper, Larry Rivers, and Raphael Soyer among others. Outside the museum is a sculpture garden, featuring works by artists including Auguste Rodin, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean-Robert Ipoustéguy, Jeff Koons, and others.\n\nYoko Ono's \"Wish Tree for Washington, DC\", a permanent installation in the Sculpture Garden (since 2007), now includes contributions from all over the world.\n\nIn 2009, then Director Richard Koshalek announced that an inflatable structure would be erected over the Hirshhorn's central plaza to create a new public space. The Seasonal Inflatable Structure, to be called the \"Bloomberg Bubble,\" was due to be erected in 2013 and would be inflated annually for one two-month period. It was supposed to create a 14,000-square-foot space for performance and lectures. Designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the proposal won a progressive architecture award from \"Architect\" magazine.\n\nHirshhorn officials began reconsidering the Bubble in 2013. Construction cost estimates for the structure more than tripled to $15.5 million from $5 million, and no major gifts for the project were received between 2010 and May 2013. A Hirshhorn study also concluded that the cost of programming (such as symposia and special events) using the Bubble were likely to run a $2.8 million annual deficit. The Hirshhorn's board of directors evenly split on a vote to proceed with the project in May 2013. In the wake of the vote, seen as a referendum on his leadership, museum director Richard Koshalek announced he would resign by the end of 2013. Constance Caplan, chair of the museum's board of trustees, resigned on July 8, 2013. She cited what the \"Washington Post\" characterized as \"a board, a museum and the larger Smithsonian Institution at a crossroads, roiled by a lack of transparency, trust, vision and good faith\". Four of the board's 15 members resigned between June 2012 and April 2013, and three more (including Caplan) in May, June and July 2013.\n\nThe museum was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft (1909-1990) and provides of exhibition space inside and nearly four acres outside in its two-level Sculpture Garden and plaza. \"The New York Times\" described it as: \"a fortress of a building that works as a museum.\" An original plan with a reflecting pool across the Mall was approved in July 1967. When excavation started, a controversy arose, resulting in a revised design, with a smaller footprint, which was approved on July 1, 1971.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden drew around 645,000 visitors. It has a budget of $8 million, which does not include the $10 to $12 million in operational support supplied by the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\n\n"}

Hispanicization is illustrated by spoken Spanish, production and consumption of Hispanic food, Spanish language music, and participation in Hispanic festivals and holidays. In the former Spanish colonies, the term is also used in the narrow linguistic sense of the Spanish language replacing indigenous languages.\n\nWithin Spain, the term hispanization can refer to the cultural and linguistic absorption of the Berber Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands in the century following their conquest in the 15th century.\n\nIt is much more rarely used as a synonym for castilianisation (castellanización) i.e. the historical process whereby speakers of minority Spanish languages such as Basque, Catalan, Galician, Asturian, Leonese or Aragonese are linguistically assimilated and progressively abandon their language for Spanish. Since all of the aforementioned languages are co-official national languages together with Castilian Spanish, the term castilianisation is preferred.\n\nAccording to the 2000 United States Census, about 75% of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Hispanic retention rates are so high in parts of Texas and New Mexico and along the border because the percentage of Hispanics living there is also very high. Laredo, Texas; Chimayo, New Mexico; Nogales, Arizona; and Coachella, California, for example, all have Hispanic populations greater than 90 percent. Furthermore, in these places have had a Hispanic-majority population since the time of the Spanish conquest and colonization of the area in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nIn Spanish America it is also used to refer to the imposition of the Spanish language in the former Spanish colonies such as Mexico and its adoption by indigenous peoples. This refers to Spain's influence which began in the late 15th century and the Spanish Empire beginning in the colonization of the Canary Islands in 1402 which is now part of Spain. Later the landing of Christopher Columbus in 1492 in the Caribbean then Central America and South America. All these countries were Hispanicised; however, there are still many people there who hold a culture that still has its origins in the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Until recently, castilianization has been official policy by the governments of many Hispanic American countries. Only recently programs of intercultural bilingual education have been introduced to a substantial extent.\n\nThe Philippines archipelago was ruled from Mexico City as a territory of New Spain, from 1565 to 1821 and as a province of Spain until 1898. Since the late 16th century, Spanish and Hispanic culture has intemperately influenced, shaped, and became the foundation of modern Filipino cultural landscape. Derived from Austronesian and Iberian influences, modern Filipino culture is described as a blend of Eastern and Western (mostly Spanish) traditions. Although most Filipinos speak an Austronesian language, the languages of the Philippines have thousands of Spanish loanwords. Furthermore, a number of Filipinos to the south speak a Spanish-based Creole known as Chavacano. This is also true with the Chamorro language in Guam, which lived side by side with Spanish for over 300 years. Many people consider these languages of the Pacific, Hispano-Austronesian languages, because of the heavy influence of Spanish on the language.\n\n\n\n"}

The messages were largely encrypted by Enigma machines.\n\nLocated initially in one of the original single-story wooden huts, the name “Hut 3” was retained when Huts 3, 6 & 8 moved to a new brick building, Block D, in February 1943. Then the decodes from Hut 6 for Hut 3 \nwhich had been sent in a wooden tray from one hatch to another via a wooden tunnel between the huts were sent from the Hut 6 Decoding Room by a conveyor belt that “never stopped” \n\nThe Enigma “Red” cypher was the main cypher used by the Luftwaffe in every theatre where they operated. Red had been broken sporadically from the beginning of 1940, and from 22 May BP overcame some changes to the Enigma machines. From then on, Hut 6 broke Red daily to the end of the war, and it became the “constant staple” of ULTRA. Calvocoressi wrote that later in the war “we in Hut 3 would get a bit tetchy if Hut 6 had not broken Red by breakfast time.” \n\nInitially there were only four people in Hut 3, and there were serious personal frictions between them. They were the original leader, Lieutenant-Commander Malcolm Saunders, Squadron Leader Robert Humphreys (senior liaison officer with the Air Force), Captain Curtis (senior liaison officer with the War Office, who knew no German), and Cambridge academic F. L. Lucas who had been in the Intelligence Corps in World War I. Humphreys was “an excellent German linguist, but no team player. He wanted to get his own way. He found this difficult to do if only because Saunders had a mind of his own. Nigel de Grey described the situation as 'an imbroglio of conflicting jealousies, intrigues and differing opinions'. Initially Travis moved the three [Saunders, Humphreys and Curtis] out of Hut 3 and put a small committee including Eric Jones in charge. As this did not work, Jones was made sole head in July 1942. Just over a year after he took over, H. S. Marchant was made his deputy, and the pair were in charge to the end of the war.” \n\nArmy and Air Force Ultra was distributed by the SLUs (Special Liaison Units) set up by Frederick Winterbotham. By the end of the war there were about 40 SLUs to 40 commands. Signals were given a priority from Z to ZZZZZ (the highest of 5), and about 100,000 signals were sent to commands during the war \n\nThe rules of interpretation for Hut 3 were that if the text was not explicit the Hut 3 officer could not add his interpretation without qualification; for a 1944 SS Panzer message where the placename had been missed or corrupted when received, the officer did not say simply “Dreux” but would say “slight indications Dreux” or\n“fair indications Dreux” or “strong indications Dreux”. They could also add glosses preceded by the word “Comment”.\n\nThe Air Index had “hundreds of thousands” of cards about 5 by 9 inches; so important that they were photographed and stored in the underground stack of the Bodleian Library in Oxford in case they were destroyed by bombing. Run by “about two dozen girls” and a man who was a “strange genius”, it had cards for every individual, unit, place or equipment so that any previous reference to (say) Major So-and-So could be found. There were two card indexes, 3A & 3M.\n\nA photograph of the Officers of 3A in 1943 or 1944 names them as: Labertouche, Brooke, Faure, Newton-John, Haskins, Bragg, Ware, Squire, Calvocoressi, van Norden, Harrow, Myers, Pilley, Manners-Wood, Rose, Cullingham, Millward.\n\n"}

{"id": "16315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16315", "title": "Joseph Campbell", "text": "Joseph Campbell\n\nJoseph John Campbell (1904–1987) was an American Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.\n\nSince the publication of \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", Campbell's theory has been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his \"Star Wars\" saga.\n\nJoseph Campbell was born in White Plains, New York, on March 26, 1904, the son of Josephine (née Lynch) and Charles William Campbell. He was from an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family. During his childhood, he moved with his family to nearby New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his grandmother.\n\nIn 1921, Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. While at Dartmouth College he studied biology and mathematics, but decided that he preferred the humanities. He transferred to Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1925 and a Master of Arts degree in medieval literature in 1927. At Dartmouth he had joined Delta Tau Delta. An accomplished athlete, he received awards in track and field events, and, for a time, was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.\n\nIn 1924, Campbell traveled to Europe with his family. On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the Theosophical Society, Jiddu Krishnamurti; they discussed Indian philosophy, sparking in Campbell an interest in Hindu and Indian thought. In 1927, he received a fellowship from Columbia University to study in Europe. Campbell studied Old French, Provençal, and Sanskrit at the University of Paris and the University of Munich. He learned to read and speak French and German.\n\nOn his return to Columbia University in 1929, Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and modern art in addition to Medieval literature. Lacking faculty approval, Campbell withdrew from graduate studies. Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the liberal arts, the discipline covering his work.\n\nWith the arrival of the Great Depression, Campbell spent the next five years (1929–1934) living in a rented shack in Woodstock, New York. There, he contemplated the next course of his life while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study. He later said that he \"would divide the day into four four-hour periods, of which I would be reading in three of the four-hour periods, and free one of them ... I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight.\"\n\nCampbell traveled to California for a year (1931–1932), continuing his independent studies and becoming close friends with the budding writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol. Campbell was introduced to the Steinbecks by author and early nutritionist Adelle Davis whom he met and developed a close relationship with on a cruise to the Caribbean with his father in December 1929. On the Monterey Peninsula, Campbell, like John Steinbeck, fell under the spell of the marine biologist Ed Ricketts (the model for \"Doc\" in Steinbeck's novel \"Cannery Row\" as well as central characters in several other novels). Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska on the \"Grampus\". Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but, unlike Steinbeck, did not complete his book.\n\nBruce Robison writes that\nCampbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in 1933 at the Canterbury School, during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction. While teaching at the Canterbury School, Campbell sold his first short story \"Strictly Platonic\" to \"Liberty\" magazine.\n\nIn 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College. In 1938, he married one of his former students, the dancer-choreographer Jean Erdman. For most of their 49 years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. They did not have any children.\n\nEarly in World War II, Campbell attended a lecture by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer; the two men became good friends. After Zimmer's death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer's papers, which he would do over the following decade.\n\nIn 1955–1956, as the last volume of Zimmer's posthumous (\"The Art of Indian Asia, its Mythology and Transformations\") was finally about to be published, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled, for the first time, to Asia. He spent six months in southern Asia (mostly India) and another six in East Asia (mostly Japan). This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth, and also on the necessity for teaching comparative mythology to a larger, non-academic audience.\n\nIn 1972, Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College, after having taught there for 38 years.\n\nCampbell attended a Grateful Dead concert in 1986, and marveled that \"Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here!\" With the Dead, Campbell put on a conference called \"Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead\".\n\nCampbell died at his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 30, 1987, from complications of esophageal cancer. Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with Bill Moyers that aired the following spring as \"The Power of Myth\". He is buried in O'ahu Cemetery, Honolulu.\n\nCampbell often referred to the work of modern writers James Joyce and Thomas Mann in his lectures and writings, as well as to the art of Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann.\n\nThe works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell's thinking; he quoted their writing frequently.\n\nThe \"follow your bliss\" philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of \"The Power of Myth\" (see below) derives from the Hindu Upanishads; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922 Sinclair Lewis novel \"Babbitt\". In \"The Power of Myth,\" Campbell quotes from the novel:\n\nThe anthropologist Leo Frobenius and his disciple Adolf Ellegard Jensen were important to Campbell's view of cultural history. Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof.\n\nCampbell's ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud, but in particular on the work of Jung, whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell. Campbell's conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation, which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation. Jung's insights into archetypes were heavily influenced by the \"Bardo Thodol\" (also known as \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\"). In his book \"The Mythic Image\", Campbell quotes Jung's statement about the \"Bardo Thodol\", that it\n\nCampbell's concept of \"monomyth\" (one myth) refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Campbell often referred to the ideas of Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called \"folk\" and \"elementary\" ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as \"the hero's journey\" and was first described in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949). An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce, Campbell borrowed the term \"monomyth\" from Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\". Campbell also made heavy use of Carl Jung's theories on the structure of the human psyche, and he often used terms such as \"anima\"/\"animus\" and \"ego consciousness\".\n\nAs a strong believer in the psychic unity of mankind and its poetic expression through mythology, Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world \"transparent to transcendence\" by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time, suffering, and ultimately death. To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words, a seemingly impossible task, the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths. These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent. The Hero's Journey was the story of the man or woman who, through great suffering, reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free.\n\nAs this story spread through space and evolved through time, it was broken down into various local forms (masks), depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it. The basic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero's adventure through the story, stages such as \"the Call to Adventure, Receiving Supernatural Aid, Meeting with the Goddess/Atonement with the Father\" and \"Return\". These stages, as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story, provide the necessary metaphors to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey. Metaphor for Campbell, in contrast with \"comparisons\" which make use of the word \"like\", pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to, as in the sentence \"Jesus is the Son of God\" rather than \"the relationship of man to God is \"like\" that of a son to a father\".\n\nIn the 2000 documentary \"Joseph Campbell: A Hero's Journey\", he explains God in terms of a metaphor:\n\nGod is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.\n\nSome scholars have disagreed with the concept of the \"monomyth\" because of its oversimplification of different cultures. According to Robert Ellwood, \"A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking.\"\n\nCampbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society. These appear at the end of his work \"The Masks of God: Creative Mythology\", as well as various lectures.\n\n\n\n\n\nCampbell's view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time, reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust. Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems. In brief these are:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1991, Campbell's widow, choreographer Jean Erdman, worked with Campbell's longtime friend and editor, Robert Walter, to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation.\n\nInitiatives undertaken by the JCF include: \"The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell\", a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell's myriad-minded work; the Erdman Campbell Award; the Mythological RoundTables, a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology, psychology, religion and culture; and the collection of Campbell's library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center.\n\nGeorge Lucas was the first Hollywood filmmaker to credit Campbell's influence. Lucas stated, following the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film in 1977, that its story was shaped, in part, by ideas described in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" and other works of Campbell's. The linkage between \"Star Wars\" and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell's book used the image of Luke Skywalker on the cover. Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell, \"A Fire in the Mind\":\n\nI came to the conclusion after \"American Graffiti\" that what's valuable for me is to set standards, not to show people the world the way it is...around the period of this realization...it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology...The Western was possibly the last generically American fairy tale, telling us about our values. And once the Western disappeared, nothing has ever taken its place. In literature we were going off into science fiction...so that's when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales, folklore, and mythology, and I started reading Joe's books. Before that I hadn't read any of Joe's books...It was very eerie because in reading \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" I began to realize that my first draft of \"Star Wars\" was following classic motifs... So I modified my next draft [of \"Star Wars\"] according to what I'd been learning about classical motifs and made it a little bit more consistent...I went on to read 'The Masks of God' and many other books.\n\nIt was not until after the completion of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy in 1983, however, that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures. In 1984, Campbell gave a lecture at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, with Lucas in the audience, who was introduced through their mutual friend Barbara McClintock. A few years later, Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire \"Star Wars\" trilogy at Skywalker Ranch, which Campbell called \"real art\". This meeting led to the filming of the 1988 documentary \"The Power of Myth\" at Skywalker Ranch. In his interviews with Bill Moyers, Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used \"The Hero's Journey\" in the \"Star Wars\" films (IV, V, and VI) to re-invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer. Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999 called the \"Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers\" to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films. In addition, the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\", which discussed the ways in which Campbell's work shaped the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\nMany filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell's work on their own craft. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood screenwriter, created a seven-page company memo based on Campbell's work, \"A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces\", which led to the development of Disney's 1994 film \"The Lion King\". Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are \"The Matrix\" series, the Batman series and the \"Indiana Jones\" series. Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV show \"Community\", often references Campbell as a major influence. According to him, he uses a \"story circle\" to formulate every story he writes, in a formulation of Campbell's work.\n\nAfter the explosion of popularity brought on by the \"Star Wars\" films and \"The Power of Myth\", creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell's theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns. Novelists, songwriters, video game designers have studied Campbell's work in order to better understand mythology – in particular, the monomyth – and its impact.\n\nThe novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth. In his best known work, \"Watership Down\", Adams uses extracts from \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" as chapter epigrams.\n\nDan Brown mentioned in a \"New York Times\" interview that Joseph Campbell's works, particularly \"The Power of Myth\" and \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon.\n\nOne of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to \"follow your bliss\". He derived this idea from the Upanishads:\n\nNow, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat-Chit-Ananda. The word \"Sat\" means being. \"Chit\" means consciousness. \"Ananda\" means bliss or rapture. I thought, \"I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being.\" I think it worked.\n\nHe saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:\n\nIf you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are—if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.\n\nCampbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that \"The Power of Myth\" was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell's death, \"Follow your bliss\" was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American public—both religious and secular.\n\nDuring his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism, Campbell is reported to have grumbled, \"I should have said, 'Follow your \"blisters\".'\"\n\nCampbell's scholarship and understanding of Sanskrit has been questioned. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto, said that he once met Campbell, and that the two \"hated each other at sight\", commenting that, \"When I met Campbell at a public gathering, he was quoting Sanskrit verses. He had no clue as to what he was talking about; he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement. I remember thinking: this man is corrupt. I know that he was simply \"lying\" about his understanding\". According to Richard Buchen, librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well. However, Buchen adds that Campbell worked closely with three scholars who did translate Sanskrit well.\n\nEllwood observes that \"The Masks of God\" series \"impressed literate laity more than specialists\"; he quotes Stephen P. Dunn as remarking that in \"Occidental Mythology\" Campbell \"writes in a curiously archaic style – full of rhetorical questions, exclamations of wonder and delight, and expostulations directed at the reader, or perhaps at the author's other self – which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest.\" Ellwood notes that \"Campbell was not really a social scientist, and those in the latter camp could tell\" and records a concern about Campbell's \"oversimpification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean\". The critic Camille Paglia, writing in \"Sexual Personae\" (1990), expressed disagreement with Campbell's \"negative critique of fifth-century Athens\" in \"Occidental Mythology\", arguing that Campbell missed the \"visionary and exalted\" androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys. Paglia has written that while Campbell is \"a seminal figure for many American feminists\", she loathes him for his \"mawkishness and bad research.\" Paglia has called Campbell \"mushy\" and a \"false teacher\", and described his work as a \"fanciful, showy mishmash\".\n\nThe religious studies scholar Russell T. McCutcheon characterized the \"following [of] the bliss of self-realization\" in Campbell's work as \"spiritual and psychological legitimation\" for Reaganomics.\n\nCampbell has also been accused of antisemitism by some authors. Brendan Gill, in an article published in \"The New York Review of Books\" in 1989, accused Campbell of both antisemitism and prejudice against blacks. Gill's article resulted in a series of letters to the editor, some supporting the charge of antisemitism or accusing Campbell of having various other right-wing biases, others defending him. However, Robert Ellwood wrote that Gill relied on \"scraps of evidence, largely anecdotal\" to support his charges against Campbell. Masson accused Campbell of \"hidden anti-Semitism\" and \"fascination with conservative, semifascistic views\". Contrarily, the \"fascist undercurrents\" in Campbell's work and especially its influence on \"Star Wars\" have been called \"a reminder of how easily totalitarianism can knock at any society's door.\"\n\nThe first published work that bore Campbell's name was \"Where the Two Came to Their Father\" (1943), an account of a Navajo ceremony that was performed by singer (medicine man) Jeff King and recorded by artist and ethnologist Maud Oakes, recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the hogan of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. Campbell provided a commentary. He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars (\"folk ideas\") of Native American stories.\n\nAs noted above, James Joyce was an important influence on Campbell. Campbell's first important book (with Henry Morton Robinson), \"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\" (1944), is a critical analysis of Joyce's final text \"Finnegans Wake\". In addition, Campbell's seminal work, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), discusses what Campbell called the \"monomyth\" – the cycle of the journey of the hero – a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nFrom his days in college through the 1940s, Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction. In many of his later stories (published in the posthumous collection \"Mythic Imagination\") he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes. These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non-fiction.\n\nOriginally titled \"How to Read a Myth\", and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at Sarah Lawrence College, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" was published in 1949 as Campbell's first foray as a solo author; it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains, arguably, his most influential work to this day. The book argues that hero stories such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis. Not only did it introduce the concept of the hero's journey to popular thinking, but it also began to popularize the very idea of comparative mythology itself—the study of the human impulse to create stories and images that, though they are clothed in the motifs of a particular time and place, draw nonetheless on universal, eternal themes. Campbell asserted:\n\nWherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd. When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved.\nPublished between 1959 and 1968, Campbell's four-volume work \"The Masks of God\" covers mythology from around the world, from ancient to modern. Where \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" focused on the commonality of mythology (the \"elementary ideas\"), the \" Masks of God\" books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on (the \"folk ideas\"). In other words, where \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" draws perhaps more from psychology, the \" Masks of God\" books draw more from anthropology and history. The four volumes of \"Masks of God\" are as follows: \"Primitive Mythology\", \"Oriental Mythology\", \"Occidental Mythology\", and \"Creative Mythology\".\n\nThe book is quoted by proponents of the Christ myth theory. Campbell writes, \"It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Campbell was in the midst of working upon a large-format, lavishly illustrated series entitled \"Historical Atlas of World Mythology\". This series was to build on Campbell's idea, first presented in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", that myth evolves over time through four stages:\n\nOnly the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell's death. Campbell's editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell's death. The works are now out of print. , Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new, ebook edition.\n\nCampbell's widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with Bill Moyers on the PBS series \"The Power of Myth\", which was first broadcast in 1988, the year following Campbell's death. The series discusses mythological, religious, and psychological archetypes. A book, \"The Power of Myth\", containing expanded transcripts of their conversations, was released shortly after the original broadcast.\n\nThe \"Collected Works of Joseph Campbell\" series is a project initiated by the Joseph Campbell Foundation to release new, authoritative editions of Campbell's published and unpublished writing, as well as audio and video recordings of his lectures. Working with New World Library and Acorn Media UK, as well as publishing audio recordings and ebooks under its own banner, the project has produced over seventy-five titles. The series's executive editor is Robert Walter, and the managing editor is David Kudler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\nWorks cited\n\nBooks\n\nArticles\n\n"}

It provides the most comprehensive and systematic record of every stamp from the first Customs issue of 1878 to the Dah Tung print Postage Due stamp in 1947. \"Ma's Illustrated Catalogue\" differs from other stamp catalogues as it goes beyond a simple listing of stamps. \"Ma's catalogue\" provides a wealth of philately related information of high historical significance that is much needed in the research and study of early Chinese stamps. Today many refer to this catalogue as simply \"馬氏圖鑑\" or \"馬氏國郵圖鑑\".\n\nThe first edition was primarily sourced from hand written manuscripts edited by the late Ma Zung-Sung (馬潤叟 1872-1945). His son, Ma Ren-Chuen (馬任全 1908-1988), already a postal expert in Chinese stamps and like his father a philatelist, was inspired by his father's unfinished wish to put together a comprehensive catalogue during the last four years of his life. After his father's death in 1945, and after extensive consultation with a number of Shanghai's authoritative philatelic experts and philatelic literature collectors, he compiled and supplemented his father's original manuscripts and then translated the entire work from traditional Chinese to English. The first edition was published with 661 black & white illustrations. The costs for typesetting, proofreading, printing, publishing, and distributing were self-funded by Ma alone. A small quantity of 1000 copies was printed by Shun Chang & Co. (順昌), in Shanghai, China in June 1947 (民國三十六年). For many years the catalogue was the most inclusive stamp catalogue ever published in China, and it was\nthe first and the only one printed in both Chinese and English texts together in one volume and exclusively published by a Chinese person. Stamp catalogues prior to Ma's were all available only in English and were printed overseas by foreign stamp dealers, often including incomplete or contradicting information among the various catalogues. The catalogue had made it possible for universal sharing and education of early Chinese stamps by all collectors in China or overseas.\n\nWhen first published the catalogue was regarded as a considerable expense. There was no set retail price as this was unnecessary for a self-published and privately sold book. The book was sold at the office of the printing house. A full page advertisement on the back cover of the November 1947 issue of \"The New Light Philatelic Magazine\", Vol 14, No. 2 (《新光郵票雜誌》民國三十六年十一月十四卷第二期) listed the retail price of the catalogue as 500,000 yuan in National Currency. To put this price into perspective, the highest bank note denomination in 1947 was a 10,000 yuan note, the magazine where the advertisement appeared was sold for 10,000 yuan a copy, and the price for placing the full page advertisement was 2,400,000 yuan. In other words, if the magazine was sold for $10 a copy, a fair market price in 2016, then the catalogue would have been sold at an equivalent of $500, which was considered by many to be a substantial amount of money.\n\nThe first edition has a scarlet colour hardcover with gilt lettering in both Traditional Chinese (馬潤叟遺著，馬任全譯纂 written vertically) and English (written horizontally) on the front cover. A small horse emblem (\"馬圖\", pronounced \"Ma\" in Chinese, the editor's last name, mainly used for anti-counterfeiting) is embossed at the centre of the back cover. The front and back covers are further embossed with wrinkle like patterns such as those found on the palm of a hand, except within the area of the horse emblem. The number 1947 is located right below the book title frame. Every authentic copy has a distinct serial number (out of 1000) stamped in black ink on the endpaper opposite the back cover. The pages are bound together, using the \"Sewing Through the Fold\" method, with four binding threads visible. It has 568 pages. The book measures 14mm x 19.5mm. The paper used is an advanced and costly paper called Art Paper (銅版紙), often referred as Coated Printing Paper (塗佈印刷紙), or Coated Paper (粉紙). The paper is coated with a thin clay to give it a more prestigious feel and elegant look. The prints can be felt when running one's fingers over the page. The pages are uncut, and lie flat when the book is opened. There is no dust jacket issued with this book.\n\nThe cost for the paper and for the printing material are primary factors for the extremely high retail price.\n\nThe first edition proved to be extremely popular and was quickly regarded by many to be the Bible of China Philately. On account of the very low initial production, a retail price not affordable by most collectors, and the lack of official second printings or updated editions for the next 40+ years, many unauthorized copies were produced in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan and sold worldwide well into the 1980s. While the author was well aware of the outright stealing of his work, he was neither compensated, nor have the ability to enforce a stop to the copying due to China's political environment at the time and its isolation from the rest of the world, which both had immense affect and influence on publication and copyright laws. In a written correspondence with Mr. Ma You Zhang (see third edition) dated January 9, 2017, he wrote, \"1949，10，1 新中国成立以后，不断的政治运动对出版事业造成很大的影响，如不了解这段社会政治历史，无法解释与出版有关的法律与实践。\". And because the reprints were purposely made to look like the original work, the reprint books themselves do not say that they are reprints. In fact, the publication date of June 1947 on the title page and July 1947 on the copyright page both remain unchanged in those books printed at a much later date. The original first edition and the unauthorized reprints may be distinguished by the following descriptions and distinct features.\n\nTo catalogue early Chinese stamps is complicated. The first postage stamps in China were, in fact, issued by the western nations occupying special concessions, known as 'Treaty Ports', which had been snatched from Imperial China by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The first Treaty Ports stamp was issued in 1865 by the Shanghai Municipal Post, with additional Local Posts followed in sixteen other Treaty Ports. The postal services were taken over by the Qing government in November 1897 after it established the Imperial Chinese Post. After the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, central authority was broken apart. During the period of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949), ongoing conflict between the Beiyang government, the Nationalist's Guomindang government, the Communist party (about 1930 - 1949), the remnant Northern warlords government, and the Empire of Japan all further fragmented China's postal system. Without a unified central government, the semi-autonomous regional governments issued their own stamps at various times to meet postal needs; Japan had issued \"Occupation\" stamps through their puppet governments, and the Chinese Communist Party had issued \"Liberated area\" stamps. The designation \"Liberated Areas\" refers to areas the Communists \"liberated\" from the Nationalists and / or the Japanese. The Liberated Areas alone already issued an estimated more than 500 sets of stamps with over 2,300 values. As these stamps are printed under war conditions, done mostly underground, and most of the stamps are coarsely printed using the simplest printing techniques on sub-standard equipment, and made use of any raw material available at the time. In fact, the first stamps issued by the new Nationalist government simply utilized remaining stocks of Imperial stamps, overprinting them with the words, 'Republic of China' until they could print new stamps. Outside of the Liberated Areas, co-existing provisional governments also find themselves difficult to unify their monetary system with the central authority of the time. Disparities and devaluation of local currencies from the ever-changing National Currency (oftentimes value had to be recalculated in a matter of hours) only promoted speculation on stamps. Such complicating factors demanded an unusual varieties of overprints (to restrict their use in a designated region so to stop speculators from profiting) or surcharging (charging extra money in National currency to make up for the difference in value). Moreover, as the central printing is done in Beijing or by externally contracted printers, the stamps are often delayed and rendering the value printed on the stamps useless. At times of an urgent need for postage stamps quickly, stocks of old issue stamps are simply overprinted by the local Post Masters, which often resulted in minor differences in design and colour variations occurring between official printers. After such a long period of complicated factors, coupled with other secret markings and numerous printing errors in between had all made it very difficult to distinguish and to document every early Chinese stamp, comprehensively or by chronological order alone.\n\nIn all, there are five main issuers of early Chinese stamps - Treaty Ports, Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, Japanese occupation, and Liberated areas. Ma's Illustrated Catalogue focused on stamps officially issued by the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, along with relevant provincial issues, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps issued during the same period.\n\nMa's first edition catalogue listed stamps under a numbering system now universally recognized as the Ma's catalogue number (馬氏編號). Numbers without a preceding letter are regular issues of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China. An Alphabet Letter preceding a stamp number denotes special purpose stamps or territorial stamps such as Provincial Overprints, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps. Letters following the stamp number are stamp errors and other special varieties.\n\nThe first edition neither provides a table of contents nor an index.\n\nThe catalogue does not provide coverage for Military stamps, postcards, aerogramme, and stamps issued by treaty ports, colonial outposts, revolutionary base, and liberated areas.\n\nAlthough the catalogue is printed in both Chinese and English text together, the material presented are not formal equivalent in nature and should not be regarded as a word-for-word translation.\n\nDiagrams of overprints and special markings are not photo extrapolation from actual stamps, rather they are hand-drawn diagrams where the actual location or the size of some letters may not correspond exactly to an actual stamp.\n\nRegular Issues of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China are listed in chronological order. A total of 1115 varieties are recorded.\n\nProvincial Overprint Issues, Air Mail stamps, and Postage Due stamps are grouped by province, then by stamp issue, then by special printing varieties such as printer name and special watermark. This section recorded over 1992 varieties.\n\nDetailed issuing history, features, and variations including the date of issue, denomination, origin of the paper, quality of paper, quality of gum, printer's name, watermark, colour, ink, perforation, number of panes per sheet, number of stamps per sheet and how they are positioned, and how many lots had been issued, are noted within.\n\nIn the first edition the stamp prices quoted are in \"Stamp Units\", a reference value not tied to a particular currency. It is useful only for indicating the relative degree of rarity/value from one stamp to another, and should not be interpreted as an actual dollar amount. Since this book does not get updated on a frequent basis like other annually published stamp catalogues, there is an advantage to the \"Stamp Units\" style of pricing. Unfortunately it is not useful for anyone trying to price their collection with the most current street value. In subsequent editions the currency of the publisher country is used as a base for representing local value in order to be more useful to local collectors.\n\nPrices for plate blocks are provided in the first edition. These prices are removed in subsequent editions.\n\nThe Chinese text portion refers to dates prior to 1912 by the Chinese Era Name (the last emperor officially abdicated on February 12, 1912), after 1912 by the Minguo Calendar, while the English text uses the Gregorian Calendar.\n\nThe 1988 revised and supplemented second edition was also edited by Ma Ren-Chuen. It was the first revision and update of the original catalogue since its publication 40 years earlier, and which Ma had decided to publish separate Chinese and English editions of the catalogue. The Chinese version of the catalogue was finished by 1983 and was sent to 中國集郵出版社 for publication. However, by 1985 the new edition was still not published. After much inquiries by his family and colleagues, they found the reason for the delay was partly due to the inclusion of some politically sensitive commemorative stamps issued near the final years of the Republic of China which at the time were deemed to be the \"enemies of the people\" and deemed inappropriate for publication by the 中國集郵出版社. Unfortunately the inclusion of such stamps was unavoidable for attaining comprehensive information on stamps issued in that period. Finally another printing house, Shanghai Cultural Press, 上海文化出版社, in early 1986 agreed to take on the printing of the Chinese text version. After this happy news Ma immediately began translating the entire work to English for the English publication.\n\nMa was then in the last years of his life and had been diagnosed with lung cancer in early 1987. Knowing that the translation work might never be completed if he were to stop, he asked to postpone all surgeries necessary for removing his cancer tumour and only to remain on mild medication for his cancer treatment in order to continue his work on finishing the catalogue while at the hospital. His son Ma Youzhang in an article published in the January 1989 edition of China Philately paying tribute to his late father accounted for how his father while updating the English manuscripts of the catalogue would secretly return home from the hospital when his work required it. Ma's determination to finish the catalogue while he was still alive never left him. The English revision was finally completed by the end of 1987 and was sent to Lee H. Hill Jr. for publication in the USA under Hill-Donnelly Corporation, and appointing Lee as his representative with full powers to find a publisher to publish the new catalogue. Lee H. Hill Jr., who now operated a publishing house, is an old acquaintance of Ma, whom he met while on a business trip to the United States back in 1947. While Lee H. Hill took only four months to edit and typeset the manuscripts and promised the book would be published by the end of July, and he would send the first copy to Ma by express mail. Ma Ren Chuen passed away on July 15, 1988, and he never saw the second editions, in English or Chinese, in book-form.\n\nThe catalogue had been expanded to cover all the Republic of China issues through the Silver Yuan issues of 1949, Military Post, Stamp Booklets, and stamps issued while under Japanese Occupation and the British Railway Administration. Also added were new date and quantity of issue information, additional pictures showing the stamp varieties within the same issue, and hand-drawn illustrations showing intricate details for identifying them.\n\nThe English text version is soft-bound, with gold lettering on a blue cover. The location of the date 1947 first printed on the first edition has been updated to read 1988. The Ma's reference numbering system follows that of the original 1947 edition. Newly added is a Table of Contents and a cross-reference table of \"Modern\" vs. \"Traditional\" spellings (for example, \"Beijing\" vs. \"Peking\"). The number of black & white pictures and illustrations was expanded from 661 in the first edition to 1132. The total number of pages is 788. Market prices have been updated to US dollars but are still expressed in \"Stamp Units\" indicating the relative scarcity and value of each stamp. The retail price was $46.50 (US) that included delivery to the US or Canada, and $49.50 (US) for delivery to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese version is renamed Zhongguo you piao tu jian 1878-1949 \"中国邮票图鉴(1878 －1949)\" written in Simplified Chinese. In fact the entire catalogue has been rewritten in Simplified Chinese. The first printing is dated December 1988 and is printed in China by Shanghai Culture Publishing House 上海文化出版社. The book is hard-bound, with gold letters on a green colour cover. It comes with a gold/white colour book jacket and black & gold lettering.\n\nStamp categories covered in this edition include: Qing Dynasty, Republic of China, Air Mail, Postage Due, Military, and stamp booklets.\n\nA table of contents was added, as well as updates of stamp release dates, quantity printed, pictures, places where stamps were first sold, secret markings, etc.\n\nMarket prices have been updated to 1987 values and are expressed in Renminbi for the ease of reference by Chinese Nationals.\n\nDue to Ma's poor health and his desire to personally witness his book's publication, numerous typesetting related errors were only discovered after the catalogue was printed and sold. In total 169 errors were documented by his eldest son, 馬延璋, who published an error reference guide (勘誤表) in October 1989 and originally provided only to members of The New Light Philatelic (新光郵票會會員) as a supplement to the catalogue. This guide is reprinted in the September 2006 Philatelic Publication 集郵文獻擷英 2006年9月出版的彩二期(總第5期). One such error is noted on the book cover and cover jacket where the year of stamp coverage 1897-1949 is misprinted and thus is incorrect. The date \"1897-1949\" only appears on the first edition covers and subsequent editions have this error corrected to read 1878-1949.\n\nThe first printing of 4,000 copies retails for 16.50 Renminbi. The second printing of 10,000 copies is dated April 1989 and retails for 21.50 Renminbi. The third printing of 3,000 copies is dated May 1992 and retails for 21.50 Renminbi. The total number of pages is 490.\n\nThe 1995 edition is edited by Lee H. Hill Jr. and published by Hill-Donnelly Corporation in Tampa, FL, USA. This edition is printed in English text only and covers the earliest, the most valuable, and often most difficult to decipher stamp issues from 1878-1911 with enhanced illustrations, detailed descriptions, and specific identification techniques unique to each stamp issue. A total of 138 digitally scanned images of actual stamps are printed in black & white throughout the 202 pages on 8.5 X 11 papers. The book is soft-bound, with gold letters on a blue cover. The additional title \"Volume 1 - Empire 1878-1911\" is added, as well as an update to the publication date of 1995 on the front cover.\n\nThe 1998 edition is edited by Lee H. Hill Jr. and published by Hill-Donnelly Corporation in Tampa, FL, USA. This version is supplemented from the 1988 edition with additional enhancements and updated to 1998 prices in US dollars. The book is soft-bound, 558 pages, 8.5 X 11 papers, with gold letters on a blue cover.\n\nAfter five years of work in 2009 the third edition was revised and published by Ma You Zhang (馬佑璋, b. Nov. 1939), the son of the late editor Ma Ren-Chuen and the grandson of the original editor Ma Zung-Sung, and the younger brother of 馬延璋 who published the error reference guide for the second edition. The title of the third edition has been updated to 中國郵票圖鑑 1878 －1949 (Zhong guo you piao tu jian) written in Simplified Chinese. The first printing of this edition was December 2009 by 冮苏人民出版社.\n\nBesides the preface and a table of contents presented in English, all other sections of this book are written in Chinese.\n\nThis edition now covers all Chinese stamp issues from the very first Qin Dynasty issue of the \"Customs Post Large Dragon\" to the final Republic of China \"Silver Yuan\" issue in 1949 (up until the founding of the People's Republic of China), as well as Provincial Issues, Special Purpose Issues (Airmail, Postage Due, Military Post, Stamp Booklets), and Occupied Area Issues (British Railway Administration, Japanese Occupation, Shandong and Hbei Overprints, Northern China, Central China, Southern China, and Manchukuo issues).\n\nUpdates are included for any new variation types discovered since the previous edition, including revisions to some historical information of each stamp issue, ways to decipher the different varieties, corrections of some misprints, and revised market prices, which have been updated to 2009 values and are expressed in Renminbi for the ease of reference by Chinese Nationals. Prices for blocks have been removed.\n\nThe original Ma's numbering reference system is unchanged and follows that of the 1988 Chinese edition. Both Custom Post and Republic of China issues are identified by a reference number only. Starting with the Provincial Issues, stamp numbers are preceded by one or two Chinese characters to denote the primary variety, followed by a numeric number. For example, \"華北 1003\" is designated for stamp variety 1003 in the Northern China Issues.\n\nBoth the names of Ma Ren-Chuen (editor) and Ma Zubg-Sung (Supplemented) appear on the cover. The total number of pages is 470. The total number of illustrations is 1135. Paper used is coated paper.\n\nPictures of stamps and related illustrations remain printed in black and white only.\n\nThere is a marked difference in the way some descriptions are written between the first edition and third edition. For example, colours written in the order of the variant colour followed by the base primary colour in the first edition are now written in reversed order: 藍綠與黑 and 紅與黑 (1947) vs. 黑與藍綠 and 黑與紅 (2009).\n\nThere are two versions, a collector edition and a regular hardcover edition.\n\nThis edition is hard-bound. The cover has gold letters on a red cover. Only 100 copies were printed and it is not for sale. This edition is reserved as commemorative gifts from Ma Zubg-Sung, with his autograph and chop stamped on the inside cover. Similar to the first edition, for the purpose of anti-counterfeiting, a small horse emblem (\"馬圖\", pronounced \"Ma\" in Chinese, the editor's last name) is engraved at the centre of the back cover. Each book is printed with a serial number from 1 to 100. \"Collector Edition (珍藏版)\" is noted below the .\n\nThis edition is also hard-bound, but the cover has gold letters written on a green background. Officially there is a horse-emblem engraved on the back cover, however, a sample of an error variety has been found without such a horse emblem. It has the same ISBN as the red cover version, but instead of \"Collector Edition (珍藏版)\" noted below the ISBN, a retail price of 98.00 Renminbi Yuan (精裝) is printed instead.\n\nBelow is a listing of the stamp varieties covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is to track the ownership history of confirmed First Editions. Every piece of evidence (knowledge of particular owners) is treated as a valuable clue for provenance, therefore it can be geographically located and chronologically dated. Explicit ownership notes are further categorized and stored, where known.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5348351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5348351", "title": "Mate (drink)", "text": "Mate (drink)\n\nMate (, ; sometimes spelled maté in English though not in Spanish or Portuguese), also known as chimarrão () or cimarrón (), is a traditional South American caffeine-rich infused drink, that was first consumed by the Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people. In the last centuries, it became particularly popular in Argentina and Uruguay, as also in Paraguay, the Bolivian Chaco, Southern Chile and Southern Brazil. It is also consumed in Syria, the largest importer in the world, and in Lebanon.\n\nIt is prepared by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\", known in Portuguese as \"erva-mate\") in hot water and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd. The straw is called a \"bombilla\" in Spanish, a \"bomba\" in Portuguese, and a \"bombija\" or, more generally, a \"masassa\" (straw) in Arabic. The straw is traditionally made of silver. Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver (called \"alpaca\"), stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane. The gourd is known as a \"mate\" or a \"guampa\"; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of \"cuia\", or also \"cabaça\" (the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food and drink in remote regions). Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos, the infusion is traditionally drunk from \"mates\" or \"cuias\".\n\nThe mate leaves are dried, chopped, and ground into a powdery mixture called \"yerba\", \"erva\" in Portuguese, which means \"herb\". The bombilla functions as both a straw and a sieve. The submerged end is flared, with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture. A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes, or a spring sleeve to act as a sieve.\n\n\"Tea-bag\" type infusions of mate (Spanish: \"mate cocido\", Portuguese: \"chá mate\") have been on the market in many South American countries for many years under such trade names as \"Taragüi\" in Argentina, \"Pajarito\" and \"Kurupí\" in Paraguay, and Matte Leão and \"Mate Real\" in Brazil.\n\nMate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people who lived in that part of southern Brazil and northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is \"Ilex paraguariensis\". The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata and from there to Chile. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef. Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in the Paraguayan department of Misiones, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild strands. After their expulsion in the 1770s, the Jesuit missions — along with the yerba mate plantations — fell into ruins. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically.\n\nBrazil then became the largest producer of mate. In Brazilian and Argentine projects in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the plant was domesticated once again, opening the way for plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention to coffee in the 1930s, Argentina, which had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting the economy of Misiones Province, where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations. For years, the status of largest producer shifted between Brazil and Argentina.\n\nToday, Argentina is the largest producer with 56–62%, followed by Brazil, 34–36%, and Paraguay, 5%. Uruguay is the largest consumer per capita, consuming around 19 liters per year.\n\nBoth the spellings \"mate\" and \"maté\" are used in English. An acute accent is not used in the Spanish spelling, because it would incorrectly indicate that the second syllable is stressed; an accent on the \"e\" sometimes seen in English is used to indicate that the word and its pronunciation are distinct from the English word \"mate\". As the Yerba Mate Association of the Americas points out, with the accent the word \"maté\" in Spanish means \"I killed\".\n\nIn Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as \"chimarrão\", although the word \"mate\" and the expression \"mate amargo\" (bitter mate) are also used in Argentina and Uruguay. The Spanish \"cimarrón\" means \"rough\", \"brute\", or \"barbarian\", but is most widely understood to mean \"feral\", and is used in almost all of Latin America for domesticated animals that have become wild. The word was then used by the people who colonized the region of the Río de la Plata to describe the natives' rough and sour drink, drunk with no other ingredient to soften the taste.\n\nMate has a strong cultural significance both in terms of national identity and well as socially. Mate is the national drink of Argentina; Paraguay, where it is also consumed with either hot or ice cold water (see tereré); and Uruguay. Drinking mate is a common social practice in parts of Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and eastern Bolivia. Throughout the Southern Cone, it is considered to be a tradition taken from the \"gauchos\" or\" vaqueros\", terms commonly used to describe the old residents of the South American \"pampas\", \"chacos\", or Patagonian grasslands, found principally in parts of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southeastern Bolivia, southern Chile and southern Brazil.\n\nParque Histórico do Mate, funded by the state of Paraná (Brazil), is a park aimed to educate people on the sustainable harvesting methods needed to maintain the integrity and vitality of the oldest wild forests of mate in the world.\n\nMate is also consumed as an iced tea in various regions of Brazil, originating both from an industrialized form, produced by Matte Leão, and from artisanal producers. It is part of the beach culture in Rio de Janeiro, where it is widely sold by beach vendors, being the hot infused variation uncommon in the area.\n\nThe preparation of mate is a simple process, consisting of filling a container with yerba, pouring hot, but not boiling, water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the \"bombilla\", which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. The method of preparing the mate infusion varies considerably from region to region, and which method yields the finest outcome is debated. However, nearly all methods have some common elements. The beverage is traditionally prepared in a gourd recipient, also called \"mate\" or \"guampa\" in Spanish and \"cuia\" in Portuguese, from which it is drunk. The gourd is nearly filled with \"yerba\", and hot water, typically at , never boiling, is added. The drink is so popular within countries that consume it, that several national electric kettle manufacters just refer to the range 70 to 85 °C on its thermostat as \"mate\" temperature.\n\nThe most common preparation involves a careful arrangement of the \"yerba\" within the gourd before adding hot water. In this method, the gourd is first filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with \"yerba\". Too much \"yerba\" will result in a \"short\" mate; conversely, too little \"yerba\" results in a \"long\" mate, both being considered undesirable. After that, any additional herbs (\"yuyo\", in Portuguese \"jujo\") may be added for either health or flavor benefits, a practice most common in Paraguay, where people acquire herbs from a local \"yuyera\" (herbalist) and use the mate as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is adequately filled, the preparer typically grasps it with the full hand, covering and roughly sealing the opening with the palm. Then the mate is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position. This causes the finest, most powdery particles of the \"yerba\" to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.\n\nOnce the \"yerba mate\" has settled, the mate is carefully brought to a near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the \"yerba mate\" inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the \"yerba\" is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of \"yerba\" on the other.\n\nAfter arranging the \"yerba\" along one side of the gourd, the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the \"yerba\" as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of \"yerba\" should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the \"yerba\" (though at least a portion should remain in place).\n\nAll of this careful settling of the \"yerba\" ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the straw. With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the straw, but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the mate.\n\nNow the mate is ready to receive the straw. Wetting the \"yerba\" by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top, and then allowing it to be absorbed into the \"yerba\" before adding the straw, allows the preparer to carefully shape and \"pack\" the \"yerba\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slope with the straw's filtering end, which makes the overall form of the \"yerba\" within the gourd more resilient and solid. Dry \"yerba\", though, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the straw, but care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the \"yerba\". Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The straw is inserted with one's thumb on the upper end of the gourd, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the \"yerba\", so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the \"yerba\" and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd. It is important for the thumb to form a seal over the end of the straw when it is being inserted, or the negative pressure produced will draw in undesirable particulates.\n\nAfter the above process, the \"yerba\" may be brewed. If the straw is inserted into dry \"yerba\", the mate must first be filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than two or three minutes). Treating the \"yerba\" with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the \"yerba mate\" from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the \"yerba\", until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the \"yerba\" is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the \"yerba\" beside the edge of the gourd's opening.\n\nOnce the hot water has been added, the mate is ready for drinking, and it may be refilled many times before becoming \"lavado\" (washed out) and losing its flavor. When this occurs, the mound of \"yerba\" can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives the mate for additional refillings and is called \"reformar o/el mate\" (reforming the mate).\n\nMate is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. The same gourd (\"cuia\") and straw (\"bomba/bombilla\") are used by everyone drinking. One person (known in Portuguese as the \"preparador\", \"cevador\", or \"patrão\", and in Spanish as the \"cebador\") assumes the task of server. Typically, the \"cebador\" fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality. In some places, passing the first brew of mate to another drinker is considered bad manners, as it may be too cold or too strong; for this reason, the first brew is often called \"mate del zonzo\" (\"mate\" of the fool). The \"cebador\" possibly drinks the second filling, as well, if he or she deems it too cold or bitter. The \"cebador\" subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the drinker to his or her right, who likewise drinks it all (there is not much; the mate is full of yerba, with room for little water), and returns it without thanking the server; a final \"gracias\" (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. The only exception to this order is if a new guest joins the group; in this case the new arrival receives the next mate, and then the cebador resumes the order of serving, and the new arrival will receive his or hers depending on his placement in the group. When no more tea remains, the straw makes a loud sucking noise, which is not considered rude. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this way until the mate becomes \"lavado\" (washed out), typically after the gourd has been filled about 10 times or more depending on the \"yerba\" used (well-aged \"yerba mate\" is typically more potent, so provides a greater number of refills) and the ability of the \"cebador\". When one has had one's fill of mate, he or she politely thanks the \"cebador\", passing the mate back at the same time. It is impolite for anyone but the cebador to move the bombilla or otherwise mess with the mate; the cebador may take exception to this and not offer it to the offender again. When someone takes too long, others in the round (\"roda\" in Portuguse, \"ronda\" in Spanish) will likely politely warn him or her by saying \"bring the talking gourd\" (\"cuia de conversar\"); an Argentine equivalent, especially among young people, being \"no es un micrófono\" (\"it's not a microphone\"), an allusion to the drinkers holding the mate for too long, as if they were using it as a microphone to deliver a lecture.\n\nSome drinkers like to add sugar or honey, creating \"mate dulce\" or \"mate doce\" (sweet mate), instead of sugarless \"mate amargo\" (bitter mate), a practice said to be more common in Brazil outside its southernmost state. Some people also like to add lemon or orange peel, some herbs or even coffee, but these are mostly rejected by people who like to stick to the \"original\" mate.\nTraditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes, and gourd-shaped \"mates\", made of ceramic or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. The gourd is traditionally made out of the porongo or cabaça fruit shell. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs. Some gourd mates with elaborated silver ornaments and silver bombillas are true pieces of jewelry and very sought after by collectors.\n\nA review of a number of population studies in 2009 revealed evidence of an association between esophageal cancer and hot mate drinking, but these population studies may not be conclusive. Some research has suggested the correlation with esophageal cancer results almost entirely from damage caused to the esophagus by burns from the hot liquid as opposed to damage caused by chemicals in the mate; similar links to cancer have been found for tea and other beverages generally consumed at high temperatures. While drinking mate at very high temperatures is considered as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" on the IARC Group 2A carcinogens list, mate itself is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.\n\nResearchers from NCI (National Cancer Institutes) and Brazil found both cold- and hot-water extractions of popular commercial yerba mate products contained high levels (8.03 to 53.3 ng/g dry leaves) of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (i.e. benzo[a]pyrene). However, these potential carcinogenic compounds originated from the commercial drying process of the mate leaves, which involves smoke from the burning of wood, much like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in wood-smoked meat. \"Unsmoked\" or steamed varieties of yerba mate tea are also available.\n\nMate contains B and C vitamins, polyphenol antioxidants, and has a slightly higher antioxidant capacity than green tea. On average, mate tea contains 92 mg of the antioxidant chlorogenic acid per gram of dry leaves, and no catechins, giving it a significantly different antioxidant profile from other teas.\n\nThe Guaraní people started drinking mate in a region that currently includes Paraguay, southern Brazil, southeastern Bolivia, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. The Guaraní have a legend that says the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it, but they instead found a \"yaguareté\" (jaguar) that was going to attack them. An old man saved them, and, in compensation, the goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant, from which he could prepare a \"drink of friendship\".\n\nAnother drink can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves, very cold water, and, optionally, lemon or another fruit juice, called \"tereré\". It is very common in Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. After pouring the water, it is considered proper to \"wait while the saint has a sip\" before the first person takes a drink. In southern Brazil, \"tererê\" is sometimes used as a derogatory term for a not hot enough \"chimarrão\".\n\nIn Uruguay and Brazil, the traditional gourd is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Argentina (especially in the capital Buenos Aires), the gourd is small and has a small hole and people sometimes add sugar for flavor.\n\nIn Uruguay, people commonly walk around the streets toting a mate and a thermos with hot water. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by \"yerba mate\" producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.\n\nIn Argentina, \"mate cocido\" (boiled mate), in Brazil, \"chá mate\", is made with a teabag or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug, with or without sugar and milk. Companies such as Cabrales from Mar del Plata and Establecimiento Las Marías produce teabags for export to Europe.\n\nTravel narratives, such as Maria Graham's \"Journal of a Residence in Chile\", show a long history of mate drinking in central Chile. Many rural Chileans drink mate, in particular in the southern regions, particularly Magallanes, Aysén and Chiloé.\n\nIn some parts of Syria, Lebanon and other Eastern Mediterranean countries, drinking mate is common. The custom came from Syrians and Lebanese who moved to South America during the late 19th and early parts of the 20th century, adopted the tradition, and kept it after returning to Western Asia. Syria is the biggest importer of yerba mate in the world, importing 15,000 tons a year. Mostly, the Druze communities in Syria and Lebanon maintain the culture and practice of mate.\n\nAccording to a major retailer of mate in San Luis Obispo, California, by 2004, mate had grown to about 5% of the overall natural tea market in North America. Loose mate is commercially available in much of North America. Bottled mate is increasingly available in the United States. Canadian bottlers have introduced a cane sugar-sweetened, carbonated variety, similar to soda pop. One brand, Sol Mate, produces 10-ounce glass bottles available at Canadian and U.S. retailers, making use of the translingual pun (English 'soul mate'; Spanish/Portuguese 'sun mate') for the sake of marketing.\n\n"}

{"id": "1367908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1367908", "title": "Morphometrics", "text": "Morphometrics\n\nMorphometrics (from Greek μορϕή \"morphe\", \"shape, form\", and -μετρία \"metria\", \"measurement\") or morphometry refers to the quantitative analysis of form, a concept that encompasses size and shape. Morphometric analyses are commonly performed on organisms, and are useful in analyzing their fossil record, the impact of mutations on shape, developmental changes in form, covariances between ecological factors and shape, as well for estimating quantitative-genetic parameters of shape. Morphometrics can be used to quantify a trait of evolutionary significance, and by detecting changes in the shape, deduce something of their ontogeny, function or evolutionary relationships. A major objective of morphometrics is to statistically test hypotheses about the factors that affect shape.\n\n\"Morphometrics\", in the broader sense, is also used to precisely locate certain areas of organs such as the brain, and in describing the shapes of other things.\n\nThree general approaches to form are usually distinguished: traditional morphometrics, landmark-based morphometrics and outline-based morphometrics.\n\nTraditional morphometrics analyzes lengths, widths, masses, angles, ratios and areas. In general, traditional morphometric data are measurements of size. A drawback of using many measurements of size is that most will be highly correlated; as a result, there are few independent variables despite the many measurements. For instance, tibia length will vary with femur length and also with humerus and ulna length and even with measurements of the head. Traditional morphometric data are nonetheless useful when either absolute or relative sizes are of particular interest, such as in studies of growth. These data are also useful when size measurements are of theoretical importance such as body mass and limb cross-sectional area and length in studies of functional morphology. However, these measurements have one important limitation: they contain little information about the spatial distribution of shape changes across the organism. They are also useful when determining the extent to which certain pollutants have affected an individual. these indices include the hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and also the condition factors (shakumbila, 2014).\n\nIn landmark-based geometric morphometrics, the spatial information missing from traditional morphometrics is contained in the data, because the data are coordinates of landmarks: discrete anatomical loci that are arguably \"homologous\" in all individuals in the analysis (i.e. they can be regarded as the \"same\" point in each specimens in the study). For example, where two specific sutures intersect is a landmark, as are intersections between veins on an insect wing or leaf, or foramina, small holes through which veins and blood vessels pass. Landmark-based studies have traditionally analyzed 2D data, but with the increasing availability of 3D imaging techniques, 3D analyses are becoming more feasible even for small structures such as teeth. Finding enough landmarks to provide a comprehensive description of shape can be difficult when working with fossils or easily damaged specimens. That is because all landmarks must be present in all specimens, although coordinates of missing landmarks can be estimated. The data for each individual consists of a \"configuration\" of landmarks.\n\nThere are three recognized categories of landmarks. \"Type 1 landmarks\" are defined locally, i.e. in terms of structures close to that point; for example, an intersection between three sutures, or intersections between veins on an insect wing are locally defined and surrounded by tissue on all sides. \"Type 3 landmarks\", in contrast, are defined in terms of points far away from the landmark, and are often defined in terms of a point \"furthest away\" from another point. \"Type 2 landmarks\" are intermediate; this category includes points such as the tip structure, or local minima and maxima of curvature. They are defined in terms of local features, but they are not surrounded on all sides. In addition to landmarks, there are \"semilandmarks\", points whose position along a curve is arbitrary but which provide information about curvature in two or three dimensions.\n\nShape analysis begins by removing the information that is not about shape. By definition, shape is not altered by translation, scaling or rotation. Thus, to compare shapes, the non-shape information is removed from the coordinates of landmarks. There is more than one way to do these three operations. One method is to fix the coordinates of two points to (0,0) and (0,1), which are the two ends of a baseline. In one step, the shapes are translated to the same position (the same two coordinates are fixed to those values), the shapes are scaled (to unit baseline length) and the shapes are rotated. An alternative, and preferred method, is Procrustes superimposition. This method translates the centroid of the shapes to (0,0); the \"x\" coordinate of the centroid is the average of the \"x\" coordinates of the landmarks, and the \"y\" coordinate of the centroid is the average of the \"y\"-coordinates. Shapes are scaled to unit centroid size, which is the square root of the summed squared distances of each landmark to the centroid. The configuration is rotated to minimize the deviation between it and a reference, typically the mean shape. In the case of semi-landmarks, variation in position along the curve is also removed. Because shape space is curved, analyses are done by projecting shapes onto a space tangent to shape space. Within the tangent space, conventional multivariate statistical methods such as multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate regression, can be used to test statistical hypotheses about shape.\n\nProcrustes-based analyses have some limitations. One is that the Procrustes superimposition uses a least-squares criterion to find the optimal rotation; consequently, variation that is localized to a single landmark will be smeared out across many. This is called the 'Pinocchio Effect.' Another is that the superimposition may itself impose a pattern of covariation on the landmarks. Additionally, any information that cannot be captured by landmarks and semilandmarks cannot be analyzed, including classical measurements like \"greatest skull breadth.\" Moreover, there are criticisms of Procrustes-based methods that motivate an alternative approach to analyzing landmark data.\n\nDiffeomorphometry is the focus on comparison of shapes and forms with a metric structure based on diffeomorphisms, and is central to the field of computational anatomy. Diffeomorphic registration, introduced in the 90's, is now an important player with existing codes bases organized around ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, StationaryLDDMM are examples of actively used computational codes for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on sparse features and dense images. Voxel-based morphometry(VBM) is an important technology built on many of these principles.Methods based on diffeomorphic flows are used in For example, deformations could be diffeomorphisms of the ambient space, resulting in the LDDMM (Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping) framework for shape comparison. On such deformations is the right invariant metric of Computational Anatomy which generalizes the metric of non-compressible Eulerian flows but to include the Sobolev norm ensuring smoothness of the flows, metrics have now been defined associated to Hamiltonian controls of diffeomorphic flows.\n\nOutline analysis is another approach to analyzing shape. What distinguishes outline analysis is that coefficients of mathematical functions are fitted to points sampled along the outline. There are a number of ways of quantifying an outline. Older techniques such as the \"fit to a polynomial curve\"\nand Principal components quantitative analysis have been superseded by the two main modern approaches: eigenshape analysis, and elliptical fourier analysis (EFA), using hand- or computer-traced outlines. The former involves fitting a preset number of semilandmarks at equal intervals around the outline of a shape, recording the deviation of each step from semilandmark to semilandmark from what the angle of that step would be were the object a simple circle. The latter defines the outline as the sum of the minimum number of ellipses required to mimic the shape.\n\nBoth methods have their weaknesses; the most dangerous (and easily overcome) is their susceptibility to noise in the outline. Likewise, neither compares homologous points, and global change is always given more weight than local variation (which may have large biological consequences).\nEigenshape analysis requires an equivalent starting point to be set for each specimen, which can be a source of error\nEFA also suffers from redundancy in that not all variables are independent. On the other hand, it is possible to apply them to complex curves without having to define a centroid; this makes removing the effect of location, size and rotation much simpler.\nThe perceived failings of outline morphometrics are that it doesn't compare points of a homologous origin, and that it oversimplifies complex shapes by restricting itself to considering the outline and not internal changes. Also, since it works by approximating the outline by a series of ellipses, it deals poorly with pointed shapes.\n\nOne criticism of outline-based methods is that they disregard homology – a famous example of this disregard being the ability of outline-based methods to compare a scapula to a potato chip. Such a comparison which would not be possible if the data were restricted to biologically homologous points. An argument against that critique is that, if landmark approaches to morphometrics can be used to test biological hypotheses in the absence of homology data, it is inappropriate to fault outline-based approaches for enabling the same types of studies \n\nMultivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects. To visualize the patterns of variation in the data, the data need to be reduced to a comprehensible (low-dimensional) form. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly employed tool to do summarize the variation. Simply put, the technique projects as much of the overall variation as possible into a few dimensions. See the figure at the right for an example. Each axis on a PCA plot is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix of shape variables. The first axis accounts for maximum variation in the sample, with further axes representing further ways in which the samples vary. The pattern of clustering of samples in this morphospace represents similarities and differences in shapes, which can reflect phylogenetic relationships. As well as exploring patterns of variation, Multivariate statistical methods can be used to test statistical hypotheses about factors that affect shape and to visualize their effects, although PCA is not needed for this purpose unless the method requires inverting the variance-covariance matrix.\n\nLandmark data allow the difference between population means, or the deviation an individual from its population mean, to be visualized in at least two ways. One depicts vectors at landmarks that show the magnitude and direction in which that landmark is displaced relative to the others. The second depicts the difference via the thin plate splines, an interpolation function that models change \"between\" landmarks from the data of changes in coordinates \"of\" landmarks. This function produces what look like deformed grids; where regions that relatively elongated, the grid will look stretched and where those regions are relatively shortened, the grid will look compressed.\n\nD'Arcy Thompson in 1917 suggested that shapes in many different species could also be related in this way. In the case of shells and horns he gave a fairly precise analysis… But he also drew various pictures of fishes and skulls, and argued that they were related by deformations of coordinates.\n\nShape analysis is widely used in ecology and evolutionary biology to study plasticity, evolutionary changes in shape and in evolutionary developmental biology to study the evolution of the ontogeny of shape, as well as the developmental origins of developmental stability, canalization and modularity. Many other applications of shape analysis in ecology and evolutionary biology can be found in the introductory text: \n\nIn neuroimaging, the most common variants are voxel-based morphometry, deformation-based morphometry and surface-based morphometry of the brain.\nHistomorphometry of bone involves obtaining a bone biopsy specimen and processing of bone specimens in the laboratory, obtaining estimates of the proportional volumes and surfaces occupied by different components of bone. First the bone is broken down by baths in highly concentrated ethanol and acetone. The bone is then embedded and stained so that it can be visualized/analyzed under a microscope. Obtaining a bone biopsy is accomplished by using a bone biopsy trephine.\n\nThe application of morphometrics is not restricted to biological uses. It can also be applied to terrain in the form of geomorphometrics. It also has a host of other applications.\n\n\n from Greek: \"morph,\" meaning shape or form, and \"metron”, measurement\n\n\n"}
{"id": "83430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83430", "title": "Mother", "text": "Mother\n\nA mother is the female parent of a child. Mothers are women who inhabit or perform the role of bearing some relation to their children, who may or may not be their biological offspring. Thus, dependent on the context, women can be considered mothers by virtue of having given birth, by raising their child(ren), supplying their ovum for fertilisation, or some combination thereof. Such conditions provide a way of delineating the concept of motherhood, or the state of being a mother. Women who meet the third and first categories usually fall under the terms 'birth mother' or 'biological mother', regardless of whether the individual in question goes on to parent their child. Accordingly, a woman who meets only the second condition may be considered an adoptive mother, and those who meet only the third a surrogacy mother.\n\nThe above concepts defining the role of mother are neither exhaustive nor universal, as any definition of 'mother' may vary based on how social, cultural, and religious roles are defined. The parallel conditions and terms for males: those who are (typically biologically) fathers do not, by definition, take up the role of fatherhood. Mother and fatherhood are not limited to those who are or have parented. Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers or mothers-to-be, though such applications tend to be less readily applied to (biological) fathers or adoptive parents. The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as \"matrescence\".\n\nBiological motherhood for humans, as in other mammals, occurs when a pregnant female gestates a fertilized ovum (the \"egg\"). A female can become pregnant through sexual intercourse after she has begun to ovulate. In well-nourished girls, menarche (the first menstrual period) usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.\n\nTypically, a fetus develops from the viable zygote, resulting in an embryo. Gestation occurs in the woman's uterus until the fetus (assuming it is carried to term) is sufficiently developed to be born. In humans, gestation is often around 9 months in duration, after which the woman experiences labor and gives birth. This is not always the case, however, as some babies are born prematurely, late, or in the case of stillbirth, do not survive gestation. Usually, once the baby is born, the mother produces milk via the lactation process. The mother's breast milk is the source of antibodies for the infant's immune system, and commonly the sole source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be breastfed, in combination with other foods, which should be introduced from approximately six months of age.\n\nChildlessness is the state of not having children. Childlessness may have personal, social or political significance. Childlessness may be voluntary childlessness, which occurs by choice, or may be involuntary due to health problems or social circumstances. Motherhood is usually voluntary, but may also be the result of forced pregnancy, such as pregnancy from rape. Unwanted motherhood occurs especially in cultures which practice forced marriage and child marriage.\n\n\"Mother\" can often apply to a woman other than the biological parent, especially if she fulfills the main social role in raising the child. This is commonly either an adoptive mother or a stepmother (the biologically unrelated partner of a child's father). The term \"othermother\" or \"other mother\" is also used in some contexts for women who provide care for a child not biologically their own in addition to the child's primary mother.\n\nAdoption, in various forms, has been practiced throughout history, even predating human civilization. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be governed by comprehensive statutes and regulations. In recent decades, international adoptions have become more and more common.\n\nAdoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a legal point of view (compared to other Western countries). In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the US accounted for nearly half of the total number of adoptions worldwide.\n\nA surrogate mother is a woman who bears a child that came from another woman's fertilized ovum on behalf of a couple unable to give birth to children. Thus the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that she is not the biological mother of. Surrogate motherhood became possible with advances in reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\nNot all women who become pregnant via in vitro fertilization are surrogate mothers. Surrogacy involves both a genetic mother, who provides the ovum, and a gestational (or surrogate) mother, who carries the child to term.\n\nThe possibility for lesbian and bisexual women in same-sex relationships (or women without a partner) to become mothers has increased over the past few decades due to technological developments. Modern lesbian parenting (a term that somewhat erases the bisexual case) originated with women who were in heterosexual relationships who later identified as lesbian or bisexual, as changing attitudes provided more acceptance for non-heterosexual relationships. Another way for such women to become mothers is through adopting or foster parenting. There is also the option of self-insemination and clinically assisted donor insemination, forms of artificial insemination. As fertility technology has advanced, more females not in a heterosexual relationship have become mothers through in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe social roles associated with motherhood are variable across time, culture, and social class.\nRegarding women in the workforce, mothers often entail a mommy track rather than being entirely \"career women\". Mothers may be stay at home mothers or working mothers. In recent decades there has been an increase in stay at home fathers too. Social views on these arrangements vary significantly by culture: in Europe for instance, in German-speaking countries there is a strong tradition of mothers exiting the workforce and being homemakers. Mothers have historically fulfilled the primary role in raising children, but since the late 20th century, the role of the father in child care has been given greater prominence and social acceptance in some Western countries. The 20th century also saw more and more women entering paid work. Mothers' rights within the workforce include maternity leave and parental leave.\n\nThe social role and experience of motherhood varies greatly depending upon location. Mothers are more likely than fathers to encourage assimilative and communion-enhancing patterns in their children. Mothers are more likely than fathers to acknowledge their children's contributions in conversation. The way mothers speak to their children (\"motherese\") is better suited to support very young children in their efforts to understand speech (in context of the reference English) than fathers.\n\nSince the 1970s, in vitro fertilization has made pregnancy possible at ages well beyond \"natural\" limits, generating ethical controversy and forcing significant changes in the social meaning of motherhood. This is, however, a position highly biased by Western world locality: outside the Western world, in-vitro fertilization has far less prominence, importance or currency compared to primary, basic healthcare, women's basic health, reducing infant mortality and the prevention of life-threatening diseases such as polio, typhus and malaria.\n\nTraditionally, and still in most parts of the world today, a mother was expected to be a married woman, with birth outside of marriage carrying a strong social stigma. Historically, this stigma not only applied to the mother, but also to her child. This continues to be the case in many parts of the developing world today, but in many Western countries the situation has changed radically, with single motherhood being much more socially acceptable now. For more details on these subjects, see Legitimacy (family law) and single parent.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR), that is, the number of children born per woman, differs greatly from country to country. The TFR in 2013 was estimated to be highest in Niger (7.03 children born per woman) and lowest in Singapore (0.79 children/woman).\n\nIn the United States, the TFR was estimated for 2013 at 2.06 births per woman. In 2011, the average age at first birth was 25.6 and 40.7% of births were to unmarried women.\n\nA \"maternal death\" is defined by WHO as \"the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes\".\n\nAbout 56% of maternal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and another 29% in South Asia.\n\nIn 2006, the organization Save the Children has ranked the countries of the world, and found that Scandinavian countries are the safest places to give birth, whereas countries in sub-Saharan Africa are the least safe to give birth. This study argues a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is over 750 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth, compared to a mother in the top ten ranked countries, and a mother in the bottom ten ranked countries is 28 times more likely to see her child die before reaching their first birthday.\n\nThe most recent data suggests that Italy, Sweden and Luxembourg are the safest countries in terms of maternal death and Afghanistan, Central African Republic and Malawi are the most dangerous.\n\nChildbirth is an inherently dangerous and risky procedure, subject to many complications. The \"natural\" mortality rate of childbirth—where nothing is done to avert maternal death—has been estimated as being 1500 deaths per 100,000 births. Modern medicine has greatly alleviated the risk of childbirth. In modern Western countries the current maternal mortality rate is around 10 deaths per 100,000 births.\n\nNearly all world religions define tasks or roles for mothers through either religious law or through the glorification of mothers who served in substantial religious events. There are many examples of religious law relating to mothers and women.\n\nMajor world religions which have specific religious law or scriptural canon regarding mothers include: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Some examples of honoring motherhood include the Madonna or \"Blessed Virgin Mother Mary\" for Catholics, and the multiple positive references to active womanhood as a mother in the Book of Proverbs.\n\nHindu's Mother Goddess and Demeter of ancient Greek pre-Christian belief are also mothers.\n\nHistory records many conflicts between mothers and their children. Some even resulted in murder, such as the conflict between Cleopatra III of Egypt and her son Ptolemy X.\n\nIn modern cultures, matricide (the killing of one's mother) and filicide (the killing of one's son or daughter) have been studied but remain poorly understood. Psychosis and schizophrenia are common causes of both, and young, indigent mothers with a history of domestic abuse are slightly more likely to commit filicide. Mothers are more likely to commit filicide than fathers when the child is 8 years old or younger. Matricide is most frequently committed by adult sons.\n\nIn the United States in 2012, there were 130 matricides (0.4 per million people) and 383 filicides (1.2 per million), or 1.4 incidents per day.\n\nThroughout history mothers with their children have often been the subject of artistic works, such as paintings, sculptures or writings.\n\nFourth century grave reliefs on the island of Rhodes depicted mothers with children.\n\nPaintings of mothers with their children have a long tradition in France. In the 18th century, these works embodied the Enlightenment's preoccupation with strong family bonds and the relation between mothers and children.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Mary Cassatt was a painter well known for her portraits of mothers.\n\nMany contemporary movies portray mothers.\n\nThe proverbial \"first word\" of an infant often sounds like \"ma\" or \"mama\". This strong association of that sound with \"mother\" has persisted in nearly every language on earth, countering the natural localization of language.\n\nFamiliar or colloquial terms for \"mother\" in English are:\n\nIn many other languages, similar pronunciations apply:\n\nThe modern English word is from Middle English moder, from Old English mōdor, from Proto-Germanic *mōdēr (cf. East Frisian muur, Dutch moeder, German Mutter), from Proto-Indo-European *méh₂tēr (cf. Irish máthair, Tocharian A mācar, B mācer, Lithuanian mótė). Other cognates include Latin māter, Greek μήτηρ, Common Slavic *mati (thence Russian мать (mat’)), Persian مادر (madar), and Sanskrit मातृ (mātṛ).\n\n\n"}

It may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths, called a \"leaflet\", or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and saddle stapled at the crease to make a simple book.\n\nFor the \"International Standardization of Statistics Relating to Book Production and Periodicals\", UNESCO defines a pamphlet as \"a non-periodical printed publication of at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in a particular country and made available to the public\" and a book as \"a non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages\". The UNESCO definitions are, however, only meant to be used for the particular purpose of drawing up their book production statistics.\n\nThe word \"pamphlet\" for a small work (\"opuscule\") issued by itself without covers came into Middle English ca 1387 as \"pamphilet\" or \"panflet\", generalized from a twelfth-century amatory comic poem with an old flavor, \"Pamphilus, seu de Amore\" (\"Pamphilus: or, Concerning Love\"), written in Latin. Pamphilus's name is derived from the Greek name , meaning \"beloved of all\". The poem was popular and widely copied and circulated on its own, forming a slim codex.\n\nIts modern connotations of a tract concerning a contemporary issue was a product of the heated arguments leading to the English Civil War; this sense appeared in 1642. In some European languages other than English, this secondary connotation, of a disputatious tract, has come to the fore: compare \"libelle\", from the Latin \"libellus\", denoting a \"little book\".\n\nPamphlets can contain anything from information on kitchen appliances to medical information and religious treatises. Pamphlets are very important in marketing because they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers. Pamphlets have also long been an important tool of political protest and political campaigning for similar reasons.\n\nA pamphleteer is a historical term for someone who produces or distributes pamphlets, especially for a political cause.\n\nEphemeral and to wide array of political or religious perspectives given voice by the format's ease of production, pamphlets are prized by many book collectors. Substantial accumulations have been amassed and transferred to ownership of academic research libraries around the world.\n\nParticularly comprehensive collections of American political pamphlets are housed at New York Public Library, the Tamiment Library of New York University, and the Jo Labadie collection at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe pamphlet has been widely adopted in commerce, particularly as a format for marketing communications. There are numerous purposes for pamphlets, such as product descriptions or instructions, corporate information, events promotions or tourism guides and they are often used in the same way as leaflets or brochures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "743870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743870", "title": "Peterborough Chronicle", "text": "Peterborough Chronicle\n\nThe Peterborough Chronicle (also called the Laud manuscript and the E manuscript), one of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicles\", contains unique information about the history of England after the Norman Conquest. According to philologist J.A.W. Bennett, it is the only prose history in English between the Conquest and the later 14th century.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicles\" were composed and maintained between the various monasteries of Anglo-Saxon England and were an attempt to record the history of Britain throughout the years AD. Typically the chronicles began with the birth of Christ, went through Biblical and Roman history, then continued to the present. Every major religious house in England kept its own, individual chronicle, and the chronicles were not compared with each other or in any way kept uniform. For example, in the opening paragraph of this chronicle it is said that the Britons that settled in South Britain came from \"Armenia\". (\"Armenia\" is probably a mistaken transcription of Armorica, an area in Northwestern Gaul.)\n\nWhen William the Conqueror took England and Anglo-Norman became the official language, the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicles\" generally ceased. The monks of Peterborough Abbey, however, continued to compile events in theirs. While the \"Peterborough Chronicle\" is not professional history, and one still needs Latin histories (e.g. William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta Regum Anglorum\"), it is one of the few surviving first-hand accounts from the period 1070 to 1154 in England written in English and from a non-courtly point of view.\n\nIt is also a valuable source of information about the early Middle English language itself. The first continuation, for example, is written in late Old English, but the second continuation begins to show mixed forms, until the conclusion of the second continuation, which switches into an early form of distinctly Middle English. The linguistic novelties recorded in the second continuation are plentiful, including at least one true innovation: the feminine pronoun \"she\" (as \"scæ\") is first recorded in the \"Peterborough Chronicle\" ().\n\nThe chronicle from the original copied text through the continuations shows the history of the loss of grammatical gender in West Saxon English, going from the copied portion which while mostly conforming to Old English grammatical gender does have some discrepancies, through the first continuation in which modifiers are re-adapted to other functions and there is a large discrepancy with Old English grammatical gender, to the second continuation in which grammatical gender is completely lost or nearly so.\n\nToday, the \"Peterborough Chronicle\" is recognised as one of the four distinct versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (along with the \"Winchester Chronicle\" or \"Parker Chronicle\", the \"Abingdon Chronicle\" and the \"Worcester Chronicle\"), but it is not wholly distinct (). There was a fire at Peterborough (Friday, 4 August 1116) that destroyed the monastery's library, and so the earliest part of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" at Peterborough is a copy of Winchester Cathedral's chronicle (). For the 11th century, the chronicle at Peterborough diverges from Parker's, and it has been speculated that a proto-\"Kentish Chronicle\", full of nationalistic and regionalistic interests, was used for these years; however, such a single source is speculative (). The Peterborough copyists probably used multiple sources for their missing years, but the Dissolution of the Monasteries makes it impossible to be sure. Regardless, the entries for the 12th century to 1122 are a jumble of other chronicles' accounts, sharing half-entries with one source and half with another, moving from one source to another and then back to a previous one. This shifting back and forth raises, again, the vexatious possibility of a lost chronicle as a single, common source.\n\nIt is after 1122 that the Peterborough manuscript becomes unique. Therefore, the document usually called \"The Peterborough Chronicle\" is divided into the \"\"first continuation\" and the \"second continuation\"\" from the time of the fire and the copying. The two continuations are \"sui generis\" both in terms of the information they impart, the style they employ, and their language. The first continuation covers 1122–1131. The second continuation runs from 1132–1154 and includes the reign of King Stephen.\n\nThe copied portion uses grammatical gender and inflections like in Old English, but there are discrepancies.\n\nAlthough the second continuation holds the most importance, the first continuation has unique records of events in the Peterborough area and provides an insight into ordinary people's lives. The first continuation records the Conquest, the incursion of Sweyn of Denmark, and rumours of other turbulence about the throne. However, it has no evidence at all for Saxon opposition and rebellion against William and his sons. An arguably eyewitness account describes the burning of Peterborough Abbey itself, due to the drunkenness of the monks. It also covers ecclesiastical scandals, such as the Abbot of Glastonbury bringing in mercenaries to control his religious house. Further, there is a significant change in language from the previous late Old English that begins with the entry for the years 1122–1131, with mixtures of Old English and Middle English vocabulary (and increasing Gallic formations) and syntax (a simplification of the pronouns and strong verbs, as well as a decrease in the declensions of the nouns).\n\nBoth the first and second continuation authors have sympathy for the common man. As Bennett suggests, Peterborough is the one source for compassion of the laity found in contemporary accounts. The first continuation expresses as much outrage at the hanging of forty-four thieves in 1122, some of whom were innocent, as at the burning of the monastery at Gloucester. The monastic author suggests that taxes were too high, putting the impoverished villagers in a dilemma of stealing or starving. Therefore, the nobles were guilty of a double sin. First, they executed the innocent and used excessive cruelty with the guilty. Second, it was at least as sinful for the nobles to compel theft with their avarice as for the poor to steal for bread. When the Norman king, Henry I of England foisted his kinsman upon Peterborough as abbot (he was already abbot of Saint-Jean d'Angély), the chronicler protests at some length at the illegality and impiety of the appointment. He also mentions that the Wild Hunt was seen at the same time as the appointment, as an ill omen. When Henry was eventually removed by death, the monk again takes the position that this was divine remedy, for Henry had tried to make Peterborough part of the Cluniac Order and had attempted to have his own nephew be the next abbot, \"oc Crist it ne uuolde\" (\"but Christ did not will it\").\n\nThe first continuation shows a major change in grammatical gender and inflections from how they were used in Old English. Though there are still 3 genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter, several nouns seem to have been shuffled among the categories in a manner that can't be completely explained by a move towards natural gender or the gender of French nouns, as the inflections marking gender are re-purposed for other functions.\n\nThe second, or final, continuation is remarkable for being in one authorial voice, and it relates the events of The Anarchy in England. Scholars speculate that the second continuation is dictated (because the language may reflect a version of early Middle English that scholars place later than Stephen and Matilda) or written as the recollections of a single elderly monk. It is a highly moving account of torture, fear, confusion, and starvation.\n\nHenry I died in 1135, and Stephen and Matilda both had a claim to the throne. The monastic author describes the rebellion of the barons against Stephen, the escape of Matilda, and the tortures that the soldiers of the baronial powers inflicted upon the people. The author blames Stephen for the Anarchy for being \"soft and good\" when firmness and harshness were needed. When Stephen captured the rebelling barons, he let them go if they swore allegiance. According to the author,\n\nThe barons then attempted to raise money as quickly as they could. They needed money and manpower to build castles (which the author regards as novel and rare), and so they robbed everyone they met:\n\nThe monastic author sympathises with the average farmer and artisan and talks about the devastation suffered by the countryside. He is outraged by the accounts of torture he relates and laments,\n\nDeath and famine followed, as the farms were depleted and farmers murdered. If two or three riders came to a village, the monk said, everyone fled, for fear that they were robbers. Trade therefore came to a standstill, and those in want had no way to get supplies. Those travelling with money to purchase food would be robbed or killed along the way. The barons said that there was no God. The chronicler records that people said openly that Christ slept, along with His saints; he states that \"this — and more than we can say — we suffered 19 winters for our sins.\"\n\nAfter the account of The Anarchy, the chronicler goes on to church matters. He speaks of the abbot Martin, who replaced the illegitimate Henry, as a good abbot. Martin had a new roof put on the monastery and moved the monks into a new building. He also, according to the author, recovered certain monastic lands that had been previously held \"by force\" by noblemen. Which lands these are is unclear, but they had probably been claimed by the nobles through the practice of placing younger sons in monasteries, making and revoking gifts of land, and by some early form of chantry. The \"Chronicle\" ends with a new abbot entering upon the death of Martin, an abbot named William. This abbot presumably halted the writing of the \"Chronicle\".\n\nGrammatical gender is almost completely gone, though Jones notes some authors consider the word \"that\" to still function as a neuter definite article here.\n\nThe two Peterborough continuations sympathise with the poor, and this makes them almost unique in Latin or English history. They also focus more on life outside of the abbey than other \"Chronicles\". The general \"Chronicle\" is somewhat insular. While most versions note the national events, such as a progress of the king or a change in sovereign, discussion of the countryside around the monastery is limited. Portents and omens receive coverage, but rarely do the chroniclers discuss political alliances (as the author of the second continuation does with his denunciation of the bishops who were allied with Matilda) or the legalities of monastic rule (as the author of the first continuation does in his lament over Abbot Henry). The monks who compiled the continuation at Peterborough were either consciously striking out in a new direction (perhaps under the direction of Abbot Martin) or continuing a type of chronicle that was confined to their own monastery (that was lost with the fire). It does not seem likely that Peterborough was in any sense a lax or secular monastery, as the description of drunkenness causing the fire would not have made the abbey singular in the age.\n\nThe continuations are also unique in their linguistic shifts. When copying from Winchester, they preserve the orthography and syntax of late Old English, and when they get to events for which they have no copy text the language abruptly changes to a newer form. Given that the loan would have taken place just before the continuation, the change in language reflects either a dramatic attempt at greater vernacular by the continuation authors or a significant and quick change in the language itself as Norman influences spread. Because the chronicle is in prose, the artificiality of verse form does not entail the preservation of linguistic archaisms, and historians of English can trace the beginnings of Middle English in these pages.\n\nThe manuscript of the \"Chronicle\" is now held by the Bodleian Library. It was donated to the library by William Laud, who was then Chancellor of Oxford University as well as Archbishop of Canterbury, on 28 June 1639. Laud included the manuscript together with a number of other documents, part of the third of a series of donations he made to the library in the years leading up to the English Civil War. It is currently identified in the library catalogue as \"Laud Misc. 636\"; previously it was designated as \"O. C. 1003\" based on the \"Old Catalogue\" by Edward Bernard. The Bodleian has made a series of images of Laud Misc 636 available.\n\n"}

The last edition in this form, in 1699, already shows some lists that foreshadow the upcoming Royal Almanac. Thus we find lists of counselors of state with their ordinary homes, the commissioners of the Board, auditors general and stewards of finances, the Chancellor, archbishops and bishops of France, universities, and the list of major exhibitions, sessions of the courts of Paris and the log of the Palace, and finally addresses the messengers and items indicating the day of departure.\n\nIn 1699, Louis XIV asked him what the author describes in detail his work.

In this context, recognition of peers is a valuable asset \"if someone has just placed a new post is an overflow of praise in its favor during the floods and the Chapel (...) but c is that while envy and jealousy talk like adulation.. One can understand the need to maintain directories so that everyone can follow the evolution of all these people. The multiplicity of these publications so says the king's will want to \"officially\" referencing his courtiers to charges created to keep beside him at Versailles, and maintain the jealousies of each other.\n\nEven if the king gave his approval, publishing such a book is not without risk. In December 1708, Laurent d'Houry is being prosecuted for having established a printing press in his house and forced to sell its equipment two months later. Then, in February 1716, he was imprisoned in the Bastille on complaint of the Earl of Stair, the British Ambassador, \"to be disrespectful in his almanac, the King George by not naming him not as king of England, or rather from Great Britain, and mention the king as son of Jacques II Stuart, exiled to St. Germain.\n\nThe Almanac and the Royal Court Calendar coexist peacefully for ten years and a lot of money to their authors, but from 1710, Laurent d'Houry integrates more and more topics like the book Colombat Biblio. The abscess broke out in 1717 when Houry Almanac releases its Abstract that will follow the format of the Calendar of the Court and simultaneously filing a lawsuit against its competitor. A Judgement of Solomon is made: if it is allowed to Houry now to continue the publication of its abstract and to counterfeit the Court Calendar, Colombat is obliged to freeze its calendar format and forbidden 'expand content. This stops any changes in the calendar of the Court, leaving the way open to the Almanac.\n\nUpon the death of Laurent Houry in 1725, his family is destitute. Revenues from sales of the Almanac are not sufficient to cover expenses of printing and bookselling. In these circumstances, his widow, Elizabeth Dubois, took over the business. Their son Charles-Maurice, who had hitherto been a mere proofreader of the Almanac, is trying to evict her mother and she is suing cons. It prepares the edition of 1726 but a ruling forbade him to publish it in his name alone. The ruling of 11 December 1726 forbids even disturb the affairs of his mother and to participate directly or indirectly to the development of the Almanac. That is why Charles-Maurice is mentioned as editor of the Almanac on the edition of 1726.\n\nIn 1731, she filed a new lawsuit against Colombat which increased its schedule despite the prohibition of 1717. Unsuccessful, she resumed the publication of the Abstract and Colombat complaint in turn, she then accepts to abandon the publication of the Abstract \"if returned to Colombat format from 1718. \"The disputes have become extinct with the death of the parties.\n\nThe privilege of the Almanac is about to expire, Charles-Maurice d'Houry tries one last time to seize it, but a royal letter of 27 March 1744 confirmed definitively André-François Le Breton as sole heir.\n\nIn 1728, the widow of his grandson, Houry combines son André-François Le Breton, who was 18 years old and an orphan under the guardianship of Charles-Maurice d'Houry. Andrew Francis had inherited, according to the will of the estate of Lawrence Houry, half of the rights of the Almanac, and his widow, the rest.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Almanac takes a new breath and adds new sections, which sometimes does not go without punishment. For example, in 1768, he has trouble with Voltaire, who sent him a letter incendiary:\n\nIn 1773, Le Breton moved his print shop in a wing of the former Hotel d'Alegre, at 13 rue de Hautefeuille, he acquired William Louis Joly de Fleury and was previously occupied by Ambassador Portugal.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, the weather is bad and bad wheat harvests. The price of this staple increases disproportionately. Recently, a rumor that the government would have the monopoly wheat, thus perpetuating the high cost of food. This rumor became official when accidentally in his edition of 1774, Le Breton added a \"Treasurer's grain account of the King\" in the person of Sr. Mirlavaud. The edition of the Almanac had yet been proofread and approved by the Chancellor, but was still sentenced to close his shop for 3 months and publish a revised edition, without the line in question.\n\nIn 1777, Le Breton was again accused of inserting information deemed subversive. It has, according to its critics, cited \"the Floral & Pranks Vergès & Vaucresson, among the prosecutors and attorneys general of the Parliament of Paris, who had been involved in a reform of parliament made by Maupeou against the venality of Parliament desired by Louis XV, but annulled by Louis XVI. In rebuke, Le Breton was sentenced to \" carton \"section on the Almanacs that had not yet been sold, and replacement cost, the Almanac issue of those who so request it.\"\n\nHe died on 4 October 1779 and his cousin, Charles-Laurent Houry, son of Charles-Maurice d'Houry, took over the business.\n\nThe privilege granted to the family of Houry for the Almanac has been threatened in 1789 when Camille Desmoulins, in his speech at the Lantern to the Parisians, says it will cease in favor of Baldwin, another Parisian publisher. This threat has not been brought into effect since the Almanac remained in Houry. Looking at the publications of the time, we can nevertheless see that Baldwin got the impressions of the National Assembly and other organs of state.\n\nFollowing the death of Joan Nera, widow of Laurent-Charles Houry, the Almanac is echoed by Jean-François-Noël Debure, husband of Anne-Charlotte d'Houry, their daughter. Debure is from a prominent and wealthy family of Parisian booksellers, especially combined with the Didot family. It is a printer since 1784 with the title's printer Duke of Orleans.\n\nDebure takes time printing of the family of Houry, but his other business is in trouble and he is forced to file for bankruptcy. To keep the property inherited from his family, Anne-Charlotte d'Houry hires a separation procedure. In November 1791, the bankruptcy is declared and it is opposed to the creditors to preserve his legacy, and this opposition is futile and a ruling allows creditors to seize his furniture, but that does not appear to have been necessary because a subsequent decision allows him to recover property that creditors have not taken her husband.\n\nFrancois-Jean-Noel Debure dies 1802 in Loiret. However, it is focused died from 1795 through various sources. Maybe it was just left without leaving an address.\n\nStephen Lawrence Testu worked as a clerk in the family home Debure since 1788, and had gradually won the confidence of the household. Because of the absence of Mr. Debure, Anne-Charlotte is alone with his two son. Despite their age difference, he is 20 years younger than she, she married Testu July 1795. Testu few highlights its knowledge in the profession to convince him to transfer the management of printing. It accepts in 1797 and offered him priority over the rights of the Almanac in exchange for a perpetual annuity of 800 francs, then she completely abandons the Almanac. This influx of money seems to turn the head Testu who play games and learn to enjoy the easy life, neglects the direction of its establishment and constantly running out of money, he contracted many loans that gradually ruining his business. Relations were strained with his wife because he left the marital home in September 1801 and the only ties that bind the couple are now linked to multiple trials they s'intentent.\n\nIn 1810, Testu secretly sold the rights of the Almanac in which he partnered with Guyot. Anne-Charlotte d'Houry opposes this sale she saw as a usurpation, but loses the case in 1812. She gets in return a pension of 1 200 francs Testu does not pay. Indeed, a decree of 1820 declares the debtor more than 90 000 francs... In 1814, due to the large sums invested by Guyot in the case, an order confirming the owner of the Almanac, a copy of this order is also printed at the end of the following books. Testu still gets Guyot repayment of its debts and an annuity of 2,400 francs.\n\nGuyot dismisses Testu business in 1820 and continues even to pay his annuity. The latter, again running out of money turned in 1823 against his wife, calls it reaches the marital home and she pays all household expenses, or alternatively, that she pays rent of 6000 francs. Judges déboutent Testu the marital home, since he himself had deserted 22 years earlier and has no housing to offer his wife even though she already lives in a very beautiful but still require his wife, yet very rich, to pay him a pension of 1,800 francs by invoking the solidarity between spouses.\n\nThe hegemony of the family of Houry on the Almanac established in 1683 has finally ceased in 1814 when, by order, the company is transferred to the association Guyot-Testu. Anne-Charlotte d'Houry died 22 July 1828 aged about 83 years.\n\nIn 1867, edition of the Almanac is transferred to the widow Berger-Levrault, who had already published the Yearbook of the French empire diplomatic, and military Yearbook of the French empire, both published as the Almanac according to documents provided by the administration.\n\nThe edition of the Almanac stops definitively in 1919 after four years of interruption due to war, the latter number includes the years 1915 to 1919. Not found in the literature the reasons that prompted the shutdown of publication, but it can be assumed that the combination of very large volume of the book (more than 1650 pages in 1900) and the hard times that the Economics and French policy at that time was to make the management of such a volume of information extremely complex and unprofitable for the publisher. It is also possible that the new government formed after elections in 1919 no longer supported the development of the Almanac.\n\nThe Almanac or Calendar, as he was called in its early editions, was just a simple calendar which were associated topics on astronomical events, the days of fairs, the newspaper of the Palace, the residence of messengers The departure of the mails, the price of currencies and the list of collectors' offices. After his presentation to the king in 1699, many items are constantly being added including the clergy, the royal family of France, then the families of other sovereign nations, officers, ambassadors, etc..\n\nIn 1705, Houry added to the list of knights of the Holy Spirit and peer and marshal of France. In 1707, it is the state of the clergy and, in 1712, the birth of kings, princes and princesses of Europe. After the death of Louis XIV, the Duke of Orleans, became the Regent, is added to the list of members of the royal family of the members of the House of Orleans. Later, he put more of his own, the full house of the Queen and princes.\n\nIt is not possible to describe all items contained in an almanac as there, so the contents of 1780 covers ten pages:\n\nThe Almanac also stands abreast of scientific advances. In the middle of the eighteenth century, improving the accuracy of clocks and many wealthy fans begin to observe and study the stars. It is indispensable to know precisely the difference between true solar time of sundials, and mean solar time clocks, especially since the advent of clocks seconds. This is the equation of the pendulum, also called the equation of time, the table is added shortly before 1750.\n\nWith the French Revolution, the Almanac exchange of title and its content is modified to match the new institutions.\n\nThe abolition of all distinctions requires overhaul the topics, timing of the vulgar era is replaced by the Republican calendar, the place reserved for kings and princes of Europe is replaced by a note on the friendly powers of France, the administrative organs of royal power are replaced by new ministries.\n\nThe content changes again with the reforms of the Consulate and the Empire, the Restoration, the Hundred Days, the July Monarchy, the Second Republic followed the Second Empire and the Third Republic who sees the end of the edition of Almanac. In each case, the bindings are supplied with the times.\n\nAs the number of entries is increasing, the number of pages follows the same trend: they numbered one hundred in 1699, nearly five-hundred in 1760, and seven-hundred just before the French Revolution. The course of a thousand pages is taken in 1840 to over 1000-6-cents in 1900. On average, about thirty names are listed per page, the total number of people or places listed annually in the tens of thousands, but no table patronymic does quickly find a particular name.\n\nAll changes in the Almanac makes it a very useful book for historians that may follow, year after year, ministries and other administrative bodies, movements of people in these offices, and retail organization public services to a resident of Paris (such as places of mailboxes, timetables and fares for ticks and royal messengers ).\n\nAfter the death of Laurent Houry, his descendants continued his work until 1814. The edition was continued until 1919. It would be tedious to describe in words the evolution of the Almanac of the 237 years that have elapsed since the first edition by Laurent d'Houry in 1683, hence the choice of this table layout.\n\nThroughout its existence, the Almanac has crossed 11 schemes political editor changed the title 14 times and 9 times.\n\nSince its inception in 1700, following a royal demand, the Almanac invented by Laurent d'Houry aims to be an official handbook.\n\nUntil the French Revolution, contributors are cordially invited to provide information to the bookseller, as pointed note of the printer in the first pages of the Almanac. In 1771, for example, we read in the Journal History of the Revolution that the Bar Association in the person of a certain Gerbier, asserted that \"there would be no change in the order of the table, and that it would be printed in the Almanac as Royal was last year, leaving out only the dead.\"\n\nWith the French Revolution, the order was given to government to provide all information to the publisher. In 1802, Testu gets even exclusivity.\n\nLater, the collection of information for the Almanac is even part of the operating budget of the ministries and can be seen in order of December 31, 1844 signed by Louis-Philippe I \"on the organization of the Ministry Administration Navy \"Article 6 of which list the items in the budget\" the formation of the Royal Almanac.\n\nThe print quality improves significantly when Laurent d'Houry became printer. It multiplies the bands and tail-lights to decorate and titles for sections. The Almanac is still very poor prints because the image is not its goal. Only that the reader can find are patterns explaining the oppositions of the planets and eclipses are present every year, and the map of departments of France editions of 1791 and 1792.\n\nDespite the short time to prepare the book, the printer treats the presentation and uses in the case of many variations in size and shape of characters for easy reading of long lists, special characters to emphasize certain lines, compositions tables or columns and clusters in braces.\n\nThat Le Breton, grand son of Laurent Houry, who brings more to the book. It increases greatly and restructures the Almanac, and also improves its presentation in order to preserve readability. Many notes are added to guide the reader and help in understanding the operation of certain administrative bodies.\n\nThe Almanacs modern nineteenth-century advantage of technological advances. Cartoon characters are modernized and the use of fonts to graphics customizable multiplies, sometimes to excess: we can count at least 7 in 11 fonts fonts differ on the cover page of the National Almanac 1850 printed by Guyot et Scribe!\n\nAnnouncements, the ancestors of advertising, are introduced by the publisher Berger-Levrault in the late nineteenth century.\n\nThe deadline for submitting this information to the editor is set to \"first ten days of October (or November). The last-minute changes are incorporated in an erratum end of the book. When they are too large, they may even delay the release. In late December, an event is sent to the administration for approving the content. This approval is required before the sale.\n\nIt leaves only two months to integrate the information of the year in the text of the previous edition and call all of the pages before submitting the book for the right to shoot. The editing step, at least for the test in 1706, has not been done with great care as can be seen by very many shells and mistakes which have crept into the table of contents presented in thumbnail to the right.\n\nOnce the administrative agreement obtained, it is inserted end of the book, the Almanac is stapled or bound and is then distributed to customers at the end of the year.\n\nEarly Almanacs were not printed by Laurent d'Houry. The Almanac of 1706 and is printed by Jacques Vincent, installed Huchette street, at the sign of the Angel. November 15, 1712, Laurent Houry became printer and immediately began printing his work. Then all the almanacs will be printed by their publishers.\n\nThere is no source that explains the draw of the Almanac. The only figures available are the annual rents generated by sales.\n\nIn 1782, Mercier said a pension of more than 40 000 francs. Diderot, at the same time, puts the figure at 30,000 pounds. For a price of sale of 5 to 6 pounds, the draw must necessarily be greater than about 7500 almanacs.\n\nAround 1820, during the trials that have brought the widow and Debure Testu, income of the Almanac was estimated between 25 and 30 000 francs. In 1834, another almanac, the Almanac of France, said that its cost is 35 cents for a sale price of 50 cents. Booksellers then purchase the item at prices of 38 cents, to resell a suggested retail price of 50 cents. The publisher earns so 3 cents per pound sold, the bookseller earns 12 (minus shipping costs, dependent). If one considers - arbitrarily - a four Almanac is sold directly into the library Testu (priced at 10 francs 50) the remainder being passed through intermediaries, we can prorate that to generate an annual income of 30 000 francs Testu must sell approximately 25 000.\n\nIn the absence of more precise information, we can only estimate at about 15,000, the number of copies sold per year between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.\n\nThe almanac is sold either stapled or bound by the printer. The paperback version allows the purchaser to connect his book as he wishes, and so it is possible to find books with bindings very ornate, with lace, weapons of families, many colors brightened or gilding Biblio 24, etc..\n\nThe bound version provided by the printer is usually presented in a bound in calf or Morocco, full, and lilies in the boxes back. With the revolution, the lilies are replaced with Phrygian caps in roundels Library 25.\n\nThe Almanac is normally available from the bookseller, but it can also be found in the province in other bookstores that serve as intermediaries, for example in 1816, at Pesche, bookseller at Le Mans Ref 17, or by correspondence through the Sorbonne, as did Voltaire Ref 18.\n\nThe Almanac has a very great interest because of the number of subjects it addresses the organization of the French administration. In 1785, Mairobert wrote that \"the Almanach Royal is in the hands of everyone and is among the Princes, the King's office, the foreign ministers would cater Ref 19. Louis-Sebastien Mercier in a pamphlet, the Tableau de Paris that stands in 1782 Ref 20 explains that \"Those who are thrown into the paths of ambition, study Almanac Royal with serious attention,\" \"more a beautiful royal consult the almanac to see if her lover is a lieutenant or sergeant... \", that\" everyone is buying the almanac to find out exactly where they stand. \"And finally\" even Fontenelle said, that it was the book which contained the greatest truths.\"\n\nAdages use the almanac as a reference. According to Jean-François de La Harpe is \"the only book to read to get rich is the Royal Almanac Ref 21, Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin uses the phrase\" having the memory of a Royal Almanac Ref 22 \" or the Memoirs of the Academy of hawkers Ref 23 explains that \"it is enough to read the Almanac for education.\"\n\nIn the eyes of justice, the book can be used as a basis for comparison: during a police investigation in 1824 Ref 24, a defendant defends himself by explaining that the volume of documents he was accused of having carried \"could be equal to that of a royal Almanac almanac or a related trade.\"\n\nWhether to have a certain level of resources to purchase this item, the customer extended beyond the financial and political world.\n\nThe Royal Almanac is competing at its inception with the Almanac of the Court of Colombat who can not make it evolve since 1717. In fact, bibliographers consider that the Royal Almanac is one of the \"oldest and most helpful Ref 25\". If it essentially describes the royal court and the Parisian institutions, other major cities also have their almanacs, such as the city of Lyon equally voluminous Ref 26. The Almanac is however considered a reference book. In 1780, a notice of a bookseller named Desnos inserted at the end of the Gazette of 27 offers for courts Ref 8 pounds to \"the statesman, letters, and generally all persons attached to the service of the King (... ) Almanach Royal, Calendar of the Court, said Colombat, Mignone Strennas-Note 22, Ref 28, the State Military Note 23, the four connected units, with shelves & stylus to write, which makes the closure \": the Royal Almanac ranks first in the collection.\n\nSince 1717, the Calendar of the Court can not change, its sections are limited to an ephemeris of the celestial motions (30 years) increased by astronomical tables with sky conditions, and timing of the court to the family and royal house, lists of boards, departments and secretaries of state finances, births and deaths of kings, queens, princes and princesses of Europe, the knights of various orders, the archbishops and bishops of the kingdom and Cardinals of the Sacred College.\n\nIt is primarily sought for its ephemeris of the celestial motions and astronomical tables of events\n\nThe Almanac of Business, published by Sébastien Bottin in the eighteenth century contains, besides the addresses of shops in Paris, many useful statistics financiers. It is supplementary to the Almanach royal, which concerns only the French administration.\n\nSome have criticized the Almanach Royal of being a plagiarism of the State of France, another administrative directory, the first publication seems to have been made in 1619 and is still published in the middle of the eighteenth century Ref 30. However, the edition of 1736 of the State of France said it was a \"periodical whose audience has applied for renewal from time to time, and had been published until 1699, 1702, 1708, 1712, 1718 and 1727 Ref 31. The latest editions of 1727 and 1736 five volumes contain over 500 pages each. Offices are described down to the smallest detail Note 25, the state of France is a companion volume of the Almanach royal use by those who wish to deepen their knowledge on the functioning of the French administration.\n\nFurther details concerning the organization of the administration of the French state, and persons who occupied positions, many other topics are discussed in the Almanacs, for example in the eighteenth century:\n\nThis section is only found in the Almanacs of the early eighteenth century, and stops just before 1726.\n\nThere are prices for masonry, carpentry and joinery, roofing, locksmithing, painting and glazing that are usually in Paris, for example:\n\nWith these data, the historian is able to quantify fully the construction of a building in Paris at that time.\n\nThe Almanac explains in great detail some official ceremonies:\n\nThe detailed description of the ceremonies to stop mid-eighteenth century to make room for a still more comprehensive directory. A reference is then made towards the end of the book \"guides for all kinds of ceremonies to be observed in the receipt of any office or employment whether in dress or in the Sword.\"\n\nTransportation of persons is ensured by the coaches, carriages, wagons and other carriages. Found in the Almanac schedules and rates of major roads.\n\nIn 1715, a passenger wishing to travel from Paris to Caen will go rue Saint-Denis on Monday at six o'clock in the morning. He has previously \"sent his clothes the night before early.\" Fifteen years later, the starting time is advanced to 5 am in summer and in 1750, the departure is 5 hours throughout the year. In 1780, two flights are scheduled Tuesdays and Fridays at 23:30 and the journey takes two days. A van, slower, except Sunday at noon and made the trip in four and a half days in summer and five days in winter. In 1790, transportation is now provided by the General Department of stagecoaches and mail royal France. Three coaches liaise on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and the van on Sunday. The departure is now Notre-Dame-des-Victoires.\n\nRates are rarely reported but in 1725 and 1761 is 18 pounds per person tournaments. He is 21 pounds in 1770 to reach 42 pounds in 1790 (fortunately for the traveler, it is stated that the \"sleeping bag weighing 10 pounds is\" free\").\n\nIn 1716, the king appoints François Perrier Dumouriez as Director General of public pump to remedy fire, without the audience is obliged to pay anything. In 1722, he founded the Compagnie des Gardes Pumps du Roy, under the direction of the same. This company later became the Brigade of firefighters in Paris Note 32.\n\nThe Almanac of 1719 lists these pumps and their wardens and deputy wardens. We then learned that a brigade is made up of four guards and four sub-custodians who are responsible for maintaining the material deposited in each district. What became three years later the Society of King's Guards Pumps were not at that time that 41 people, 17 pumps distributed in groups of 8 men and 4 or 3 pumps in the City Hall, the convent of the Grands Augustins The Carmelite convent in the Place Maubert, Convent of Mercy, and the Fathers of Little Place des Victoires, in addition to a pump at the Director General of the pumps, Rue Mazarine. Except Dumouriez guards pumps are not professional fire but shoemakers, carpenters, locksmiths, etc..\n\nAlmanacs are found regularly in auctions and in the antiquarian booksellers. Given their importance documentary and the fact that there are beautiful copies, these books are particularly sought after by historians, writers, bibliophiles and enthusiasts.\n\nVolumes in the first round of the seventeenth century often exceed several thousand euros Ref 32, the other is generally negotiated between a few tens and five hundred euros, sometimes more, depending on their rarity, condition and quality bookbinding Note 33. Just over half are however available for free download on Gallica or Google Books:\n\nAlmanacs contain some handwritten notes left by their readers. The value of the book can then be influenced upward or downward depending on the quality and content of these notes, and especially the person who wrote them - when you can identify it. They are usually found on page intentionally left blank for the ephemeris. Some of these notes can provide very interesting information, such as notes written on the page in August 1715 a copy of the BNF. It relates the circumstances of the death of Louis XIV, who was suffering from gangrene Note 34:\n"}
{"id": "59236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59236", "title": "Set (deity)", "text": "Set (deity)\n\nSet or Seth (Egyptian: \"stẖ;\" also transliterated Setesh, Sutekh, Setekh, or Suty) is a god of chaos, the desert, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion. In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as \"Sēth\" (Σήθ). Set had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his solar boat to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos. Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant. He was lord of the red (desert) land where he was the balance to Horus' role as lord of the black (soil) land.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Set is portrayed as the usurper who killed and mutilated his own brother Osiris. Osiris' wife Isis reassembled (remembered) Osiris' corpse and resurrected her dead husband long enough to conceive his son and heir Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set, and the myths describe their conflicts. This Osiris myth is a prominent theme in Egyptian mythology.\n\nSet is the son of Geb, the Earth and Nut, the Sky; his siblings are Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. He married Nephthys and fathered Anubis; and in some accounts he had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat, and Astarte.\n\nThe meaning of the name \"Set\" is unknown but it is thought to have been originally pronounced *\"sūtiẖ\" [ˈsuw.tixʲ] based on spellings of his name in Egyptian hieroglyphs as \"stẖ\" and \"swtẖ\". The Late Egyptian spelling \"stš\" reflects the palatalization of \"ẖ\" while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like \"swtj.\" The Coptic form of the name, \"Sēt,\" is the basis for the English vocalization.\n\nIn art, Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the \"Set animal\", a beast resembling no known creature, although it could be seen as a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, a jackal or a fennec fox. The animal has a curved snout, long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and canine body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe, owing to the large flat-topped \"horns\" which correspond to a giraffe's ossicones. The Egyptians themselves, however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted as a donkey or as having a donkey's head.\n\nThe earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the Amratian culture (\"Naqada I\") of prehistoric Egypt (3790 BC–3500 BC), though this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a ceremonial macehead of Scorpion II, a ruler of the Naqada III phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present.\n\nThe next phase of the myth begins when the adult Horus challenges Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in \"Contendings\", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.\n\nThe rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the \"Pyramid Texts\", the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.\nThe divine struggle involves many episodes. \"Contendings\" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.\n\nIn a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \"Contendings\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \"gives birth\" to the disk. In \"Contendings\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.\n\nAnother important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.\n\nIn any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of \"maat\". Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.\n\nSet was depicted standing on the prow of Ra's barge defeating the dark serpent Apep. In some Late Period representations, such as in the Persian Period Temple of Hibis at Khargah, Set was represented in this role with a falcon's head, taking on the guise of Horus. In the \"Amduat\" Set is described as having a key role in overcoming Apep.\n\nDuring the Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BC), a group of Asiatic foreign chiefs known as the Hyksos (literally, \"rulers of foreign lands\") gained the rulership of Egypt, and ruled the Nile Delta, from Avaris. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King Apophis is recorded as worshiping Set exclusively, as described in the following passage:\n\nJan Assmann argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \"lonely\" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.\n\nWhen, c. 1522 BC, Ahmose I overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became xenophobic, and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.\n\nThe founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Ramesses I came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably Seti I (literally, \"man of Set\") and Setnakht (literally, \"Set is strong\"). In addition, one of the garrisons of Ramesses II held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses II erected the so-called \"Four Hundred Years' Stele\" at Pi-Ramesses, commemorating the 400-year anniversary of the Set cult in the Delta.\n\nSet also became associated with foreign gods during the New Kingdom, particularly in the Delta. Set was also identified by the Egyptians with the Hittite deity Teshub, who, like Set, was a storm god.\n\nAccording to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the Assyrian and Persian empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.\n\nSet's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks would later associate Set with Typhon, a monstrous and evil force of raging nature. Both were sons of deities representing the Earth (Gaia and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, Zeus for Typhon).\n\nNevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.\n\nSet has also been classed as a trickster deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.\n\nSet was worshipped at the temples of Ombos (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near Kom Ombo), at Oxyrhynchus in upper Egypt, and also in part of the Fayyum area.\n\nMore specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of Sepermeru, especially during the Ramesside Period. There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the \"House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru\". One of the epithets of this town was \"gateway to the desert\", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called \"The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm\", and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called \"The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\".\n\nThere is no question, however, that the two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets. Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna. The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this \"milieu\" is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another \"House of Seth\" and another \"House of Nephthys\" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing in terms of the pre-Twentieth Dynasty connections between temples of Set and nearby temples of his consort Nephthys is the evidence of Papyrus Bologna, which preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the \"House of Seth\" in the now-lost town of Punodjem (\"The Sweet Place\"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: \"the ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples\".\n\nIt is unfortunate, perhaps, that we have no means of knowing the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts—it would be interesting to learn, for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth's consort-goddess. When, by the Twentieth Dynasty, the \"demonization\" of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, \"Hwt-Sekhem\"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.\n\nYet it is perhaps most telling that Seth's cult persisted with astonishing potency even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion, in outlying (but important) places like Kharga, Dakhlah, Deir el-Hagar, Mut, Kellis, etc. Indeed, in these places, Seth was considered \"Lord of the Oasis/Town\" and Nephthys was likewise venerated as \"Mistress of the Oasis\" at Seth's side, in his temples (esp. the dedication of a Nephthys-cult statue). Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as \"Mistress\" in the Osirian temples of these districts, as part of the specifically Osirian college. It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. Further study of the enormously important role of Seth in ancient Egyptian religion (particularly after the Twentieth Dynasty) is imperative.\n\n\n"}

Individual websites or intranets may use a back-of-the-book index, while search engines usually use keywords and metadata to provide a more useful vocabulary for Internet or onsite searching. With the increase in the number of periodicals that have articles online, web indexing is also becoming important for periodical websites.\n\nBack-of-the-book-style web indexes may be called \"web site A-Z indexes\". The implication with \"A-Z\" is that there is an alphabetical browse view or interface. This interface differs from that of a browse through layers of hierarchical categories (also known as a taxonomy) which are not necessarily alphabetical, but are also found on some web sites. Although an A-Z index could be used to index multiple sites, rather than the multiple pages of a single site, this is unusual.\n\nMetadata web indexing involves assigning keywords or phrases to web pages or web sites within a metadata tag (or \"meta-tag\") field, so that the web page or web site can be retrieved with a search engine that is customized to search the keywords field. This may or may not involve using keywords restricted to a controlled vocabulary list. This method is commonly used by search engine indexing.\n\n\n"}

The sites were operated by a range of agencies including the Army, Navy and RAF plus the Foreign Office (MI6 and MI5), General Post Office and Marconi Company receiving stations ashore and afloat.\n\nThe \"Y\" stations tended to be of two types, for intercepting of the signals and for identifying where they were coming from. Sometimes both functions were operated at the same site, with the direction finding (D/F) hut being a few hundred metres from the main interception building, because of the need to minimise interference. The sites collected radio traffic which was then either analysed locally or if encrypted, passed for processing initially to Admiralty Room 40 in London and during World War II to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.\n\nIn the Second World War a large house called \"Arkley View\" on the outskirts of Barnet (now part of the London Borough of Barnet) acted as a data collection centre, where traffic was collated and passed to Bletchley Park and it also acted as a Y station. Many amateur radio (ham) operators supported the work of the Y stations, being enrolled as \"Voluntary Interceptors\". \n\nMuch of the traffic intercepted by the Y stations was recorded by hand and sent to Bletchley by motorcycle couriers and later by teleprinter, over post office land lines. The name derived from Wireless Interception (WI). The term was also used for similar stations attached to the India outpost of the Intelligence Corps, the Wireless Experimental Centre (WEC) outside Delhi.\n\nSpecially constructed Y stations undertook direction finding on wireless transmissions. This became particularly important in the Battle of the Atlantic where locating U-boats was vital. Admiral Dönitz told his commanders that they could not be located if they limited their wireless transmissions to under 30 seconds but skilled D/F operators were able to locate the origin of their signals in as few as six seconds.\n\nThe design of land-based D/F stations preferred by the Allies in World War II was the U-Adcock system, which consisted of a small, central operators' hut that was surrounded by four vertical aerial poles, usually placed at the four compass points. Aerial feeders ran underground and came up in the centre of the hut and were connected to a direction finding goniometer and a wireless receiver, that allowed the bearing of the signal source to be measured. In the UK some operators were located in an underground metal tank. These stations were usually in remote places, often in the middle of farmers' fields. Traces of World War II D/F stations can be seen as circles in the fields surrounding the village of Goonhavern in Cornwall.\n\n\n\n"}
