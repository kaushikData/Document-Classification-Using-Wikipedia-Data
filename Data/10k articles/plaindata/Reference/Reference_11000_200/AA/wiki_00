Haupt Conservatory is a greenhouse in the Bronx, New York, United States, a major part of the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). Inspiration for the park and the conservatory stemmed from Nathaniel Lord Britton and his wife Elizabeth. The couple had visited the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew on their honeymoon and thought a similar park and conservatory should be built for New York City. The NYBG and the Conservatory were the result.\n\nThe conservatory was designed by the major greenhouse company of the time, Lord and Burnham Co. The design was modeled after the Palm House at the Royal Botanic Garden and Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in Italian Renaissance style. Groundbreaking took place on January 3, 1899 and construction was completed in 1902 at a cost of $177,000. The building was constructed by John R. Sheehan under contract for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Since the original construction, major renovations took place in 1935, 1950, 1978, and 1993.\n\nBy the 1970s, the building was in a state of extreme disrepair and had to be either substantially rebuilt or torn down. Enid Annenberg Haupt saved the conservatory from demolition with a $5 million contribution for renovation and a $5 million endowment for maintenance of the building. A subsequent renovation, which started in 1978, restored the conservatory closer to its original design, which had been compromised during the 1935 and 1950 renovations. Due to her generous contributions, the Conservatory was named the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory in 1978.\n\nThe 1993 renovation replaced the inner workings of the conservatory. At this time, the mechanical systems to control temperature, humidity, and ventilation were upgraded to computerized systems. The exhibits were also redesigned. The conservatory serves as a focal point of the park and a center for education. It is a New York City landmark.\n\nWhile the creation of the New York Botanical Garden was inspired by Nathaniel and Elizabeth Britton's visit to the Royal Botanical Garden at Kew, its creation was dependent on a complex series of events. As early as 1877, ideas were circulating in New York City to create a botanical garden; funding could not be obtained at the time, although the efforts led to parkland being set aside for future use. Ultimately, authorization to set aside specifically for a New York Botanical Garden was received in 1891. The principal officers of the new corporation set up for the garden were Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan, with Nathaniel Lord Britton as the new secretary. From this beginning, the NYBG was established:\n\nThe Conservatory was key to the mission and concept of the NYBG from the beginning. When the master plan for the garden was drawn up, planning for the conservatory began.\nThe commission to design the Conservatory was given to the greenhouse firm Lord and Burnham very early in the process. The primary designer of the building was William R. Cobb, an architect employed by Lord and Burnham. The new Conservatory was primarily made of steel, cast iron, wood and glass.\n\nThe original design remained largely intact until the 1935 and 1950 renovations, which significantly compromised the original design. During these renovations, much of the elaborate decoration was removed. The 1935 renovation, in particular, was described as \"an attempt to halt the deterioration of the endangered building and bring it up to the prevailing taste of European Modernism.\" By 1978, the Conservatory was in a state of extreme disrepair and was slated for demolition due to a lack of funding for its renovation. Following Enid Annenberg Haupt's endowment, Edward Larrabee Barnes was the architect for the renovation and the conservatory was renamed the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory.\n\nThe most recent renovation was completed by Beyer Blinder Belle Architects in 1997, and was significant for the interior of the conservatory. The mechanical systems to control temperature, humidity, and ventilation were upgraded to computerized systems. The new systems allow optimal growing conditions for a greater variety of plants. This opportunity led to a redesign of the exhibits, which has remained largely intact. The redesign created a transitioning environment through the pavilions that conveys a trip over mountains from wet western slopes, up through the rainforest and down into the desert.\n\nAs the conservatory has evolved, the central principles guiding the NYBG's mission have remained consistent. The park (and the conservatory) continues to serve as a center for education. The conservatory also remains the focal point for the park, and is an element drawing the largest crowds to visit the NYBG. Due to the conservatory's history and success, it was dedicated as a New York City landmark in 1976.\n\nThe original architect for the conservatory was the greenhouse company Lord and Burnham Co. Lord and Burnham was \"the premier glasshouse design and fabrication firm of the time\" and completed several large commissions in addition to the NYBG Conservatory. Lord and Burnham began as Lord's Horticultural Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1856 by Frederick A. Lord. His son-in-law William Addison Burnham joined the business in 1872, and its name was changed to Lord & Burnham.\n\nLord was a carpenter from Ipswich, Massachusetts. He built himself a greenhouse in 1849 after moving to Buffalo, New York, and was subsequently asked to build greenhouses for others. He built greenhouses as a side job, until opening his own company. In 1870, Lord moved to Irvington, New York to be closer to his clients. Much of his early work consisted of greenhouses for large private estates along the Hudson River.\n\nIn 1877, Lord and Burnham was contracted to build a conservatory in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. This was one of the firm's first public works and led to many future projects. Jay Gould, the railroad tycoon, made an order in 1881 for several greenhouses to be constructed in Irvington. The greenhouses built on his estate were said to be the first steel-frame glass houses constructed in the United States. In addition to their embrace of new materials, Lord and Burnham was innovative in the development of boilers (which were a key part of the greenhouses' functioning).\n\nLord and Burnham was awarded the commission to design the conservatory in 1896. William R. Cobb was the architect working for Lord and Burnham who was in charge of the design of the conservatory. He was a noted horticultural designer and served as the first vice president, secretary, and general sales manager of Lord and Burnham. As a designer for Lord and Burnham, Cobb designed many parks, conservatories, and private estates throughout the country.\n\nThe original architect for the NYBG was Calvert Vaux (co-designer of Central Park). He served as an adviser during the formulation of the preliminary design along with Samuel Parsons. The plan they developed together was submitted in 1896 (shortly after Vaux's death), and was ultimately followed almost exactly. A notable exception of deviation from this plan was the location of the conservatory, which was the only major element not built on the site shown in the Vaux plan.\n\nFrom the time the land was secured for the park nearly until the Conservatory construction began, the placement of the conservatory within the park was heavily debated. The advisory committee of the Parks Department favored a formal spatial arrangement of buildings within the park, while the NYBG disagreed; they believed greater separation of the buildings would ease the management and supervision of crowds. Ultimately, the conservatory was placed away from other buildings in the park. At the time this was an unusual arrangement, as the conservatory had no axial or visual connection to the museum or any other buildings in the park.\n\nThe site chosen in 1898 was an open field; some have suggested this open site was chosen to save existing trees. Additionally, the chosen site placed the conservatory in a location where the building is visible from the boundary streets along the south and west of the park. Southern Boulevard and other adjacent streets were realigned and reorganized when the site was developed. The arrangement created visibility of the conservatory from the road and presented the building as a public icon, relationships which still remain.\n\nEqually important to the overall placement of the building within the park was the development of the immediately surrounding gardens. The adjacent gardens were considered important supporting resources to the conservatory, and also related to the geometry of the building. \"The elaborate, multiple domes style of the Conservatory and its topographic position above the surrounding grades dictated the clean lines and geometries of the surrounding paths, sloping terraces, and planting beds, further integration building and setting\". All of the adjacent garden elements were formal, geometric, and orthogonal to reflect the architecture of the Conservatory.\n\nThe main materials used in the construction of the conservatory were steel and glass, in addition to a range of materials used for the base, ornament, and waterproofing. The main structure of the building was made of steel although a few of the pavilions had wrought iron columns. Also, wood beams were used in some locations. Later renovations to the building altered some aspects of the structure. For example, many steel elements were replaced and wood beams were replaced with steel.\n\nGlazing was clearly the other major element in the conservatory. Standardized sized glass panes were used to the greatest extent possible, with panels cut to length in all pavilions except the Palm House (the main pavilion.) The Palm House incorporated glass. All pavilions called for second quality French and American glass. Additionally, clear and ground glass was used depending on the orientation of the glass. All vertical glass was left clear while certain portions of the roof glass were ground. However, the ground glass was not alone sufficient to provide shading and additional means were employed which would allow for modification depending on seasonal conditions. Stipling and waterproof movable shades were used for additional shade control.\n\nIn addition to the structural and glazing systems, a variety of other materials were used for the base of the building, the waterproofing, ornament, and other secondary functions. Bluestone, Buff Bedford Stone, North River brick, and Tennessee marble were used for the masonry work. For leaders and gutters throughout most of the building, copper flashing was used. In some areas cast iron was used for the gutter system. Cast iron was also used for sills, friezes, columns, railings, mullions, transom bars, and snowguards.\n\nWhile the conservatory has undergone many renovations since the original construction, the same palette of materials has generally been maintained. However, the building systems behind what visitors see have been greatly altered in major efforts to maintain the best possible environment for the plants inside. Though technology has advanced greatly, the commitment to state-of-the-art systems has remained unchanged since the earliest boiler systems installed by Lord and Burnham.\n\nThe conservatory form developed as a combination of the latest technologies in greenhouse design and more traditional ideas of ornament. The overall shape and layout of the building is geared both towards the functional aspects of the interior greenhouse spaces as well as creating a monumental form from the exterior to portray the significance of the building. Lord and Burnham made heavy use of ornament at the conservatory and was a trademark aspect of their civic and public conservatories. The heavy ornamentation here and in other buildings at the time was an essential element in defining the building's status and historical appearance.\n\nThe building is a series of large glass pavilions that are all very open on the inside (typical of greenhouses). The pavilions are laid out symmetrically around the large central Palm House pavilion. In plan the building is divided into eleven pavilions, where each pavilion has a distinct geometry defining it in relationship to adjacent pavilions. Together the pavilions form a \"C\"-shape with the central pavilion (with its grand dome) in the center. The use of ornament creates a hierarchy among the pavilions. The central dome is the most elaborate, followed by the corner and end pavilions. The interconnecting pavilions are the least ornamented.\n\nFunctionally, each pavilion houses a different group of plants representing various conditions found around the globe. The configuration of the building into distinct pavilions allows for each of these global regions to be treated separately in terms of the temperature and humidity maintained for the plants. While the collections have changed over time, the basic concept of display has remained fairly consistent. The base collection is generally permanent, with additional plants brought in for special exhibitions throughout the year. For example, there is an extensive orchid show every spring that draws many visitors to the Conservatory. During the orchid show, thousands of orchids are brought in and are incorporated into the existing collection.\n\nThe conservatory is a major resource in the international study of horticulture as well as a center for learning for the public. For example, every year hundreds of scientists travel to the conservatory to study the rare palm and cacti exhibits. The original goal of the conservatory to serve as a center of learning and to advance knowledge of the art and science of horticulture has remained intact since the opening of the conservatory and park. Additional greenhouses have been built on the grounds of the NYBG to provide additional space for research. These greenhouses are a tremendous resource for scientists while also supporting exhibits in the main Conservatory. As a symbol of the NYBG however, the conservatory remains the main draw of the park and its form has developed an iconic status in New York City and beyond.\n\nSince the opening of the NYBG, the conservatory has been a tremendous resource for the community in the New York City area as well as for the global scientific community. The public focus of this conservatory was an important step in the larger history of greenhouses, especially at the time of its construction. Around 1900, greenhouses were a privilege only for the upper classes and carried with them a great air of exclusivity. The explosion of greenhouses across the world was due to a variety of influences. Colonial expansion and expanding worldwide travel at the turn of the century brought with it a certain mania for people to bring exotic flora into their lives, and the possibility was made complete through the development of the modern greenhouse. The Industrial Revolution resulted in such feats as Paxton's Crystal Palace, which marked the beginning of commercialized greenhouse design and construction. The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory opened up the opportunity for people of all classes to enjoy the greenhouse experience. Also, as New York City expanded in the nineteenth century, open space became more and more precious. The NYBG as a whole provided a release from the pressures of city life and the Conservatory brought the opportunity for new and exotic experiences wholly outside the routines of everyday life. For the scientific community, the Conservatory has always been a major resource for scientists from all over the world and has helped established the New York Botanical Garden as a leader in horticultural research. The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory continues to uphold the ideals and traditions from its earliest beginnings and is a tremendous resource for New York City and beyond.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The bill is an effort to enact a shield law at the federal level.\n\nThe bill was introduced to the United States Senate by Sens. Richard Lugar and Chris Dodd in 2007.\nIt was proposed in its current form by Sen. Arlen Specter.\n\nIn October 2007, the Free Flow of Information Act was passed by the United States House of Representatives. However, It was filibustered (failed cloture) on Jul 30, 2008, and withdrawn.\n\nIn the 2007-08 Senate version, it would not act as an unqualified immunity for journalists. Instead, federal judges would be allowed to declare certain news stories as having a public interest based on information obtained from confidential sources during the newsgathering process.\n\nMore than 50 media companies and organizations support the bill. The administration of President George W. Bush opposed it.\nSpeaking to the Associated Press annual meeting in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 2008, Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee for president, said \"Despite concerns I have about the legislation, I have narrowly decided to support it.\"\n\nThere are fears, however, that the act may be adopted in such a way as to exclude people who are not \"professional\" journalists, which would in turn serve to effectively shut down investigative reporting by small and independent media sources.\n\nIn July 2013 the White House was pushing for a federal media shield law, the Free Flow of Information Act, authored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a \"clear and convincing\" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation. The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. \"Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom,\" wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a board member of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \"Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters.\"\n\n"}

He put forward all manner of excuses to explain why clients' money had found its way into his personal account.\n\nThe court found that the question of fitness is a discretionary one. It found, therefore, that Windvogel was not a fit and proper person to be allowed to continue practising as an attorney.\n\nAs to the issue of costs, the applicant sought an order for costs against the respondent on the scale as between an attorney and his own client. A court will not normally direct the precise method of taxation of costs, but will generally order costs to be taxed on a party-and-party or on an attorney-and-client scale.\n\nThe court considered that an attorney-client cost order may be issued after considering the circumstances surrounding the case, the conduct of the losing party and whether the court finds it just to make such an order. The court considered cases from its division in the past in which it had awarded similar costs and held that \"the reason for such a cost order is that the Law Society is a statutory body which obtains its funding from its members and if a member strays to the extent that it becomes necessary for the Law Society to apply for his removal or for his suspension, there is no reason why any of the members of the association to which the respondent belonged should be out of pocket as a result of his conduct.\"\n\nAccordingly, the court ordered costs on an attorney-client basis.\n\nAs to the issue of taxation, the court noted that, before the amount of an attorney-and-client bill can be recovered, it must first be taxed against that latter party. When the other party to the litigation is required to pay costs, the taxation will not be as generous as where an attorney's own client is to pay that attorney's costs.\n\n"}

Often described as \"hairy-faced dwarfs\" in stories, petroglyph illustrations show them with horns on their head and traveling in a group of 5 to 7 per canoe.\n\nNative legends often talk of the little people playing pranks on people, such as singing and then hiding when an inquisitive person searches for the music. It is often said that the little people love children and would take them away from bad or abusive parents or if the child was without parents and left in the woods to fend for themselves.\n\nOther legends say the little people if seen by an adult human would beg them not to say anything of their existence and would reward those who kept their word by helping them and their family out in times of need. From tribe to tribe there are variations of what the little people's mannerisms were like, and whether they were good or evil may be different. \n\nOne of the common beliefs is that the little people create distractions to cause mischief. They were believed to be gods by some. One North American Native tribe believed that they lived in nearby caves. The caves were never entered for fear of disturbing the little people.\n\nLegends of physical remains of tiny people being found in various locations in the western United States, particularly Montana and Wyoming, typically describe the remains as being found in caves with various details such as descriptions that they were \"perfectly formed\", dwarf-size, etc. Archeologist Lawrence L. Loendorf notes that \"The burials, of course, are always sent to a local university or to the Smithsonian for analysis, only to have both the specimens and research results disappear.\" Loendorf also suggests that the discovery of two mummies of anencephalic infants in the first half of the twentieth century with deformities that caused some people to believe they were adults has \"contributed to public belief in the existence of a group of tiny prehistoric people.\"\n\nA graveyard unearthed in the 1830s in Coshocton County, Ohio, was believed to contain skeletons belonging to a pygmy race. In fact, the graves (which were roughly long) were \"bone burials\" containing disarticulated or bent bones packed together.\n\nThe Native American little people have been said to reside in the Pryor Mountains of Montana and Wyoming. The Pryors are famous for their \"fairy rings\" and strange happenings. Some members of the Crow tribe consider the little people to be sacred ancestors and require leaving an offering for them upon entry to the area.\n\n\nOjibwe myths also bring up a creature known as the Memegwaans, or Memegwaanswag (Plural), which seems to be different from the more common Little People variation of Memegwesi. According to Basil Johnson, a Memegwaans is a little person without definitive form which is terrified of adult humans. However, it seems to have a soft spot for children and will often approach in the guise of a child any young person who seems upset, injured, scared or lonely and either protect them or keep them company until help arrives. If an adult sees one, they will often cower on the ground, screaming and crying hysterically before vanishing in the blink of an eye. They were also known as protectors of copper mines & were prayed to almost as patron saints of lost children. This is more specific & different from the Memegwesi, which is often simply described as a short, hairy man. \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19955", "title": "Megatokyo", "text": "Megatokyo\n\nSet in a fictional version of Tokyo, \"Megatokyo\" portrays the adventures of Piro, a young fan of anime and manga, and his friend Largo, an American video game enthusiast. The comic often parodies and comments on the archetypes and clichés of anime, manga, dating sims, arcade and video games, occasionally making direct references to real-world works. \"Megatokyo\" originally emphasized humor, with continuity of the story a subsidiary concern. Over time, it focused more on developing a complex plot and the personalities of its characters. This transition was due primarily to Gallagher's increasing control over the comic, which led to Caston choosing to leave the project. \"Megatokyo\" has received praise from such sources as \"The New York Times\", while negative criticism of Gallagher's changes to the comic has been given by sources including Websnark.\n\n\"Megatokyo\" began publication as a joint project between Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston, along with a few internet acquaintances. Gallagher and Caston later became business partners, as well. According to Gallagher, the comic's first two strips were drawn in reaction to Caston being \"convinced that he and I could do [a webcomic] ... [and] bothering me incessantly about it\", without any planning or pre-determined storyline. The comic's title was derived from an Internet domain owned by Caston, which had hosted a short-lived gaming news site maintained by Caston before the comic's creation. With Caston co-writing the comic's scripts and Gallagher supplying its artwork, the comic's popularity quickly increased, eventually reaching levels comparable to those of such popular webcomics as \"Penny Arcade\" and \"PvP\". According to Gallagher, \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s popularity was not intended, as the project was originally an experiment to help him improve his writing and illustrating skills for his future project, \"Warmth\".\n\nIn May 2002, Caston sold his ownership of the title to Gallagher, who has managed the comic on his own since then. In October of the same year, after Gallagher was laid off from his day job as an architect, he took up producing the comic as a full time profession. Caston's departure from \"Megatokyo\" was not fully explained at the time. Initially, Gallagher and Caston only briefly mentioned the split, with Gallagher publicly announcing Caston's departure on June 17, 2002. On January 15, 2005, Gallagher explained his view of the reasoning behind the split in response to a comment made by Scott Kurtz of \"PvP\", in which he suggested that Gallagher had stolen ownership of \"Megatokyo\" from Caston. Calling Kurtz's claim \"mean spirited\", Gallagher responded:\n\"While things were good at first, over time we found that we were not working well together creatively. There is no fault in this, it happens. I've never blamed Rodney for this creative 'falling out' nor do I blame myself. Not all creative relationships click, ours didn't in the long run.\"\nFour days later, Caston posted his view of the development on his website:\n\"After this he approached me and said either I would sell him my ownership of MegaTokyo or he would simply stop doing it entirely, and we'd divide up the company's assets and end it all.\nThis was right before the MT was to go into print form, and I really wanted to see it make it into print, rather [than] die on the vine.\"\nIn May 2011, it was announced that \"Endgames\" (a gameworld existing within \"Megatokyo\") was being revamped in a light novel format, with a story written by webfiction author Thomas Knapp, with four light novels planned. A short story \"Behind the Masque\" was also announced, and released on Amazon's Kindle Store on June 10, 2011.\n\n\"Megatokyo\" is usually hand-drawn in pencil by Fred Gallagher, without any digital or physical \"inking\". Inking was originally planned, but dropped as Gallagher decided it was unfeasible. \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first strips were created by roughly sketching on large sheets of paper, followed by tracing, scanning, digital clean-up of the traced comics with Adobe Photoshop, and final touches in Adobe Illustrator to achieve a finished product. Gallagher has stated that tracing was necessary because his sketches were not neat enough to use before tracing. Because of the tracing necessary, these comics regularly took six to eight hours to complete. As the comic progressed, Gallagher became able to draw \"cleaner\" comics without rough lines and tracing lines, and was able to abandon the tracing step. Gallagher believes \"that this eventually led to better looking and more expressive comics\".\n\n\"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s early strips were laid out in four square panels per strip, in a two-by-two square array – a formatting choice made as a compromise between the horizontal layout of American comic strips and the vertical layout of Japanese comic strips. The limitations of this format became apparent during the first year of \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication, and in the spring of 2001, the comic switched to a manga-style, free-form panel layout. This format allowed for both large, detailed drawings and small, abstract progressions, as based on the needs of the script. Gallagher has commented that his drawing speed had increased since the comic's beginning, and with four panel comics taking much less time to produce, it \"made sense in some sort of twisted, masochistic way, that [he] could use that extra time to draw more for each comic\".\n\n\"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s earliest strips were drawn entirely on single sheets of paper. Following these, Gallagher began drawing the comic's panels separately and assembling them in Adobe Illustrator, allowing him to draw more detailed frames. This changed during \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s eighth chapter, with Gallagher returning to drawing entire comics on single sheets of paper. Gallagher stated that this change allowed for more differentiated layouts, in addition to allowing him a better sense of momentum during comic creation.\n\nThe strip is currently drawn on inkjet paper in pencil, the text and speech being added later with Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. In March 2009 he began Fredarting, a streaming live video feed of the comic being drawn.\n\nGallagher occasionally has guest artists participate in the production of the comic, including Mohammad F. Haque of \"Applegeeks\".\n\n\"Megatokyo\" has had several sources of funding during its production. In its early years, it was largely funded by Gallagher and Caston's full time jobs, with the additional support of banner advertisements. A store connected to ThinkGeek was launched during October 2000 in order to sell \"Megatokyo\" merchandise, and, in turn, help fund the comic. On August 1, 2004, this store was replaced by \"Megagear\", an independent online store created by Fred Gallagher and his wife, Sarah, to be used solely by \"Megatokyo\", although it now also offers \"Applegeeks\" and \"Angerdog\" merchandise.\n\nGallagher has emphasized that \"Megatokyo\" will continue to remain on the Internet free of charge, and that releasing it in book form is simply another way for the comic to reach readers, as opposed to replacing its webcomic counterpart entirely. Additionally, he has stated that he is against micropayments, as he believes that word of mouth and public attention are powerful property builders, and that a \"pay-per-click\" system would only dampen their effectiveness. He has claimed that such systems are a \"superior\" option to direct monetary compensation, and that human nature is opposed to micropayments.\n\nMuch of \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s early humor consists of jokes related to the video game subculture, as well as culture-clash issues. In these early strips, the comic progressed at a pace which Gallagher has called \"haphazard\", often interrupted by purely punchline-driven installments. As Gallagher gradually gained more control over \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s production, the comic began to gain more similarities to the Japanese shōjo manga that Gallagher enjoys. Following Gallagher's complete takeover of \"Megatokyo\", the comic's thematic relation to Japanese manga continued to grow.\n\nThe comic features characteristics borrowed from anime and manga archetypes, often parodying the medium's clichés. Examples include Junpei, a ninja who becomes Largo's apprentice; Rent-a-zillas, giant monsters based on Godzilla; the Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division, which fights the monsters with giant robots and supervises the systematic destruction and reconstruction of predesignated areas of the city; fan service; a Japanese school girl, Yuki, who has also started being a magical girl in recent comics; and Ping, a robot girl. In addition, Dom and Ed, hitmen employed by Sega and Sony, respectively, are associated with a Japanese stereotype that all Americans are heavily armed.\n\nCharacters in \"Megatokyo\" usually speak Japanese, although some speak English, or English-based l33t. Typically, when a character is speaking Japanese, it is signified by enclosing English text between angle brackets (<>). Not every character speaks every language, so occasionally characters are unable to understand one another. In several scenes (such as this one), a character's speech is written entirely in rōmaji Japanese to emphasize this.\n\n\"Megatokyo\" is divided into chapters. Chapter 0, which contains all of the comic's early phase, covers a time span in the comic of about six weeks. Each of the subsequent chapters chronicles the events of a single day. Chapter 0 was originally not given a title, although the book version retroactively dubbed it \"Relax, we understand j00.\" Between the chapters, and occasionally referenced in the main comic, are a number of omake.\n\nPiro, the protagonist, is an author surrogate of Fred Gallagher. Gallagher has stated that Piro is an idealized version of himself when he was in college. As a character, he is socially inept and frequently depressed. His design was originally conceived as a visual parody of the character Ruri Hoshino, from the \"Martian Successor Nadesico\" anime series. His name is derived from Gallagher's online nickname, which was in turn taken from Makoto Sawatari's cat in the Japanese visual novel \"Kanon\".\n\nIn the story, Piro has extreme difficulty understanding \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s female characters, making him for the most part ignorant of the feelings that the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he has become much more aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.\n\nLargo is the comic's secondary protagonist, and the comic version of co-creator Rodney Caston. An impulsive alcoholic whose speech is rendered in L33t frequently, he serves as one of the primary sources of comic relief. A technologically gifted character, he is obsessed with altering devices, often with hazardous results. Gallagher designed Largo to be the major recipient of the comic's physical damage. Largo's name comes from Caston's online nickname, which refers to the villain from \"Bubblegum Crisis\". For various reasons (including fire and battle damage) he often ends up wearing very little clothing. Largo seems to have awkwardly blundered into a relatively successful relationship with Hayasaka Erika at the current time in the comic.\n\n is a strong-willed, cynical, and sometimes violent character. At the time of the story, she is a former popular Japanese idol (singer) and voice actress who has been out of the spotlight for three years, though she still possesses a considerable fanbase. Erika's past relationship troubles, combined with exposure to swarms of fanboys, have caused her to adopt a negative outlook on life. Gallagher has implied that her personality was loosely based on the \"tsundere\" (tough girl) stereotype often seen in anime and manga.\n\n is a Japanese girl who previously worked as a waitress at an Anna Miller's restaurant, and is Piro's romantic interest. At the current point in the story, she is a voice actress for the possibly-failing Lockart game \"Sight\", playing the main heroine, Kannazuki Kotone. Kimiko is a kind and soft-spoken character, though she is prone to mood-swings, and often causes herself embarrassment by saying things she does not mean. Gallagher has commented that Kimiko was the only female character not based entirely on anime stereotypes.\n\n is an enigmatic and manipulative young goth girl. She is drawn to resemble a \"Gothic Lolita\", and is often described as \"darkly cute,\" with Gallagher occasionally describing her as a \"perkigoth.\" Miho often acts strangely compared to the comic's other characters, and regularly accomplishes abnormal feats, such as leaping inhuman distances or perching herself atop telephone poles. Despite these displays of ability, it is hinted at that Miho has problems with her health. Little is revealed in the comic about Miho's past or motivations, although Gallagher states that these will eventually be explained. Largo believes that she (Miho) is the queen of the undead, and is the cause of the zombie invasion of Tokyo. It has been hinted that she is a magical girl who may have some past connection with the zombies. She is apparently killed in a robotic beam attack by Ed, but nine days later is found in the hospital reading and eating with no obvious signs of physical damage. More possibilities exist that she is some type of game prototype or archetype.\n\n\"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story begins when Piro and Largo fly to Tokyo after an incident at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Piro has the proper paperwork; Largo must beat the ninja Junpei at a video game to enter. After a spending spree, the pair are stranded without enough money to buy plane tickets home, forcing them to live with Tsubasa, a Japanese friend of Piro's. When Tsubasa suddenly departs for America to seek his \"first true love\", the protagonists are forced out of the apartment. Tsubasa leaves Ping, a robot girl PlayStation 2 accessory, in their care. This leads to old friends of Piro and Largo showing up later. The two are shadow operatives for video game companies, Ed (Sony) and Dom (SEGA).\n\nAt one point, Piro, confronted with girl troubles, visits the local bookstore to \"research\"—look in the vast shelves of shoujo manga for a solution to his problem. A spunky schoolgirl, Sonoda Yuki, and her friends, Asako and Mami, see him sitting amidst piles of read manga, and ask him what he is doing. Piro, flustered, runs away, accidentally leaving behind his bookbag and sketchbook.\n\nAfter their eviction, Piro begins work at \"Megagamers\", a store specializing in anime, manga, and video games. His employer allows him and Largo to live in the apartment above the store. Largo is mistaken for the new English teacher at a local school, where he takes on the alias \"Great Teacher Largo\" and instructs his students in L33t, video games, and about computers. Yuki's father, Inspector Sonada Masamichi of the \"Tokyo Police Cataclysm Division\" (TPCD) hires Largo after Largo manipulates Ping into stopping a rampaging monster, the drunken turtle Gameru.\n\nAs Largo is working at the local high school, Piro encounters Yuki again while working at Megagamers, when she returns his bookbag and sketchbook, scribbled all over with comments about his drawings. She then, to his consternation, asks if he would give her drawing lessons. Piro, flustered, agrees, and promptly forgets about them.\n\nEarlier in the story, Piro had seen Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, where she is a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro encounters Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered the next time they meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy to get rid of all cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.\n\nMeanwhile, Largo develops a relationship with Hayasaka Erika, Piro's coworker at Megagamers. She and Kimiko share a house. As with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story. Later, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fiancé left her. When she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it. He then offers to help Erika to deal with her \"vulnerabilities in the digital plane\". Erika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building. This leads into a little more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.\n\nThe enigmatic Tohya Miho frequently meddles in the lives of the protagonists. Miho knows Piro and Largo from the \"Endgames\" MMORPG previous to \"Megatokyo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot. She abused a hidden statistic in the game to gain control of nearly all of the game's player characters, but was ultimately defeated by Piro and Largo. In the comic, Miho becomes close friends with Ping, influencing Ping's relationship with Piro and pitting Ping against Largo in video game battles. Miho is also involved in Erika's backstory; Miho manipulated Erika's fans after Erika's disappearance. This effort ended badly, leaving Miho hospitalized, and the TPCD cleaning up the aftermath. Most of the exact details of what happened are left to the readers' imagination, as are her current motivations and ultimate goal. Miho and many of the events surrounding her involve a club in Harajuku, the Cave of Evil (CoE).\n\nAfter getting yelled at for retaining her waitress job, Kimiko quits her voice acting job and goes home to find Erika assembling a new computer in her undergarments. Not long after Erika tells Kimiko to strip, Piro comes by, who she tells to get undressed as well. While Erika and Piro talk about her, Kimiko, who hid when Piro showed up, runs out of the apartment. Kimiko runs into Ping, who wanted to talk to Piro about why, after an explosion at school, she had started to cry uncontrollably. They encounter Largo at the store, who explains what went wrong, although no one knows what he means until Piro comes in and translates. Ping is relieved to know that she won't shut down and Kimiko hugs Piro and apologizes for her actions. Largo leaves for Erika's apartment after she calls looking for help. That night, while Piro and Kimiko fall asleep watching TV, Erika, who finished the computer with Largo's help, tries to seduce Largo, but it freaks him out and he runs out for home. The next morning, after Kimiko departs, Piro finds out she quit her voice acting job and tries to find her.\n\nKimiko and Miho are in the same diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has disrupted his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko. After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation about that as the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone. Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, \"Sight\". Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.\n\nLargo and Yuki, who has since been revealed along the way to be a magical girl like her mother Meimi (likewise revealed), steal a Rent-a-Zilla to fight the zombie outbreak. Largo leaves Yuki to help Piro get to Kimiko. Unfortunately, the Rent-a-Zilla gets bitten by zombies and turns into one itself, resulting in the TPCD capturing it. Yuki protects it from the TPCD, teleports it out of the area, and adopts it as a pet in a miniaturized form, all much to her father's chagrin.\n\nAfter the event, Erika, Largo, Kimiko and Piro are reunited, and they talk a bit with Miho, who has shown up again after storming out following an argument with Kenji earlier. Miho declines an offer to eat with the group and wanders off thinking about games and Largo and Piro. She is shown walking amongst the zombies and then in Ed's gun-sights, and in the center of an attack by a number of Ed's Kill-Bots.\n\nDuring the next nine days, Piro and Kimiko have made up and Kimiko returned to both of her jobs, with them seeing little of each other. Largo and Erika are shown to likewise be involved but more often, including going to dinner with the Sonoda family, as the inspector's brother was Erika's fiancé. Kimiko is attempting to get Piro working as an artist on \"Sight\", which unbeknownst to them is now being funded by Dom. Ping is concerned about the whereabouts of Miho, who hasn't been seen during the time, but Piro is still upset about all that has happened and somewhat evasively refuses direct assistance. Ping and Junko, another one of Largo's students, who used to be a friend of Miho, work towards finding Miho. Yuki and Kobayashi Yutaka then also become involved with the attempt because of this. That night, Piro and Kimiko discuss Miho and \"Endgames\", which Yuki overhears, they unaware she is there. This leads Yuki to appropriate Piro's powerless laptop and leave, believing him to still be in love with Miho and that the device might hold clues to finding her. Kimiko and Piro work on his portfolio for \"Sight\" and then they say goodnight and leave. He returns to his apartment, but Kimiko goes to the CoE club using a pass Miho gave her long ago in the beginning. Once at the club, Dom mockingly advises her, Yuki unknowingly whisps past her, and she unexpectedly meets up with an old friend Komugiko. During all this, Piro has left his apartment after looking at his sketchbook and a drawing of Miho. His current location is unknown.\n\nAside from Kimiko, concurrent overlapping events have led to almost every main character converging upon the club for various reasons involving Miho, or in support of others involved. Ed, attempting to destroy Ping, fights with Largo, as the staff of the club have maneuvered Ed and Ping into the protective radius of ex-Idol Erika. Yuki and Yutaka get Piro's laptop powered on, she reads the old chat logs between Piro and Miho, and follows instructions from her to him. Going to a \"hidden-in-plain-sight\" hospital room, she finds Miho alive and well, although seemingly in a weakened state. During a heated argument and Miho's goading, Yuki then forcibly moves Miho to the club. Shortly after the arrival of the two in the center of everyone, the bulk of the denizens go into trance-like states while others are fighting or confused about what to do next. Miho appears to be collapsing. Upon instructions from Erika, Largo finds then uses his Largo-Phone and the club's sound system to knock out power in the immediate area of the club. During this event, Piro has gone to visit Miho at the \"hospital\" room, where he discovers that she is missing. Following the blackout, Largo, Erika, and Miho board a train, where Miho decides to return home. However, a large crowd has blocked her path home, apparently waiting for someone's return.\n\nThe next morning, Piro has been brought to jail, where he has been interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is obtained through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell. Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment. Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events. She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to \"build a 'real' me\", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and how crazy it was. Largo and Erika, who are riding on the roof of a train in the Miyagi prefecture also call during the conversation. After a short conversation with both Largo and Erika on the phone, and a bit more conversation with Miho, Piro instructs her to stay in the apartment until they can figure out what to do. Junko and Ping are shown leaving for school, with Junko seeming taking Ed's shotguns from last night with her.\n\nAfter receiving a phone call from Yutaka, whom Masamichi initially disapproves of, Yuki, who has not changed clothing from the events of the previous chapter, leaves her house, grabs him, and takes him to a rooftop, where they try to explain things after Yutaka was being questioned by Asako and Mami. She goes over everything, even why she referred to herself as a \"monster\", which Yuki's friends previously overheard and misunderstood. Realizing that Miho is the cause of this mess, Yutaka indirectly vows revenge, but Yuki stops him. Yutaka goes anyway and meets his brother in front of Megagamers, who has tracked Miho to the store since the previous night. Yutaka's brother is a member of a group of Nanasawa fans who plan to intervene and remind Piro who his true love is to get rid of Miho. However, Dom's van is blocking the store's entrance. Though Yuki protests against intervention to the group, Dom, who is unknown to them, performs his own method of intervention anyway and forces Piro to choose between Nanasawa and Miho. It is currently unknown if Dom knows who Miho is, but Miho, in a disguise, overhears the conversation and forces Piro to briefly wear a hat. At the same time, Yuki, deciding that she can wait no longer, steals Dom's van and guns, and rushes into the store with Yutaka in tow. Seeing this, Miho grabs Piro and rushes upstairs, discarding the hat in the process. Yuki subsequently collides with the hat and a presumed explosion occurs, stalling Yuki and Yutaka. Miho and Piro don cosplay outfits as a disguise, escape, and make their way to the local bath house. Just before Yuki grabs Yutaka again, Dom, now trapped under a pile of rubble, expresses his condolences to Yutaka, to which he does not understand. The pair quickly follow Miho and Piro and await for them to leave the bath house.\n\n\"Megatokyo\" was first published in print by Studio Ironcat, a partnership announced in September 2002. Following this, the first book, a compilation of \"Megatokyo\" strips under the title \"Megatokyo Volume One: Chapter Zero\", was released by Studio Ironcat in January 2003. According to Gallagher, Studio Ironcat was unable to meet demand for the book, due to problems the company was facing at the time. On July 7, 2003, Gallagher announced that Ironcat would not continue to publish \"Megatokyo\" in book form. This was followed by an announcement on August 27, 2003 that Dark Horse Comics would publish \"Megatokyo Volume 2\" and future collected volumes, including a revised edition of \"Megatokyo Volume 1\". The comic once more changed publishers in February 2006, moving from Dark Horse Comics to the CMX Manga imprint of DC Comics. The comic then transferred to CMX's parent Wildstorm, with its last volume published in July 2010.\nCMX, along with Wildstorm closed down in 2010. Former publisher Dark Horse regained the rights to the series and planned to release it in omnibus format in January 2013, but didn't.\n\n, six volumes are available for purchase: volumes 1 through 3 from Dark Horse, volumes 4 and 5 by CMX/DC, and volume 6 by Wildstorm. The books have also been translated into German, Italian, French, and Polish. In July 2004, \"Megatokyo\" was the tenth best-selling manga property in the United States, and during the week ending February 20, 2005, volume 3 ranked third in the Nielsen BookScan figures, which was not only its highest ranking to date (), but also made it the highest monthly rank for an original English-language manga title.\n\nIn July 2007, Kodansha announced that in 2008 it intends to publish \"Megatokyo\" in a Japanese-language edition, (in a silver slipcased box as part of Kodansha Box editions, a new manga line started in November 2006). Depending on reader response, Kodansha hoped to subsequently publish the entire \"Megatokyo\" book series. The first volume was released in Japan on May 7, 2009.\n\nThe artwork and characterizations of \"Megatokyo\" have received praise from such publications as \"The New York Times\" and Comics Bulletin. Many critics praise \"Megatokyo\"s character designs and pencil work, rendered entirely in grayscale; conversely, it has been criticized for perceived uniformity and simplicity in the designs of its peripheral characters, which have been regarded as confusing and difficult to tell apart due to their similar appearances.\n\nSome critics, such as Eric Burns of Websnark, have found the comic to suffer from \"incredibly slow pacing\" (, only about 2 months of in-universe time have elapsed), unclear direction or resolutions for plot threads, a lack of official character profiles and plot summaries for the uninitiated, and an erratic update schedule. Burns also harshly criticized the often uncanonical filler material Gallagher employs to prevent the comic's front page content from becoming stagnant, such as \"Shirt Guy Dom\", a punchline-driven stick figure comic strip written and illustrated by \"Megatokyo\" editor Dominic Nguyen. Following Gallagher taking on \"Megatokyo\" as a full-time occupation, some critics have complained that updates should be more frequent than when he worked on the comic part time. Update schedule issues prompted Gallagher to install an update progress bar for readers awaiting the next installment of the comic; however, it has since been removed as it itself often wasn't updated.\n\nIGN called \"Megatokyo\"'s fans \"some of the most patient and forgiving in the webcomic world.\" During an interview, Gallagher stated that \"Megatokyo\" fans \"always [tell him] they are patient and find that the final comics are always worth the wait,\" but he feels as though he \"[has] a commitment to [his] readers and to [himself] to deliver the best comics [he] can, and to do it on schedule,\" finally saying that nothing would make him happier than \"[getting] a better handle on the time it takes to create each page.\" Upon missing deadlines, Gallagher often makes self-disparaging comments. Poking fun at this, Jerry \"Tycho\" Holkins of \"Penny Arcade\" has claimed to have \"gotten on famously\" with Gallagher, ever since he \"figured out that [Gallagher] legitimately detests himself and is not hoisting some kind of \"glamour\".\"\n\nWhile \"Megatokyo\" was originally presented as a slapstick comedy, it began focusing more on the romantic relationships between its characters after Caston's departure from the project. As a result, some fans, preferring the comic's gag-a-day format, have claimed its quality was superior when Caston was writing it. Additionally, it has been said that, without Caston's input, Largo's antics appear contrived. Comics Bulletin regards \"Megatokyo\"'s characters as convincingly portrayed, commenting that \"the reader truly feels connected to the characters, their romantic hijinks, and their wacky misadventures with the personal touches supplied by the author.\" Likewise, Anime News Network has praised the personal tone in which the comic is written, stating that much of its appeal is a result of the \"friendly and casual feeling of a fan-made production.\"\n\nGallagher states early in \"Megatokyo Volume 1\" that he and Caston \"didn't want the humor ... to rely too heavily on what might be considered 'obscure knowledge.'\" An article in \"The New York Times\" insists that such scenarios were unavoidable, commenting that the comic \"sits at the intersection of several streams of obscure knowledge,\" including \"gaming and hacking; manga ... the boom in Web comics over the past few years; and comics themselves.\" The article also held that \"Gallagher doesn't mean to be exclusive ... he graciously offers translation of the strip's later occasional lapses into l33t ... [and] explains why the characters are occasionally dressed in knickers or as rabbits.\" The newspaper went on to argue that \"The pleasure of a story like \"Megatokyo\" comes not in its novelistic coherence, but in its loose ranginess.\"\n\n\"Megatokyo\" was nominated in at least one category of the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards every year from 2001 through 2007. It won Best Comic in 2002, as well as Best Writing, Best Serial Comic, and Best Dramatic Comic. The largest number of nominations it has received in one year is 14 in 2003, when it won Outstanding Environment Design. The series tied with Svetlana Chmakova's \"Dramacon\" for the 2007 Best Continuing OEL Manga.\n\n"}

Brown attended the City of London School and started to collect stamps in around 1860.\n\nMount Brown published his \"Catalogue of British, Colonial, and Foreign Postage Stamps\" in May 1862, just weeks after Frederick Booty published his catalogue in April 1862, however, Brown's catalogue was more successful and reckoned to be more complete. Unlike Booty, Brown's catalogue was unillustrated. Others, such as Dr. Viner, may already have prepared unpublished hand-written lists of stamps. Brown's catalogue was more successful than Booty's and went through 7500 copies and five editions up to 1864.\n\nBrown largely compiled his catalogue in the Rectory of All Hallows Staining, and he believed that the church there was the one mentioned by Charles Dickens in \"Dombey & Son\". Mount Brown had a collection of about 400 stamps but was able to list 1200 different types in his first catalogue with the help of a group of like-minded collectors who met on Saturday afternoons to pool their knowledge. These included Dr. Charles W. Viner, Henry Haslett, Frederick Philbrick, William Hughes-Hughes, Sir Daniel Cooper and the Rev. Francis J. Stainforth. The Rev. Stainforth in particular was said to have had a very fine collection which largely formed the basis for Brown's catalogue.\n\nThe catalogue was quickly plagiarised, by John Kline, writing as A.C. Kline, in 1862, and by W.H. Wright writing as \"A Collector\" in 1863. According to \"The Stamp Collectors Magazine\", Brown was well aware of the plagiarism and had arranged for all copies of Wright's work to be surrendered to him for destruction. He had also taken steps to prevent the introduction of Kline's work to Great Britain.\n\nAddenda to the catalogue were published in \"The Stamp Collector's Magazine\", of which Mr Viner was editor 1863-67, and revisions to the format of the catalogue took place in the third edition, following contact between Mount Brown and Dr. Gray of the British Museum. The number of stamps listed also expanded and details of forgeries began to be included.\n\nAs well as catalogues, a stamp album was available, billed as \"Mount Brown's Postage-Stamp or Crest Album\", price seven and a half shillings, and lists of unused postage stamps.\n\nBy 1870 Brown's philatelic business was so great that he was forced to choose between it and his normal profession. He chose to give up philately but retained an interest, visiting the Junior Philatelic Society's exhibition in 1908 where he met Fred Melville.\n\nThe small group who met at \"All Hallows Staining\" formed the nucleus of what became \"The Philatelic Society, London\", which eventually became the Royal Philatelic Society London. Mount Brown was not a member of \"The Philatelic Society\", possibly because it was open only to amateurs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "227018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227018", "title": "Open standard", "text": "Open standard\n\nAn open standard is a standard that is publicly available and has various rights to use associated with it, and may also have various properties of how it was designed (e.g. open process). There is no single definition and interpretations vary with usage.\n\nThe terms \"open\" and \"standard\" have a wide range of meanings associated with their usage. There are a number of definitions of open standards which emphasize different aspects of openness, including the openness of the resulting specification, the openness of the drafting process, and the ownership of rights in the standard. The term \"standard\" is sometimes restricted to technologies approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis.\n\nThe definitions of the term \"open standard\" used by academics, the European Union and some of its member governments or parliaments such as Denmark, France, and Spain preclude open standards requiring fees for use, as do the New Zealand, South African and the Venezuelan governments. On the standard organisation side, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) ensures that its specifications can be implemented on a royalty-free basis.\n\nMany definitions of the term \"standard\" permit patent holders to impose \"reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing\" royalty fees and other licensing terms on implementers or users of the standard. For example, the rules for standards published by the major internationally recognized standards bodies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and ITU-T permit their standards to contain specifications whose implementation will require payment of patent licensing fees. Among these organizations, only the IETF and ITU-T explicitly refer to their standards as \"open standards\", while the others refer only to producing \"standards\". The IETF and ITU-T use definitions of \"open standard\" that allow \"reasonable and non-discriminatory\" patent licensing fee requirements.\n\nThere are those in the open-source software community who hold that an \"open standard\" is only open if it can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. While open standards or architectures are considered non-proprietary in the sense that the standard is either unowned or owned by a collective body, it can still be publicly shared and not tightly guarded. The typical example of “open source” that has become a standard is the personal computer originated by IBM and now referred to as Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessor. There are three others that are most widely accepted as “open” which include the GSM phones (adopted as a government standard), Open Group which promotes UNIX and the like, and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which created the first standards of SMTP and TCP/IP. Buyers tend to prefer open standards which they believe offer them cheaper products and more choice for access due to network effects and increased competition between vendors.\n\nOpen standards which specify formats are sometimes referred to as open formats.\n\nMany specifications that are sometimes referred to as standards are proprietary and only available under restrictive contract terms (if they can be obtained at all) from the organization that owns the copyright on the specification. As such these specifications are not considered to be fully \"open\". Joel West has argued that \"open\" standards are not black and white but have many different levels of \"openness\". Ultimately a standard needs to be open enough that it will become adopted and accepted in the market, but still closed enough that firms can get a return on their investment in developing the technology around the standard. A more open standard tends to occur when the knowledge of the technology becomes dispersed enough that competition is increased and others are able to start copying the technology as they implement it. This occurred with the Wintel architecture as others were able to start imitating the software. Less open standards exist when a particular firm has much power (not ownership) over the standard, which can occur when a firm’s platform “wins” in standard setting or the market makes one platform most popular.\n\nOn August 12, 2012, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Internet Society (ISOC), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB), jointly affirmed a set of principles which have contributed to the exponential growth of the Internet and related technologies. The “OpenStand Principles” define open standards and establish the building blocks for innovation. Standards developed using the OpenStand principles are developed through an open, participatory process, support interoperability, foster global competition, are voluntarily adopted on a global level and serve as building blocks for products and services targeted to meet the needs of markets and consumers. This drives innovation which, in turn, contributes to the creation of new markets and the growth and expansion of existing markets.\n\nThere are five, key OpenStand Principles, as outlined below:\n\n1. Cooperation\nRespectful cooperation between standards organizations, whereby each respects the autonomy, integrity, processes, and intellectual property rules of the others.\n\n2. Adherence to Principles - Adherence to the five fundamental principles of standards development, namely\n\n\n3. Collective Empowerment\nCommitment by affirming standards organizations and their participants to collective empowerment by striving for standards that:\n\n\n4. Availability\nStandards specifications are made accessible to all for implementation and deployment. Affirming standards organizations have defined procedures to develop specifications that can be implemented under fair terms. Given market diversity, fair terms may vary from royalty-free to fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND).\n\n5. Voluntary Adoption\nStandards are voluntarily adopted and success is determined by the market.\n\nThe ITU-T is a standards development organization (SDO) that is one of the three sectors of the International Telecommunications Union (a specialized agency of the United Nations). The ITU-T has a Telecommunication Standardization Bureau director's \"Ad Hoc\" group on IPR that produced the following definition in March 2005, which the ITU-T as a whole has endorsed for its purposes since November 2005:\n\nThe ITU-T, ITU-R, ISO, and IEC have harmonized on a common patent policy under the banner of the WSC. However, the ITU-T definition should not necessarily be considered also applicable in ITU-R, ISO and IEC contexts, since the Common Patent Policy \ndoes not make any reference to \"open standards\" but rather only to \"standards.\"\n\nIn section 7 of its RFC 2026, the IETF classifies specifications that have been developed in a manner similar to that of the IETF itself as being \"open standards,\" and lists the standards produced by ANSI, ISO, IEEE, and ITU-T as examples. As the IETF standardization processes and IPR policies have the characteristics listed above by ITU-T, the IETF standards fulfill the ITU-T definition of \"open standards.\"\n\nHowever, the IETF has not adopted a specific definition of \"open standard\"; both RFC 2026 and the IETF's mission statement (RFC 3935) talks about \"open process,\" but RFC 2026 does not define \"open standard\" except for the purpose of defining what documents IETF standards can link to.\n\nRFC 2026 belongs to a set of RFCs collectively known as BCP 9 (Best Common Practice, an IETF policy).\nRFC 2026 was later updated by BCP 78 and 79 (among others). As of 2011 BCP 78 is RFC 5378 (Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust), and BCP 79 consists of RFC 3979 (Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology) and a clarification in RFC 4879. The changes are intended to be compatible with the \"Simplified BSD License\" as stated in the IETF Trust Legal Provisions and Copyright FAQ based on RFC 5377.\n\nIn August 2012, the IETF combined with the W3C and IEEE to launch OpenStand and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\". The declaration is then published in the form of RFC 6852 in January 2013.\n\nThe European Union defined the term for use within its European Interoperability Framework for Pan-European eGovernment Services, Version 1.0 although it does not claim to be a universal definition for all European Union use and documentation.\nTo reach interoperability in the context of pan-European eGovernment services, guidance needs to focus on open standards.\nThe word \"open\" is here meant in the sense of fulfilling the following requirements:\n\nThe Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium (NCOIC) defines open standard as the following:\nSpecifications for hardware and/or software that are publicly available implying that multiple vendors can compete directly based on the features and performance of their products. It also implies that the existing open system can be removed and replaced with that of another vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption.\nThe Danish government has attempted to make a definition of open standards, \nwhich also is used in pan-European software development projects. It states:\nThe French Parliament approved a definition of \"open standard\" in its \"Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy.\" The definition is:\n\nA clear Royalty Free stance and far reaching requirements case is the one for India's Government \n4.1 Mandatory Characteristics\nAn Identified Standard will qualify as an “Open Standard”, if it meets the following criteria:\n\nItaly has a general rule for the entire public sector dealing with Open Standards, although concentrating on data formats, in Art. 68 of the Code of the Digital Administration (\"Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale\")\n\n[applications must] allow representation of data under different formats, at least one being an open data format.\n\n[it is defined] an open data format, a data format which is made public, is thoroughly documented and neutral with regard to the technological tools needed to peruse the same data.\nA Law passed by the Spanish Parliament requires that all electronic services provided by the Spanish public administration must be based on open standards. It defines an open standard as royalty free, according to the following definition:\nAn open standard fulfills the following conditions:\nThe Venezuelan Government approved a \"free software and open standards law.\" \nThe decree includes the requirement that the Venezuelan public sector must use free software based on open standards, and includes a definition of open standard:\nArticle 2: for the purposes of this Decree, it shall be understood as \nk) Open standards: technical specifications, published and controlled by an organization in charge of their development, that have been accepted by the industry, available to everybody for their implementation in free software or other [type of software], promoting competitivity, interoperability and flexibility.\nThe South African Government approved a definition in the \"Minimum Interoperability Operating Standards Handbook\" (MIOS).\n\nFor the purposes of the MIOS, a standard shall be considered open if it meets all of these criteria. There are standards which we are obliged to adopt for pragmatic reasons which do not necessarily fully conform to being open in all respects. In such cases, where an open standard does not yet exist, the degree of openness will be taken into account when selecting an appropriate standard:\n\n\nThe E-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) defines open standard as royalty free according to the following text:\nWhile a universally agreed definition of \"open standards\" is unlikely to be\nresolved in the near future, the e-GIF accepts that a definition of “open standards”\nneeds to recognise a continuum that ranges from closed to open, and encompasses\nvarying degrees of \"openness.\" To guide readers in this respect, the e-GIF\nendorses \"open standards\" that exhibit the following properties:\n\n\nThe e-GIF performs the same function in e-government as the Road Code does on\nthe highways. Driving would be excessively costly, inefficient, and ineffective if\nroad rules had to be agreed each time one vehicle encountered another.\nOne of the most popular definitions of the term \"open standard,\" as measured by Google ranking, is the one developed by Bruce Perens.\nHis definition lists a set of principles that he believes must be met by an open standard:\n\n\nVijay Kapoor, national technology officer, Microsoft, defines what open standards are as follows:\nLet's look at what an open standard means: 'open' refers to it being royalty-free, while 'standard' means a technology approved by formalized committees that are open to participation by all interested parties and operate on a consensus basis. An open standard is publicly available, and developed, approved and maintained via a collaborative and consensus driven process.\nOverall, Microsoft's relationship to open standards was, at best, mixed. While Microsoft participated in the most significant standard-setting organizations that establish open standards, it was often seen as oppositional to their adoption.\n\nThe Open Source Initiative defines the requirements and criteria for open standards as follows:\n\nThe Requirement\n\nAn \"open standard\" must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.\n\nThe Criteria\n\nTo comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an \"open standard\" must satisfy the following criteria. If an \"open standard\" does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.\n\n\nKen Krechmer identifies ten \"rights\":\n\n\nAs an important provider of Web technology ICT Standards, notably XML, http, HTML, CSS and WAI, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) follows a process that promotes the development of high-quality standards.\n\nLooking at the end result, the spec alone, up for adoption, is not enough. The participative/inclusive process leading to a particular design, and the supporting resources available with it should be accounted when we talk about Open Standards:\nIn August 2012, the W3C combined with the IETF and IEEE to launch OpenStand and to publish The Modern Paradigm for Standards. This captures \"the effective and efficient standardization processes that have made the Internet and Web the premiere platforms for innovation and borderless commerce\".\n\nThe Digital Standards Organization (DIGISTAN) states that \"an open standard must be aimed at creating unrestricted competition between vendors and unrestricted choice for users.\" Its brief definition of \"open standard\" (or \"free and open standard\") is \"a published specification that is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle.\" Its more complete definition as follows:\n\nA key defining property is that an open standard is immune to vendor capture at all stages in its life-cycle. Immunity from vendor capture makes it possible to improve upon, trust, and extend an open standard over time.\"\nThis definition is based on the EU's EIF v1 definition of \"open standard,\" but with changes to address what it terms as \"vendor capture.\" They believe that \"Many groups and individuals have provided definitions for 'open standard' that reflect their economic interests in the standards process. We see that the fundamental conflict is between vendors who seek to capture markets and raise costs, and the market at large, which seeks freedom and lower costs... Vendors work hard to turn open standards into franchise standards. They work to change the statutory language so they can cloak franchise standards in the sheep's clothing of 'open standard.' A robust definition of \"free and open standard\" must thus take into account the direct economic conflict between vendors and the market at large.\"\n\nThe Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) uses a definition which is based on the European Interoperability Framework v.1, and was extended after consultation with industry and community stakeholders. FSFE's standard has been adopted by groups such as the SELF EU Project, the 2008 Geneva Declaration on Standards and the Future of the Internet, and international Document Freedom Day teams.\n\nAccording to this definition an Open Standard is a format or protocol that is:\n\n\nThe Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure's definition is said to coincide with the definition issued in the European Interoperability Framework released in 2004.\nA specification that is public, the standard is inclusive and it has been developed and is maintained in an open standardization process, everybody can implement it without any restriction, neither payment, to license the IPR (granted to everybody for free and without any condition). This is the minimum license terms asked by standardization bodies as W3C. Of course, all the other bodies accept open standards. But specification itself could cost a fair amount of money (ie. 100-400Eur per copy as in ISO because copyright and publication of the document itself). \n\nThe UK government's definition of open standards applies to software interoperability, data and document formats. The criteria for open standards are published in the “Open Standards Principles” policy paper and are as follows.\n\nNote that because the various definitions of \"open standard\" differ in their requirements, the standards listed below may not be open by every definition.\n\n\nDiSEqC is an open standard, no license is required or royalty is to be paid to the rightholder EUTELSAT.\nDiSEqC is a trademark of EUTELSAT.\nConditions for use of the trademark and the DiSEqC can be obtained from EUTELSAT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 the controversy about using reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) licensing for the use of patented technology in web standards increased. Bruce Perens, important associations as FSF or FFII and others have argued that the use of patents restricts who can implement a standard to those able or willing to pay for the use of the patented technology. The requirement to pay some small amount per user, is often an insurmountable problem for free/open source software implementations which can be redistributed by anyone. Royalty free (RF) licensing is generally the only possible license for free/open source software implementations. Version 3 of the GNU General Public License includes a section that enjoins anyone who distributes a program released under the GPL from enforcing patents on subsequent users of the software or derivative works.\n\nOne result of this controversy was that many governments (including the Danish, French and Spanish governments singly and the EU collectively) specifically affirmed that \"open standards\" required royalty-free licenses. Some standards organizations, such as the W3C, modified their processes to essentially only permit royalty-free licensing.\n\nPatents for software, formulas and algorithms are currently enforceable in the US but not in the EU. The European Patent Convention Article 52 paragraph (2)(c) expressly prohibits algorithms, business methods and software from being covered by patents. The US has only allowed them since 1989 and there has been growing controversy in recent years as to either the benefit or feasibility.\n\nA standards body and its associated processes cannot \"force\" a patent holder to give up its right to charge license fees, especially if the company concerned is not a member of the standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process. In fact, this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an \"open\" approach, fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members. Few bodies will carry out (or require their members to carry out) a full patent search. Ultimately, the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard, try to rework around it, or work to invalidate the patent. Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group, and this is generally considered enforceable.\n\nExamples of patent claims brought against standards previously thought to be open include JPEG and the Rambus case over DDR SDRAM. The H.264 video codec is an example of a standards organization producing a standard that has known, non-royalty-free required patents.\n\nOften the scope of the standard itself determines how likely it is that a firm will be able to use a standard as patent-like protection. Richard Langlois argues that standards with a wide scope may offer a firm some level of protection from competitors but it is likely that Schumpeterian creative destruction will ultimately leave the firm open to being \"invented around\" regardless of the standard a firm may benefit from.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Doughney\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, 263 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 2001), was an important Internet domain trademark infringement decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n\nMichael Doughney registered the domain name peta.org in 1995 and created a website called \"People Eating Tasty Animals\". The site described itself as \"a resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the fruits of scientific research\".\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued Doughney, alleging trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. The case was initially heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and both parties cross-appealed. The circuit court affirmed the district's court ruling, which had granted summary judgment to PETA. However, the court denied PETA's cross-appeal for attorney's fees and costs, because it held that Doughney's action was not malicious.\n\nIn 1995, Doughney registered the domain name peta.org for his website titled \"People Eating Tasty Animals\". The website contained links to over 30 sites including some that promoted the sale of leather goods and meats. At the bottom of the page, the website inquired \"Feeling lost? Offended? Perhaps you should, like, \"exit immediately\"\" and provided a link to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals website.\n\nIn 1996, PETA requested that Doughney voluntarily transfer the domain name, because it owned the trademark \"PETA\". Doughney refused to do so, leading to the lawsuit. PETA asserted claims of service mark infringement, unfair competition, trademark dilution, and cybersquatting. Initially, PETA did not seek compensation other than enjoining Doughney from using the peta.org domain and an order to transfer peta.org to PETA. The district court ruled in favor of PETA in its summary judgment, leading to the appeal of the case to the circuit court.\n\nPETA was a registered trademark that belonged to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Thus the trademark infringement claim centered on whether \"defendant used the mark 'in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising' of goods or services\" The court concluded that because the website prevented others from accessing the actual PETA website, it was a use in \"commerce\".\n\nDoughney claimed that his peta.org website was a parody of the PETA organization, and was free speech permissible under the First Amendment. The court relied on \"Cliffs Notes, Inc. v. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publ'g Group, Inc.\", to rule that, in order to constitute a parody, the peta.org domain must simultaneously convey that (1) the site was the PETA site; and (2) the contradictory message that it is merely a parody.\n\nThe court held that the domain name \"peta.org\" itself only conveyed the first meaning, and thus did not qualify as a parody. The court was unwilling to consider the domain name in conjunction with the site's content for the purposes of determining whether the site \"simultaneously\" conveyed these two meanings, writing, \"Looking at Doughney's domain name alone, there is no suggestion of a parody...The domain name does not convey the second, contradictory message needed to establish a parody -a message that the domain name is not related to PETA, but that it is a parody of PETA. Doughney claims that this second message can be found in the content of his website. Indeed, the website's content makes it clear that it is not related to PETA. However, this second message is not conveyed simultaneously with the first message, as required to be considered a parody. The domain name conveys the first message; the second message is conveyed only when the viewer reads the content of the website\".\n\nThis refusal to consider a site's content when determining whether it qualifies as a parody was arguably rejected by the Fourth Circuit a few years later in \"Lamparello v. Falwell\", 420 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2005), where in discussing \"PETA v. Doughney\", the court wrote, \"[t]o determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, a court should not consider how closely a fragment of a given use duplicates the trademark, but must instead consider whether the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion\". When dealing with domain names, this means a court must evaluate an allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website identified by the domain name\".\n\nAlthough PETA did not initially allege that Doughney violated the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), it raised it during its request for summary judgement. Before and during the litigation, Doughney made statements suggesting that PETA should \"settle\" with him and \"make him an offer\". This was seen by the court as his attempt to profit from the peta.org domain. Because of this and the fact that the domain name is identical to the distinctive PETA trademark, the court ruled that Doughney violated the ACPA. However, the court further held that PETA was not entitled to damages because Doughney registered and used the domain prior to ACPA's enactment. Instead Doughney was merely required to surrender the domain.\n\nThe court ruled that PETA was ineligible for an award of attorney's fees because Doughney did not maliciously infringe the trademark because he was creating a parody and had a First Amendment right to do so.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830983", "title": "Perchta", "text": "Perchta\n\nPerchta or Berchta (English: Bertha), also commonly known as Percht and other variations, was once known as a goddess in Alpine paganism in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the Alps. Her name may mean \"the bright one\" (Old High German \"beraht, bereht\", from Proto-Germanic *\"brehtaz\") and is probably related to the name \"Berchtentag\", meaning the feast of the Epiphany. Eugen Mogk provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name \"Perchta\" to the Old High German verb \"pergan\", meaning \"hidden\" or \"covered\". \n\nPerchta is often identified as stemming from the same Germanic goddess as Holda and other female figures of German folklore (see Frija-Frigg). According to Jacob Grimm and Lotte Motz, Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of \"guardian of the beasts\" and appear during the Twelve Days of Christmas, when they oversee spinning. \n\nGrimm says Perchta or Berchta was known \"precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria.\"\n\nAccording to Erika Timm, Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably Celtic, traditions of the Alpine regions after the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages.\n\nPerchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names \"Perahta\" and \"Berchte\" as the main names (in his heading), followed by \"Berchta\" in Old High German, as well as \"Behrta\" and \"Frau Perchta\". In Baden, Swabia, Switzerland and Slovenian regions, she was often called \"Frau Faste\" (the lady of the Ember days) or Pehta or 'Kvaternica', in Slovene. Elsewhere she was known as \"Posterli,\" \"Quatemberca\" and \"Fronfastenweiber\".\n\nIn southern Austria, in Carinthia among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as \"Quantembermann\", in German, or \"Kvaternik\", in Slovene (the man of the four Ember days). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is \"Berchtold.\"\n\nRegional variations of the name include \"Berigl\", \"Berchtlmuada\", \"Perhta-Baba\", \"Zlobna Pehta\", \"Bechtrababa\", \"Sampa\", \"Stampa\", \"Lutzl\", \"Zamperin\", \"Pudelfrau\", \"Zampermuatta\" and \"Rauweib\".\n\nIn some descriptions, Perchta has two forms; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.\n\nIn many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could shapeshift to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German \"Berhte mit dem fuoze\", French \"Berthe au grand pied\", Latin \"Berhta cum magno pede\", Italian \" Berta dai gran piè\", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): \"It is apparently a swan maiden's foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the treadle\".\n\nIn the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.\n\nInitially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against spinning on holidays. In the folklore of Bavaria and Austria, Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the Twelfth Night). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles. She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of flax or wool during the year. She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.\n\nThe cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for \"Fraw Percht\" and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the \"Thesaurus pauperum\" (1468) and by Thomas Ebendorfer von Haselbach in \"De decem praeceptis\" (1439).\n\nLater canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: Holda, Diana, Herodias, Richella and Abundia.\n\nGrimm thought Holda is her equivalent while the Weisse Frauen may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.\n\nThe word \"Perchten\" is plural for Perchta, and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to \"bring luck and wealth to the people.\" The other form is the \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.\n\nSometimes, \"der Teufel\" is viewed as the most \"schiach\" (\"ugly\") \"Percht\" and \"Frau Perchta\" as the most \"schön\" (\"beautiful\") \"Percht\".\n\nIn Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with La Befana, who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.\n\nAccording to Jacob Grimm (1882), Perchta was spoken of in Old High German in the 10th century as Frau Berchta and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of Holda. He believed she was the feminine equivalent of Berchtold, and was sometimes the leader of the Wild Hunt. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.\n\nIn contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a \"rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children\".\nToday in Austria, particularly Salzburg, where she is said to wander through Hohensalzburg Castle in the dead of night, the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival Fastnacht). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called \"Perchten\".\n\nIn the Pongau region of Austria large processions of \"Schönperchten\" (\"beautiful Perchten\") and \"Schiachperchten\" (\"ugly Perchten\") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.\n\nOther regional variations include the \"Tresterer\" in the Austrian Pinzgau region, the stilt dancers in the town of Unken, the \"Schnabelpercht\" (\"trunked Percht\") in the Unterinntal region and the \"Glöcklerlaufen\" (\"bell-running\") in the Salzkammergut. A number of large ski-resorts have turned the tradition into a tourist attraction drawing large crowds every winter.\n\n"}
{"id": "19481523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19481523", "title": "Proto-Slavic borrowings", "text": "Proto-Slavic borrowings\n\nNumerous lexemes that are reconstructible for the Proto-Slavic language have been identified as borrowings from the languages of various tribes that Proto-Slavic speakers came into contact with, either in prehistorical times or during their expansion when they first appeared in history in the 6th century (the Common Slavic period). Most of the loanwords come from Germanic languages, with other contributors being Iranian, Celtic, and Turkic. The topic of such loanwords in Slavic has sparked numerous sharp debates in the 20th century, some of which persist to this day.\n\nAccording to Matasović (2008), \"solving the problem of Iranian loanwords in Slavic, their distribution and relative chronology, is one of the most important tasks of modern Slavic studies\". Slavs in the era of the Proto-Slavic language came into contact with various Iranian tribes, namely Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans, which were present in vast regions of eastern and southeastern Europe in the first centuries CE. The names of two large rivers in the centre of Slavic expansion, Dnieper and Dniester, are of Iranian origin, and Iranian toponyms are found as far west as modern day Romania.\n\nFor a long time there have been investigators who believe that the number of loanwords from Iranian languages in Proto-Slavic is substantial. For example, Gołąb (1992) maintains that all Slavic words with unexplained initial *\"x\"- are in fact Iranianisms. However, there have been other Slavists who have claimed that confirmed Iranianisms in Slavic are in fact surprisingly few, and Matasović has raised broad objections to the body of past Iranianist research. Meillet and Vaillant cite the Slavic word *\"taparu\", axe (Russ. \"topór\", Pol. \"topór\", Sr-Cr. \"tȍpor\"), which came from Iranian *\"tapara\"- (cf. Persian \"tabar\"). (Gołąb, noting the etymological connection with Slavic *\"tepǫ\", I hit, holds that this word is in fact a loan \"from\" Slavic \"into\" Iranian.) Meillet and Vaillant explain the alleged lack of Iranianisms in Slavic with the argument: \"the civilization of warrior and partially nomadic tribes, like Scythian and Sarmatian, could have exerted only a cursory influence on the patriarchal civilization of Slavs.\"\n\nMatasović criticizes Gołąb's approach as \"methodologically unacceptable\", emphasizing that initial *\"x\"- in Slavic has several sources, some of which have been ascertained (like PIE *#\"ks\"-), and others which have not. Matasović recommends that instances of initial *\"x\"- in Slavic should first be explained by recourse to regular Slavic sound laws, and that Iranian should be proposed as a source if and only if the etymon has been attested in Iranian and if and only if there is additional phonetic evidence to support the proposal.\n\nGołąb and Matasović concur that Reczek (1985) and Bernštejn (1961–74) compiled excessively large numbers of alleged Iranianisms by neglecting to thoroughly check the candidates against accepted sound changes in the various major descendants of Proto-Indo-European.\n\nTwo likely Iranian loanwords in Common Slavic are\n\nThere are Iranianisms which have not been attested in every one of the three first order subdivisions of the Slavic languages (East, West, South); hence the evidence is lacking that these borrowings date back to Common Slavic. Examples:\n\nMeillet and Vaillant considered that the semasiological development of the Proto-Slavic word for god was an Iranianism. In both Slavic and Indo-Iranian, the root that denotes deity also denotes wealth, share (Proto-Slavic *\"bagu\" > Common Slavic *\"bogъ\") and Indo-Iranian (Old Persian \"baga\", Sanskrit \"bhága\"). However, they did not argue that the Proto-Slavic root itself was a borrowing, despite its similarity to the Old Persian and Sanskrit roots.\n\nOne of the Iranian-Slavic lexical isoglosses is a lone adposition: Old Persian \"rādiy\", OCS \"radi\".\n\nMatasović notes typological coincidences between Slavic and Ossetian, an Iranian language whose ancestor was Alanic. In both modern Ossetian and the Slavic group, verbs are conjugated for perfective and imperfective aspects; prefixation is a prominent means of deriving perfective verbs from imperfective verbs; there are certain syntactic behaviors of pronominal clitics in common; both sporadically mark direct objects with the genitive. It remains to be determined, however, whether those correspondences are a result of prehistoric contacts between Slavic and Alanic tribes, or just a case of accidental parallel development.\n\nIt is not certain when speakers of Proto-Slavic first came into contact with Germanic tribes: among Common Balto-Slavic words that have Centum reflexes, there is not a single one that has typical Germanic sound features. As for the Baltic languages, all their prehistoric Germanic loanwords are either mediated through Slavic or are borrowed from Old Norse or Proto-Norse; i.e., borrowed during a period well after Slavic prehistory (which ended c. 600 CE). The conclusion is that the speakers of Germanic must have lived far from the area of the subsequent spread of speakers of Proto-Balto-Slavic.\n\nThe Goths are the first Germanic people who can be proved to have had intensive contacts with speakers of Proto-Slavic. Goths are believed to have reached the western shores of the Black Sea between the Danube and Dniester Rivers (an area covered by present-day Ukraine and Romania) about 230 CE, so contact between them and Proto-Slavic speakers might have started in the preceding century. Contact between these two groups continued all the way to the early historical period. It is believed that the Gothic language was the intermediary for the entry of many terms of Greco-Roman cultural provenience into Proto-Slavic, for example\n\nHere is a list of words which are generally held to be Germanic loanwords in Proto-Slavic:\n\nThis set of loanwords covers diverse semantic fields, fields from which languages readily borrow words: buildings (*\"xūzu\",*\"tūnu\"); terrain features (*\"xulmu\", *\"bergu\"); social interaction and societal structure (*\"pulku\", *\"želdān\", *\"kōpītej\", *\"činda\"); animals and cattle (*\"asilu\", *\"skatu\").\n\nMany Germanic loanwords entered Slavic languages well after Proto-Slavic; i.e. in the Common Slavic period. After 600 CE most such borrowings came from Old High German.\n\nStender-Petersen (1927) assumes two layers of Germanic loanwords in Slavic (whether into Proto-Slavic or into Common Slavic): words from Proto-Germanic and words from Gothic. Kiparsky suggests a more refined chronological layering:\n\nAll investigators agree that Germanicisms entered Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic over a lengthy period and subsequently underwent numerous sound changes. *\"činda\", *\"želdān\", *\"xelmu\" would predate the Slavic first palatalization; *\"lōku\", *\"kōsitej\", *\"kōpitej\" would predate the change, PSl. *\"aw\" > PSl. */ō/. Of special interest are certain Proto-Slavic accentual developments that can be observed in Germanic loanwords:\n\nBy the time Slavs start to appear in historical records, Celtic languages were already limited to the British Isles and modern-day France. However, during Classical Antiquity Celts populated the regions of Central Europe in which Slavs spread in the 6th and the 7th century, there may have been speakers of Celtic languages in the regions of Slavic expansion. In any case, it seems very possible that Celtic words might have entered Slavic indirectly instead, through Vulgar Latin/early Romance dialects, since Celtic, being but marginally spoken, was probably a low prestige idiom spoken by the lower classes of society. Two likely examples of direct borrowings from Celtic are\n\nAncient Greek words in Proto-Slavic are identified through phonetic features, some related to Greek phonetic history, others possibly Scythian-Sarmatian or Gothic mediations. Ancient Greek, non-mediated words are \"korablja\" (ark), \"koliba\" (cottage, hut), and supposedly \"trem\" (porch); Scythian mediations are \"luk\" (onion), \"haluga\" (fence), \"koš\" (basket), \"talog\" (dregs), \"kurva\" (whore); supposedly Gothic mediations are \"crkva\" (church) and \"daska\" (plank).\n\nSpeculations as to contacts between Proto-Slavic speakers and other Indo-European languages have abounded in the literature on Slavic historical linguistics. Proposals have included Italic, Illyrian, Thracian, Venetic, and even Armenian.\n\nThere are words that undoubtedly were borrowed from non-Indo-European languages. Most of these words came from Turkic languages, chiefly Bulgar and European Avar. Among commonly cited examples of non-IE loanwords are\n\n\n"}

The scheming Harry decides to steal a bottle to give Chester the power of photographic memory for lucrative nefarious purposes.\n\nReturning to Calcutta, followed by Diane, Harry has Chester test the results of the memory herb by memorizing the rocket formula that Diane placed in Chester's coat. Not knowing what it is, Harry destroys it after Chester has successfully memorized it. Diane arrives too late, but after seeing Chester recite the formula, she offers them $25,000 to meet her in Hong Kong. On the way to Hong Kong, an agent of the High Lama replaces the stolen Tibetan herbs with a similar bottle containing ordinary tea leaves.\n\nThe Third Echelon is seeking the fuel for its own spacecraft with an underwater launching pad in Hong Kong. The goal is to be the first on the moon, where a base is to be established to launch nuclear weapons against Earth and to bring survivors under the agency's control.\n\nWith a Russian launch to the moon carrying two apes imminent, the Third Echelon, which was going to emulate the Soviet achievement, decides to gain respect at the United Nations by launching two human astronauts, Chester and Harry, instead of apes. The two are used as guinea pigs (and fed with bananas) to test the capabilities of the spacecraft and the effects of spaceflight upon humans. The mission is successful, with moonlight bringing back Chester's photographic memory.\n\nDiane decides to leave the Third Echelon when she discovers that once her colleagues have extracted the final formula from Chester, they plan to dissect Chester and Harry to see the effects of space travel on their bodies. Diane helps the boys escape. They are pursued through Hong Kong, eventually leading Diane to the authorities. Chester and Harry happen to meet Dorothy Lamour at a nightclub where they are recaptured by the Third Echelon.\n\nChester, Harry and Diane all end up in a rocket bound for another planet. They think they're alone after landing, but they're not—Chester calls out, \"The Italians!\" as they are joined by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.\n\nFilming in England at Shepperton Studios, the regular \"Road\" picture stars Crosby and Hope returned for one last go, but the leading lady was now Joan Collins rather than Dorothy Lamour. Lamour did make a cameo appearance as herself late in the film. In her autobiography, Lamour wrote that Crosby thought her too old to be a leading lady (she was 48), while Hope refused to do the film without her. Her extended cameo that featured her singing with Hope and Crosby was a compromise. Other cameos are provided by David Niven, Peter Sellers, Roger Delgado, Jerry Colonna, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. In order to preserve the feel of the 1940s and '50s \"Road\" films, the movie was shot in black and white (even as the previous entry \"Road to Bali\" had been shot in color).\n\nThe name of Hope's character, \"Chester Babcock\", is an in-joke. Edward Chester Babcock was the real name of Hollywood composer Jimmy Van Heusen, whose work is featured in this and other \"Road\" pictures. The lamasery where Hope goes to restore his memory is reused from \"Black Narcissus\". Peter Sellers' appearance as an Indian physician involves extended interplay with Crosby and Hope.\n\nThe plot of the film (released 22 May 1962) involves espionage and space rockets predating \"Dr. No\" (released 5 October 1962) and the spy craze of the 1960s. Hope and Crosby are up against a SPECTRE type organization called \"The Third Echelon\" who have their own underwater secret headquarters and are led by Robert Morley with James Bond film regular Walter Gotell as \"Dr. Zorbb\" and Bob Simmons as an astronaut. The film's art director is another Bond film regular, Syd Cain.\n\nAlthough the movie features the same kind of antics and gags as previous episodes, with all characters trying their utmost to help each other, the film was not as well-received as its predecessors. Some critics felt that the 59-year-old Hope and Crosby couldn't pull off the part credibly at their age and that it was unfair for them to dump their old partner Lamour (with whom they had excellent screen chemistry) for the more youthful Collins. Others thought the decade-long gap since the last \"Road\" movie wrecked the momentum of the series and that Peter Sellers came off as more fresh and funny than the aging stars of the film.\n\nIn 1977, Sir Lew Grade had planned to reunite Hope, Crosby and Lamour in \"The Road to the Fountain of Youth\" for which Melville Shavelson had completed the script, but Crosby died before production. Crosby was rumored to have asked the writers for a Monty Python-esque script in order to keep the series fresh for 1970s audiences.\n\nThis is the only \"Road\" film to have its rights retained by the original producer/distributor (where all the previous films are now at the hands of other companies), although today Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (UA's sister studio) handles distribution and marketing on behalf of UA.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" welcomed it saying, \"inter alia\": \"Age may have withered somewhat the glossy hides of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and custom may have done a little something to stale their brand of vaudeville. But the old boys still come through nicely in another turn in the old “Road” act by which they were jointly elevated to international eminence about twenty years ago...But practically every moment spent with Bing and Bob is good for consecutive chuckles and frequent belly-deep guffaws. For their former travel agents, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, who have not only written this picture but produced and directed it, have provided them with the gags and business to make for much humorous verbal give-and-take and an almost unending succession of crazy and corny contretemps.\"\n\n\"Variety\" was pretty positive too. \"The seventh “Road” comedy, after a lapse of seven years, should cause a seven-year itch among tab buyers to get in at the laughs. For they come thick and fast in this genial piece of nonsense. Perhaps the old formula creaks occasionally, but not enough to cause any disappointment while the zany situations and razor-edge wisecracks keep the whole affair bubbling happily. . . . The result is an amiable comedy which should please nostalgic customers and entice those who haven’t seen any of the previous “Road” pix...\"\n\nAll songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyrics) with the exception of \"Personality\".\n\n\nA soundtrack album was released by Liberty Records.\n\n\n\"The Road to Hong Kong\" was released to DVD by MGM Home Video in a Region 1 DVD on 1 April 2003.\n\n\"The Road to Hong Kong\" was released to Blu-ray (Region A) by Olive Films on 17 Feb 2015.\n\n\n"}

The 27 teenage plaintiffs brought suit against the State of Alaska, claiming that Native American boarding schools were discriminatory and unjust. The case is widely known as the \"Molly Hootch Case\" after the first plaintiff named.\n\nAt the time of the case, Alaskan Native parents were forced to send their children away for schooling because of a lack of quality local educational facilities in their towns. Boarding schools had historically been used as a tactic of assimilating Native students into white culture. Alaskan Native children were sent far from their parents for their secondary education, often heading to the contiguous 48 states and boarding with local non-Native families. They were thus immersed in a situation that was both geographically (Oregon, Oklahoma, etc.) and culturally removed from their place of origin. The plaintiffs alleged that this situation led to mistreatment of the Native students and a high dropout rate among them (65% within 2 years, in one documented case ), signs of educational inequality.\n\nIn October 1976, the signing of the Tobeluk Consent Decree committed the government to building local high schools in Alaska, which they have since done with positive results on retention rates. The state by means of the consent decree agreed to create a secondary school in any village with at least fifteen high school-aged children.\n"}

That is, it concerns a collection of digital images of preserved plants or plant parts. Virtual herbaria often are established to improve availability of specimens to a wider audience. However, there are digital herbaria that are not suitable for internet access because of the high resolution of scans and resulting large file sizes (several hundred megabytes per file). Additional information about each specimen, such as the location, the collector, and the botanical name are attached to every specimen. Frequently, further details such as related species and growth requirements are mentioned.\n\nThe standard hardware used for herbarium specimen imaging is the \"HerbScan\" scanner. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner which raises the specimen up to the scanning surface. This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a copy stand to achieve the same effect.\n\nA small color chart and a ruler must be included on a herbarium sheet when it is imaged. The JSTOR Plant Science requires that the ruler bears the herbarium name and logo, and that a ColorChecker chart is used for any specimens to be contributed to the Global Plants Initiative (GPI). \n\nVirtual herbaria are established in part to increase the longevity of specimens. Major herbaria participate in international loan programs, where a researcher can request specimens to be shipped in for study. This shipping contributes to the wear and tear of specimens. If, however, digital images are available, images of the specimens can be sent electronically. These images may be a sufficient substitute for the specimens themselves, or alternatively, the researcher can use the images to \"preview\" the specimens, to which ones should be sent out for further study. This process cuts down on the shipping, and thus the wear and tear of the specimens, as well as the wait times associated with shipping.\n\nVirtual herbaria can also be used to increase public awareness of herbaria. Some herbaria make their specimen databases publicly available on the Internet. Digital images of specimens can be added to these databases to allow the public to further engage with the material. Some herbaria also capitalize on their images by selling herbarium prints and greeting cards featuring particularly attractive specimens.\n\nHerbar Digital\n\n"}

It tells the story of Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, and the leak by Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley) of classified material to the website in 2010. It was published by Guardian Books in February 2011.\n\nAlong with other sources, portions were adapted for the 2013 film \"The Fifth Estate\".\n\nThe book describes Assange's childhood and details about his work creating and expanding WikiLeaks. It explains how his surname comes from his stepfather, a \"touring puppet theater owner\", and not his biological father, a choice that Assange made himself.\n\nIn response to the book's publication, WikiLeaks posted on Twitter: \"'The Guardian\" book serialization contains malicious libels. We will be taking action.' The Hindu writer, Hasan Suroor, said Assange's concern is that the book is \"critical of [Assange's] robust style and his alleged tendency to be a 'control freak'\". One of the points of disagreement is that the book claimed he had initially refused to redact the names of Afghan informants to the US military from the Afghan War logs; the book reports him as saying they would \"deserve it\" if they were killed. When Douglas Murray relayed these comments in a debate on the 9th of April, 2011, Assange interjected \"We are in the process of suing \"The Guardian\" in relation to that comment.\" \"The Guardian\" claimed the following day that they had 'not received any notification of such action from WikiLeaks or its lawyers', two months after the publication of the book.\n\nIn the book, Leigh mentioned the password to a set of unredacted classified US State Department cables. WikiLeaks had earlier distributed multiple copies of files containing all these cables, and others had mirrored their files with BitTorrent. WikiLeaks blamed Leigh and \"The Guardian\" for unnecessarily disclosing the password. In response \"The Guardian\" said \"It's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way.\" According to \"The Guardian\", WikiLeaks had indicated that the password was temporary and that WikiLeaks had seven months to take action to protect the files it had subsequently decided to post online. Wikileaks replied that others posted the files online, and as they were publicly available, the password was still useful. The cables contained in the file had their original form and thus they did have all the names that were erased for the safety of the informants.

{"id": "61366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61366", "title": "X.500", "text": "X.500\n\nX.500 is a series of computer networking standards covering electronic directory services. The X.500 series was developed by ITU-T, formerly known as CCITT, and first approved in 1988. The directory services were developed in order to support the requirements of X.400 electronic mail exchange and name lookup. ISO was a partner in developing the standards, incorporating them into the Open Systems Interconnection suite of protocols. ISO/IEC 9594 is the corresponding ISO identification. \n\nThe protocols defined by X.500 include\n\nBecause these protocols used the OSI networking stack, a number of alternatives to DAP were developed to allow Internet clients to access the X.500 Directory using the TCP/IP networking stack. The most well-known alternative to DAP is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). While DAP and the other X.500 protocols can now use the TCP/IP networking stack, LDAP remains a popular directory access protocol.\n\nThe primary concept of X.500 is that there is a single Directory Information Tree (DIT), a hierarchical organization of entries which are distributed across one or more servers, called Directory System Agents (DSA). An entry consists of a set of attributes, each attribute with one or more values. Each entry has a unique Distinguished Name, formed by combining its Relative Distinguished Name (RDN), one or more attributes of the entry itself, and the RDNs of each of the superior entries up to the root of the DIT. As LDAP implements a very similar data model to that of X.500, there is further description of the data model in the article on LDAP.\n\nX.520 and X.521 together provide a definition of a set of attributes and object classes to be used for representing people and organizations as entries in the DIT. They are one of the most widely deployed white pages schema.\n\nX.509, the portion of the standard providing for an authentication framework, is now also widely used outside of the X.500 directory protocols. It specifies a standard format for public-key certificates.\n\nThe current use of X.509v3 certificates outside the Directory structure loaded directly into web browsers was necessary for e-commerce to develop by allowing for secure web based (SSL/TLS) communications which did not require the X.500 directory as a source of digital certificates as originally conceived in X.500 (1988). One should contrast the role of X.500 and X.509 to understand their relationship in that X.509 was designed to be the secure access method for updating X.500 before the WWW, but when web browsers became popular there needed to be a simple method of encrypting connections on the transport layer to web sites. Hence the trusted root certificates for supported certificate authorities were pre loaded into certificate storage areas on the personal computer or device.\n\nAdded security is envisaged by the scheduled 2011-2014 implementation of the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, a two- to three-year project protecting digital identities in cyberspace.\n\nThe WWW e-commerce implementation of X.509v3 bypassed but did not replace the original ISO standard authentication mechanism of binding distinguished names in the X.500 Directory.\n\nThese packages of certificates can be added or removed by the end user in their software, but are reviewed by Microsoft and Mozilla in terms of their continued trustworthiness. Should a problem arise, such as what occurred with DigiNotar, browser security experts can issue an update to mark a certificate authority as untrusted, but this is a serious removal effectively of that CA from \"internet trust\". X.500 offers a way to view which organization claims a specific root certificate, outside of that provided bundle. This can function as a \"4 corner model of trust\" adding another check to determine if a root certificate has been compromised. Rules governing the Federal Bridge policy for revoking compromised certificates are available at www.idmanagement.gov.\n\nThe contrast of this browser bundled approach is that in X.500 or LDAP the attribute \"caCertificate\" can be \"bound\" to a directory entry and checked in addition to the default pre-loaded bundle of certificates of which end users typically have never noticed unless an SSL warning message has appeared.\n\nFor example, a web site using SSL, typically the DNS site name \"www.foobar.com\" is verified in a browser by the software using libraries that would check to see if the certificate was signed by one of the trusted root certificates given to the user.\n\nTherefore, creating trust for users that they had reached the correct web site via HTTPS.\n\nHowever, stronger checks are also possible, to indicate that more than the domain name was verified. To contrast this with X.500, the certificate is one attribute of many for an entry, in which the entry could contain anything allowable by the specific Directory schema. Thus X.500 does store the digital certificate, but it is one of many attributes that could potentially verify the organization, such as physical address, a contact telephone number and an email contact.\n\nCA Certs or certificate authority certs are loaded into the browser automatically (in the case of Microsoft's update mechanism), or in new version updates of browsers, and the user is given further choices to import, delete, or develop an individual trust relationship with the loaded Certificate Authorities and determine how the browser will behave if OCSP revocation servers are unreachable.\n\nThis is in contrast with the Directory model which associates the attribute caCertificate with a listed certificate authority.\n\nThus the browser can verify the SSL cert of the website by means of the loaded group of accepted certificates or the root certificates can be looked up in an X.500 or LDAP Directory (or via HTTP/S) and imported into the list of trusted Certificate Authorities.\n\nThe \"bound\" distinguished name is located in the subject fields of the certificate which matches the Directory entry. X.509v3 can contain other extensions depending on the community of interest other than international domain names. For broad Internet use, RFC-5280 PKIX describes a profile for fields that may be useful for applications such as encrypted email.\n\nAn end user who relies on the authenticity of a certificate being presented to a browser or email has no simple way to compare a forged certificate presented (perhaps which triggers a browser warning) with a valid certificate, without also being given the opportunity to validate the DN or Distinguished Name which was designed to be looked up in an X.500 DIT.\n\nThe certificate itself is public and considered to be unforgeable and can therefore be distributed in any manner, but an associated binding to an identity occurs in the Directory. Binding is what links the certificate to the identity who claims to be using that certificate. For example, the X.500 software that runs the Federal Bridge has cross certificates that enable trust between certificate authorities.\n\nSimple homographic matching of domain names has resulted in phishing attacks where a domain can appear to be legitimate, but is not.\n\nIf a X.509v3 certificate is bound to a valid organization's distinguished name within the Directory, then a simple check can be made in regards to the authenticity of the certificate by a comparison with what is presented to the browser with what is present in the Directory.\n\nSome options do exist to check notaries to see if a certificate has only recently been seen, and therefore more likely to have been compromised. If the cert is likely to be trusted and is failing because the domain name is a slight mismatch, it will then initially fail in the browser, but then be subjected to the notary trust, which can then bypass the browser warning.\n\nA valid organizational entry, such as o=FoobarWidgets, will also have an associated alphanumeric OID, and it has been \"identity proofed\" by ANSI, providing another layer of assurance regarding binding the certificate to the identity.\n\nRecent events (2011) have indicated a threat from unknown actors in nation states who have forged certificates. This was done in order to create a MITM attack against political activists in Syria accessing Facebook over the web. This would have normally triggered a browser warning, but would not if the MITM certificate was issued by a valid certificate authority already trusted by a browser or other software. Similar attacks were used by Stuxnet which allowed software to impersonate trusted code. The point of certificate transparency is to allow an end user to determine, using a simple procedure if a certificate is in fact valid. Checking against the default bundle of certificates may not be enough to do this, and therefore an additional check is desired. Other suggestions for certificate transparency have also been advanced.\n\nA different attack was used against Comodo, a certificate authority, that resulted in forged certificates that were directed at high-profile communications websites. This necessitated an emergency patch to major browsers. These certificates were actually issued from a trusted Certificate Authority, and therefore a user would have had no warning if they had gone to a faked website, in contrast with the Syria incident, where the certificate was crudely forged, including substituting Alto Palo, for Palo Alto. and incorrect serial numbers.\n\nSome projects designed to exchange PHI, protected Health Information (which is considered to be highly HIPAA sensitive) may obtain X.509v3 certs via a CERT DNS resource record, or via LDAP to a X.500[2008] Directory. The issue of an authoritative bind then is detailed in RFCs related to the accuracy of the DNS information secured by signing from the root using DNSSEC.\n\nThe concept of root name servers has been a source of major contention in the Internet community, but for DNS is largely resolved. The name space associated with X.500 has traditionally been thought to start with a national naming authority, which mirrors the ISO/ITU approach to global systems with national representation. Thus different countries will create their own unique X.500 services. The U.S. X.500 was privatized in 1998, when the U.S. Government no longer offered X.500 or DNS registration outside of known government agencies.\n\nThe X.500 pilot project has been in development in the commercial space, and the technology continues to be present in major installations of millions of users within corporate data centers, and within the U.S. Government for credentialing.\n\nThe authors of RFC 2693 (concerning SPKI) note that \"The original X.500 plan is unlikely ever to come to fruition. Collections of directory entries... are considered valuable or even confidential by those owning the lists and are not likely to be released to the world in the form of an X.500 directory sub-tree.\" and that \"The X.500 idea of a distinguished name (a single, globally unique name that everyone could use when referring to an entity) is also not likely to occur.\"\n\n\"X.500 is too complex to support on desktops and over the Internet, so LDAP was created to provide this service 'for the rest of us'.\"\n\n\n"}
