{"id": "714845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714845", "title": "Aswang", "text": "Aswang\n\nAn Aswang (or Asuwang) is an umbrella term referring to a shapeshifting evil spirit in Filipino folklore, vampire, a ghoul, a warlock/witch, or different species of werebeast. It is the subject of a wide variety of myths and stories. Spanish colonists noted that the Aswang was the most feared among the mythical creatures of the Philippines, even in the 16th century. The myth of the aswang is well known throughout the Philippines. It is especially popular in the Visayas, southern parts of Luzon, and parts of Mindanao. Other regional names for the aswang include \"tik-tik\", \"wak-wak\", \"sok-sok\" and \"kling-kling\".\n\nAnthropologists postulate that the Aswang belief came from the myth-making of the Spaniards intent on keeping the population under control. Through the \"encomienda\" system, a town was arranged into easy-to-manage layers, and those who lived too far away were labelled \"tulisans\" (dissenters). To frighten the Filipinos and discourage mobility, stories of \"Aswangs\" living on the outskirts of the forests were spread in towns to keep everyone in groups and maintain control.\n\nModern investigation links the prevalence of the aswang myth in the Capiz province of the Philippines to the genetic disease X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) or Dystonia of Panay (Lubag Syndrome).\n\nQuintessinal of these versions is the \"bal-bal\" or ghoul (\"maninilong\" in Catanauan, Quezon), which replaces the cadaver with banana tree trunks after consumption. Aswang stories and definitions vary greatly from region to region and person to person, and no particular set of characteristics can be ascribed to the term. Another common and very popular version is the manananggal which are usually female.\n\nThe wide variety of descriptions in the aswang stories makes it difficult to settle upon a fixed definition of aswang appearances or activities. However, several common themes that differentiate aswangs from other mythological creatures do emerge: Aswangs are typically described as shape-shifters. Stories recount aswangs living as regular townspeople that are quiet, shy and elusive. At night, they transform into creatures such as a bat, bird (usually a crow), wild boar, black cat, or most often, a big black dog.\n\nThey love to eat unborn fetuses and small children, favoring livers and hearts. Some have long proboscises, which they use to suck the children out of their mothers' wombs when they are sleeping in their homes. Some are so thin that they can hide themselves behind a bamboo post. They are fast and silent. Some also make noises, like the Tik-Tik, (the name was derived from the sound it produces) which are louder the farther away the aswang is, to confuse its potential victim; and the Bubuu, an aggressive kind of aswang that makes a sound of a laying hen at midnight. They may also replace their live victims or stolen cadavers with doppelgangers made from tree trunks or other plant materials. This facsimile will return to the victim's home, only to become extremely sick and then die. An aswang will also have bloodshot eyes, the result of staying up all night searching for houses where wakes are held to steal the bodies.\n\nAswangs are physically much more like humans at daytime; they only change their appearance at night when they feel they are hungry. It has been said that if an aswang married a human, upon their wedding, his or her mate would become an aswang as well but rarely can they reproduce. The couple may hunt together at night but will most often go in separate directions, either to avoid quick detection or because they do not like to share their food.\n\nUnlike vampires and other similar creatures, they are not harmed by sunlight. They are daywalkers. Aswangs can also be befriended, they can talk to you like any normal human: they laugh and/or cry, get angry/sad, get hurt/humiliated and feel shy and envious. These creatures do not harm their friends and neighbors, and were said to be exempted from their target victims for food, hence the Filipino saying, \"Mas mabuti ang aswang kaysa sa isang magnanakaw\" (English: \"An aswang is better than a thief\").\n\nThey search for food in faraway places that it would not be too obvious for them. Aswangs are said to be vulnerable during daytime because during that time they do not have the excessive superhuman strength that they have in their nighttime prowl (aswangs only transform at night because they believe that God is sleeping). When people know of their identity, they are hunted down and killed immediately.\n\nLike vampires, aswangs are repelled or killed by using garlic, salt and religious artifacts/weapons (e.g. Holy water, crucifix, rosary, prayers and religious verses). They are also killed using a whip made entirely of a stingray's tail (buntot pagi), which may also be used to repel the creature (aswangs are said to be scared of the sound made by the whip's cord slashing through the air). It is also said that they cannot step on holy consecrated ground (i.e. churches, mosques, temples, etc.). Decapitation is also a way to destroy an aswang.\n\nCertain agimats (native Philippine amulets) and special prayers posted on doors and entrances may also repel aswangs. A good example of which is the red and black bead bracelets worn by newborn babies.\n\nIt is said that to spot an aswang at daytime, look straight at their eyes. The person in front of you is an aswang if your reflection is upside-down. Another way of knowing is looking in a \"tuwad\" manner; that is, bending over and looking at the person from between your legs, upside-down. The person is an aswang if the image of the person is different. It is said that a person without a philtrum is an aswang. Hintura is a kind of oil made by albularyos, used to detect if an aswang is near the premises. It is said that the oil will boil and bubble if an aswang is near.\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered a part of Israel's Download Valley, a cluster of software companies monetizing \"free\" software downloads through adware. Babylon includes in-house proprietary dictionaries, as well as community-created dictionaries and glossaries. It is a tool used for translation and conversion of currencies, measurements and time, and for obtaining other contextual information. The program also uses a text-to-speech agent, so users hear the proper pronunciation of words and text. Babylon has developed 36 English-based proprietary dictionaries in 21 languages. In 2008–2009, Babylon reported earnings of 50 million NIS through its collaboration with Google.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2013, Babylon became infamous for demonstrating questionable behavior typical of malware: A \"Babylon Toolbar\" bundled with Babylon and other software, has been widely identified as a browser hijacker that is very easy to install inadvertently and unnecessarily difficult to remove. This eventually lead to Google terminating its agreement with Babylon Ltd. in 2013.\n\nIn 1995, Israeli entrepreneur Amnon Ovadia began a project for an online English–Hebrew dictionary which would not interrupt the reading process. As a result, Babylon Ltd. was founded in 1997 and launched the first version of Babylon. On 25 September 1997, the company filed a patent for text recognition and translation. In 1998, a year following its launch date, Babylon had two million users, mostly in Germany and Brazil, growing from 420,000 to 2.5 million users in the course of that year. In the same year, Formula Systems, headed by Dan Goldstein, acquired Mashov Computers and became the largest shareholder in the company. By 2000, the product had over 4 million users. In the spring of 2000, Babylon Ltd. failed to raise $20 million in a private placement and lost NIS 15 million. Further stress came with the collapse of the Dot-com bubble. In 2001, Babylon Ltd. continued shedding money, with the company costing its parent company Formula Vision NIS 4.7 million.\n\nSince 2007, Babylon Ltd. () has been a publicly traded company. Its IPO took place in February 2007; Israeli businessman Noam Lanir purchased controlling interests in the company for $10.5 million, sharing management with second majority shareholder Reed Elsevier and the Company founder Amnon Ovadia. According to Globes magazine in January 2011, Lanir received an offer for his stake from a foreign private equity fund that valued the company at NIS 248 million (approximately 70 million dollars).\n\nIn 2008–2009, Babylon reported earnings of NIS 50 million through its collaboration with Google. In 2010, Google Ireland signed an extended cooperation agreement with Babylon to provide it with online search and pay-per-click advertising services.\n\nIn 2011, Babylon was named the seventh most popular website in Libya, the eighth in Algeria and the eleventh in Tunisia.\n\nAccording to Globes magazine, Noam Lanir, who acquired control of Babylon for NIS 20 million, made a paper profit of NIS 200 million on his investment in 2012.\n\nAccording to Alexa, Babylon's website was once ranked 45th most popular website in the world.

Babylon enables the translation of Microsoft Word documents and plain text files. It offers results from a database of over 1,700 sources in over 75 languages.\n\nBabylon includes its in-house proprietary dictionaries, community-created dictionaries and glossaries (UGC), which include general and technical dictionaries, language and monolingual dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedias and lexicons in a multitude of languages. They are indexed in 400 categories covering the arts, business, computers, health, law, entertainment, sports and so on.\n\nThe program also uses a text-to-speech agent so users hear the proper pronunciation of words and text. Babylon Ltd. has developed 36 English-based proprietary dictionaries in 21 languages (English, Arabic, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish) that are free of charge to users of the software. These dictionaries comprise between 60,000 and 200,000 terms, phrases, acronyms and abbreviations and are enabled with a morphological engine which facilitates recognition of all inflected forms of single words and phrases, provides all forms of terms that include prefixes and extensions and supplies a solution for all formats of writing. Babylon's Linguistic Department is responsible for the extensive content and information database which is a significant component of Babylon's Product.\n\nOn 7 August 2010, Microsoft antivirus products identified the software application as adware (identified as \"Adware: Win32/Babylon\") due to potentially intrusive behavior. Sixteen days later, on 23 August 2010, Microsoft announced that Babylon Ltd. had modified the program and that it was no longer categorized as adware.\n\nIn 2011, Download.com started bundling the Babylon Toolbar with open-source packages such as Nmap. Gordon Lyon, the developer of Nmap, criticized the decision. The vice-president of Download.com, Sean Murphy, released an apology: \"The bundling of this software was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the user and developer communities for the unrest it caused.\"\n\nIn 2012 the Babylon search toolbar was identified as a browser hijacker that, while very easy to install inadvertently, is unnecessarily difficult to remove afterwards. The toolbar is listed as an unwanted application by anti-spyware software such as Stopzilla or Spybot – Search & Destroy. Many users, trying to uninstall Babylon, have searched for help on different support forums. The toolbar tends to install itself onto computers as an add-on with other software and changes users' home page to the Babylon search engine, adds the search engine to the computer and sets itself as the default. It changes browser preferences such as the user's home page and search engine, changes that can be very difficult to reverse.\n\nOn 29 October 2013, Google notified Babylon that it did not intend to renew its cooperation agreement between the two companies, which terminated on 30 November 2013. Google said that complaints had been received from Google Chrome users, claiming that the Babylon toolbar damages the browser's user experience. According to Babylon, Google may have reconsidered the decision during 2014.\n\n"}

The book became a major best-seller and something of a social phenomenon. Today Chicken Soup for the Soul Publishing, LLC continues to publish about a dozen new books per year.\n\nThe company has branched out into other categories such as food, pet food, and television programming.\n\nMotivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen collaborated on the first \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" book, compiling inspirational, true stories they had heard from their audience members. Many of the stories came from members of the audience of their inspirational talks. The book was rejected by major publishers in New York but accepted by a small, self-help publisher in Florida called HCI.\n\nAfter the success of the first book, Canfield and Hansen, with HCI, published additional, similar \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" titles. Later, they published \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" books for specific demographics, such as \"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul\", which came out in 1997 and was a major best-seller. New \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" titles and sequels to existing books have been published on a regular basis since the first book came out in 1993. As of late 2013, the series included more than 200 titles.\n\nIn 2008, the founders, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, sold the company to a new ownership group led by William J.

It represents a more holistic approach to retrieval and access as the relationships between the entities provide links to navigate through the hierarchy of relationships. The model is significant because it is separate from specific cataloguing standards such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR) or International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD).\n\nThe ways that people can use FRBR data have been defined as follows: to find entities in a search, to identify an entity as being the correct one, to select an entity that suits the user's needs, or to obtain an entity (physical access or licensing).\n\nFRBR comprises groups of entities:\n\nGroup 1 entities are the foundation of the FRBR model:\n\nGroup 1 entities are not strictly hierarchical, because entities do not always inherit properties from other entities. Despite initial positive assessments of FRBR clarifying the thoughts around the conceptual underpinnings of works, there has been later disagreement about what the Group 1 entities actually mean. The distinction between Works and Expressions is also unclear in many cases.\n\nIn addition to the relationships between Group 1 and Groups 2 and 3 discussed above, there are many additional relationships covering such things as digitized editions of a work to the original text, and derivative works such as adaptations and parodies, or new texts which are critical evaluations of a pre-existing text. FRBR is built upon relationships between and among entities. \"Relationships serve as the vehicle for depicting the link between one entity and another, and thus as the means of assisting the user to ‘navigate’ the universe that is represented in a bibliography, catalogue, or bibliographic database.\" Examples of relationship types include, but are not limited to:\n\nEquivalence relationships exist between exact copies of the same manifestation of a work or between an original item and reproductions of it, so long as the intellectual content and authorship are preserved. Examples include reproductions such as copies, issues, facsimiles and reprints, photocopies, and microfilms.\n\nDerivative relationships exist between a bibliographic work and a modification based on the work. Examples include:\n\nDescriptive relationships exist between a bibliographic entity and a description, criticism, evaluation, or review of that entity, such as between a work and a book review describing it. Descriptive relationships also includes annotated editions, casebooks, commentaries, and critiques of an existing work.\n\n\n\n"}

It was among the first publications to recommend the use of condoms to prevent the transmission of STDs in men having sex with men, and has even been named, along with \"Play Fair!,\" as one of the foundational publications in the advent of modern safe sex.\n\nThe booklet was co-written by Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, with scientific advisement from Dr. Sonnabend. Callen's partner Richard Dworkin was the editor. Both Callen and Berkowitz had been diagnosed with AIDS when they wrote the booklet and had a thorough knowledge of the sexual culture of gay and bisexual men in New York City. Sonnabend describes the symbiotic relationship between the three as one in which he contributed medical and scientific information while Callen added the more political points and Berkowitz, who had educated himself with Sonnabend's scientific archives for the sake of his own treatment, synthesized the two.\n\nIn May 1983, when \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was published, the AIDS epidemic in New York City has only recently begun and panic about the unknown causes, means of transmission and potential for treatment for AIDS was spreading rapidly. The misconception that there was something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection was common at the time and led to the development of a stigma surrounding both the disease and gay sex. Doctor Sonnabend wrote that \"it may be impossible for those who did not directly experience the uncertainty and terror of the early years of AIDS to appreciate the circumstances under which these guidelines [for safe sex] were constructed.\"\n\nAt the time when \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was written, there was no consensus on the cause of AIDS, but two main theories existed: the \"new agent theory,\" which was increasingly the scientific consensus, and the \"multifactorial theory,\" which Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend adopted as their basis for sexual education around AIDS transmission prevention. The new agent theory proposed that AIDS was caused by a single, previously unknown pathogen, likely a retrovirus similar to the Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). According to the multifactorial theory, however, continual overexposure to semen, specifically cytomegalovirus (CMV) in semen, lead to an eventual state of immunosuppression that characterized AIDS. This was based on prior scientific studies that revealed the role that CMV can play in causing cellular immune-related abnormalities. The multifactorial theory espoused in the manual has since been disproven; the majority of scientists are now in agreement that AIDS is caused by the transmission of the retrovirus HIV.\n\nAs a result of the lack of agreement on AIDS cause and transmission, it was difficult to determine the risk of various forms of sexual contact. Berkowitz, in the introduction to his autobiography, describes how, in the early years of the epidemic, risk categorizations were rewritten every few months: \"anal sex with a condom became an endless back and forth dance, from high risk to medium risk to low risk to possibly safe.\" It was this confusion that prompted the authors to create a safe sex manual that clearly outlined for men having sex with men the dangers of each type of contact and various methods to protect oneself from exposure.\n\nAfter the Sexual Revolution and the Gay Liberation in the 1960s and `70s, sex in urban gay epicenters was not only newly acceptable, but also often seen as key to gay identity and resistance to heteronormativity. AIDS brought up a renewed fear about negative media coverage and the civil rights violations that LGBT people might face from targeted quarantines and a denial of basic healthcare services. As such, the issue of safe sex was a contentious one, and any arguments criticizing frequent sex were poorly received by the majority of the community. A large sector of LGBT community leadership worried that raising awareness about AIDS and gay sex would be off-putting to the straight majority and damage the image of the subculture as a whole. Activists still deeply entrenched in the battle to protect the political gains of the past decade tended to overlook the AIDS crisis as a political attack, a topic too controversial to address, or an overreaction by self-hating gay men.\n\nThe authors of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" were aware of the political risks they took in creating the booklet: Berkowitz noted in his autobiography the possibility that their writing could be used as ammunition by homophobic institutions and leaders. However, their advocacy was motivated by the increasingly critical state of the health crisis and their shared belief in what Callen described as the danger of \"put[ting] political considerations over the tragedy of even a single gay man's death.\"\n\nBefore the AIDS epidemic, condoms were mostly advertised and used for preventing pregnancies and therefore were not considered a viable safe sex or STD prevention tool among the LGBT community: David France estimates that less than 1% of men who have sex with men in New York City used them regularly in the 1970s, despite the fact that many other sexually transmitted diseases, including cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B, were already at \"endemic\" levels. Sonnabend writes about condoms at the time: \"I think most gay men said, 'Oh thank god, that's one thing we don't have to worry about,'\" and many didn't know how to use one. However, as Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend would show them, condoms really were something to worry about and could be an easy way to prevent disease and death while continuing to have a normal and fulfilling sex life.\n\nAlong with \"Play Fair!\", its San Francisco counterpart written by a drag group called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was the first sex-positive manuals for safe sex—in other words, it did not present sex in a negative, shameful or moralistic light. Sonnabend writes in the introduction to the booklet that one of their goals was to \"explore the many different forms of sexual expression open to gay men.\" As David France later recounted, the authors actively tried to avoid condescension or arrogance in their writing (despite the fact that Callen himself had acknowledged that telling people how to have sex is inherently an arrogant thing to do), instead attempting to establish a dialogue, \"queen to queen,\" between themselves and the people for whom they created the manual. Callen even educated himself about different philosophers, including Hannah Arendt, to get an idea of the best way to productively use writing to influence people through rhetoric and written arguments. The independent and community-driven nature of this approach to LGBT-related safe sex, according to Cindy Patton, can be traced back to the \"self-help model\" promoted in the women's health movement.\n\nThe primary message of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" is 1) to use protection (i.e., condoms) during sex and 2) to limit the specific sex acts one performs to those with a lower risk of contagion. It was a model that attempted to challenge traditional anti-promiscuity and anti-gay viewpoints in previous safe sex education and AIDS prevention—as Callen and Berkowitz argued, it's what you do, not how often you do it or who you do it with. In other words, they had searched for, and come up with, what they termed the possibility of \"life-affirming sex.\"\n\nThe categories below contain summaries of the chapters of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" and the arguments presented therein:\n\nThe authors introduce the two presiding theories of AIDS transmission and present their arguments for the multifactorial model. They describe the role of CMV in causing abnormalities in immune cells, as well as the potential for gradual immune overload by semen and harmful immune complexes resulting from the binding of antibodies to antigens on other STDs. This section presents evidence against the \"new agent theory\" but acknowledges that in either case, AIDS is likely sexually transmitted and therefore the best method of prevention will be the use of protection and more critical choice in which sexual acts to perform.\n\nIn this section, Callen and Berkowitz elaborate on the multifactorial model to provide a basis for later applications of safe sex practices. They cite the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" study that found that traces of CMV were found in 94% of MSM in a New York City cohort in 1981, but later estimate that CMV was present in ¼ of sexually active gay men in 1982-83, which, when factoring in the average frequency and diversity of partners in the population of sexually active gay men in New York City, would still amount to a high number of exposures per year. The reasoning behind their support of the multifactorial theory was the concurrent epidemics of AIDS and CMV in the same sexual networks and locations; they called it the \"one common link found in all gay men with AIDS.\" They summarize the characteristics of CMV and its links to AIDS as the following:\n\nThis part of the manual stresses the fact that it's not a single infection putting people at risk, but instead repeated exposure to the virus in semen, particularly through anal-receptive intercourse. In addition to the specific cytomegalovirus in sperm, the authors argue that simply exposing the body to such high intake levels of sperm itself can present a health risk. Although the multifactorial model had been criticized for failing to account for the sudden appearance of AIDS, the authors use the fact that the rate of CMV infections in urban sexually active gay men rose significantly in last decade as evidence of the \"new\" component that accounts for the rapid increase in AIDS cases. They advise readers to get tested for CMV and describe which tests to get (e.g. antibody tests or viral isolation of CMV from urine and semen), but also acknowledge that the price of such tests ($200) and the fact that it was not routinely offered at traditional clinics and labs might make it inaccessible to most patients.\n\nIn this section, the authors stress the need for the gay male community to come together to protect itself. A central component of this was that one's own sexual health and the health of others should \"never became separated.\" They wrote that it was important to think about not only what sexual acts would put oneself in a risky position in terms of disease transmission, but also what would be dangerous for one's partner. They recognize the importance of maintaining mental control during sex, and argue that although it's easy to forget about safety in the heat of the moment, the growing threat of sickness and death should be enough to motivate people to act with foresight. Their primary piece of advice within the \"control\" subsection is not abstinence; instead, it centers around the importance of staying sober during sexual encounters in order to make informed decisions. This, Callen and Berkowitz write, means not drinking, smoking, or taking poppers before going clubbing. They also emphasize the importance of communication with one's partner in the broader discussion of maintaining control, including the need to talk about health concerns, disease status, and convince him to engage in whatever sexual acts safely.\n\nMuch of the rest of the pamphlet is dedicated to discussing the many possible forms of sexual expression available to gay and bisexual men and providing a thorough analysis of the risk associated with each particular act. This analysis is warranted by the fact that, as the authors recognized, different diseases spread through different types of contact, and specifically AIDS/CMV (as they saw it back then) is much more easily transmitted through certain sex acts.\n\n\"Note that some of these categorizations are incorrect given current knowledge about HIV transmission, and the descriptions below should not be presumed to be the medical consensus.\"\n\nCallen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by stating that, regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be, some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after being infected, whether knowingly or unknowingly, although many may be so incapacitated that sex is \"the furthest thing from their minds.\" The solution, they argue, does not involve treating people with AIDS (PWA) like lepers, as they are just as human as the rest of the population, desire the same human contact and will simply end up being unwilling to disclose their HIV status if automatic ostracism is the result. In all likelihood, the authors contend, the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS is higher than to the uninfected person, as any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromised immune system. For a person with AIDS to go to the baths or backrooms would therefore be \"extremely unwise.\"\n\nBased on the multifactorial model of AIDS transmission, the uninfected person would simply be at risk for being exposed to high levels of CMV-infected semen. However, the reality is that the risk of having sex with someone with AIDS is higher than they described because it is caused by a single virus (HIV) that PWA (and people with HIV pre-AIDS) have and uninfected people do not. Either way, they conclude in all capital letters that AIDS PATIENTS HAVE AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO ADVISE POTENTIAL PARTNERS OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS.\" It should be up to the uninfected person to make the informed decision to have sex, evaluating all the risk factors. However, sex between a PWA and an uninfected person, according to the pamphlet, would be fine if they are monogamous lovers and use protection. Given scientific evidence against casual transmission of AIDS, the authors saw no reason to discourage other forms of affection and touching.\n\n\"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" stresses the importance of separating valid medical advice from moral-based arguments disguised as medicine. In this section, the authors discuss the difficulties posed by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease, especially given that men who have sex with men, as well as transgender women, were, even before the outbreak of AIDS, often accused of having too much sex by the Moral Majority. Advice during the initial stage of the epidemic was to \"cut down\" on the frequency of sex, without giving any thought to the type of sex. The authors describe their attempt to correct this incomplete advice by educating people on what types of sexual acts are higher risk as a way to present them with an alternative to abstinence/self-denial and encourage a sex-positive mentality.\n\nThe example they provide in the pamphlet is a man who decides to limit the number of times he has sex to 12 per year, but does not change what he does with his partners or how he does it (e.g. with protection or not). The authors conclude that this will not prevent him from putting himself at high risk for contracting AIDS at some point during the year. They stress that sex is not a vice, and therefore giving up sex to avoid getting AIDS is not the same as giving up smoking to avoid lung cancer. It should be noted that the advice to cut down on only the frequency of sex and sexual partners was even less productive under the \"new virus model\" as opposed to the multifactorial model.\n\nCallen and Berkowitz also bring up the fact that anonymous sex was highly criticized by the straight majority, but telling one's partner one's name will not make a difference to the infectivity of the pathogen. However, they recognize anonymity during sex might make the issue of protecting one's partner from disease transmission less pressing and/or personally important.\n\nThis section of the manual also highlights the importance of talking to one's physicians and making sure the information one gets about the disease is reliable by looking at multiple sources and doing individual research. They conclude: \"If we are to celebrate our gayness and get on with Gay Liberation, we must stay healthy. To stay healthy, we must realize that the issue isn't gayness or sex; the issue is simply disease.\"\n\nThe penultimate section of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was added after both Sonnabend and Richard Dworkin read it over and were struck by the complete absence of the word \"love\" in a manual about safe sex. Afterwards, the authors realized the potential it had as a moral and emotional justification for the use of protection and added this section, starting by admitting, \"It came as quite a shock to us to find that we had written almost 40 pages on sex without mentioning the word \"love\" once.\" David France explain that Callen and Berkowitz both \"cared deeply for their vast sexual communities\" and Sonnabend agreed, saying, \"you could really love somebody even for just four hours. Genuinely.\"\n\nIn this section, the authors describe the years post-Sexual Revolution as a time when sex and love were accepted as being distinct and that STD epidemics were a product of this newfound freedom, not just within the LGBT community but everywhere. If one cares about one's partner or accepts sex as something that is \"interpersonally meaningful,\" they argue, that should be motivation enough to use protection for the sake of both one's partner and oneself. The authors build on their feminist critique, claiming that the challenge facing the gay male community is to undo their \"socialization as men\" who are \"trained to destroy\" and to compete with one another and instead promote a community of people who take care of one another. Maybe, they argue, the goal of gay male liberation is to be able to love one's partner even when society teaches them not to. \"Men loving men was the basis of gay male liberation, but we have now created 'cultural institutions' in which love or even affection can be totally avoided,\" they write. They also pose the question to their readers: \"Have we modified the belief that we could dance our way to liberation into the belief that we could somehow fuck our way there?\" They end with this statement: \"If you Love the person you are fucking with -- even for one night -- you will not want to make them sick. Maybe affection is our best protection.\"\n\nIn the pamphlet's short section of \"closing thoughts,\" the authors reiterate that \"the party of the `70s is over\" and that ignorance in the baths and backrooms has now turned into a form of oppression. They add that, because many members of the LGBT community are not well educated or able to afford successive healthcare visits, it's doubly important to disseminate correct, reliable information was widely as possible. Their final call is not for an end to sex, but an end to \"sex without responsibility.\"\n\nAlthough MSM showed a wide range of responses to the epidemic in terms of sexual practices—some became celibate, others became monogamous, and many made no changes whatsoever --, behavioral studies showed \"dramatic declines\" in risk-related sexual behavior in white gay men, as well as increased frequency in condom use (from 1% in 1981 to 70% in 1987), and the impetus for this change, particularly the increase in condom use, has been partially attributed to sex-positive educational materials like \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic.\" The increasing practice of safe sex is reflected in HIV transmission statistics, which show a peak of new infection rates from between 1983–85, followed by a significant decrease in the following years. It must be noted these trends were primarily seen in white MSM: infection rates in Black and Latino MSM continued to rise or stayed static in the later half of the 1980s. Gay rights activist and writer Jeffrey Escoffier summarizes the impact of this grassroots safe sex advocacy:\n\nEven before mainstream, government-regulated condom campaigns became common in New York City (in the 1990s), the LGBT community began promoting condom use among its members to protect from AIDS. France recounts watching \"a team of lesbians on a flatbed truck lovingly hurl the things [condoms] into the air like rose petals over the heads of their gay brothers\" on Christopher Street. Condoms rose in popularity \"as fast as Madonna's debut album\" and it soon became common to see \"Hudson River white fish\"—i.e., used condoms floating in the river—in popular cruising spots for MSM. Condom sales spikes in the mid 80s (20% between 1986-1987) and companies began producing them in varying sizes, colors, and flavors and expanding their advertisements to appeal to gay men, among other demographics. Due to the awakening to safe sex in the LGBT community, condom use in San Francisco MSM between 1983 and 1987 quadrupled, and as a result, rectal gonorrhea diagnoses dropped significantly, up to 80% between `83 and `86 in a cohort of New York City primarily white MSM. Despite the lack of concrete statistics about the sexual practices of queer men in the 1980s, David France estimates that tens of thousands of lives were saved by the safe sex movement. \nHowever, the authors of \"How to Have Sex\" also faced significant barriers in disseminating their message, most of which was due to their message's lack of popularity within the majority of the LGBT community. All of their applications for grants were rejected, and attempts to create a broader educational campaign built around the booklet's teachings were blocked by both the New York City government and organizations within the LGBT community. The Gay Men's Health Crisis offered to buy all 5,000 pamphlets and promote them, with the condition that any mentions of the multifactorial model be removed from the writing. The authors refused. Berkowitz recounts in an interview it being \"infuriating\" that in 1985, the city still hadn't adopted any standard safe sex education.\n\nThe advent of safe sex in urban gay male populations came too late for many people: by 1983, more than 1,476 people had died from AIDS and David France estimated that as much as half of all MSM in New York City and San Francisco had been infected. Retrospective analysis by the CDC found that there were between 250,000-300,000 people living with HIV in the United States in 1983, and the number of people newly infected between `83-`84 was around 150,000). However, the model set forth by Callen and Berkowitz at least provided the possibility of a \"return to intimacy\" for people with AIDS, which, despite being based on a now-defunct notion of how the syndrome arose, was important in combating the social death that many PWA faced after diagnosis. \n\"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was also credited with laying a foundation for safe sex education outside of the LGBT community. Duke Global Health Institute founder Michael Merson describes lessons from this grassroots movement—e.g. the importance of contraceptives over abstinence—as being key in \"a generation of prevention approaches to follow,\" including PEPFAR (which was criticized for its emphasis on abstinence) and The Global Fund. \nIn 1983, it was generally accepted knowledge that AIDS was at least indirectly sexually transmitted. However, it was the stigma and lack of education around this fact that made the frankness and sex-positivity \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" all the more important. The fact that the authors did not advocate for abstinence, were open to people's differing personal preferences, and emphasized that gay sex, anal-receptive sex in particular, was not dangerous or immoral in and of itself, made it much more effective and well-received by the gay community. According to Jeffrey Escoffier, given that many members of the LGBT community saw gay sex as transgressive and empowering, safe sex, particularly the use of condoms that had been traditionally seen as only necessary for heterosexual sex, was therefore a \"normalization\" of gay sex and a loss of gay power. Thus, safe sex education that did not detract from the uniqueness and power in gay sex was vital; Sonnabend himself recognizes that \"perhaps the most valuable contribution of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was its ability to propose condom use in a manner that was able to celebrate sex.\"\n\nIn 1981, when Sonnabend was formulating the multifactorial theory of HIV/AIDS transmission, the available data did not clearly disprove either his model or the new agent theory, and there was no time to wait for the debate to be cleared up before offering concrete prevention methods. It was widely accepted that AIDS was sexually transmitted, and the fraught political environment made both models unappealing for different reasons. Sonnabend argued that \"to propose without supporting evidence that any minority group might be carrying a potentially fatal new, mutant virus is unconscionable\"; however, the multifactorial model also came under attack for being homophobic and moralistic in its approach to frequent and impersonal sex. Because the virus seemed almost entirely isolated to MSM in the early 1980s, it was difficult to see how and why a single virus would target a single demographic group. The new agent theory was adopted by the Gay Men's Health Crisis but was also, according to Callen and Berkowitz, a tool used by the religious right to justify homophobia and dialogues condemning sex outside of marriage, as well as a reflection of the \"Western tradition of blaming calamity on the Third World.\"\n\nDespite the fact that \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was based on incomplete knowledge of the causes of AIDS, the advice given in the 40 pages was relevant to HIV/AIDS prevention, at least when it comes to sex-related modes of transmission. Its central argument was to avoid getting semen and CMV in one's rectum, although, as the authors pointed out in the first section of the booklet, CMV could be substituted for the new, unidentified retrovirus that was hypothesized to cause AIDS.\n\nHowever, there are several instances in which the advice is inaccurate and no longer a part of safe sex education. The authors put more emphasis than necessary on the lifestyle argument—that there are inherent behavioral patterns in the MSM community responsible for causing AIDS—and failed to recognize that a single exposure could result in infection. Under the multifactorial model, kissing a PWA, rimming and swallowing during oral sex all appear more risky than they actually are; on the other hand, having sex with a person with AIDS was more risky than the multifactorial theory suggested because a single contact can result in seroconversion. The multifactorial model was also unnecessarily critical of promiscuity (although the authors make sure to clarify that promiscuity is only problematic given high preexisting rates of STDs in the sexual network). In 2008, Sonnabend defended the pamphlet's focus on promiscuity, arguing that high quantities of unprotected sex were a \"very significant health hazard\" whether or not one put their faith in the multifactorial model, and, indeed, a high frequency of sexual encounters was still relevant given that it increased the probability of contact with an HIV+ person. \nThe multifactorial model also gave the authors and their writing a certain degree of hope that the endpoint to AIDS was not necessarily death (which it seemed to be at the time): they believed that stopping exposure to semen and CMV after infection could improve the health of the infected individual. The asymptomatic latency period had not yet been defined, and accounts of people with AIDS, including Berkowitz himself, maintaining a relatively healthy standard of living post-diagnosis convinced the authors of the importance of continued use of protection among people with AIDS who have sex. As is now common knowledge, once one has been infected with HIV it is almost impossible to completely rid one's body of the virus. However, the advice to continue using protection after being diagnosed was important in not only preventing future transmission to uninfected people but also to protecting the person with AIDS from being exposed to more pathogens through sex.\n\nHistorians, as well as the authors themselves, recognize that the creation of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was only possible given their belief in the multifactorial model. Safe sex advocates would have been much less likely to propose condom use had they known that a single exposure was enough to contract HIV. For proponents of the single agent theory, \"to suggest condom use would be tantamount to suggesting that one place a thin latex film between oneself and certain death,\" as Sonnabend put it. Following the discovery of the HIV and the almost unanimous acceptance of the single agent theory in the scientific community, the authors have acknowledged the inaccuracies in their safe sex manual, while pointing out its continued importance.\n\nBerkowitz describes \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" as being more conservative than it needed to be, given that it operated on the sole principle that gay men should avoid getting sperm in their own or their partner's rectum without knowing the other's status. He says, \"at least we figured out very early that it was the recipient of anal sex that we needed to warn — and that we needed to celebrate.\"\n\nAfter the pamphlet went through numerous drafts and editions, Callen and Berkowitz had difficulty finding somewhere to publish it, given its controversial subject matter and point of view. It was rejected by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a prominent LGBT community health group that promoted the single virus theory, as well as by the state of New York when they reached out for help with publication. The authors collected donations from the LGBT community in New York City to fund the printing, and received a significant donation from philanthropist and HIV/AIDS activist Randall Klose. Callen even contributed his own tax refund to the cause. In May 1983, they ordered 5,000 copies from Tower Press and distributed the copies around gay social establishments in the city, including bars, bookstores, clubs and other shops. The copyright is attributed to \"News From the Front Publications,\" which was created by Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend founded in 1983 for the very purpose of printing and distributing their booklet. This independent publication method reflects the grassroots, personal nature of the pamphlet: as Sonnabend wrote, \"HTHS originated entirely in the community of people with and at risk for AIDS, from individuals with no organizational affiliation.\"\n\n\"How to Have Sex\" was met with a mixed response from its target audience (queer men/MSM) in New York City. Sales exceeded what the authors had expected, and within two weeks of the initial publication they had ordered a second batch, and, soon after, a third to meet popular demand. David France describes himself and his friends being \"absorbed\" by the material: \"the pool table sat idle as a dozen of us passed around copies, hungry for guidance through the terror that sex was causing.\" It has been lauded as the \"first sex-positive guide to practicing safe sex\" and is widely regarded as revolutionizing the tone of safe sex education, particularly in the LGBT community. The only real sacrifices in behavior that it required were abstaining from substance use in sex-related situations, rather than abstinence from any form of sex itself. Most readers reacted well to the positive and casual tone of the writing, as well as the frank descriptions of sexual acts. Edmund White, author of \"The Joys of Gay Sex\", said of the pamphlet: \"this is the sanest, most sensible advice I've read yet about AIDS\" and Dennis Altman, author of \"The Homosexualization of America\" said, \"at last: a response to the effect of aids on our lives that goes beyond fears and myths to suggest positive actions.\" David France called it \"a survival guide for the plague years.\" Many gay men were simply glad for any concrete advice in the midst of such confusion, particularly advice that did not present celibacy as the only safe option.\n\nAs expected, \"How to Have Sex\" did receive significant criticism from other gay men and gay organizations for its critical take on promiscuity. Callen and Berkowitz had attempted to tone down their critical tone from their first major publication, \"We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity\" in a 1982 issue of the New York Native, which had harshly condemned the \"excessiveness\" and \"pigging out\" that was occurring in the gay nightclub scene. They incorporate consistent affirmation of gay sex throughout the forty pages, including sentences like the following:\n\nMany gay community members and leaders saw the writing in \"How to Have Sex\" as moralistic and attributed the advice against some types of sex to internalized homophobia, self-hatred and an \"anti-sexual sense of guilt.\" A response written by Michael Lynch and Bill Lewis in the Toronto Politic, a Canadian gay newspaper, criticized Callen and Berkowitz for blowing the epidemic out of proportion and allowing the medical community to \"pathologize\" gay men, and the authors faced frequent accusations of victim-blaming and siding with the religious right. It was not an easy message for some gay men to receive: in an interview for Berkowitz' biographical film, Sex Positive, Larry Kramer described it as a blast of \"cold water in the face.\"\n\nHowever, all three authors firmly believed in the importance of disseminating their message despite negative reactions. Callen wrote in his book \"Surviving AIDS\" that \"to be attacked for trying to save the lives of others was deeply wounding. But we felt we had no choice.\" Sonnabend argued that political correctness and the \"desire to be nonjudgemental\" were beginning to interfere with medical practitioners' primary commitment to take care of their patients and was becoming a public health issue. Callen even applauded the negative responses to their advocacy published in the New York Native, because it ended up causing debate and dramatically widening the audience and popularity of \"How to Have Sex\" in an Epidemic. \"It turns out historically to have been one of the advantages of our status as heretics,\" he was quoted saying in \"How to Survive a Plague.\"\n\nCallen and Berkowitz do address the personal and political implications of their safe sex advice, specifically the loss of autonomy and joy the community might experience from having to police sexual behavior. In \"We Know Who We Are\" they wrote:\n\nIn his memoir, Berkowitz wrote, \"there was little chance we would water down our safe sex manifesto to make it more presentable for the general public in the Reagan era.\" Although he and Callen both stressed that \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was not intended for straight audiences, its popularity and importance as a foundational safe sex manifesto ensured that it got at least some level of attention beyond the LGBT community of New York City. According to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine archives, the pamphlet was purchased by numerous public libraries (twelve known examples) and universities, as well as seven known high schools, a surprising number of which were in traditionally conservative states that still had functioning sodomy laws. The frank description of gay sex did not seem to dissuade more mainstream institutions, although it is unclear whether they were aware of the explicit content of the manual before purchasing it.\n\nThe primary readership of \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" was still gay men in New York City, but knowledge of the work spread to people of all sexualities around the country, and even, in some cases, internationally. Soon after its initial publication, the booklet was given a review in the New York Review of Books, and later a newscaster came from West Germany to interview the authors about their work. Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also received response letters from around the country and from international readers.\n\nSocial scientists have credited \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" and a 1982 pamphlet called \"Play Fair!\" by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence as the first literature to recommend safe sex as a strategy for reducing the risk of contracting the transmitting agent which causes AIDS. A similar AIDS education manual, entitled \"Can We Talk?\" was published by the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club in San Francisco at the beginning of 1983, although it is less often credited as being foundational for safe sex.\n\nDespite the negative press that \"How to Have Sex\" received for what many perceived as a criticism of promiscuity, many queer theorists have acknowledged the importance of the pamphlet and others like it to the evolution of the broader LGBT rights movement. The politics at the time were fraught, and the AIDS epidemic revealed what Callen and Berkowitz described as the danger of having \"a positive political force [i.e. the LGBT liberation] tied to a dangerous lifestyle [i.e. promiscuity without condom use].\" The viewpoint presented in the booklet is one that attempted to challenge the institutions that had arisen in the urban gay male community, including bathhouses and backrooms, that had an economic \"stake in keeping us promiscuous,\" according to the authors. There was a common notion in the community at the time that STDs were supposed to be what Edmund White called \"red badges of courage in a war against a sex negative society,\" but as the cost of life from these diseases rose, members of that same community saw the need to change practices to make sex safer, and \"How to Have Sex\" is a result of that phenomenon. Thus, it is part of the shift in behavior and mentality from the 70s to the 80s resulting directly from the AIDS epidemic. The following quote from \"We Know Who We Are\" demonstrates the authors' call to action:\n\nAlong with buddy programs, The Denver Principles, the San Francisco model of care, and activism occurring around the country, pamphlets like \"How to have Sex\" and \"Play Fair!\" have been described as key elements of the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement. Sonnabend called the method presented in the manual a \"do it yourself\" approach that \"did not wait for others to take care of pressing needs.\" As Berkowitz explained, having the power to control one's sex life and to prevent oneself from getting sick was the essence of self-empowerment at a time when AIDS was taking away gay men's sexual freedom and ability to enact a rebellion against heteronormativity through sex.\n\nAlong with Play Fair!, \"How to have Sex\" was among the first safe sex educational materials produced and widely disseminated that addressed the subject in a positive and affirming light. David France described the authors' method and aims to modify the behaviors of an entire subculture as something so radical that, had they discussed its feasibility with social scientists beforehand, they might have been dissuaded from attempting it. That said, Berkowitz has lamented that the grassroots origins of safe sex were rapidly forgotten as it became increasingly touted as an invention from experts in the scientific community.\n\n\"How to Have Sex\" in an Epidemic is evidence of a larger trend occurring in the 1980s and 1990s in which the impetus for treatment and prevention for HIV/AIDS came directly from the infected communities. As Alan Brandt argues, the AIDS epidemic did more than any other to blur the line between the healthcare field and the people they treated; community-based care became a central model for public and global health efforts related to this particular disease. Social scientists have recognized the importance of \"vernacular knowledge\" from within the gay community, such as the vocabulary used in \"How to Have Sex in an Epidemic\" being brought into a broader epidemiological/scientific context, because it was this intimate knowledge of sexual behavior among MSM that gave Callen and Berkowitz the authority to address the subject and the ability to do so in a way that appealed to their audience and avoided condescension. Queer theorist Douglas Crimp wrote: \n\nOn a practical level, this sort of grassroots prevention advocacy was necessary because, in the early years of the epidemic when little was known about transmission and AIDS panic was highly prevalent, many mainstream medical institutions refused to offer care to people with AIDS or did so in a substandard manner. Both the booklet itself and the partnership of the contributors (i.e., between Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend) helped lay the foundation for greater collaboration between scientists and the affected communities they study.\n\n\"How to have Sex in an Epidemic\" was an important medical text in that it gave straight healthcare professionals and mainstream institutions more in depth knowledge of gay culture in general, and sexual culture of MSM specifically, including a variety of niche sex acts. This information was critical for practitioners and researchers in their attempts to understand the risks associated with contracting HIV.\n\n"}
{"id": "22723009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22723009", "title": "Information governance", "text": "Information governance\n\nInformation governance, or IG, is the management of information at an organization. Information governance balances the use and security of information. Information governance helps with legal compliance, operational transparency, and reducing expenditures associated with legal discovery. An organization can establish a consistent and logical framework for employees to handle data through their information governance policies and procedures. These policies guide proper behavior regarding how organizations and their employees handle electronically stored information (ESI).\n\nInformation governance encompasses more than traditional records management. It incorporates information security and protection, compliance, data governance, electronic discovery, risk management, privacy, data storage and archiving, knowledge management, business operations and management, audit, analytics, IT management, master data management, enterprise architecture, business intelligence, big data, data science, and finance.\n\nRecords management deals with the creation, retention and storage and disposition of records. A record can either be a physical, tangible object, or digital information such as a database, application data, and e-mail. The lifecycle was historically viewed as the point of creation to the eventual disposal of a record. As data generation exploded in recent decades, and regulations and compliance issues increased, traditional records management failed to keep pace. A more comprehensive platform for managing records and information became necessary to address all phases of the lifecycle, which led to the advent of information governance.\n\nIn 2003 the Department of Health in England introduced the concept of broad-based information governance into the National Health Service, publishing version 1 of an online performance assessment tool with supporting guidance. The NHS IG Toolkit is now used by over 30,000 NHS and partner organisations, supported by an e-learning platform with some 650,000 users.\n\nIn 2008, ARMA International introduced the Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®, or \"The Principles\" and the subsequent \"The Principles\" Information Governance Maturity Model. \"The Principles\" identify the critical hallmarks of information governance. As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use \"The Principles\" to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units. ARMA International recognized that a clear statement of \"Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®\" (\"The Principles\") would guide:\n\n\nInformation governance goes beyond retention and disposition to include privacy, access controls, and other compliance issues. In electronic discovery, or e-discovery, relevant data in the form of electronically stored information is searched for by attorneys and placed on legal hold. IG includes consideration of how this data is held and controlled for e-discovery, and also provides a platform for defensible disposition and compliance. Additionally, metadata often accompanies electronically stored data and can be of great value to the enterprise if stored and managed correctly.\n\nWith all of these additional considerations that go beyond traditional records management, IG emerged as a platform for organizations to define policies at the enterprise level, across multiple jurisdictions. IG then also provides for the enforcement of these policies into the various repositories of information, data, and records.\n\nA coalition of organizations known as Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM), which was founded in 2005 to address issues related to electronic discovery and information governance, subsequently developed, as one of its projects, a resource called the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM). In 2011, EDRM, in collaboration with ARMA International, published a white paper that describes \"How the Information Governance Reference Model (IGRM) Complements ARMA International’s Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles (\"The Principles\")\" The IGRM illustrates the relationship between key stakeholders and the Information Lifecycle and highlights the transparency required to enable effective governance IGRM v3.0 Update: Privacy & Security Officers As Stakeholders.\n\nIn 2012, Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council (CGOC) developed the Information Governance Process Maturity Model, or (IGPMM). The model outlines 13 key processes in electronic discovery (e-discovery) and information management. Each process is described in terms of a maturity level from one to four – completely manual and ad hoc to greater degrees of process integration across functions and automation. In 2017, it was updated to include an emphasis on legal, privacy, information security, cloud security issues and evolving data privacy concerns, including the impact of The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)(EU).\n\nIn the past, records managers owned records management, perhaps within a compliance department at an enterprise. In order to address the broader issues surrounding records management, several other key stakeholders must be involved. Legal, IT, and Compliance tend to be the departments that touch information governance the most, though certainly other departments might seek representation. Many enterprises create information governance committees to ensure that all necessary constituents are represented and that all relevant issues are addressed.\n\nTo address retention and disposition, Records Management and Enterprise Content Management applications were developed. Sometimes detached search engines or homegrown policy definition tools were created. These were often employed at a departmental or divisional level; rarely were tools used across the enterprise. While these tools were used to define policies, they lacked the ability to enforce those policies. Monitoring for compliance with policies was increasingly challenging. Since information governance addresses so much more than traditional records management, several software solutions have emerged to include the vast array of issues facing records managers.\n\nOther available tools include:\n\nKey to IG are the regulations and laws that help to define corporate policies. Some of these regulations include:\n\n\n\n"}

On 3 February 2010, the second edition of the cast of the sculpture became one of the most expensive works of art ever sold at auction, and which is sold for about $104.3 million the most expensive sculpture, until May 2015, when another Giacometti work, \"L'Homme au doigt\", surpassed it.\n\nThe bronze sculpture depicts a lone man in mid-stride with his arms hanging at his side. The piece is described as \"both a humble image of an ordinary man, and a potent symbol of humanity\". Giacometti is said to have viewed \"the natural equilibrium of the stride\" as a symbol of \"man's own life force\".\n\nIn 1960, Giacometti was asked to be part of a public project by the Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York to plant bronze figures outside the building. He created several sculptures, with \"L'Homme qui marche I\" among them. Giacometti struggled with the project and eventually abandoned the commission. However, in 1961 he cast the life-size work in bronze and exhibited it at the Venice Biennale a year later. \"L'Homme Qui Marche I\" was created at the high point of Giacometti's mature period and represents the pinnacle of his experimentation with the human form. The piece is considered to be one of the most important works by the artist and one of the most iconic images of Modern art.\n\nEdition number one of the sculpture is located at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Edition number two belongs in a private collection. Other casts of \"L'Homme qui marche I\" include those at the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul, Alpes-Maritimes, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY, and Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nOn 3 February 2010, edition number two of the sculpture came up for auction at Sotheby's auction house in London. The piece was sold by German banking group Commerzbank, which had acquired it when it took over the Dresdner Bank in 2009. The sale of the sculpture marked the first time in 20 years that a life-size Giacometti figure of a walking man came to auction.\nIt had been estimated to sell for between £12 and £18 million, but in just eight minutes the sculpture was bought by Lily Safra, widow of the prominent Lebanese banker Edmond Safra for £58 million. Including the buyer's premium the price reached £65 million (US$103.7 million). \n\nThe piece broke the record for a Giacometti work at auction, which was set at $27.5 million by \"Grande Femme Debout II\" in 2008, and that for the most expensive sculpture sold at a public auction, which was held by the 5000-year-old \"Guennol Lioness\", sold at Sotheby's in 2007 for $57.2 m. When expressed in British pounds and when inflation is ignored, the bronze also broke the record price for an art work sold at auction which, since 2004, was held at $104.2 million (then £58.2 m) by Pablo Picasso's \"Garçon à la pipe\". The most expensive work of art sold at a public auction remained Van Gogh's \"Portrait of Dr. Gachet\", which was bought in May 1990 for $82.5 million (approx. $138.4 million in CPI-adjusted 2010 US dollars), while Jackson Pollock's \"No. 5, 1948\", which was privately sold for $140 million in 2006 (approx. $151 million in 2010 dollars), remained the most expensive work of art sold overall.\n\n"}

Note that some of these third-party applications, especially PowerAMP, decode FLAC and other formats using FFmpeg and therefore do not rely on the operating system to provide that functionality.\n\nThe Windows Mobile operating system is able to support playback of FLAC files through the use of plugins or third-party applications such as TCMP and others.

{"id": "30678123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30678123", "title": "Menggu Ziyun", "text": "Menggu Ziyun\n\nMenggu Ziyun (, \"Rimes in Mongol Script\") is a 14th-century rime dictionary of Chinese as written in the 'Phags-pa script that was used during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). The only surviving examplar of this dictionary is an 18th-century manuscript copy that belonged to Stephen Wootton Bushell (1844–1908), and is now held at the British Library (Or. 6972). As the only known example of a 'Phags-pa script dictionary of Chinese, it is important both as an aid for interpreting Yuan dynasty texts and inscriptions written in Chinese using the 'Phags-pa script, and as a source for the reconstructed pronunciation of Old Mandarin.\n\nThe British Library manuscript was acquired by the antiquarian and art historian S. W. Bushell when he worked as a physician at the British Legation in Beijing, China from 1868 to 1900, probably in 1872 during a trip to Inner Mongolia and the ruins of Shangdu, the fabled summer capital of the Yuan emperors then known as \"Xanadu\" in English. In April 1909, a year after his death, Bushell's widow, Florence Bushell, sold the manuscript to the British Museum in London, and it is now held by the British Library (shelfmark Or. 6972).\n\nThe manuscript is written on thin, brown paper which has been mounted on white backing paper and bound in two traditional stitched volumes, each 24.7 × 17.3 cm. Each folio of the manuscript is 22.5 × 28.8 cm in size, folded in half as is normal in stitch-bound volumes. The text is written in vertical columns running from left to right across the page, which is the opposite of traditional Chinese books, but follows the layout of Mongolian script and 'Phags-pa texts. The first volume comprises an unnumbered title folio and 33 numbered folios, and the second volume comprises an unnumbered title folio and 31 numbered folios, of which page 30b and 31a are blank except for the volume and page numbers. The missing section covers the rimes in \"-a\" and \"-e\", as well as the first part of the appended \"Taboo Characters\" section, which Junast and Yang Naisi have calculated should actually take up three full folios (i.e. the second volume of the original edition would have comprised 33 folios).\n\nThe manuscript does not indicate when and by whom it was copied, and there are no ownership seals. However, on the basis of tabooed characters of Qing dynasty emperors, the manuscript has been dated to the Qianlong era (1736–1795). The manuscript may be a second or third hand copy of an original Yuan dynasty edition, made by someone who did not necessarily understand the 'Phags-pa script, and so the 'Phags-pa letters are often poorly written or corrupted, and there are many transcription errors such as missing, misplaced and incorrectly written Chinese characters.\n\nBased on its format, the British Library manuscript of \"Menggu Ziyun\" is thought to be a copy of an earlier printed edition. Although no extant printed editions are known, one mid 19th century writer, Luo Yizhi 羅以智, mentions that he had seen a Yuan dynasty printed edition of the dictionary. Other Qing dynasty (1644–1912) writers mention having seen manuscript copies of the text, but the British Library manuscript is now the only known copy.\n\nThe British Library manuscript includes two prefaces in Chinese dated 1308, one by Liu Geng 劉更 and one by Zhu Zongwen 朱宗文 (Mongolian name Bayan) of Xin'an 信安 (modern Changshan County in Zhejiang). The prefaces both indicate that this edition of the dictionary was composed by Zhu Zongwen, but that it is a revised edition based on a collation of several editions that were in circulation at the time, including one edition published in Hubei and one edition published in Eastern Zhejiang. The original 'Phags-pa dictionary that is ancestral to the 1308 edition was probably compiled by imperial order soon after the 'Phags-pa script was devised in about 1269, intended for use in teaching the new script to Chinese officials.\n\nTwo late 13th century books which may be related to \"Menggu Ziyun\" are recorded in Yuan dynasty sources, one called \"Měnggǔ Yùnlüè\" 蒙古韻略 (\"Summary of the Mongol Rimes\") and one called \"Měnggǔ Yùnlèi\" 蒙古韻類 (\"Mongol Rime Categories\") that was compiled by Li Hongdao 李宏道. Although neither work is extant, it has been conjectured that they could be primary sources used by Zhu Zongwen in compiling his edition, or possibly even earlier editions of \"Menggu Ziyun\" published under a different title. A preface for \"Měnggǔ Yùnlèi\" that has survived, and it indicates that it used a system of 15 rime classes and 32 initials, which is very similar to the system used in \"Menggu Ziyun\".\n\nThe book is written in Chinese using a mixture of Chinese characters and 'Phags-pa transcription, with section titles and rime class headings given in both scripts. Only the two prefaces and the appended list of taboo characters are written entirely in Chinese characters. The title of the book in 'Phags-pa script ( \"mong xol tshi ʼwin\") is anomalous in that it does not exactly transcribe the corresponding Chinese characters (\"Měnggǔ Zìyùn\" 蒙古字韻) as \"mong xol\" is not a transcription of the Chinese characters 蒙古 (měnggǔ, meaning 'Mongol'), but is a direct phonetic representation of the Mongolian word \"mongɣol\" 'Mongol'.\n\nThe book comprises the following sections:\n\n\nThe main text comprises 813 entries ordered by rime class and initial sound. Three folios covering some 37 syllables with \"-a\" and \"-e\" rimes are missing in the extant manuscript, and so it is thought that the original text would have comprised about 850 entries in total. Each entry consists of a syllable written in 'Phags-pa script at the top, below which are a list of Chinese characters representable by this 'Phags-pa syllable, ordered according to the four traditional Chinese tones (\"level\", \"rising\", \"falling\" and \"entering\"). The 'Phags-pa script does not indicate tonal differences so Chinese characters with the same pronunciation but different tones are represented using the same 'Phags-pa syllable. A total of 9118 Chinese characters are given under the surviving 813 entries, although as Chinese characters may have more than one pronunciation, some characters are included under multiple entries.\n\nThe entries in \"Menggu Ziyun\" are arranged by the fifteen rime classes listed at the start of the dictionary, and within each rime class by rime subclass (there are 71 subclasses in total, as shown in the table below). Within each rime subclass entries are ordered according to the thirty-six traditional initial onsets.\n\nThe rime classes in \"Menggu Ziyun\" follow those given in \"Gǔjīn Yùnhuì Jǔyào\" 古今韻會舉要, a lexicographical compendium originally compiled by Huang Gongshao 黃公紹 (died 1297), and published in an abridged form by Xiong Zhong 熊忠 in 1297. However, the Chinese characters under each entry may be based on \"Xīnkān Yùnlüè\" 新刊韻略, a rime book compiled by Wang Wenyu 王文郁 during the late Jin dynasty (1115–1234) (the text is known from a manuscript copy of an edition published in 1229).\n\nThe 36 initials are a traditional classification of initial onsets used in Chinese books dating back to the Tang dynasty (618–907), but by the Yuan dynasty they represented an idealized phonetic system that did not accurately reflect the Old Mandarin language that the 'Phags-pa script was designed to represent. The discrepancy between the theoretical and actual phonology of Yuan dynasty Chinese is indicated by certain peculiarities in the use of 'Phags-pa letters to represent the 36 initials in \"Menggu Ziyun\":\n\n\nThis use of variant forms of the letters \"fa\", \"ha\", \"sha\" and \"ya\" for different initials is not reflected in surviving inscriptions in the 'Phags-pa script, and is probably an attempt by Zhu Zongwen to artificially distinguish historical phonetic differences that were no longer valid in Yuan dynasty Old Mandarin.\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}

By 1985 Momart had gained a solid reputation amongst the commercial galleries and artists and started to introduce its credentials to the public sector such as the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Gallery, Tate, Royal Academy and other UK based art institutions.\n\nIn 1985, Momart commissioned the UK’s first fine art vehicle with temperature control and air ride suspension and carried out its first museum job on behalf of the Royal Academy - a Henry Moore exhibition. Momart was by then able to undertake all of the transport handling requirements completely in-house, including making site visits to the individual lenders where required, case making, transport of the empty cases to the lenders, pack on site and delivery of the case loan to the borrower.\n\nFrom 1988 Momart expanded the services to include the international movement of artworks on behalf of both commercial and museum clients overseas. This prompted close analysis and investigation of the various case making options and specifications and in 1991, in collaboration with Tate, the company assisted with the development and the standard specification for museum cases for touring exhibitions and for sending artworks worldwide. This was then presented at the Art in Transit Conference in Washington DC.\n\nMomart’s client base continued to expand. In the late 1980s the company started working for the Royal Collection and, in 1993, in recognition of the high quality of service provided by Momart, Her Majesty The Queen appointed Momart as a Royal warrant holder.\n\nIn 2003 Momart invested in new premises in Leyton, with new plant and equipment and room for expansion. This included a new state-of-the-art workshop, storage facilities and transport office with Hackney remaining as the office base for the project coordination, administration and some satellite warehousing. This investment improved efficiency and capacity for increased storage business. In the same year Momart was granted Listed Agent status with the Department for Transport (DfT) allowing certified Momart employees to carry out hand search procedures on client artworks to avoid the need for X-raying at the airport of departure.\n\nIn 2008 Momart was acquired by Falkland Islands Holdings (FIH) the international services group that owns services businesses focused on transport and logistics. Following the acquisition, Momart's key management and staff has continued to work within the group to drive the company’s continued expansion, particularly in rapidly growing overseas markets. In that same year Momart’s administrative offices were moved from Hackney to Whitechapel from where the company operated all of the administration, coordination, shipping, finance, IT services.\n\nIn 2009 HMRC granted Momart the then unique privilege amongst fine art transport companies to undertake all of its customs procedures in-house. Couple of years later, in 2011, Momart has been certified as an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) enabling the company to simplify customs bureaucracy and speed up passage within the EU for their clients.\n\nIn 2013 the company relocated its head office to South Quay, East London where it currently resides.\n\nIn 2016 Momart expanded its storage facilities in Leyton, East London, with a new purpose-built unit providing additional 2,500 square metres of specialist art storage space.\n\nIn 2001 Momart and five other respected international fine art transport agents founded the professional association ARTIM, whose members monitor each other's service levels both professionally and financially. ARTIM comprises the leading fine art agents worldwide who have the highest standards of service. Agents wishing to join ARTIM have to be voted in with a majority vote by the Founders’ Committee before becoming members. The association has gained much respect due to the calibre of the membership and although it cannot be used as an advertising tool in any way, offers great mutual support and benefits to its members and thereby to its clients and to the art world as a whole.\n\nIn the early hours of 24 May 2004 a fire broke out at the Cromwell industrial estate in Leyton, east London. According to the fire investigation report, the flames that caught between 1.45 am and 3.15 am that morning were started deliberately, after burglars broke into a unit located at the extreme south-western corner of the estate and leased to an individual business repairing consumer electronics. \n\nThe fire spread through the adjoining units at the estate, eventually reaching and destroying a warehouse then operated by Momart. The blaze destroyed more than 100 works by some of Britain's leading contemporary artists including Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Helen Chadwick and others. Many of those works were owned by Charles Saatchi, the country's biggest collector of modern art. \n\nArt industry insiders noted at the time that the insurance value of the works lost in the fire would be many times their initial purchase price, and that a comparable rise could be expected in the market values of the remaining (and future) works by artists whose works were lost. The total value of artworks lost was estimated at between £30 and £50 million.\n\nA number of artists, in a joint action with several insurance firms, alleged negligence and pursued a legal case against Momart. The case was settled out of court in a mediated agreement for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the order of “tens of millions of pounds”.\n\nThe tradition of the Christmas card goes back to 1984 when the first object – a festive card – was designed for the company by Bruce McLean. Since then Momart collaborated on this project with many of the top British and international artists. The complete series of Momart Christmas card is now part of the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate.\n\nThe artists represented in past Christmas cards are:\n\n"}

They claim to be against both Marxism and capitalism, proposing a concept of \"social justice\" economics, following the third positionist ideology.\n\nThe members of \"Noua Dreaptă\" revere the leader of the Iron Guard in the 1930s, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. \"Noua Dreaptă\" members refer to him as \"Căpitanul\" (\"The Captain\"), which is what Codreanu's supporters called him during his lifetime.\n\nThe stated ultimate political aim of \"Noua Dreaptă\" is to restore Greater Romania, which represented Romania at its greatest geographic expanse before World War II. The group also states it is strongly opposed to the principles of representative democracy, which it sees as an \"inadequate\" form of government. Some individual members are monarchists.\n\n\"Noua Dreaptă\" is registered as a political party since 2015. The number of members is undocumented, but it is estimated from 1000 to 2000.\n\nSome members have also engaged in violence. Incidents have been specifically reported involving physical attacks by \"Noua Dreaptă\" members against Mormons and gays.\n\nAmong other actions, the organization attempts to attract supporters through publicity campaigns aimed against what it sees as foreign and without any connections with the Romanian traditional heritage (and therefore negative) cultural influences - such as Valentine's Day.\n\n\"Noua Dreaptă\" was part of the European National Front, an umbrella group of far-right nationalist organizations, many of which can be characterized as Fascist. The \"Noua Dreaptă\" web site includes a column of \"links of interest\" to numerous extreme nationalist organizations throughout Europe, including the following:\n\n\n\"Noua Dreaptă\" is also reported to have ties to the following political groups:\n\n\n\"Noua Dreaptă\" uses imagery associated with \"legionarism\", the ideology of the extreme nationalist and anti-Semitic interwar Iron Guard, which roughly paralleled the Fascist and Nazi movements in Italy and Germany, respectively. The group's symbol, for example — the Celtic cross (usually drawn on a green background) — is reminiscent of the insignia of the Iron Guard.\n\n\"Noua Dreaptă\" has aligned itself with organizations elsewhere in Europe with strongly anti-Semitic views, although it has not focused its efforts against Romania's currently small Jewish community. Rather, the group has concentrated its rhetoric and efforts against the ethnic Hungarians, Roma (Gypsies), sexual minorities and minority religious faiths.\n\nIts anti-democratic and anti-constitutional views and statements made them a permanent target of surveillance by the Directorate for the Defense of the Constitution, a department of the domestic intelligence service.\n\nIn May 2006, dozens of \"Noua Dreaptă\" members were arrested by police after trying to violently disrupt the GayFest pride parade in Bucharest. Police also used tear gas to disperse counterprotesters led by individuals identified as \"Noua Dreaptă\" members.\n\nOn 15 March 2008, on the National Day of Hungary, \"Noua Dreaptă\" organized an anti-Hungarian rally in Cluj-Napoca — an action which, after group members attacked and beat an ethnic Hungarian celebrator, led UDMR leader Marko Bela to criticize Cluj's mayor Emil Boc for approving it.

{"id": "35290988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35290988", "title": "Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)", "text": "Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)\n\nThe Original vampires, in the universe of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"The Originals\", are a family of vampires from which all current vampires descend, as well as being the most powerful and indestructible of their kind. In Autumn 1001 AD, after the death of her youngest son Henrik at the hands of werewolves, the powerful witch Esther performed an occult blood ritual in order to protect her five remaining children—(Finn, Elijah, Niklaus, Kol, and Rebekah)—and her husband, Mikael. The ritual formed her family into the first vampires. Then the whole family scattered across the world.\n\nThe family comes from 10th century Viking-era Europe, from the Kingdom of Norway where a young witch named Esther and her sister Dahlia were captured by Viking raiders. They were the only survivors and were kept alive so Dahlia could aid them by using her witchcraft. Esther was allowed to live freely. She turned her back on her magical heritage to marry Mikael, a wealthy landowner and powerful Viking warrior. She and her sister Dahlia, who since childhood had been her best friend, had sworn an oath to protect each other always and forever. They used to hum the song of the starlings together. Dahlia was distraught that Esther would rather lay with their captors than escape with her, as she lived like a slave. A year later Esther discovers she is barren, and her desire for children ended in failure. Desperate, Esther turned for help to her sister. Dahlia performed the ritual at a high price, and Esther became fertile. She gave birth to a daughter named Freya, who was quickly followed by a boy named Finn. By the time they left the Old World for the New World, Esther was pregnant with their third child, a boy named Elijah. Mikael was a good husband and a doting father, who adored his children but especially loved his daughter Freya. However, during Esther's third pregnancy and while Mikael was away, Dahlia came to collect her price; the first child of the first generation, just as Esther had promised. She had also promised that she would give up every first child for every generation to come. Dahlia took Freya, and Esther lied to Mikael, telling him their daughter died of the plague and that she burned the body to stop its spread.\n\nNot wanting to lose any other children to Dahlia, Mikael and Esther, along with Finn, unborn Elijah, and Esther's friend and mentor Ayana, left Europe for the Americas, where several Viking colonies already existed. There, they settled in a village on the location of the future town of Mystic Falls in Virginia. Their neighbours were powerful werewolf warriors, and they quickly became a part of the society. Mikael became a fierce warrior who helped the werewolves in battle while Ayana became the village healer and taught Esther how to use her magic. Esther quickly became a very powerful witch, even considered by some as being the most powerful of her time. However, the loss of Freya had badly hurt Mikael, and he grew distant from his wife. Eventually, Esther took a liking to the young werewolf leader of the village, Ansel. The two begun an affair, as Mikael still neglected Esther. Esther eventually became pregnant with Ansel's child; and, realizing what Mikael would do to them if he ever found out, she returned to her husband. When she gave birth to a third boy, Niklaus, it renewed his hope for a family. Three more children would be born to Mikael and Esther; two sons, Kol and Henrik, and a daughter, Rebekah. However, Mikael had become harsher as a result of Freya's loss. While he loved his children he wanted them to be fierce warriors, and his children came to fear him. To prevent Mikael from finding out her wedlock son's nature, Esther gave Klaus a cursed pendant, which weakened him and prevented him from triggering his curse. This led him to be viewed badly by Mikael, and he suffered the brunt of his violence. Esther also forbade Ansel from seeing their son; but the werewolf remained close, knowing that Klaus would one day trigger his curse and need him. Despite Mikael's contempt for Klaus, the family was a close one. When Klaus was abused Esther taught him to hum a song, sung by the starlings she'd brought to the new world long ago, the song that her sister Dahlia and she used to hum.\n\nHowever, the family's happiness came to an end when Klaus and Henrik, fascinated by the werewolves, snuck out of the caves to see them turn on the full moon, which was forbidden by their village's laws. Henrik was killed by the turned wolves. Desperate to protect their remaining children but refusing to run again, Mikael and Esther planned to use magic to prevent them from being hurt. Mikael had Esther turn him and their children into beings faster and stronger than werewolves, with their own fangs to attack, and heightened senses, and unable to be truly killed. Esther, upon her husband's request, called on the power of the sun for life, and the ancient white oak tree for immortality to make her children stronger and immortal while also using the magically spelled blood of a doppelganger to allow them to be reborn as a powerful new species. Mikael and his five remaining children turned while Esther remained a witch. However, for every new strength, a weakness plagued them, the sun that granted life would burn them and keep them inside until dark, vervain that grew on the white oak tree could burn them and prevent mind compulsion, while neighbors who had once invited them into their homes could now keep them out unless they are invited, and wood from the white oak tree is the one thing that can take their immortal lives away, by killing them. The worst of the weaknesses was the terrible hunger for blood (as the thing that had made them vampires, it was the thing they craved above all else). They had become the first of the vampire. In their hunger, they massacred half of their village. When Klaus made his first human kill, he triggered his werewolf curse, revealing his mother's infidelity. In his rage, Mikael slaughtered half the village before killing Ansel himself. He then forced his wife to suppress Klaus's werewolf side by using the blood of the doppelganger. Furious at his mother's betrayal, Klaus killed her and blamed his step-father for her death. Mikael fled from their village in his rage, followed by Finn and Kol. After burying their mother, Elijah, Klaus and Rebekah also left their hometown.\n\nDespite originating in 10th century pre-Christianized Norway, most members of the family (all but Freya, Finn, Kol, and Henrik) carry non-Scandinavian names. The rest, apart from Niklaus, carry biblical Hebrew names: Mikael, Esther, Elijah, and Rebekah. The name Mikaelson, or any variants, would likely be anachronistic in 10th century Norway.\n\nMikael is the patriarch of the Mikaelson family. He is portrayed by Sebastian Roché.\n\nMikael was searching for Klaus and the rest of his family for a thousand years. He desired to kill Klaus, in order to get revenge for the murder of his wife and him being framed for it. He always had a bad relationship with Klaus, but caring enough to save him by turning him into a vampire but otherwise being hard on him when he was growing up. Unlike the rest of children who fell inline, Klaus was the black sheep of the family and acted differently, this was because he was the product of an affair Klaus' mother had with a werewolf. As such, Mikael was condescending, cold and abusive towards Klaus for no apparent reason, though Mikael tried to justify this by claiming he was trying to toughen Klaus up. This treatment contributed greatly to Klaus' narcissism, hunger for power, paranoia and psychosis.\n\nMikael was imprisoned in a coffin by Bonnie's mother Abby, when he came to Mystic Falls looking for Elena when she was a small child. He wanted to kill the Petrova doppelgänger in order to prevent Klaus from breaking the curse and creating a hybrid army. Katherine awoke him in order to get information on how to kill Klaus.\n\nKlaus eventually killed Mikael using the white oak stake after being saved by Stefan.\n\nWhen the Original Vampires throw a ball in order to introduce themselves to the Mystic Falls community, they use the last name \"Mikaelson\", as a tribute to the patriarch. Ironically, Klaus also refers to himself as Mikaelson, despite his deep resentment of Mikael.\n\nMikael's ghost appears in New Orleans and convinces Davina to resurrect him, which is successful but found himself bound to Davina via a mystical bracelet or at least until Kol Mikaelson released him while Davina was knocked out.\n\nMikael is the oldest of the Original Family and considered the strongest and most powerful vampire in existence, although after Klaus breaks the sun and moon curse and became a hybrid it is likely that margin was somewhat narrowed, given they faced each other twice after that and Klaus prevails in the first encounter and gains the upper hand in the second only to be thwarted in an attempt to save Camille.\n\nKlaus kills Mikael a second time in a surprise attempt to use his Viking ashes for a spell to defeat his Aunt Dahlia.\n\nEsther is the matriarch of the Mikaelson family. She is portrayed by a British actress Alice Evans in \"The Vampire Diaries\" and was played by Natalie Dreyfuss in \"The Originals\" while possessing Cassie's body. She was played by Sonja Sohn while possessing Lenore's body. She was stuck in Lenore's body as a vampire.\n\nShe was not a vampire, but was a powerful witch. She was the apprentice of a very powerful Bennett witch, Ayanna, during her first years in the New World. Esther was responsible for turning her family into vampires. She did so by summoning life from the sun and immortality from a white oak tree, then making them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them.\n\nShe was referred to as \"The Original Witch\", though she was not the first witch in the world. This was a reference to the fact that she was the witch who was a part of the Original Family.\n\nEsther was murdered by Klaus in the early 11th century, because she used her powers, and those of some other fellow witches, to suppress his werewolf abilities and bind them to the moonstone through the use of a curse, and for making him the target of Mikael's hatred through her affair. Esther comes back to life in the 21st century, when she was awakened by Bonnie and Abby Bennett. Esther tries to kill all of her vampire children, whom she now believes to be abominations after seeing the violence that they embody. She obtains the help of her son Finn, who becomes willing to be sacrificed in order to end the pain that his siblings bring to the world. Esther also seeks the help of Bonnie Bennett and her mother Abby (descendants of the powerful ancient witch Ayanna) by channeling them and their bloodline, in order to gain more power to perform the spell that will kill her children. However, Esther's son Elijah finds out about the plan, and teams up with his siblings to force the Salvatore brothers to prevent his mother from killing the family by kidnapping Elena and threatening to kill her if the Salvatores do not stop Esther's endeavors. Damon ends up turning Bonnie's mother into a vampire, which ends her witch abilities and thus destroys the spell. Esther then flees from Mystic Falls to avoid her family.\n\nIn the season three episode, \"Heart of Darkness\", Esther returns to Mystic Falls. She tells Rebekah that she was dying, and wanted to see her daughter one last time; however, she had ulterior motives for returning. She grabs Rebekah's hands, and performs a spell in order to switch bodies with Rebekah, using her as a cover for safety. Esther was desperate to stay safe from Klaus and her other Original Vampire children who want her dead after learning of her plans to kill them all and ending the vampire race. After she returns to her own body, she was killed by Alaric's normal self, but not before she successfully performs the ritual on his dark side, and her body was put back into its coffin by Klaus.\n\nEsther's remains are consecrated in New Orleans and as a result, she becomes a New Orleans witch, a witch that has or can use the collective power of all the dead New Orleans witches. She eventually becomes the leader of the Ancestors, the spirits of the dead witches who give their power to the living witches.\n\nShe is portrayed by an American-Canadian actress Riley Voelkel.\n\nMikael and Esther's firstborn child was a daughter. It was originally believed that she died in Europe at a very young age as the result of a plague that had struck their homeland. In reality, Esther's sister Dahlia took the child (and all firstborns from Esther's bloodline) as the price for the magic used to allow Esther to bear children. Esther lies to Mikael, and Freya's supposed death is what caused Mikael and Esther to move to a village in a \"mystical land\" far away in the New World, which was later called Mystic Falls.\n\nDahlia took Freya and taught her many of her secrets and, over the years, she became a very powerful witch. Eventually, Dahlia cast a spell on both of them which would provide them with \"the next best thing\" to immortality: they would slumber for one hundred years before waking for a year of aging. Eventually, Freya escaped from Dahlia, later telling her brothers, Klaus and Elijah, that it hadn't been easy and that she had lost something in the process. Freya hid from Dahlia's wrath and, eventually, ended up in New Orleans where she wanted to meet her family. Invited to a party thrown by her brothers and her sister as her brother Kol's date, she witnessed Klaus daggering Kol. As his date, she was imprisoned in a cottage which had become an asylum for mad witches since Klaus had a spell placed on it which prevented witches from leaving. Once inside the asylum, Freya returned to her slumber, remaining as such for a hundred years.\n\nAs her slumber came to an end, Freya discovered that her sister, Rebekah, had been imprisoned in the asylum when her spirit was placed in a witch body by a vengeful Kol. Pretending to be another inmate, she finally met her sister properly, admiring her bravery when she stood up to the Kindred witches who ran the asylum. Later, when Rebekah planned to draw on Freya (not knowing she was her sister) to break the spell on the asylum, the Kindred tried to stop her but Freya arrived and easily dispatched the Kindred with her magic before breaking the spell that contained the witches. Revealing her true identity to Rebekah, she told her that she would soon come to see their brothers. The first of them she met was her brother Finn, whom she had been close to as a child. Revealing what had happened to her after the kidnapping, Freya also learnt that her younger brother, Klaus, had fathered a daughter, something that would draw Dahlia once she found out. Helping Finn to kill Hope, she cast a spell to protect her brother for his upcoming confrontation with Elijah, who was protecting Hope. She later brought Finn back thanks to her spell when he was killed by Elijah. She also told him that, once Hope started doing magic, Dahlia would sense it and come for what was hers.\n\nSometime afterwards, once Finn was strong enough, Freya asked him to take her to Mikael, their father, who Finn had been using as a sacrificial power source in his battle with their brothers. Although Mikael was sceptical at first, he eventually recognized his long-lost daughter, and father and daughter happily reunited. Telling Mikael about the truth behind her disappearance and the threat posed by Dahlia, Freya then met with her brothers Klaus and Elijah, who had confronted Finn in the City of the Dead. Removing Finn's spirit from his host and placing him in her pendant, Freya told her brothers that Hope had nothing to fear from her or from Finn now that he was neutralized. She then told them that they needed to ally if they wanted to stop Dahlia, who was far more powerful than any witch they had ever come across. Although Klaus refused her help, especially when he learnt of her alliance with Mikael, Elijah was willing to hear her out and even ally with her but he told her that he did not trust her. Freya hoped that she would be able to one day win her younger brother's trust.\n\nFreya is one of the most powerful witches to ever walk the earth, along with Dahlia, her niece Hope and her mother Esther. However, Hope's power seems even greater than Freya's and Esther's, as she is capable of accomplishing feats even Esther and Freya could not. Even Rebekah, whose knowledge of magic was quite limited, knew that Freya was far more powerful than any other witch she had encountered. Freya knew and mastered a vast number of spells and could accomplish them at a greater degree than other witches; namely, she could locate someone despite them being protected by a cloaking spell. She could also use her magic in a fight, something that not even a Harvest witch like Davina can do.\n\nHe is portrayed by a British actor Casper Zafer and was played by American actor Yusuf Gatewood while possessing Vincent Griffith's body.\n\nFinn is Mikael and Esther's second born child and was the oldest living Mikaelson family member (he was also the only person to know the truth of Freya's \"death,\" as he was there), until his elder sister Freya woke up. He is shown to be even more noble and moral than Elijah, but is more distant to his siblings since he views them as monsters. Finn once had a loving relationship with his siblings, but that changed after they became vampires, and after seeing how they acted he emotionally distanced himself. He still cared about them enough that he stayed with them but held a judgemental attitude towards them, especially Niklaus, whose relationship with Finn became hostile. This made Klaus decide to leave the White Oak Ash Dagger in Finn after The Brotherhood of the Five attacked them. However 900 years later, after Elijah un-daggered him, he conspired with Esther to link all the remaining Original Vampires so they could all be destroyed.\n\nFinn was responsible for turning the 900-year-old vampire, Sage, with whom he is in love. Sage and Finn reunite shortly before his death.\n\nHe is killed in the season 3 episode \"The Murder of One\", when Stefan, Elena and Matt kill him, thinking that it will kill all of the Originals due to their \"linked\" status. However, Klaus manages to force Bonnie into unlinking the siblings moments before Finn is killed. It is revealed through Finn's death that when an Original dies, all vampires of his or her bloodline die as well.\n\nAs was revealed in the season finale of \"The Originals\", Finn returns along with his mother Esther and brother Kol in another body of a male witch named Vincent.\n\nHe is portrayed by New Zealand actor Daniel Gillies\n\nElijah first appears in episode eight of season two, entitled \"Rose\". Elijah is brought into the circle by two vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals if they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppelgänger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the ritual required to become a vampire/werewolf Hybrid. They were subsequently hunted by Klaus and Elijah for centuries.\n\nElijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, a former doppelgänger he was in love with), and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee. Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise.\n\nElena is rescued by the Salvatore brothers not long after Elijah kills Trevor, who had betrayed Elijah in the past by helping Katerina escape. The Salvatores attack Elijah and succeed in staking him; however, he comes back to life at the end of the episode because he is an Original Vampire who can not be killed by any wooden stake. Only wood from the ancient White Oak Tree, which his family burned when they became vampires, can kill Originals. Elijah then works with a witch to locate Elena.\n\nThe witch is able to locate her, so he goes to Mystic Falls to confront her, where he ends up saving her from a group of vampires who also wanted to take Elena. It is revealed that those vampires wanted to hand her over to Klaus. When Elijah discovers this, he makes peace with Elena and her friends, because he wants to use Elena as bait to draw out Klaus and kill him. He thus makes a deal with Elena that if she helps him kill Klaus, he will leave her family and her friends alone and keep them safe. However, he intends for Elena to be successfully sacrificed, as once Klaus breaks the curse and starts transforming, he will be left vulnerable enough to be killed. During a series of events, Elijah is temporarily \"killed\" when Elena stabs him with a mystical dagger that can kill an Original when dipped in ash from the White Oak Tree.\n\nWhen Klaus comes to town, Elena un-daggers Elijah because she needs his help, and he then reveals to her his family's history, and the fact that Klaus killed the rest of his siblings. Elijah thus at first tries to help Elena and her friends kill Klaus, but ends up saving him instead in the Season 2 finale episode, because Klaus promises to take Elijah to their family (Elijah had assumed Klaus had hidden their \"dead\" bodies deep in the ocean) if Elijah spares him. In season two's finale however, it is revealed that Klaus double-crossed Elijah once again, and daggered him to keep him close to him, like the rest of his daggered siblings.\n\nDamon undaggers Elijah later in season 3 to help him find a way to kill Klaus. When Elijah awakes, he undaggers the rest of his siblings who were located in similar coffins in the same room. They begin to plot their revenge against Klaus; however, before they can make their move, their mother Esther, thought to be dead, reappears and convinces the siblings to be a family again [which later turns out to be a front for her true motives; she wants to link her children's lives together and kill one of them to kill the rest, rendering vampires extinct].\n\nAfter Elijah foils his mother's plans to kill him and his siblings, he leaves Mystic Falls a tortured soul, ashamed of his own barbaric actions and those of his family's. He is shown to be one of the most sophisticated and peaceful of the Original siblings, alongside his older brother Finn. He is the most compromising regarding Elena and her friends. Elijah and Elena develop a sort of understanding, and Elena comes to be fond of Elijah's company. She thus feels especially betrayed when earlier Elijah threatened to allow Rebekah to kill Elena if the Salvatore brothers are not able to stop Esther Mikaelson from killing the Original Family. However, in the 18th episode of season 3, Elena professes that she hopes that her vampire friends are descended from Elijah's bloodline, so that he can be spared. Elijah returns to town in the season three finale episode, \"The Departed\", in order to make a deal with Elena and her friends. Elijah proposes that he be allowed to take Klaus's desiccated (by witch Bonnie and help from the Salvatores and Tyler) body with him and his siblings and leave town, and in exchange, he would make sure that Klaus would not be resurrected within Elena's lifetime or even that of her children, stating: \"perhaps that will teach him some manners\". However, Klaus is staked, and Elijah and Rebekah believe him to be dead, even though Klaus actually possessed Tyler Lockwood's body and lives on.\n\nIn season four, Elijah reappears as Katherine's lover, and is making a deal with Katherine for her to be granted her freedom from Klaus in exchange for the cure for immortality, which Klaus wants to give to Silas, the world's first and most dangerous immortal being, to avoid Silas' psychic torture. Elijah refuses Klaus the cure for Rebekah to take before Silas re-claims it, denying Katherine's freedom. Elijah breaks up with Katherine when he learns Klaus has fathered a child and returns to New Orleans to keep Klaus' unborn baby safe and help his brother.\n\nHe follows his brother Klaus to New Orleans and finds out that Hayley is pregnant with Klaus' child. He begins to have feelings for Hayley and throughout 'The Originals' the two make their feelings for each other clear. When Esther returns, she reveals the truth about how Elijah's first love, Tatia, was killed, proving it was in fact himself who had fed on her when they had newly been vampires. During one of Finn's spells Elijah is trapped in a room with animal heads which represent each brother of the family. To escape, Elijah discovers you must ruin the representation of each other, thus causing him to share with Klaus that he killed Tatia. When Klaus proves he is capable of forgiveness the spell is broken and they are free.\n\nNiklaus Mikaelson (more commonly called Klaus) is physically the most powerful immortal supernatural being in \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"The Originals\" universe. He is shown to be cruel, sadistic, ruthless. He's portrayed by British actor Joseph Morgan. After the Original couple moved to the Americas, Klaus's mother had an affair with a member of the neighboring werewolf tribe. Klaus was born as a result. The mother's infidelity was later revealed. His illegitimate birth as well as his perceived weaknesses made him the target of his step-father's ruthless hatred, emotional neglect, abuse, and contempt.\n\nWhen Esther turned the family into vampires, Klaus's blood-lust became particularly strong and he transitioned into a hybrid after his first kill, due to his werewolf gene. Esther later bound his werewolf powers to the moonstone, due to her believing that his hybrid status made him an abomination. In order to obtain his werewolf abilities, Klaus had to perform a ritual in which a werewolf, a vampire and a Petrova doppelganger had to be sacrificed. Klaus first hunted Katerina Petrova, later known as Katherine Pierce, who was from the line of supernatural Petrova doppelgangers. In order to avoid being sacrificed by Klaus and allowing him to gain his werewolf powers, Katerina drinks the blood of a vampire and then kills herself in order to transition into a vampire. She then becomes useless to Klaus because his ritual requires a human doppelganger. Katherine subsequently spends centuries on the run from Klaus, who is enraged at her actions. As a result, Klaus kills her entire family and continues to hunt her obsessively.\n\nContinuing his quest to release his werewolf abilities, Klaus compels Isobel Saltzman to locate the latest Petrova doppelganger, Elena Gilbert, her own daughter. Klaus is then able to perform the ritual. He sacrifices Tyler Lockwood's werewolf friend, Jules, and turns Jenna Sommers into a vampire before killing her. Finally, Klaus drains Elena of blood (though she lives thanks to a ritualistic sacrifice made by her biological father, John Gilbert) and thus completes the ritual, becoming a fully functional vampire-werewolf hybrid.\n\nA major plot line of the show is Klaus' quest to create a hybrid army. Klaus can only sire other hybrids by using the blood of the supernatural Petrova doppelgänger, Elena Gilbert. Thus, he is often a threat to Elena and is a major kill target for the Salvatore brothers.\n\nAt one point, Klaus blackmails Stefan into helping him create more hybrids, by threatening to kill his brother Damon. Klaus forces Stefan to return to his old, deadly ways, and returns Stefan to the Salvatores' former sociopathic persona, known as \"The Ripper\". When Klaus discovers that he needs Elena's blood to create his hybrid army, he sends Stefan back to Mystic Falls to keep an eye on her, but also forces Stefan to turn off his emotions (an ability that all vampires have). Tyler Lockwood ends up becoming Klaus' first successful hybridized victim.\n\nIt's also revealed that Klaus murdered his own mother, because she suppressed his werewolf powers through a curse, and because he blames her for making him the target of Mikael's hatred by her conception of him through an affair. When his half-sister Rebekah learns of this, she initially disowns him. However, when Elena's friends release Klaus's family from their coffins, Rebekah forgives him, though only after their mother convinces them that she wants them to reunite as a family.\n\nGlimpses of his humanity can also be seen in regard to his half-siblings, such as when he saves his half-sister's life when Kol was about to stab her with the white oak stake, in spite of the fact that he had previously disowned her and the two were at odds, or when he became infuriated over his half-brother Kol's death. There are also small instances when it's revealed how deeply he cares for his unborn child, and even the child's mother Hayley.\n\nIn the season three episode, \"Before Sunset\", Klaus is temporarily \"killed\" by the Salvatores and Tyler Lockwood. He tries to kill Elena by draining her of all her blood in order to kill two birds with one stone; (1) have a supply of her blood with which to create a hybrid army, (2) kill the vampire form of the vampire-hating Alaric Saltzman, who desires to kill Klaus, all other vampires and whose life is tied to Elena's by the witch Esther. Subsequently, Elena's friends neutralize Klaus in order to protect her. Instead of staking him, which could potentially kill them all (see \"Mythology\" section), the Salavatore brothers use Bonnie's magic and a dark spell to stop Klaus' heart, which \"desiccates\" him and leaves him immobile and starved of blood, and thus in a seemingly \"dead\" state. A similar spell was performed on Klaus's step-father, Mikael, by Bonnie's mother, Abby Bennett. In the season three finale episode \"The Departed\", Klaus is staked in his coffin by the vampire form of Alaric Saltzman and subsequently, his body burns to ashes, (see \"Mythology\" section). However, Klaus lives on by switching bodies with Tyler Lockwood, through a spell which Bonnie Bennett performs.\n\nIn \"Bring It On\" Klaus sleeps with Hayley Marshall and provides her with information in regards to her family, because he noticed a crescent moon shaped birthmark on her shoulder.\n\nIn \"The Originals\", the backdoor pilot for the spin-off show, Klaus is told by a group of witches, who are blackmailing him, that Hayley is carrying his child. They threaten to kill the child and Hayley if he doesn't. Klaus decides he wants this child, so he vows to protect Hayley and their unborn child, whatever it takes.\nAs the Original Vampire-Werewolf Hybrid, Klaus is the strongest of the original vampires, despite not being the eldest, he grows stronger and faster with age due to his vampirism and when he is using his lycanthrope enhancement, also increase in strength when enraged; due to his werewolf side.\n\nIn Klaus's confrontations against the-then Enhanced Original Vampire Alaric Saltzman, his step-father Mikael, and the Upgraded Original Vampires Lucien Castle and Marcel Gerard respectively, the latters' are apparently proven to be physically stronger than Klaus, however, it should be noted in each of these confrontations, the Original Hybrid never truly used his full strength, as his physical attributes (such as strength and speed) are at their peaks when he is fully transformed into his werewolf form.\n\nAlthough stronger than his Original Vampire maternal half-siblings due to his werewolf heritage, some of his half-siblings have been shown to be able to fight with him almost equal terms; not enough to actually defeat Klaus, as the latter always quickly turns the tables on his half-siblings in the end.\n\nHis supernatural and physical attributes aside, Klaus' greatest asset is his sharp intellect. His penchant for strategies and forming contingencies way ahead of time and surpasses Elijah's penchant for strategies and forming contingencies; as he has outsmarted Elijah on several occasions and rarely is outsmarted by the latter. According to Dahlia, Klaus is the most intelligent of his maternal half-siblings.\n\nKol is the youngest surviving son of the Original Family, since the death of his younger brother Henrik and the second youngest child still living, being older than Rebekah. He is portrayed by Australian actor Nathaniel Buzolic and was played by British actor Daniel Sharman while possessing Kaleb's body.\n\nHe tries to kill Matt Donovan for entertainment during the Originals' family ball, but is stopped by Damon Salvatore.\n\nIn the season three episode, \"Heart of Darkness\", Kol appears in Denver, Colorado, where Elena and Damon had sent Jeremy, to get him away from Mystic Falls and protect his life. He threatens to hurt Jeremy, in order to prevent Elena and Damon from trying to find out the history of Damon's blood line; (if they managed to do so, they might find out that Elena's friends are not descended from Kol, which would allow them to kill him—see \"Mythology\" section). Damon drives a baseball bat through Kol's body in order to debilitate him so that he, Elena, and Jeremy can escape. Kol later appears at the house of Mary Porter, the vampire who sired Rose. Kol kills Mary, so that she is not able to tell Elena and Damon about the history of her bloodline, which could lead them to find out which Original vampire Damon, Stefan, Caroline and Abby Bennett are descended from; Mary sired Rose, Katherine Pierce forced Rose to sire her, and Katherine later sired Damon and Stefan.\n\nIn season four, Kol returns to aid Rebekah in finding the rumoured \"cure\" for vampirism. He tortures Professor Shane, who supposedly knows how to get the cure. When Kol realizes that Shane plans to release Silas, the first and most dangerous immortal being of all time, Kol stabs Shane through the torso with a wooden object, killing him. However, Bonnie is able to save Shane's life through an \"expression\", or dark magic spell.\n\nKol compels Damon to kill Jeremy so that they cannot find Silas, but Stefan locks Damon away so that he cannot. Elena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete.\n\nElena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena corners him and showers him in water mixed with vervain. Jeremy stabs Kol with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching furiously in the doorway, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved.\n\nKol returned in the season four episode \"The Walking Dead\", along with several deceased characters as ghosts, longing for revenge against their killers and the residents of Mystic Falls. He clashes once more Matt Donovan, wounding him by throwing a glass bottle at his shoulder and taunting his sister, angered at her brief grieving period, before proceeding to attack Elena, grieving for her brother at his grave. His neck is snapped by Stefan before he managed to kill Elena, however appears in the next episode, \"Graduation\", threatening Bonnie into completely destroying the veil so he could return to life. Bonnie plays along with his plan, however deceives him by luring him into a trap, so he can't cause any more harm until the veil is returned.\n\nKol later appears to Matt Donovan while Matt is temporarily trapped on the Other Side. After Matt witnesses his sister Vicky being sucked into oblivion, Kol reveals that the Other Side is unraveling, slowly taking one spirit after the other. Soon, every spirit of the supernatural kind will be gone. Kol begs Matt for his help, before he, too, will be swept away. However, upon awaking, Matt doesn't remember. Soon, the Other Side completely disintegrates, and Kol's fate is left unknown.\n\nSome time later in season 2 of \"The Originals\", a young man named Kaleb appears in New Orleans, flirting with the young but powerful witch Davina Claire. He later meets up with Cassie and Vincent, two witches whose bodies have been taken over by Esther and Finn. It's revealed that Kaleb is actually Kol, having taken possession of a body as well. Kol continues his relationship with Davina Claire, originally because his mother told him to but develops feelings for her. He chooses to side with Davina over his mother Esther who he helps stop along with his siblings. However, this leads to his brother Finn casting a spell on him which eventually kills him, leaving Davina heartbroken. In season 3 Davina works to resurrect Kol which she succeeds in doing by aligning herself with the Strix to get the power she needed. Kol is later resurrected by Davina through the energy that was used in un-siring Klaus.\n\nRebekah is currently the youngest member of the original family since Henrik died over a thousand years ago. She is portrayed by Australian actress Claire Holt and was played by British actress Maisie Richardson-Sellers while possessing Eva Sinclair's body. \nShe and her living siblings, Elijah, Finn, Klaus and Kol were turned into vampires by their parents, Esther and Mikael Mikaelson. They made them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them. Esther, their mother who is an original witch, performed a spell using white oak ash for eternal life. When they woke, their father forced them to drink human blood. With the intention of turning them into vampires was so that they could survive in their village and to be stronger, faster and even more vigilant than the werewolves, who killed their youngest brother. However, the great hunger and lust for blood was a bad effect that their parents didn't plan on. Vervain, a plant by the white oak tree, burned them as did sunlight, which caused them to be forced to wear daylight rings or necklaces. The only thing that can really kill an Original is a stake made of the actual white oak tree used to turn them, while a dagger dipped in the ash of the white oak can place them in a deathlike trance until the dagger is pulled out.\n\nRebekah shares a deep bond with her brother Klaus, and was the only family member that remained loyal to him throughout his vicious behavior. Klaus thus kept her by his side, while he kept the rest of his family daggered and stored in coffins for hundreds of years.\n\nShe had a romantic interest in Stefan Salvatore during their encounters in the early 1920s. During that time period, Klaus and Rebekah are once again forced to go on the run after the arrival of their vengeful father Mikael. Consequently, Rebekah professes an interest to stop running and desires to live a stable life with Stefan by her side. Klaus forces her to choose between himself and Stefan. She chooses the latter, leading Klaus to dagger her. He brings her back to life shortly thereafter, in order to obtain her necklace, which was originally Esther's. The same necklace is gifted to Elena by Stefan during the series first season. Rebekah and Klaus thus head to Mystic Falls. Rebekah develops a deep hatred and envy of Elena, and continually tries to hurt, kill, and emotionally distress her, until her brother makes her stop. Later on, Rebekah tries to be Elena's friend and helps with her and her friends' plan to kill Klaus once she found out he killed her mother, but is betrayed, and daggered by Elena, to simplify the Salvatore's plan to killing Klaus. In season three, Klaus makes Elena reveal Rebekah's location, and takes her body with him. She is eventually un-daggered by Elijah.\n\nDuring her time in Mystic Falls, Rebekah enrolls at the local high school, much to the disgust of Elena and her friends. There, she at first makes romantic advances towards Tyler Lockwood, Caroline Forbes' boyfriend. She later develops a fondness for Matt Donovan, and invites him to her family's ball.\n\nRebekah is shown to be lonely and insecure, though she hides this by being cruel and violent. This is demonstrated quite well through her sexual rendezvouses with Damon Salvatore, an enemy of her family, and the subsequent torture she makes him endure after being betrayed and used by him.\n\nHer mother Esther comes back and tells Rebekah and her siblings she wants them to unite and become a family again. However, she really came to kill them all by linking them with a spell that would cause each sibling to die only by killing one of them. Klaus forces Bonnie to undo the spell, but Elena, the Salvatore's and others kill Finn, Rebekah's brother.\n\nRebekkah's body is temporarily taken over by her witch mother, Esther, through a spell which Esther performs. She invades Rebekah's body in order to be able to go unnoticed while scheming to kill all of her Original children (who are out for her blood, ever since they discovered that she tried to kill them by a blood-linking spell at the family ball). Esther later leaves Rebekah's body and stakes her; however, Klaus restores Rebekah by removing the stake.\n\nRebekah supposedly leaves Mystic Falls in the season three episode \"Before Sunset\", in order to avoid the vampiric version of Alaric Saltzman, who wants to kill her and all other vampires. However, she then returns to Mystic Falls after witnessing the supposed \"death\" of her brother. Grief-stricken, she decides to kill Elena, therefore killing Alaric and taking away the last threat to her and her family therefore saving her family. She causes both Elena and Matt Donovan to drive off of the Wickery Bridge and into the lake to drown, and Elena dies, along with Alaric. However, Elena had vampire blood in her system, something Rebekah was unaware of.\n\nIn season four, Rebekah is yet again daggered by Klaus, after he believes she will be an obstacle in finding The Cure. However, she is then un-daggered by April Young, and sets upon finding it herself. After developing a 'no strings attached' relationship with Stefan, she reveals she wants to be human, feeling miserable as a vampire.\n\nIn season two of \"The Originals\", after Klaus's child is born she returns to New Orleans and is named the caretaker of Klaus's child. She promises to get a strong witch to protect her and her niece from Esther, who wants to kill the baby\nIn season 3 Rebekah makes a return.\n\nHenrik was the child of Esther and Mikael. He was killed by werewolves a thousand years ago, before the family had been turned into vampires. He is portrayed by Devon Allowitz in season three.\n\nHis death created a war between the werewolf clan and his own family, causing his mother to turn the family into vampires, so they could defend themselves against the lycanthropic beasts.\n\nHope is portrayed by Alexandria and Victoria Collins in \"Rebirth\", later by toddlers in seasons 2 and 3, by Summer Fontana in season 4, and by Danielle Rose Russell in season 5 and the Hope-centric spin-off series \"Legacies\".\n\nHope Andrea Mikaelson is the daughter of Klaus and the former-werewolf Hayley Marshall. Hope is the result of a one-night stand between her parents, and after her birth her family agreed to fake her death to protect her from all those who wish her harm. Klaus, after promising to get Hope back one day, gives her to the only person he can trust to protect and raise his daughter: his sister, Rebekah. Hope is returned to her parents later in Season 2.\nHope is extremely powerful who, apart from being a vampire-werewolf hybrid, is also a witch of the Mikaelson bloodline which is one of the most powerful witch lineages in the fictional world of \"The Vampire Diaries\". Moreover, her vampire lineage is that of an Original, making her almost invincible and more powerful than average vampires. Her werewolf heritage is that of an alpha, through Hayley, making her royalty among the werewolves as the Princess of the Crescent pack.\n\nAt the end of season 4, Hope is sent to Mystic Falls to study magic at the Salvatore Boarding School, which provides the premise for \"Legacies\".\n\nShe is portrayed by Australian actress Claudia Black.\n\nThe sister of Esther, and first-born witch of that generation of their family, Dahlia is one of the most powerful witches in history, far more than that of her sister, already regarded as one of the most powerful. Dahlia was taken, along with Esther from her homeland, which was destroyed by the Vikings who locked her away as a slave to do magic whilst allowing Esther to roam freely. When Ester decides to marry one of their captors instead of escape with her sister and best friend, Dahlia becomes a hate-filled woman. Years later Esther discovers she is infertile and in desperation seeks out her sister. Dahlia agrees to perform a ritual that will give her fertility, if Esther agrees to give her the first-born child of every generation, all of whom, like Dahlia, would possess immense magical power. Esther obliges and Dahlia comments that she would be able to help herself if Esther hadn't given up magic. \nYears later Dahlia contacts her sister wishing to collect her fee, 5-year old Freya Mikaelson. Esther, upset, begs her sister not to take her daughter, and swears to grow in power until she is more powerful than Dahlia, claiming she did not know the love of a parent to a child when she made the deal. Dahlia commands Esther to tell Mikael that their daughter died from the bubonic plague and her body was burned.\n\nDescribed by Freya as the most powerful witch she has ever seen, Dahlia first gained her enhanced powers by linking her magic to the magic possessed by her then five-year-old niece Freya. Once Freya reached adulthood, Dahlia then cast a spell that allows them both to gain pseudo-immortality by leap-frogging through time; the women were put into a magically-induced sleep for nearly a century, only to awaken for one single year of life and aging with all of the magic they accrued over their hundred-year-long slumber, before they would once again return to their sleep after the year had passed.\n\nDahlia's understanding of magic after so many years of study is extensive enough that she was able to create her own form of connective magic in the 10th century. She also has the ability to sense the magic of other witches, especially those of the first-born children of her and her sister Esther's bloodline, as the first-born witches of their lineage possess devastating amounts of power. According to Freya, Dahlia aims to be truly immortal without having to sleep for centuries, and she will not hesitate to come and claim the first-born Mikaelson witches to achieve this goal, even if it means destroying anyone who stands in her way.\n\nBeing the oldest and most powerful vampires, the Original Vampires are stronger and faster than all normal vampires, though it is implied they do not get stronger with age due to being \"created\" at the zenith of vampiric physical prowess. (Alaric was just as strong, if not stronger, than the other Original Vampires despite being a day old. So too was Lucien, strong enough to kill Finn). It is possible that the spell used to make the Original Vampires, gives them the peak powers of vampirism. Also, werewolves prove little to no challenge for them, though they can be challenging in their wolf form (where they are at their strongest) as a pack of four can defeat an Original Vampire (Rebekah) and two human form werewolves with moonrings (which allows them to use the full power of their condition) overpowered Elijah. Also, Original Vampires are somewhat immune to werewolf venom, which is fatal to normal vampires but it still affects Original Vampires, though they only experience weakness and hallucinations. Original Vampires have the power to \"compel\" or hypnotize ordinary vampires in addition to humans, though they cannot compel each other.\n\nNothing can kill an Original Vampire, except for a heart-aimed stake made only of the ancient white oak tree or the immense power of a very powerful witch, though channeling that much power will also kill the witch. If an Original Vampire is stabbed by a white oak stake, he or she will die and burn to ashes. Using a silver dagger dipped in the ashes of the white oak tree will cause the Original Vampires to be neutralized as long as the dagger remains within them; however, that type of dagger would not work on Klaus due to his hybrid nature, and only a pure white oak stake could kill him. However, Davina and Kol had created a gold dagger with the ability to subdue Klaus. Other stakes temporarily disable Original Vampires, but they recuperate in hours. This was demonstrated when Elijah pulled out the wooden stake that Damon had plunged into his chest when attempting to rescue Elena from Rose and Trevor.\n\nWhen an Original Vampire dies, all of the vampires from his or her bloodline die as well. This is demonstrated when Damon, Stefan, Elena and Matt kill Finn, resulting in the deaths of Sage and Troy, (Finn had sired Sage and Sage had sired Troy, thus creating a blood line). Thus, if all Original Vampires were to be killed, the entire vampire species would be rendered extinct, since all the vampires in the world are descended from the Original Vampires. However, in season 3 of the Originals, Klaus and his sireline are unlinked, meaning that if Klaus were to die, his sireline would continue to live on. It is unknown if any new Vampires that Klaus sired would be linked to him, or if they would also be unlinked, it is also unknown if Klaus' sireline can be relinked to him again.\n\nHowever, it is necessary for the Original Vampire's spirit to cross the veil, in order for his or her bloodline to follow suit. In the season three finale episode \"The Departed\", Klaus manages to switch bodies with Tyler Lockwood before being staked and lives on; thus, even though his body supposedly burnt to ashes, none of his bloodline is affected.\n\nIn season four it was revealed that the spell Esther used to create the Original Vampires is a variation of the spell Qetsiyah, the ancestor of her friend Ayana, used to create the immortality elixir.\n\nKlaus, the Original hybrid, was fertile due to his werewolf nature and thus impregnates Hayley, giving him a daughter named Hope. She has only shown witch powers and presumably would be a werewolf if she killed anyone, but her blood can create hybrids sired to her. She has created a new sire line by turning her mother. While initially it was unknown if her death would result in the death of her \"descendants\" like for any other original vampires, Hayley was later described as an \"Unsired Vampire\", meaning that any hybrid or vampire that Hope sires would continue to live on if she were to be killed.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, it was announced that a back-door pilot focused on the Originals, starring Joseph Morgan as Klaus titled \"The Originals\" would air April 25 for a potential series pick-up for the 2013-2014 season. This second spin-off attempt is carried out by Julie Plec. There is no involvement by Kevin Williamson.\n\nIn February 2013, it was announced that Daniella Pineda was cast as the witch Sophie for episode 4x20 of \"The Vampire Diaries\". This episode serves as a backdoor-pilot for the spin-off series, revolving around \"the Originals\" and taking place in the French Quarter of New Orleans. She was a regular cast member for first thirteen episodes of the series.\n\nOn February 11, 2013 it was announced that Leah Pipes was cast as the human Camille. Although there has been talk of a love triangle between Marcel and Klaus with this bartender/college student, there isn't any evidence to support this. However the character was in a small love triangle for couple episodes, but isn't anymore.\n\n"}

{"id": "1340584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1340584", "title": "Rockefeller Museum", "text": "Rockefeller Museum\n\nThe Rockefeller Museum, formerly the Palestine Archaeological Museum (PAM), is an archaeology museum located in East Jerusalem that houses a large collection of artifacts unearthed in the excavations conducted in Mandate Palestine, in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe museum is under the management of the Israel Museum and houses the head office of the Israel Antiquities Authority.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Rockefeller Museum, the British Mandate Department of Antiquities and British School of Archaeology were housed in an old building in Jerusalem with a small exhibition hall. The only other archaeological museum at the time was the Franciscan Biblical Museum, built in 1902.\nIn 1906, the Jewish National Fund began to negotiate the purchase of Karm el-Sheikh, a tract of land facing the northeastern corner of the Old City walls, to house the Bezalel School of Art and Crafts. The founder of the school, Boris Schatz envisaged a museum and university that would overlook the Temple Mount. In 1919, town planner Patrick Geddes proposed the establishment of an antiquities museum at this site. To further the project, the Mandate authorities proposed a special tourism tax in 1924.\nVisiting Palestine in 1925, during the days of the British Mandate, James Henry Breasted, founder and director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, recognized the need for an archaeological museum in Jerusalem to house important regional finds. Encouraged by Lord Plumer, the British High Commissioner, Breasted approached American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who agreed to donate two million dollars toward the project. Previously, he had offered to build an archeological museum in Cairo, Egypt, but he was turned down, possibly due to pressure from the British government, which was anxious to keep America from establishing a foothold in the region.\nThe museum was designed by Austen Harrison, (Austen St. Barbe Harrison), chief architect of the Mandatory Department of Public Works, who drew up blueprints for a white limestone building integrating eastern and western architectural elements. The cornerstone of the new museum was laid on June 19, 1930, but construction was delayed due to the discovery of tombs dating to the fifth century B.C. at the building site. The museum features a stone bas-relief of the meeting of Asia and Africa above the main entrance together with ten stone reliefs illustrating different cultures and a gargoyle fountain in the inner courtyard carved in 1934 by the British sculptor Eric Gill (1882–1940). Gill also produced stone carved signage throughout the museum in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.\n\nThe museum opened to the public on January 13, 1938. Officially, it was called the \"Palestine Archaeological Museum\", but was also known as the \"Rockefeller Museum\".\nUntil the final days of the Mandate period, the museum was administered by the British Palestine Government. On 1 April 1948 it was closed for the public.\n\nOn 20 April 1948, the High Commissioner appointed a council of international trustees to administer the museum. The council consisted of twelve members: two representing the High Commissioner, one from the British Academy, one from the British Museum, one from the French National Academy, one from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two from the Antiquities Departments of the Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Transjordanian governments; one from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, one from the Royal Swedish Academy, one from the American Institute of Archaeology, and one from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. The board run the museum until 1966. In the 1950s controversies came up about objects removed by the two sides to Amman and the Israeli side respectively.\n\nAfter the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the museum also became a secondary headquarters of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, headed by Gerald Lankester Harding until 1956. In 1966, the museum was nationalized by King Hussein during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank.\n\nSeven months later, when the 1967 Six-Day War broke out, the museum was captured by an Israeli paratroop brigade. Its hexagonal tower was used as a lookout. Fierce fighting took place here between Israeli and Jordanian forces, culminating in an Israeli victory. The Museum was then officially renamed as the Rockefeller Museum.\n\nSince 1967, the museum has been jointly managed by the Israel Museum and the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (later reorganized as the Israel Antiquities Authority).\n\nInside what was to have been the rear courtyard of the museum stood (until it died after nearly 300 years in 1998) one of the oldest pine trees in the country. According to Arab legend, on the site of this pine tree, Ezra the Scribe sat and wrote the Torah for Israel. The stump may still be seen behind the museum.\n\nThe museum's first curator was John H. Iliffe, who arranged the artifacts in chronological order, from two million years ago to 1700 AD. Among the museum's prized possessions are 8th-century wooden panels from the al-Aqsa Mosque and 12th-century (Crusader-period) marble lintels from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Most of the collection consists of finds from the 1920s and 1930s. On display are artifacts unearthed in Jerusalem, Megiddo, Ashkelon, Lachish, Samaria, and Jericho. One of the Lachish letters is on permanent display at the museum, as are the statuary and stucco decorations from the Umayyad Hisham's Palace.\n\nSome of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran between 1947 and 1956, consisting of Jewish texts and commentaries, were housed in the Rockefeller Museum.\n\nIn 1967, following the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem, the scrolls were seized by Israel and relocated to the Shrine of the Book, a specially designed building on the grounds of the Israel Museum, with the ownership of these scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. The Copper Scroll was taken to the Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2987552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2987552", "title": "Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture", "text": "Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\n\nThe Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture is a research library of the New York Public Library (NYPL) and an archive repository for information on people of African descent worldwide. Located at 515 Malcolm X Boulevard (Lenox Avenue) between West 135th and 136th Streets in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, it has, almost from its inception, been an integral part of the Harlem community. It is named for Afro-Puerto Rican scholar Arturo Alfonso Schomburg.\n\nThe resources of the Center are broken up into five divisions, the Art and Artifacts Division, the Jean Blackwell Hutson General Research and Reference Division, the Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division, the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division, and the Photographs and Prints Division.\n\nIn addition to research services, the center hosts readings, discussions, art exhibitions, and theatrical events. It is open to the general public.\n\nIn 1901, Andrew Carnegie tentatively agreed to donate $5,200,000 () to construct 65 branch libraries in New York City, with the requirement that the City provide the land and maintain the buildings once construction was complete. Later in 1901 Carnegie formally signed a contract with the City of New York to transfer his donation to the city to then allow it to justify purchasing the land to house the libraries. McKim, Mead & White were chosen as the architects and Charles Follen McKim designed the three-story library building at 103 West 135th Street in the Italian Renaissance Palazzo mode. At its opening on July 14, 1905, the library had 10,000 books and the librarian in charge was Gertrude Cohen.\n\nIn 1920, Ernestine Rose, a white woman born in Bridgehampton in 1880, became the branch librarian. She quickly integrated the all-white library staff. Catherine Allen Latimer, the first African-American librarian hired by the NYPL, was sent to work with Rose as was Roberta Bosely months later. Some time later Sadie Peterson Delaney became employed at the branch. Together, they created a plan to assist integrating reading into the lives of the library attendees and cooperated with schools and social organizations in the community. \n\nIn 1921, the library hosted the first exhibition of African-American art in Harlem; it became an annual event. The library became a focal point to the burgeoning Harlem Renaissance. In 1923, the 135th Street branch was the only branch in New York City employing Negroes as librarians, and consequently when Regina M. Anderson was hired by the NYPL, she was sent to work at the 135th Street branch.\n\nRose issued a report to the American Library Association, in 1923, which stated that requests for books about Negroes or written by Negroes had been increasing, and that the demand for professionally trained colored librarians was also. In late 1924, Rose called a meeting, with attendees including Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, James Weldon Johnson, Hubert Harrison, that decided to focus on preserving rare books, and solicit donations to enhance its African-American collection. On May 8, 1925, it began operating as the \"Division of Negro Literature, History and Prints\", a division of the NYPL. In 1926, Schomburg was interested in selling his collection of African-American literature because he wanted it to be available to the general public, but he wanted the collection to stay in Harlem. Rose and the National Urban League convinced the Carnegie Foundation to pay $10,000 to Schomburg and then donate the books to the library. In 1926, the center's collection won acclaim with the addition of Schomburg's personal collection. By donating his collection, Schomburg sought to show that black people had a history and a culture and thus were not inferior to other races. About 5,000 objects in Schomburg's collection were donated.\n\nIn 1929, Anderson was desirous of a promotion and enlisted the help of W. E. B. Du Bois and Walter Francis White when she was being discriminated against by not being promoted. After letters of intervention on her behalf by Du Bois and White, and a boycott of the library by White, Anderson was promoted and transferred to the Rivington Street branch of the NYPL.\n\nBy 1930, the Center had 18,000 volumes. In 1932, Schomburg became the first curator of his collection, until his death in 1938. In 1935, the Center developed a project to deliver books once a week to those handicapped severely enough that they could not make it to the library. Dr. Lawrence D. Reddick became the second curator of the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature. At the behest of Reddick, in October 1940, the entire Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints was renamed the Schomburg Collection of Negro History and Literature.\n\nIn 1942 Rose retired after an extension was built onto the rear of the building, at a time when the library had 40,000 books. Dorothy Robinson Homer replaced her as Branch Librarian, after the Citizen's Committee of the 135th Street Branch Library specifically requested a Negro to replace Rose.\n\nAfter the extension was built, the library became known as the Countee Cullen Library, and the 135th Street Library is still considered the original location of the Countee Cullen library by the New York Public Library, although that name is now only used for the extension itself on West 136th Street. \n\nHomers created a room of books just for young adults and created the American Negro Theatre in the basement that spawned the play Anna Lucasta, which was moved to Broadway. She kept the emphasis on building a community center for art, music and drama. She put on art exhibits that favored unknown, young artists of all races.\n\nAfter the outbreak of WWII, Homer started a program of monthly concert recitals in the auditorium to enhance public spirit, but the demand by performers and audience members to continue the practice made it permanent.\n\nIn 1948, Jean Blackwell, later Jean Blackwell Hutson, was named the director of the Center. In a 1966 speech, Hutson warned of the perilous status of the Schomburg collection.\n\nIn 1971, the Center began being supported by the privately funded Schomburg Corporation. The next year, funds by New York City were allocated to renovate the building at 103 West 135th, and it was renamed the building of the \"Schomburg Collection for Research in Black Culture\". Simultaneously, the entire Schomburg collection was rounded up from various branch libraries and transferred to the Center. In 1972, it was designated as one of NYPL's research libraries.\n\nIn 1973, a building on the west side of Lenox ave between 135th and 136th was bought so that it could be demolished and a new building could be constructed. The location was chosen due to its proximity to other community agencies and because it was the \"scene of the Harlem Renaissance.\" In 1978, the building on 135th Street between Lenox and 7th Avenues was entered into the National Register of Historic Places. In 1979, it was formally listed in the NRHP.\n\nIn 1980, a new Schomburg Center was founded at 515 Lenox Avenue. In 1981, the original building on West 135th Street which held the Schomburg Collection was designated a New York City Landmark. In 2016, both the original and current buildings, now joined by a connector, were designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1981, Wendell L. Wray became the director of the Center. Protests began over Wray's decision to not hire an African-American man to head the Center's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Books Division and instead hired Robert Morris. In 1983, Wray resigned to pursue academic research and Catherine Hooker was named acting director.\n\nHoward Dodson became the director in 1984, at a time when the Schomburg was primarily a cultural center visited by tourists and schoolchildren and its research facilities were known only to scholars. In 1984, the Schomburg's collection was at 5 million. In 1984 attendance was 40,000 a year. As early as 1984, the Schomburg was recognized as the most important institution in the world for collections of art and literature of people in Africa or its diaspora. In 1983, a scholars-in-residence program started at the center. In 1986, an exhibit entitled \"Give me your poor...\" sparked controversy. In March 1987, a public funding campaign was started to raise money to renovate the old library and to enhance the new Center's housing and its functions.\n\nIn 1991, completion of additions to the Schomburg Center were completed. The new center on Malcolm X was expanded to include an auditorium and a connection to the old landmark building on 135th. The \"Art and Artifacts Division\" and the \"Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division\" were moved into the old landmark building. In 2000, the Schomburg Center held an exhibition titled \"Lest We Forget: The Triumph Over Slavery\", which later went on tour around the world for more than a decade under the sponsorship of UNESCO's Slave Route Project. In 2005, the center held an exhibition of letters, photographs and other material related to Malcolm X. In 2007, the building was renovated and expanded in an $11 million project. The Schomburg Center had 120,000 visitors a year; by 2010, Dodson announced he would retire in early 2011.\n\nIn 2007, the Schomburg Center was one of the sponsors of the African Burial Ground National Monument.\n\nFollowing Howard Dodson's announcement of his retirement in 2010, Khalil Gibran Muhammad, great-grandson of Elijah Muhammad and professor of history at Indiana University, was announced as Dodson's replacement. In the summer of 2011, Muhammad became the fifth director of the Schomburg. His stated goals were for the Schomburg to be a focal point for young adults and to collaborate with the local community, to not only reinforce its pride, but also for the Center to be a gateway for revealing the history of Black people worldwide. In July, the Center began an exhibit of Malcolm X footage and prints entitled \"Malcolm X: the Search for Truth\".\n\nOn August 1, 2016, the New York Public Library announced that poet and academic Kevin Young would begin as the Director in the \"late fall\" of 2016. \n\nThe Schomburg Collection was considered, in 1998, as consisting of the rarest, and most useful, Afrocentric artifacts of any public library in the United States. At least as late of 2006, it is viewed as the most prestigious for African-American materials in the country. As of 2010, the Collection stood at 10 million objects, The Center contains a signed, first edition of a book of poems by Phillis Wheatley, archival material of Melville J. Herskovits, John Henrik Clarke, Lorraine Hansberry, Malcolm X and Nat King Cole. The collection includes the files, or papers of the International Labor Defense, the Civil Rights Congress, the Symphony of the New World, and the National Negro Congress. It also includes the papers of Lawrence Brown (1893-1973), Ralph Bunche, Léon Damas, William Pickens, Hiram Rhodes Revels, Clarence Cameron White. The files of the South African Dennis Brutus Defense Committee (restricted). The collection also includes manuscripts of Alexander Crummell and John Edward Bruce, manuscripts of Slavery, Abolitionism and on the West Indies, and letters and unpublished manuscripts of Langston Hughes. It includes some papers from Christian Fleetwood, Paul Robeson (restricted), Booker T. Washington, and Schomburg himself. It includes musical recordings, black and jazz periodicals, rare books and pamphlets, and tens of thousands of art objects. The Center's collection includes documents signed by Toussaint Louverture and a rare recording of a speech by Marcus Garvey.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n\nReference books\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Its purpose was to collect specimens for the Smithsonian's new Natural History museum, now known as the National Museum of Natural History. The expedition collected around 11,400 animal specimens which took Smithsonian naturalists eight years to catalog. Following the expedition, Roosevelt chronicled it in his book \"African Game Trails\".\n\nThe group, led by the legendary hunter-tracker R. J. Cunninghame, included scientists from the Smithsonian and was joined from time to time by Frederick Selous, the famous big game hunter and explorer. Among other items, Roosevelt brought with him four tons of salt for preserving animal hides, a lucky rabbit's foot given to him by boxer John L. Sullivan, a Holland & Holland double rifle in .500/450 donated by a group of 56 admiring Britons, a Winchester 1895 rifle in .405 Winchester, an Army (M1903) Springfield in .30-06 caliber stocked and sighted for him, a Fox No. 12 shotgun, and the famous Pigskin Library, a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk. Participants on the Expedition included Roosevelt's son, Kermit, Edgar Alexander Mearns, Edmund Heller, and John Alden Loring.\n\nThe party set sail from New York City on the steamer Hamburg on March 23, 1909, shortly after the end of Roosevelt's presidency on March 4. The party landed in Mombasa, British East Africa (now Kenya), traveled to the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) before following the Nile to Khartoum in modern Sudan. Financed by Andrew Carnegie and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and for the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\n\nRoosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11,397 animals. According to Theodore Roosevelt’s own tally, the figure included about four thousand birds, two thousand reptiles and amphibians, five hundred fish, and 4,897 mammals (other sources put this figure at 5,103). Add to this marine, land and freshwater shells, crabs, beetles and other invertebrates, not to mention several thousand plants, and the number of natural history specimens totals 23,151. A separate collection was made of ethnographic objects. The material took eight years to catalogue. The larger animals shot by Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt are listed on pages 457 to 459 of his book\" African Game Trails\". The total is 512, of which 43 are birds. The number of big game animals killed, was 17 lion, 3 leopard, 7 cheetah, 9 hyena, 11 elephant, 10 buffalo, 11 (now very rare) black rhino and 9 White rhino. Most of the 469 larger non big game mammals included 37 species and subspecies of antelopes. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals which were required to provide fresh meat for the large number of porters employed to service the expedition. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington, D.C.; the quantity took years to mount, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other museums. Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, \"I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.\" In assessing whether the toll of animals was excessive in that the animals taken spanned a period of ten months, and were procured over an area that ranged from Mombasa through Kenya, to Uganda and the Southern Sudan, a distance travelled, with side trips, of several thousand kilometres. The diversity of larger mammal species collected was such that few individuals of any species were shot in any given area, and the large mammals collected had a negligible impact on the great herds of game that roamed East Africa at that time. Apologists for the Roosevelts have pointed out that the number of each big game species shot was very modest by the standards of the time: many white hunters of that period, for example, such as Karamoja Bell, had killed over 1,000 elephants each, while the Roosevelts between them killed just eleven. In making this comparison it has to be remembered that the white hunters weren’t collecting specimens for museums, but were employed by landowners to clear animals from land they wanted to use for plantations.\n\nAlthough the safari was conducted in the name of science, it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion; Roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land-owning families, and met many native peoples and local leaders. Roosevelt became a Life Member of the National Rifle Association, while President, in 1907 after paying a $25 fee. He later wrote a detailed account in the book \"African Game Trails\", where he describes the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science.\n\nWhile Theodore Roosevelt greatly enjoyed hunting, he was also an avid conservationist. In \"African Game Trails\" he condemns \"game butchery as objectionable as any form of wanton cruelty and barbarity\" (although he does note that \"to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head, not of soundness of heart\") and as a pioneer of wilderness conservation in the USA he fully supported the British Government's attempts at that time to set aside wilderness areas as game reserves, some of the first on the African continent. He notes (page 17) that \"in the creation of the great game reserve through which the Uganda railway runs the British Government has conferred a boon upon mankind\", a conservation attitude which Roosevelt helped sow that finally grew and blossomed in the form of the great game parks of East Africa today.\n\n"}

It operates the Twin Galaxies website and publishes the \"Twin Galaxies' Official Video Game & Pinball Book of World Records\", with the Arcade Volume released on June 2, 2007. \"The Guinness World Records - Gamers Edition 2008\" was released in March, 2008 in conjunction with Twin Galaxies, who Guinness World Records considers to be the official supplier of verified world records to the annual volume.\n\nIn mid-1981, Walter Day, founder of Twin Galaxies Incorporated, visited more than 100 video game arcades over four months, recording the high scores that he found on each game. On November 10, he opened his own arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa, naming it Twin Galaxies. On February 9, 1982, his database of records was released publicly as the Twin Galaxies National Scoreboard.\n\nTwin Galaxies became known as the official scoreboard, arranging contests between top players. Twin Galaxies' first event attracted international media attention for gathering the first teams of video-game stars. Top players in North Carolina and California were formed into state teams that faced off in a \"California Challenges North Carolina All-Star Playoff\", playing on 17 different games in Lakewood, California, and Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. California defeated North Carolina 10–7 over the weekend of August 27–30, 1982.\n\nSimilar competitions were also conducted during the summers of 1983 and 1984 when Day organized the players in many U.S. states to form teams and compete in high score contests for the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". The states included California, North Carolina, Washington, Illinois, Nebraska, Ohio, Michigan, Idaho, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, Alaska, Iowa and Kansas.\n\nOn November 30, 1982, Ottumwa mayor Jerry Parker declared the town \"Video Game Capital of the World\", a claim that was backed up by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, Atari and the Amusement Game Manufacturers Association in a ceremony at Twin Galaxies on March 19, 1983.\n\nTwin Galaxies' status as the official scorekeeper was further enhanced by support from the major video game publications of the early 1980s. Beginning in the summer of 1982, \"Video Games\" magazine and \"Joystik\" magazine published full-page high-score charts taken from Twin Galaxies' data. These high-score tables were published during the entire lives of these magazines. Additional high-score charts also appeared in \"Videogiochi\" (Milan, Italy), \"Computer Games\", \"Video Game Player\" magazine and \"Electronic Fun\" magazine. Twin Galaxies' high-score charts also appeared in \"USA Today\" (April 22, 1983), \"Games\" magazine and was distributed sporadically in 1982 and 1983 by the Knight-Ridder news service as an occasional news feature, originating from the \"Charlotte Observer\".\n\nTwin Galaxies brought top players together on November 7, 1982, to be photographed by \"Life\" magazine. This photo session is the subject of a recent documentary film, \"\", which was screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. On January 8–9, 1983, Twin Galaxies organized the first significant video-game championship, to crown a world champion. This event was filmed in Ottumwa by ABC-TV's \"That's Incredible!\" and was aired on the night of February 21, 1983.\n\nIn March 1983, Twin Galaxies was contracted by the Electronic Circus to assemble a professional troupe of video game superstars who would travel with the Circus as an \"act.\" With Walter Day hired as the \"Circus Ringmaster\", Twin Galaxies supplied a squad of 15 world-record holders on Twin Galaxies' high-score tables. Though the Circus was scheduled to visit 40 cities in North America, its Boston inaugural performance, opening in the Bayside Exposition Ctr. on July 15, 1983, lasted only five days, closing on July 19. The players selected by Twin Galaxies for the Circus are believed to be history's first professionally contracted video game players.\n\nOn July 25, 1983, Twin Galaxies established the professional U.S. National Video Game Team, the first such, with Walter Day as team captain. The USNVGT toured the United States during the summer of 1983 in a 44-foot GMC bus filled with arcade games, appearing at arcades around the nation and conducting the 1983 Video Game Masters Tournament, the results of which were published in the 1984 U.S. edition of \"Guinness World Records\". Under the direction of Day, functioning as an assistant editor for the \"Guinness Book\" in charge of video-game scores, the USNVGT gathered annual contest results that were published in the 1984—1986 U.S. editions. In September 1983, the USNVGT visited the Italian and Japanese Embassies in Washington D.C. to issue challenges for an international video game championship. In 1987, the USNVGT toured Europe where it defeated a team of UK video game superstars. Every month between 1991 and 1994, the U.S. publication \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\"), published a full-page high-score table titled \"The U.S. National Video Game Team's International Scoreboard\".\n\nIn 1988 the Guinness Book of World records stopped publishing records from Twin Galaxies due to a decline in interest for arcade games.\n\nOn February 8, 1998, \"Twin Galaxies' Official Video Game & Pinball Book of World Records\" was published. It is a 984-page book containing scores compiled since 1981. A second edition was published as a three-volume set in 2007. A third edition was published in 2009.\n\nFounder Walter Day left Twin Galaxies in 2010 to pursue a career in music, and since then ownership of Twin Galaxies has changed hands several times. In 2013 Twin Galaxies began charging a fee for score submissions. \n\nIn March 2014, Jace Hall announced himself as the new owner of Twin Galaxies. On April 28, 2014, the full Twin Galaxies website, including the high score database and forum content, came back online.\n\nThe U.S. National Video Game Team was founded on July 25, 1983 in Ottumwa, Iowa by Walter Day and the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard.\n\n\nTwin Galaxies organized the first Video Game Film Festival on June 2, 2001, at the Funspot Family Fun Center in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire as a vehicle to document the cultural impact that video games have exerted on today's society. A second festival is planned but no date has been set.\n\nTwin Galaxies conducted the first Console Video Game World Championship during Twin Galaxies' 1st Annual Twin Galaxies' Video Game Festival at the Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota, on the weekend of July 20–22, 2001. This event is also known as the Console Game World Championship and had originally been planned for March 24–25, 2001 at the Sheraton Dallas Brookhollow Hotel in Dallas, Texas, but was moved forward to the Mall of America event.\n\nThe second Console Video Game World Championship was held the weekend of July 12–14, 2002, at the 2nd Annual Twin Galaxies' Video Game Festival at the Mall of America.\n\nTwin Galaxies conducted the first \"Classic Video Game World Championship\" on June 2–4, 2001 at the Funspot Family Fun Center in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire. The winner of this renewed video game contest was Dwayne Richard with Donald Hayes coming in second place. This event was descended from the Coronation Day Championships that were conducted by Twin Galaxies in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 2000. The 2nd \"Classic Video Game World Championship\" was conducted on the weekend of June 30–July 2, 2002. The winner was Dwayne Richard with Donald Hayes again coming in second place. This was the last year the contest was in this format. The following years had the Funspot location organizing and running the contest in a more informal arcade \"Player of the Year,\" format.\n\nIn July 2001 and 2002, Twin Galaxies conducted the annual Twin Galaxies' Video Game Festivals at the Mall of America, attracting approximately 50,000–75,000 attendees each year.\n\nOn August 15, 2005, Walter Day and the staff of Twin Galaxies led a contingent of USA and UK video game players to Paris, France, where they delivered an eight-foot (2.4 meter) tall Proclamation which proposed a \"London vs. Paris\" Video Game Championship.\n\nOn September 24, 2005, The U.S. National Video Game Team revived and formed a New England Chapter with Walter Day as the national team captain and David Nelson of Derry, New Hampshire, as the chapter captain.\n\nIn the first week of July, 1985, Twin Galaxies conducted the 1st Twin Galaxies Iron Man Contest. The goal of the Iron Man competition was simple: competitors had to continue playing their game for as long as they could. If anyone passed 100 hours, they would be awarded a $10,000 prize from the Sports Achievement Association.\n\nThe winner of the contest was 18-year-old James Vollandt, who carried his \"Joust\" game for 67½ hours. The game malfunctioned at around 58 hours, wiping out all of his 210 extra lives. However, he earned back forty of them. He left the game voluntarily with a record-breaking score of 107,216,700 points, a record that stood until 2010, when John McAllister broke the record over live streaming video on justin.tv.\n\nIn 2007, a film about Twin Galaxies and video game champions in the 1980s, \"\", was screened at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\"\", a feature documentary about retro arcade gamers, featuring Twin Galaxies, was released in theaters on August 24, 2007. The documentary was in large measure critical of Twin Galaxies' handling of challenges to long-established top scores, suggesting that its organizational structure is rife with conflicts of interest.\n\n\"Frag\", a feature documentary about modern professional gamers, was released on DVD on August 1, 2008 by Cohesion Productions of Cedar Falls, Iowa. The first ten minutes of the documentary recapped Twin Galaxies' role as the pioneers of organized video game playing back in the early 1980s.\n\n\"Man vs Snake: The Long and Twisted Tale of Nibbler\", a feature documentary about the video game Nibbler, was released worldwide in 2016. The film includes Twin Galaxies history and the competition for high scores. Walter Day is featured throughout the film.\n\nSince August 1, 1982, Twin Galaxies has been producing unique, colorful posters to document gaming events. Though the first dozen posters issued in the early 1980s enjoyed printing runs of 500 – 1,000 copies each, the posters created in later years have been issued as limited editions with only 20-24 copies produced of each one.\n\nScores by both Todd Rogers and Billy Mitchell have been called into question and found to be fraudulent. Rogers was revealed to have entered bogus records into the database either by himself or a referee friend, whereas Mitchell used an emulator to reach his scores while claiming to have played on an original arcade machine, in violation of the Twin Galaxies rules.\n\n\n"}

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which is responsible for government buildings, was also developing a system. The AIA and GSA agreed on a system and named it UNIFORMAT. The AIA included it in their practice on construction management, and the GSA included it their project estimating requirements. In 1989, ASTM International began developing a standard for classifying building elements, based on UNIFORMAT. It was renamed to UNIFORMAT II.

{"id": "25901032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25901032", "title": "Whitepages (company)", "text": "Whitepages (company)\n\nWhitepages is a provider of online directory services, fraud screening and identity verification for businesses, public record background checks, and other products, based on its database of contact information for people and businesses. It has the largest database available of contact information on US residents.\n\nWhitepages was founded in 1997 as a hobby for then-Stanford student Alex Algard. It was incorporated in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.\n\nThe idea for Whitepages was conceived by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard was searching for a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job to focus on the website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.\n\nThe site grew and attracted more advertisers. The company brokered deals with Yellowpages and Superpages, whereby Whitepages earned revenue for sending them referral traffic. By 2005, $15 million in annual revenues was coming from these contracts. In 2003, Algard stepped down as CEO to focus on CarDomain.com, which he had also founded and Max Bardon took his place as CEO temporarily. In 2005, Technology Crossover Ventures and Providence Equity Partners invested $45 million in the company. That same year, MSN adopted Whitepages' directory data for its \"Look it up\" feature. Algard returned to the company in 2007. By the end of that year, the Whitepages database had grown to 180 million records and the company was listed as one of Deloitte's 500 fastest growing technology companies in North America three times. By 2008 the company had $66 million in annual revenues.\n\nIn 2008, Whitepages said it would start working on options for users to control their information on the site. That same year, it acquired VoIP developer Snapvine in order to add features where users could be called through the website without giving out their phone number. It also introduced an api, which gave third-party developers access to Whitepages' data. Whitepages released an iOS app that August, followed by the Whitepages Caller ID app for Android devices in February 2009 and for Blackberry that May.\n\nThe app displays information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. It originally had the ability to display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of the caller. The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.\n\nWhitepages.com underwent a re-design in 2009. According to VentureBeat reporter Matt Marshall, the redesign made the advertising \"cleaner\" and made it more obvious when someone was going to a third-party website like US Search. Marshall had previously criticized Whitepages, because website users that clicked on US Search ads and purchased data from US Search were sent through perpetual advertisements for other services that made it difficult to access the information they paid for. A local business lookup feature called \"Store Finder\" was added in June 2010. The following month, Whitepages.com launched a deal site, Dealpop.com, which differed from Groupon by offering short-term deals on nationally available products. Dealpop was sold to Tippr the following year.\n\nIn 2010, Superpages and Yellowpages cut back spending with Whitepages from $33 million to $7 million, causing a substantial decline in revenues and a tense relationship with investors. Algard spent $50 million in cash the company had on-hand and $30 million from a bank loan, to buyout the investors in 2013. He also used his personal house, savings account and personal belongings as collateral for the loan. Algard began shifting the company's business model to reduce its reliance on advertising and instead focus on business users and paid subscriptions.\n\nWhitepages released the Localicious app in July 2011. The app was released on Android first, because Whitepages was frustrated with Apple's approval process for iPhone apps. Whitepages PRO was also introduced that same year. An updated Android app called Current Caller ID was released in August 2012. Within a year of its release, 5 billion calls and texts had been transmitted using the app. It was updated in July 2013 with new features, such as the ability to customize the layout of caller information for each caller and the ability to \"Like\" Facebook posts from within the app. In June 2013, Whitepages acquired Mr. Number, an Android app for blocking unwanted callers.\n\nIn August 2013 Whitepages purchased all the interests in the company owned by investors for $80 million. In 2015, WhitePages acquired San Francisco-based NumberCorp to improve the database of phone numbers used for scams in the Caller ID app. In April 2016, Whitepages spun-off its caller ID business into a separate company called Hiya with a staff of 40 in Seattle. In September 2016, Alex Algard stepped down as CEO of WhitePages, in order to focus on the mobile spam-blocking spin-off Hiya. He appointed Rob Eleveld as the new WhitePages CEO.\n\n\nWhitepages has the largest database of contact information on Americans. As of 2008, it had data on about 90 percent of the US adult population, including 200 million records on people and 15 million business listings. Whitepages' data is collected from property deeds, telecom companies, and public records. Privacy is a common concern regarding Whitepages' publishing of personal contact information. The Whitepages.com website has features that allow users to remove themselves from the directory or correct and update information. WhitePages.com has about 50 million unique visitors per month and performs two billion searches per month.\n\nWhitePages started developing features for business users around 2010. WhitePages Pro is used for things like verifying the identity of a sales lead, find fake form data in online forms and to check form data from consumers making a purchase against common indicators of fraud, like shipping to a mailbox at an unoccupied building. In 2016, advertising on WhitePages.com was turned off in favor of selling monthly subscriptions that give users unlimited background checks and other records.\n\nAs of 2013 Whitepages provides its data and related services through seven web properties, ten mobile apps and through multiple web properties, including 411.com and Switchboard.com. The Hiya app (previously known as WhitePages Caller ID) checks incoming calls against a database of phone numbers known for spam or scam calls and helps users report scams to the Federal Trade Commission. Hiya mobile app replaces the Android user interface for making and receiving phone calls.\n\n"}
{"id": "723060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723060", "title": "Willis Carto", "text": "Willis Carto\n\nWillis Allison Carto (July 17, 1926 – October 26, 2015) was an American political activist on the American far right. He described himself as Jeffersonian and populist, but was primarily known for his promotion of antisemitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial.\n\nCarto was one of America's most influential political racial theorists through the Liberty Lobby and successor organizations which he helped create. Carto ran a group supporting segregationist George Wallace's 1968 presidential campaign which formed the basis for the National Youth Alliance which promoted Francis Parker Yockey's political philosophy. Carto helped found the Populist Party, which served as an electoral vehicle for white supremacist group and Ku Klux Klan members, such as David Duke in 1988 and Christian Identity supporter Bo Gritz in 1992. Carto ran \"American Free Press,\" another extremist organization, which publishes anti-semitic and racist books and features columns by Joe Sobran, James Traficant, Paul Craig Roberts, and others. The organization promotes 9/11 conspiracy theories. Carto's many other projects included the Institute for Historical Review, which promotes Holocaust denial.\n\nWillis Carto was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He fought in World War II, serving in the Philippines and earning the Purple Heart. After leaving the military he lived with his parents in Mansfield, Ohio. He took at least some classes at the University of Cincinnati Law School. He later worked for Procter & Gamble and moved west to San Francisco, California where he worked for the Household Finance Company.\n\nWillis Carto was a devotee of the writings of Francis Parker Yockey. Yockey promoted Adolf Hitler's German National Socialism movement, harsh criticism of the influence of Jews, and other Fascist causes and worked with the Nazi aligned German-American Bund and the National German-American Alliance. While in prison for possessing falsified passports, Yockey was visited by Carto. Yockey's book, \"\", was adopted by Carto as his own guiding ideology.\n\nLater, Carto would define his ideology as Jeffersonian and populist rather than National Socialist, particularly in Carto's 1982 book, \"Profiles in Populism\". That book presented sympathetic profiles of several United States political figures including Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Henry Ford, as well as Catholic priest Father Charles Coughlin who used radio to issue commentary in support of the policies of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.\n\nIn 1955, Carto founded an organization called Liberty Lobby, which remained in operation under his control until 2001, when the organization was forced into bankruptcy as a result of a lawsuit. Liberty Lobby published \"The Spotlight\" newspaper between 1975 and 2001.\n\nCarto and several \"Spotlight\" staff members and writers subsequently founded a new newspaper called the \"American Free Press\". The paper includes articles from syndicated columnists who have no direct ties to Carto or his organizations.\n\nIn 1966, Carto acquired control of \"The American Mercury\" via the Legion for the Survival of Freedom organization. It was published until 1980.\n\nCarto ran a group called \"Youth for George Wallace\" to aid the third party presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968. When the campaign failed, he converted what remained of the Youth for George Wallace organization into the National Youth Alliance. As National Chairman for this group, Carto was successful in recruiting William Luther Pierce, who later became famous for his authorship of \"The Turner Diaries\". Eventually, Carto lost control of the National Youth Alliance to Pierce who transformed it into the National Alliance, which is today a white nationalist and white separatist political organization.\n\nOn September 10, 1971, the conservative magazine \"National Review\" published a detailed critique of Carto's activities up to that point. It was titled \"Liberty Lobby - Willis Carto and his Fronts.\"\n\nThe Institute for Historical Review was founded by Willis Carto in 1979. Carto was also the founder of a publishing company called Noontide Press, which published a number of books on white racialism, including Yockey's \"Imperium\" and David Hoggan's \"The Myth of the Six Million\", one of the first books to deny the Holocaust. Noontide Press later became closely associated with the IHR, and fell out of Carto's hands at the same time as the IHR did.\n\nThe IHR and Carto were sued in 1981 by public interest attorney William John Cox on behalf of Auschwitz survivor Mel Mermelstein. In that case, which was to eventually last eleven years, the court took \"judicial notice of the fact that Jews were gassed to death at Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944.\" The court went on to state, \"It is simply a fact.\" The law firm of Robert Von Esch, Jr., representing the defendants, settled with the plaintiff to remove themselves from the case by agreeing to pay $100,000 and an explicit apology for having filed an August 1986 libel suit by the IHR against Mermelstein. The Von Esches also formally acknowledged that Jews had been gassed at Auschwitz and that millions of Jews had perished in German wartime camps. On September 19, 1991, the plaintiffs withdrew complaints of libel, conspiracy to inflict emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress, following Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen M. Lachs' dismissal of the malicious prosecution portion of the case.\n\nAfter losing control of Noontide Press and the IHR in a hostile takeover by former associates, Carto started another publication, \"The Barnes Review\", with the focus also on Holocaust denial.\n\nIn 1984, Carto was involved in starting a new political party called the Populist Party. It quickly fell out of his hands in a hostile takeover by disgruntled former associates. Critics asserted that this Populist Party (not to be confused with the 19th-century People's Party, commonly known as \"Populists\") was little more than an electoral vehicle for current and former Ku Klux Klan and Christian Identity members. Olympic athlete Bob Richards (1984), David Duke (a founder of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and a future Louisiana state representative, 1988) and former Green Beret Bo Gritz (1992) were the Populist Party's only three presidential candidates. It folded before it could nominate a candidate for the 1996 elections.\n\nCarto's Liberty Lobby acquired the Sun Radio Network in December 1989, and attempted to use talk radio as a vehicle for espousing his views. It was eventually a financial failure. Liberty Lobby and \"American Free Press\" also sponsored the \"Radio Free America\" talk show. Carto also formed the Foundation to Defend the First Amendment, one of several nonprofits Carto used to spread money to like-minded individuals and groups. Carto also published Barnes Review from 1994.\n\nIn 2004, Carto joined in signing the New Orleans Protocol on behalf of \"American Free Press\". The New Orleans Protocol seeks to \"mainstream our cause\" by reducing internecine warfare. It was written by David Duke.\n\nCarto has also been featured as a guest on \"The Political Cesspool\", which, according to its statement of principles, represents \"a philosophy that is pro-White.\" He has spoken at meetings conducted by \"Pastor\" Thomas Robb, a prominent Ku Klux Klan leader and Christian Identity advocate and in 2015 participated in the ground breaking ceremony for the Christian Revival Research and Development Center being built on Robb's compound in Arkansas, along with Edward Fields and Canadian white supremacist Paul Fromm.\n\nIn 2007, Carto condemned the \"genocidal maniacs like Vice President Cheney and commentator Bill O'Reilly\" in their support of the Bush administration's attack on Iraq. Carto defended Iraq as a \"highly civilized, independent, stable country with 6,000 years of proud history\" where over \"800,000 innocent men, women and children have been killed, and at least one million wounded, an untold number of homes have been demolished, roads blown up, buildings destroyed.\" Carto warned that \"now the crooks are prodding America to attack Iran\" and condemned \"the war cries of cowardly 'neo-con' Israel-firsters who literally demand war against Iran\". He expressed the fear that American bombs might kill enough Iranians so that Israel will \"establish control over the entire theatre and those who presently live there will become Jewish serfs—like the Palestinians.\" His media outlets have supported candidate and congressman Ron Paul.\n\nCarto died on October 26, 2015 at the age of 89, reportedly from cardiac arrest. In February 2016, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery (which the family had the right to request because he had earned a Purple Heart.) Far-right, white nationalist leader Pastor Thomas A. Robb presided over his funeral.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1134376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1134376", "title": "Wye River Memorandum", "text": "Wye River Memorandum\n\nThe Wye River Memorandum was an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at a summit in Wye River, Maryland, U.S., held from 15–23 October 1998. The Memorandum aimed to resume the implementation of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (Oslo II Accord). It was signed in the White House by Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, through negotiations led by U.S. President Bill Clinton, on 23 October 1998. On 17 November 1998 Israel's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. The Memorandum determined that it would enter into force on 2 November 1998, ten days from the date of signature.\n\nOn 18 December 1998, the Clinton administration and the EU declared their contentment about the implementation of the first phase of the Memorandum by both sides. Israel, however, had only implemented stage 1 of the further redeployment (F.R.D.), meaning that it had withdrawn from 2% of Area C instead of the required 13%. Both parties accused each other of not fulfilling its share of responsibilities under the Wye River Memorandum, and the further implementation of the agreement remained unfinished.\n\nThe summit was brokered by the United States at the Aspen Institute Wye River Conference Centers near Wye Mills, Maryland, U.S. President Bill Clinton opened the summit at the secluded Wye River Conference Center on 15 October, and returned at least six times to the site to press Netanyahu and Arafat to finalize the deal. In the final push to get Netanyahu and Arafat to overcome remaining obstacles, Clinton invited King Hussein who had played a past role in easing tensions between the two men, to join the talks.\n\nOn the final day of the negotiations, the agreement almost fell through. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked President Bill Clinton to release Jonathan Pollard, an American naval intelligence officer who has been serving a life sentence since 1985 for giving classified information to Israel. A bitter disagreement arose, with Netanyahu claiming that Clinton had promised to release Pollard, and Clinton saying he had only promised to \"review\" the case. It was reported that then-Director of the CIA George Tenet had threatened to resign should Pollard be released.\n\nThe agreement was finally signed by Netanyahu and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat at the White House, with President Clinton playing a key role as the official witness.\n\nFor the implementation of the Oslo II Accord and to facilitate the Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, Israel and the Palestinian Authorities signed a number of agreements and protocols. The documents contained the reciprocal responsibilities, including those relating to further redeployments and security.\n\nIn 1994, the \"Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities Between Israel and the PLO\" was signed. In 1995, the \"Protocol on Further Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities\" followed. The 1997 Hebron Protocol settled the withdrawal from 80% of Hebron and its division into two Areas.\n\nThe Further Redeployments (F.R.D.) in the Wye River Memorandum refer to the three phases in Appendix 1 of Annex I of the Oslo II Accord, which would follow the previous redeployment from populated areas in the West Bank. Only the phases 1 and 2 are specified. Phase 3 was delegated to a \"Third further redeployment committee\" which was to be started.\n\nThe Phases one and two, not specified in the Oslo II Accord, comprised the transfer to the Palestinians of 13% from Area C and shifts of parts of Area B to Area A. The redeployment was divided into three stages, specified in the \"Time line\".\n\nIn total, 13% would thus be transferred from Area C. Area B would increase with 13% and Area A with 14%.\n\nIf the Memorandum had been implemented, Area C would theoretically have been reduced from circa 74% to 61%. Article I, however, determined that 3% of Area B would be designated as Nature Reserves with full Israeli control, meaning that the Palestinians would neither have free access to it, nor could build new constructions. This specification was a result of a misunderstanding regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's \"bottom line\" for Israeli territorial withdrawal. He told American negotiator Dennis Ross he could go as high as the \"lowest teen\" in percentage of territory, and Ross persuaded Chairman Arafat to accept the 13% figure. Later, Netanyahu insisted he had meant 11% withdrawal, so Ross surfaced the idea of using the nature reserves to bridge the 11% and 13% figures.\n\nIn the provisions on security arrangements of the Interim Agreement, the Palestinian side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Israeli side, against individuals falling under the Israeli side's authority and against their property, just as the Israeli side agreed to take all measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crime and hostilities directed against the Palestinian side, against individuals falling under the Palestinian side's authority and against their property. The two sides also agreed to take legal measures against offenders within their jurisdiction and to prevent incitement against each other by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction.\n\n(a) The Palestinian side was to make known its policy of zero tolerance for terror and violence against both sides.\n(b) A work plan developed by the Palestinian side would be shared with the U.S. and thereafter implementation would begin immediately to ensure the systematic and effective combat of terrorist organizations and their infrastructure.\n(c) In addition to the bilateral Israeli–Palestinian security cooperation, a U.S.–Palestinian committee would meet biweekly to review the steps being taken to eliminate terrorists cells and the support structure that plans, finances, supplies and abets terror.\n(d) The Palestinian side would apprehend the specific individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and terror for the purpose of further investigation, and prosecution and punishment of all persons involved in acts of violence and terror.\n(e) A U.S.–Palestinian committee would meet to review and evaluate information pertinent to the decisions on prosecution, punishment or other legal measures which affect the status of individuals suspected of abetting or perpetrating acts of violence and terror.\n\n(a) The Palestinian side would ensure an effective legal framework is in place to criminalize, in conformity with the prior agreements, any importation, manufacturing or unlicensed sale, acquisition or possession of firearms, ammunition or weapons in areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.\n(b) In addition, the Palestinian side would establish and vigorously and continuously implement a systematic program for the collection and appropriate handling of all such illegal items it accordance with the prior agreements. The U.S. agreed to assist in carrying out the program.\n(c) A U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would be established to assist and enhance cooperation in preventing the smuggling or other unauthorized introduction of weapons or explosive materials into areas under Palestinian jurisdiction.\n\n(a) The Palestinian side would issue a decree prohibiting all forms of incitement to violence or terror, and establishing mechanisms for acting systematically against all expressions or threats of violence or terror. This decree would be comparable to the existing Israeli legislation which deals with the same subject.\n(b) A U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would meet on a regular basis to monitor cases of possible incitement to violence or terror and to make recommendations and reports on how to prevent such incitement. The Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. sides would each appoint a media specialist, a law enforcement representative, an educational specialist and a current or former elected official to the committee.\n\nThe two sides agreed that their security cooperation would be based on a spirit of partnership and would include, among other things, the following steps:\n\nThere would be full bilateral security cooperation between the two sides which would be continuous, intensive and comprehensive.\n\nThere would be an exchange of forensic expertise, training, and other assistance.\n\nIn addition to the bilateral Israeli–Palestinian security cooperation, a high-ranking U.S.–Palestinian–Israeli committee would meet as required and not less than biweekly to assess current threats to deal with any impediments to effective security cooperation and coordination and address the steps being taken to combat terror and terrorist organizations.\n\n(a) The Palestinian side would provide a list of its policemen to the Israeli side in conformity with the prior agreements.\n(b) Should the Palestinian side request technical assistance, the U.S. indicated its willingness to help meet those needs in cooperation with other donors.\n(c) The Monitoring and Steering Committee would, as part of its functions, monitor the implementation of this provision and brief the U.S.\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Central Council should reaffirm the letter of 22 January 1998 from PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat to President Clinton concerning the nullification of the Palestinian National Charter provisions that were inconsistent with the letters exchanged between the PLO and the Government of Israel on 9–10 September 1993.\n\nAmong other forms of legal assistance in criminal matters, there were requests for the arrest and transfer of suspects and defendants. The United States had been requested by the sides to report on a regular basis on the steps being taken to respond to the above requests.\n\nAccepted norms of human rights and the rule of law, and would be guided by the need to protect the public, respect human dignity, and avoid harassment.\n\n\nThe two sides would immediately resume permanent status negotiations on an accelerated basis and will make a determined effort to achieve the mutual goal of reaching an agreement by 4 May 1999.\n\nRecognizing the necessity to create a positive environment for the negotiations, neither side should initiate or take any step that would change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in accordance with the Interim Agreement.\n\nThe Wye agreement was broadly popular in Israel, with 74% of Israelis supporting the agreement according to early-November polling. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu sensed opposition within his Likud party and delayed a vote of cabinet approval while he sought public assurances from the Clinton administration about the implementation of Wye. Rather than join a national unity government with opposition leader Ehud Barak, Netanyahu tried to assuage Likud hardliners by stopping implementation of Wye in early December over confrontations between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers. Disapproval of Netanyahu's policies from Barak's Labor Party and the Likud right resulted in a vote of no confidence against his government that prompted general elections in May 1999; Barak was victorious and pledged to continue the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.\n\n"}

This can sometimes be very confusing as YP (AT&T) and yellow pages are similar in nature.\n\nThe name and concept of \"yellow pages\" came about in 1883, when a printer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, working on a regular telephone directory ran out of white paper and used yellow paper instead. In 1886, Reuben H. Donnelley created the first official Yellow Pages directory.\n\nToday, the expression \"yellow pages\" is used globally, in both English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. In the United States, it refers to the category, while in some other countries it is a registered name and therefore a proper noun. The term \"Yellow Pages\" is not a registered name within the United States and is freely used by many companies. Telephone directories using the official internet address \"yellowpages.xx\" exist in 75 different countries. They are edited by many different phone companies and directory publishers, mostly independent from each other.\n\nIn Belgium, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, and Romania, the yellow pages are known as the \"Golden Pages\". In Austria and Germany, the yellow pages are known as \"Gelbe Seiten\", and in Sweden as \"Gula Sidorna\", which in both cases means the yellow pages. In Portugal and Brazil, the yellow pages are known as \"Páginas Amarelas\". In Spain, Chile, Peru, Argentina and other countries in Latin America, the yellow pages are known as \"páginas amarillas\". In France and in francophone Canada, they're known as \"Pages jaunes\". In Italy and Italian Switzerland they are known as \"Pagine gialle\". In Japan, the yellow pages are known as \"Town Page\". In Sri Lanka, the yellow pages are known as the \"Rainbow Pages\", or the \"silver page\".\n\nA particular yellow pages is a print directory which provides an alphabetical listing of businesses within a specific geographical area (e.g., the Tampa Bay area), which are segregated under headings for similar types of businesses (e.g., plumbers). Traditionally these directories have been published by the local phone company, but there are numerous independent directory publishers. Some yellow pages publishers focus on a particular demographic (e.g., Christian yellow pages or business pages).\n\nYellow pages directories are usually published annually, and distributed for free to all residences and businesses within a given coverage area. The majority of listings are plain and in small black text. The yellow pages publishers generate profit by selling advertising space or listings under each heading. Advertising may be sold by a direct sales force or by approved agencies (CMR's). Available advertising space varies among publishers and ranges from bold names up to four color twin page ads (\"double trucks\").\n\nIn the United States, the predominant yellow pages are DEX One's DEX, the AT&T Real Yellow Pages, Yellowbook, and the Verizon Superpages.\nBusiness listings used for publication are obtained by several methods. Local phone companies that publish yellow pages directories rely on their own customer lists and include business listings that are provided by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs). Business owners that utilize phone services other than the local phone company (typically a Bell Company) should make certain that their information has been sent to the publisher for printing in upcoming directories.\n\nAdvertising in yellow pages directories requires payment in full prior to printing or may be billed monthly over the life of the contract, which is usually 12 months. Typically, a sales representative will assist the customer in creating their ad design and provides a Proof Copy for review and approval. Advertisers should be aware that many contracts have automatic renewal clauses and require action on the part of the advertiser to end future billing.\n\nYellow pages print usage is reported to be declining with both advertisers and shoppers increasingly turning to Internet search engines and online directories. According to a study by Knowledge Networks/SRI, in 2007, print yellow pages were referenced 13.4 billion times, while Internet yellow pages references increased to 3.8 billion, up from 2006’s 3.3 billion online searches. As a result, most yellow pages publishers have attempted to create online versions of their print directories. These online versions are referred to as IYP or Internet yellow pages. Independent ad agencies or Internet marketing consultants can assist business owners in determining sound opportunities for yellow pages advertising and provide objective information on usage, possession and preferences.\n\nArchived yellow pages and telephone directories are important tools in local historical research, trademark litigation, and genealogy.\n\nThe \"Walking Fingers\" logo was created by Henry Alexander, a well known New England artist. Upon graduation from the Swain School of Design in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Mr. Alexander began a freelance career as an illustrator and commercial designer. He formed a long association with the New England Telephone Company lasting thirty-one years. In 1962 he designed the \"walking fingers\" logo and within a year it became the national trademark for their yellow pages.\n\nAT&T, the creator and owner of the most famous three-fingered version of the \"Walking Fingers\" logo, never applied for a trademark on the logo. While they eventually received a trademark on a different version of the logo, the version with the three fingers was not considered by AT&T to be proprietary and they in fact allowed any telephone directory to use it. Throughout the 1970s, many cities ran television ads showing a disembodied hand \"walking\" across an open copy of the Yellow Pages, with the slogan \"Let Your Fingers Do the Walking.\"\n\nThe Bell System later applied for a trademark on the logo but had their trademark denied on the grounds that it \"had become a generic indicator of the yellow pages without regard to any particular source.\" Shortly thereafter, Bell began using a trademarkable logo with a lightbulb instead of the walking fingers, but returned to the walking fingers two years later.\n\nIn some countries, the familiar \"walking fingers\" logo is not protected as a trademark and may be used by anyone. This logo is used in varying forms by almost every yellow pages publisher; however, there are companies that use it to imitate mainstream publishers.\nIn Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, Israel and the Netherlands the directory, although using the yellow pages logo, is called \"Golden Pages\".\n\nOnline business directories are branded as IYP or Internet yellow pages. On a broader scale, they can be classified as vertical directories. There are consumer oriented and business oriented varieties. Providers of IYP offer online advertising.\n\nAccording to several reports the search term \"yellow pages\" was in the top 5 highest revenue generator of all search terms in Google's AdWords program in 2010. Experian/Hitwise reported in January 2011 that the search term \"yellow pages\" was one of the top 50 search terms across all search engines and all search terms(millions of search terms). This makes \"yellow pages\" one of the most searched for things on the Internet.\n\nThe Local Search Association released an online search usage study in June 2011. Their study of US consumers on how they find local businesses. 57% had used an Internet yellow pages in the past year. 58% had used a newspaper and 74% used a print phone book and 76% used a search engine. The Yellow Pages Association said in February 2011 that 75 percent of adults in the United States still used print yellow pages and that for every $1 in investment, businesses returned $15.\n\nIn 2009, Burke, a media research organization released a \"Local Media Tracking Survey\". A couple of highlights of the study found that users of Internet yellow pages reported that 36% of the time they used an IYP they made a purchase (more than 1 out of 3 leads purchased something). It was further reported that a large number of users had no company in mind when they began their search on Internet yellow pages. \n\nIt takes many keywords and search terms to cover a small businesses \"category\" or \"heading\" for search engines. Internet yellow pages allow a small business to advertise locally and target their audience with single familiar categories with such as \"attorney\" or \"florist\" or \"plumbing\".\n\nIt was reported by Borrell and Associates(a media research group) in March 2012 that online directories have a 12.6% share of the $19 billion local online advertising. \n\nIYP offers listings differently from standard search engines. Where search engines return results based on relevancy to the true search term, IYP returns results based on a geographic area.\n\nStudies by independent companies such as Nielson and comScore have shown that Internet yellow pages have a smaller percentage of total Internet searches, 85% of all Internet searches, occur on the major search engines Google, Yahoo and Bing.\n\nIYP is classified as a local search directory which provides content with the added ability to refine the search to find the needed service. The search engine prioritizes local businesses in its results rather than the results being dominated by regional or national companies. All services offer paid advertising options which typically offer preferred placement on search results pages.\n\nIn later years, the yellow pages industry faced scrutiny from environmentalist groups who claim printed yellow pages are a wasteful resource, citing statistics that by 2011 nearly 70% of all Americans rarely or never used printed phone directories. Other studies have found that a majority of consumers continue to use Yellow Pages. Approximately 58% of working U.S. adults said they use phone books at home, work or both, according to a 2013 survey by RingCentral that appeared in USA Today.\n\nThe Product Stewardship Institute claims local governments spend $54 million a year to dispose of unwanted phone books and $9 million to recycle them. Phone books use low grade glues and are therefore difficult to recycle, and they often clog recycling machinery. Publishers note that phone book directories are 100% recyclable and are made using soy-based and non-toxic inks, glues and dyes.\n\nIn 2011, San Francisco became the first city in the US to restrict yellow page distribution to people who opt in, but was being sued in federal court by the Local Search Association on freedom of speech grounds. According to the Sierra Club, 1.6 million phone books were distributed annually in San Francisco, producing 3600 tons of waste, $1 million in disposal costs, and 6180 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed, and the Mayor signed, an ordinance that repealed the Yellow Pages Distribution Pilot Program (Ordinance 130186).\n\nAlso in 2011, Yellow Pages Association and the Association of Directory Publishers started the yellowpagesoptout.com web site allowing anyone in the United States to choose not to receive directories. The site remains active in 2018.\n\nThe 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Municipal Solid Waste report classified directories as the smallest contributor of paper and paperboard products to the solid waste stream, representing only 0.3% – significantly less than all other paper product categories such as newspapers, magazines and books. In 2010, the EPA stopped measuring directories separately from newspapers, indicating the minor impact of directories on municipal waste.\n\nYellow Pages publishers reduced paper usage by nearly 60% between 2007–2012, and were projected to increase reduction to more than 60% by the end of 2013, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council. The EPA’s 2011 Municipal Waste report showed that approximately 73% of phone directory, newspaper and mechanical papers were recycled.\n\nIn September 2017 the UK publisher of Yellow Pages, Yell, announced that the business would be fully digitised from January 2019, ending the publication's 51-year run.\n\n\n"}
