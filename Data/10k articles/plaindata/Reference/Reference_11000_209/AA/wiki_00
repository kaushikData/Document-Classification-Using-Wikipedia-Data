{"id": "419808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419808", "title": "Anglicisation", "text": "Anglicisation\n\nAnglicisation (or anglicization, see English spelling differences), occasionally anglification, anglifying, Englishing, refers to modifications made to foreign words, names and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce, or understand in English. It commonly refers to the respelling of foreign words, often to a more drastic degree than romanisation. One example is the word \"dandelion\", modified from the French \"dent-de-lion\" (“lion’s tooth”, because of the sharply indented leaves).\n\nAnglicising non-English words for use in English is just one case of the widespread domestication of foreign words that is common to many languages, sometimes involving shifts in meaning. One example is the German word \"Felleisen\" (a backpack), a germanization of the French word \"valise\" (small suitcase).\n\nThis term does not cover the unmodified adoption of foreign words into English (kindergarten); the unmodified adoption of English words into foreign languages (internet, computer, web), or the voluntary or enforced adoption of the English language or of British or American customs and culture in other countries or ethnic groups, also known as social and economic anglicisation. (Examples being the action of the English crown in the Celtic regions of the United Kingdom, in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall; the policy on use of the English language as one of the causes contributing to the South African Wars (1879–1915); or the adoption of English as a personal, preferred language in countries where that language is not native, but has become for historical reasons the language of government, commerce, and instruction.)\n\nNon-English words may be anglicised by changing their form and/or pronunciation to something more familiar to English speakers. Changing grammatical endings is especially common. The Latin word \"obscenus\" has been imported into English in the modified form \"obscene\" . The plural form of a foreign word may be modified to more conveniently fit English norms, like using \"indexes\" as the plural of index, rather than indices, as in Latin. The word \"opera\" (itself the plural form of the Latin word \"opus\") is understood in English to be a singular noun, so it has received an English plural form, \"operas\". The English word \"damsel\" is an anglicisation of the Old French \"damoisele\" (modern \"demoiselle\"), meaning \"young lady\". Another form of anglicising is the inclusion of a foreign article as part of a noun (such as alkali from the Arabic \"al-qili\"). \"Rotten Row\", the name of a London pathway that was a fashionable place to ride horses in the 18th and 19 centuries, is an adaptation of the French phrase \"Route du Roi\". The word \"genie\" has been anglicized via Latin from jinn or djinn from , originally meaning demon or spirit. Some changes are motivated by the desire to preserve the pronunciation of the word in the original language, such as the word \"schtum\", which is phonetic spelling for the German word \"stumm\", meaning silent.\n\nThe word \"charterparty\" is an anglicisation of the French homonym \"charte partie\"; the \"party\" element of \"charterparty\" does not mean \"a party to the contract\".\n\nThe French word \"homage\" was introduced by the Normans after 1066, and its pronunciation became anglicised as /ˈhɒmɪdʒ/, with stress on the first syllable; but in recent times showbiz and Hollywood have taken to pronouncing \"homage\" in the French fashion, rhyming with \"fromage\".\n\nSome foreign place names are commonly anglicised in English. Examples include the Danish city København (Copenhagen), the Russian city Москва Moskva (Moscow), the Swedish city Göteborg (Gothenburg), the Dutch city Den Haag (The Hague), the Spanish city of Sevilla (Seville), and the Egyptian city of القاهرة Al-Qāhira (Cairo).\n\nSuch anglicisation was once more common. In the late 19th century, however, use of non-English place names in English began to become more common. When dealing with languages that use the same Latin alphabet as English, names are now more usually written in English as in their local language, sometimes even with diacritical marks that do not normally appear in English. With languages that use non-Latin alphabets, such as the Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Korean Hangul, and other alphabets, a direct transliteration is typically used, which is then often pronounced according to English rules. Non-Latin based languages may use standard romanisation systems, such as Japanese Rōmaji or Chinese Pīnyīn. The Japanese and Chinese names in English follow these spellings with some common exceptions, usually without Chinese tone marks and without Japanese macrons for long vowels: Chóngqìng to Chongqing (重慶, 重庆), Shíjiāzhuāng to Shijiazhuang (石家莊, 石家庄), both in China; Kyōto to Kyoto (京都) in Japan.\n\nMany English names for foreign places have been directly taken over from the French version, sometimes unchanged, such as Cologne, Rome, Munich, Naples, sometimes only slightly changed, like Vienna (Vienne), Venice (Venise), Lisbon (Lisbonne), Seville (Séville). The English city-name for the Czech capital, Prague (Praha), is taken with spelling unaltered from the French name for the city, itself descended from the Latin name for the city (Praga), which had been borrowed from an earlier Czech name (pre-dating the /g/>/h/ shift).\n\nDe-anglicisation has become a matter of national pride in some places and especially in regions that were once under colonial rule, where vestiges of colonial domination are a sensitive subject. Following centuries of English rule in Ireland, Douglas Hyde delivered an argument for de-anglicisation before the Irish National Literary Society in Dublin, 25 November 1892: \"When we speak of 'The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation', we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and, indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English.\" Despite its status as an official language, Irish has been reduced to a minority language in Ireland due to centuries of English rule, as is the case in North America where indigenous languages have been replaced by that of the British colonists. In the process of removing the signs of their colonial past, anglicised names have been officially discouraged in many places: Ireland's Kingstown, named by King George IV, reverted to its original Irish name of Dún Laoghaire in 1920, even before Irish independence in 1922; India's Bombay is now Mumbai, even though this is not the oldest local name (see Toponymy of Mumbai) and \"Bombay\" is still commonly used in the city; Calcutta is now Kolkata and Madras is Chennai. Bangladesh's Dacca is Dhaka. Many Chinese endonyms have become de-anglicised or otherwise replaced with the more recent Hanyu Pinyin Romanization scheme: Canton is now more commonly called Guangzhou (廣州, 广州), and Peking is generally referred to as Beijing (北京), although this reflected a name change from Beiping (Peiping) to Beijing (Peking) with the de-anglicisation of the name taking place after the name change to reflect a pronunciation change in the newly established Beijing dialect-based Mandarin.\n\nIn Scotland, many place names in Scots Gaelic were anglicised, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally because of unfamiliarity with Gaelic. Often the etymology of a place name is lost or obscured, such as in the case of Kingussie, from \"Cinn a' Ghiuthsaich\" (“The Heads of the Pine Forest”). In Wales, a large number of place names were anglicised, with some examples including: Caernarfon became Carnarvon, Conwy became Conway, Llanelli became Llanelly, Caerdydd became Cardiff. Many of these place names have since reverted, especially in the west of the country (as is the case for Llanelli, Caernarfon, Conwy and Porthmadog), though in the east Welsh and English spellings of place names are often seen side-by side even when very similar to each other, such as with Rhyl/Y Rhyl, or Blaenavon/Blaenafon.\n\nIn other cases, now well-established anglicised names, whatever their origin, have remained in common use where there is no national pride at stake. This is the case with Ghent (Gent, or Gand), Munich (München), Cologne (Köln), Vienna (Wien), Naples (Napoli), Rome (Roma), Milan (Milano), Athens (Αθήνα, Athina), Moscow (Москва, Moskva), Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург, Sankt-Peterburg), Warsaw (Warszawa), Prague (Praha), Bucharest (Bucureşti), Belgrade (Београд, Beograd), Lisbon (Lisboa), and other European cities whose names have been familiar in their anglicised forms for centuries. However, the present local names sometimes appear as alternatives on maps, and in public places (airports, road signs).\n\nSometimes a place name might appear anglicised compared with the current name, but the form being used in English is actually an older name that has since been changed. For example, Turin in the Piedmont province of Italy was named Turin in the original Piedmontese language, but is now officially known as Torino in Italian. The International Olympic Committee made the choice to regard the city officially as \"Torino\" throughout the 2006 Winter Olympics. The English and French name for Florence in Italy is closer to the original name in Latin (\"Florentia\") than is the modern Italian name (Firenze).\n\nIn the past, the names of people from other language areas were anglicised to a higher extent than today. This was the general rule for names of Latin or (classical) Greek origin. Today, the anglicised name forms are often retained for the more well-known persons, like Aristotle for Aristoteles, and Adrian (or later Hadrian) for Hadrianus. However, less well-known persons from antiquity are now often given their full original-language name (in the nominative case, regardless of its case in the English sentence).\n\nFor royalty, the anglicisation of personal names was a general phenomenon, especially until recently, such as Charles for Carlos, Karoly, and Karl, or Frederic for Friedrich or Fredrik. Anglicisation of the Latin is still the rule for popes: Pope John Paul II instead of Ioannes Paulus II, Pope Benedict XVI instead of Benedictus XVI, Pope Francis instead of Franciscus.\n\nThe anglicisation of medieval Scottish names consists of changing them from a form consistent with Scottish Gaelic to the Scots language, which is an Anglo-Frisian language. For instance, the king known in Scottish Gaelic as Domnall mac Causantín (Domnall son of Causantín) is known in Scots as Donald, son of Constantine.\n\nDuring the time in which there were large influxes of immigrants from Europe to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the names of many immigrants were never changed by immigration officials,(as demonstrated in \"The Godfather Part II\") but only by personal choice.\n\nFrench immigrants to the United States (of Huguenot or French Canadian background) often accommodated those unfamiliar with French pronunciations and spellings by altering their surnames in either of two ways: spellings were changed to fit the traditional pronunciation (Pariseau became Parizo, Boucher became Bushey, Mailloux became Mayhew), or pronunciations were changed to fit the spelling (Benoît, pronounced , became Benedict). In some cases, it could go either way (Gagné, pronounced , became or Gonyea), or something only slightly similar; (Bourassa became Bersaw).\n\nMost Irish names have been anglicised. An example is the surnames of many Irish families – for example, Ó Briain has often become O'Brien, Ó Rothláin became Rowland, Ó Néill became O'Neill, and some surnames may be shortened, like Ó Gallchobhair to just Gallagher. Likewise, native Scottish names were altered such as Somhairle to Sorley, Mac Gill-Eain to MacLean, and Mac Aoidh to MacKay. Many Welsh names have also been altered, such as \"ap Hywell\" to Powell, or \"ap Siôn\" to Jones.\n\nGerman names of immigrants were also anglicised (such as Bürger to Burger, Schneider to Snyder) in the course of German immigration waves during times of political and economic instability in the late 19th and early 20th century. A somewhat different case was the politically motivated change of dynasty name in 1917 by the royal family of the United Kingdom from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. Incidentally, Saxe-Coburg was already an anglicisation of the German original .\n\nMany Bengali surnames have been anglicised. Banerjee, Chatterjee and Mukherjee are anglicised forms of Bandhopadhay, Chatophadhay and Mukhopadhay respectively.\n\nThe anglicisation of a personal name now usually depends on the preferences of the bearer. Name changes are less common today for Europeans emigrating to the United States than they are for people originating in East Asian countries (except for Japan, which no longer has large-scale emigration). However, unless the spelling is changed, European immigrants put up with (and in due course accept) an anglicised pronunciation: \"Lewinsky\" will be so pronounced, unless the \"w\" becomes a \"v\", as in \"Levi\". \"Głowacki\" will be pronounced \"Glowacki\", even though in Polish pronunciation it is \"Gwovatski\". \"Weinstein\" is usually pronounced with different values for the two \"-ein-\" parts, (.\n\nAs is the case with place names and personal names, in some cases ethnic designations may be anglicised based on a term from a language other than that of the group described. For example, the names Germany (the country), German (the language), and Germans (the people) are minor modifications of the Latin designation (\"Germania\"), and not of the local names (Deutschland, Deutsch, Deutsche).\n\nSome ethnonyms have been considered offensive, although not always by the group involved, but because they had been used by others or in the past in a derogatory sense and were therefore considered tainted, and requiring replacement for that reason. Examples are Gypsy, Negro, Vandal, Bushman, Eskimo, Philistinism. This change is not, however, a matter of anglicisation but of political correctness.\n\n"}

The Khmer inhabited Mekong Delta started to become inundated with Vietnamese and in response the Vietnamese were subjected to Cambodian retaliation. After the Vietnamese successfully conquered Champa as part of the Vietnamese territory, the Vietnamese then moved to conquer Khmer in Mekong Delta. Following the beginning of French Cochinchina with the arrival of European troops and missionary, the Cambodians told Catholic European envoys that the Vietnamese persecution against Catholics justified retaliatory attacks launched against the Vietnamese colonists in Cambodia.\n\nIn 1978, under the administration of Democratic Kampuchea, especially when Cambodian socialists began to rebel in the eastern zone of Cambodia, Pol Pot ordered his armies to exterminate 1.5 million eastern Cambodians which branded as \"Cambodian with Vietnamese minds\" along with the 50 million Vietnamese in the area. This led to a war with the Vietnamese when the Vietnamese began to retaliate over the inhumane genocide and subsequently overthrow the Khmer Rouge from power. The King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk at the time also plead to United States President Lyndon B. Johnson for American forces to liberate Cambodia from the Viet Cong but to no avail.\n\nUntil the modern times, anti-Vietnamese sentiment continue to flare in Cambodia due to fear from Cambodians for what they believed that Vietnam will take over their land one day with some Cambodian opposition politicians continue to playing up the issue to justify their hatred against the Vietnamese. That was shown by attacks against Vietnamese resulting in the rape and murder of several Vietnamese in the country, as anti-Vietnamese anger has been too difficult to counter in Cambodia with an activist against racism even from the Cambodia ethnicity itself was given a death threat if he tried to interfere.\n\nOn 16 February 2014, an ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia, Tran Van Chien, was beaten to death by Cambodian mobs after a minor accident with the Cambodians. In March 2015, an 8-year-old Vietnamese girl, Ngo Ngoc Phut, was kidnapped and killed in Vietnam before her body been thrown into the side of Cambodian border near a casino as her mother who work in the Cambodian casino could not come up with a US$300 ransom. On 3 December, an ethnic Vietnamese fisherman was hacked to death by a pair of Cambodian assailants, armed with a machete and a pistol, but the suspects did not steal any property on the victim. On 29 March 2016, a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl in Phnom Penh who was selling flowers in the capital was abducted, raped and murdered by a Cambodian man who had just finished a drinking session.\n\nAs Mainland China has dominated Vietnam for a very indefinite of time, there has been a long unease sentiment towards China among Vietnamese community with more anti-Chinese sentiment is evident than anti-Vietnamese sentiment in China. Many Vietnamese girls who lived in northern Vietnam have been trafficked to China and sold into marriage for Chinese men. Recent tensions in the South China Sea have caused more hatred towards Chinese among the Vietnamese community. As a retaliation, a Chinese restaurant in Beijing refused to served foods to Vietnamese, Filipino and Japanese customers, the three countries being among China's loudest opponents in its territorial disputes.\n\nHatred towards foreigners especially to non-white people began to rise in Russia as they were blamed for the country's 10 years of failed reforms in which living standards plummeted. Prior to the Chechen–Russian conflict, especially when Russian authorities blamed the Chechen Muslims Jihadist as responsible in the Russian apartment bombings, this has fuelled more hatred towards immigrants in the country. Prior to this, Russian skinheads began to be formed with some of the group members joining to take revenge for their family members that had been killed during the bomb attacks, though some other Russians joined the group because they are just \"bored\" and want to bully people. Following the attack against Vietnamese in Russia as they also been included on Russian skinhead target list on immigrants, a protest was held by Vietnamese community in the country especially after the murder of 20-year old Vietnamese student, Vu Anh Tuan on 13 October 2004 with the protestor said:\n\nDespite the protest for protection from Russian authorities, Vietnamese people continue to be attacked as on 25 December 2004, two Vietnamese students at the Moscow Energy Institute, Nguyen Tuan Anh and Nguyen Hoang Anh suffered severe injuries and were subsequently hospitalised after they had been assaulted by a group of strangers with knives and clubs on the way back to their dormitory. On 13 March 2005, three Russians stabbed a 45-year-old Vietnamese man named Quan to death in front of his home in Moscow. On 22 March 2008, a 35-year old Vietnamese woman who worked at a Moscow market stabbed to death in an apparent race-hate killing. On 9 January 2009, a group of strangers in Moscow stabbed a 21-year-old Vietnamese student named Tang Quoc Binh resulting to his death on the next day.\n\nAmid continuous attacks against Vietnamese students and workers, around 600 Vietnamese were rounded up in August 2013 in the city of Moscow and placed in poor conditions tents while waiting to be deported from Russia.\n\nTension and hatred between Vietnamese immigrants and white fishermen rose up in Galveston Bay, Texas in 1981, and was intensified by the Ku Klux Klan following an invitation from the American fishermen to threatening and intimidating the Vietnamese to leave, which resulted in attacks on Vietnamese boats.\n\nVietnamese business owners, along with Korean Americans were disproportionately targeted during the Rodney King Riots.\n\n\n"}

The five men made it to the water's edge and began to look for driftwood to build a raft. In the meantime, their absence was discovered and guards swarmed the island with rifles and machine guns. Dark figures were spotted on the western shore and guards opened fire. Stamphill was shot in the legs multiple times but recovered. Doc Barker took a slug in the head and died several hours later. The remaining three inmates gave up immediately and were recaptured without injury. The beach was later named after Doc Barker by the National Park Service.\n"}
{"id": "174022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174022", "title": "Best alternative to a negotiated agreement", "text": "Best alternative to a negotiated agreement\n\nIn negotiation theory, the best alternative to a negotiated agreement or BATNA is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. This could include diverse situation, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances. BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator. A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.\n\nThe BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value, however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria. Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options. This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.\n\nSome people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style; a theoretical example of this is \"adversarial approach style negotiation\". Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding. According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.\n\nAttractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the best-selling book \"Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In\", the authors give 3 suggestions of how to accomplish this:\n\n\nIn negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.\n\nThe purpose here, as Philip Gulliver mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.\n\nPreparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behavior, bias-free behavior are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.\n\nBATNA was developed by negotiation researchers Roger Fisher and William Ury of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on Principled negotiation that started with \"Getting to YES\", unwittingly duplicating the game theory concept of a disagreement point from bargaining problems pioneered by Nobel Laureate John Forbes Nash decades earlier. A Nash Equilibrium is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy. For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.\n\n\n"}

It was an alphabetical bibliography that listed all the known books printed in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew.\n\nThe Swiss scholar Conrad Gessner started to compile his extensive work on \"Bibliotheca universalis\" at the age of 25. He first visited as many of the Italian and German libraries as he could find. His motivation was partly a fear of the loss of precious manuscripts, such as the destruction of the library at Buda, by the Turks in 1526. He described the project in its title, as involving works \"extant and not, ancient and more recent down to the present day, learned and not, published and hiding in libraries\". He published the completed work in 1545 in Zurich, after some four years of research. At the time, he wrote \"In truth I rejoice and thank God because I have finally gotten out of the labyrinth in which I was trapped for almost three years\". It included his own bio-bibliography. \"Bibliotheca universalis\" was the first modern bibliography of importance published since the invention of printing, and through it, Gessner became known as the \"father of bibliography.\"\n\nThe work attempted to be an exhaustive survey of known writing in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and included approximately three thousand authors The authors’ forenames were listed alphabetically according to mediaeval usage, with a reverse index of their surnames. It was intended as an index by subject of all known authors. Gessner listed the writers together with the titles of their works, short biographies, and publication details including place of printing, printers and editors. He added his own annotations, comments, and evaluations of the nature and merit of every entry. It included about twelve thousand titles.\n\nGessner followed Johannes Trithemius’s work of placing works in systems of cataloging. Gessner admired Trithemius’s systems and used them as guidelines and templates; however Gessner carried the idea of cataloging and systems a step further. Theodore Besterman, in \"The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography\", suggests that Gessner’s work to organize knowledge was the forerunner of Francis Bacon’s works and other encyclopedias that followed. Though called \"universal\", it was intended to be selective.\n\nIn 1548, Gessner followed this with a companion thematic index to \"Bibliotheca universalis\", a large folio, \"Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici & philosophiae professoris, libri xxi\" (\"Pandectae\").\n\nThe \"Pandectae\" had nineteen sections, each devoted to a scholarly discipline and contained dedications to the best scholar printers of Gessner's time. He listed their publications and accomplishments. The planned scope of 21 books was never completed, since part 20 \"De re medica\". was never published, and part 21 \"De theologia Christiana\" was published separately as \"Partitiones theologicae\" in 1549. A further supplement \"Appendix bibliothecae\" containing additions previously published separately by Lycosthenes (1551) and Simmler (1555) appeared in 1555.\n\nGessner made full use of any publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists which were available in the 16th century that were printed when he was doing his research. These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like Aldus Manutius of Venice and Henri Estienne of Paris.\n\nGessner's work, with its heterodox principles and advanced Protestant scholarship was a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church which soon banned the work in the Index librorum prohibitorum. The Counter Reformation's response took another generation of Catholic scholarship to produce and appeared on the Vatican press in Rome in 1593 under the programmatic title, \"Bibliotheca selecta\". This updated \"Anti-Gessner\" was assembled in 18 books covering the bibliography of the traditional scientific disciplines (Theology, 1-11, Law, 12, Philosophy, 13, Medicine, 14) and the liberal arts, 15-18, by the Mantuan Jesuit humanist and bibliographer Antonio Possevino.\n\n"}

{"id": "42657549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42657549", "title": "Encyclopedic novel", "text": "Encyclopedic novel\n\nThe encyclopedic novel is a literary concept popularised by Edward Mendelson in two 1976 essays (\"Encyclopedic Narrative\" and \"Gravity's Encyclopedia\"). In Mendelson's formulation, encyclopedic novels \"attempt to render the full range of knowledge and beliefs of a national culture, while identifying the ideological perspectives from which that culture shapes and interprets its knowledge\". He states that \"[b]ecause they are the products of an epic in which the world's knowledge is larger than any one person can encompass, they necessarily make extensive use of synecdoche\". Other qualities include \"the full account of at least one technology or science\" and the display of \"an encyclopedia of literary styles, ranging from the most primitive and anonymous levels ... to the most esoteric of high styles\". Key to Mendelson's definition is a short but significant interval between the era portrayed in the novel and the era of the novel's writing (as in, for example, James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", and Thomas Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\"). In more general terms, the encyclopedic novel is a long, complex work of fiction that incorporates extensive information (which is sometimes fictional itself), often from specialized disciplines of science and the humanities. Orderly plot structures are often absent.\n\nThere has been considerable debate about the nature and function of the encyclopedic novel since Mendelson's exposition of the concept. Hillary A. Clark attributes to this type of discourse the importance of ordering the information which the writer discovers and retrieves. Moreover, Clark points out that encyclopedic texts have a long history, from the Renaissance \"Divine Comedy\" of Dante to Ezra Pound's modernist \"The Cantos\". She explains that the urge to order the sum of all knowledge grew exponentially during the Renaissance and that by the 20th century we see writers such as Pound and James Joyce (whose \"Finnegans Wake\" is an example of an encyclopedic novel) simply recycling narratives. The encyclopedist's essential job regardless of the type of discourse, is to gather, recycle, and restate. The encyclopedic writer \"returns to the role of the medieval scribe … reading and copying the already known, the popular, as well as the esoteric,\" and hence the encyclopedic novel assumes an almost \"anti-creative\" function.\n\nThe illusion of encyclopedism experienced by the reader of such a novel might represent the author's exploration of the assumptions and practices embodied in the production of a real encyclopedia. Along these lines, a post-structuralist analysis of the encyclopedic novel sees it as critical of encyclopedism, the ostensible goal of which is to capture the sum of all human knowledge. This critique suggests that the encyclopedic project is \"tainted by its association with master narratives\" and that it reinforces the \"illusion of a totalizing system\" of knowledge. Encyclopedic novels in this view are commentaries on the limits of such narratives and systems. Given that the aura of encyclopedism in a work of fiction is necessarily an illusion, it points to a failure—a \"failure\" which may align with a novelistic intent to \"highlight the illusory basis of 'total knowledge'\". From this perspective, encyclopedic fiction suggests that \"we should not systematically encyclopedize but seek more 'open' approaches to knowledge\". On the other hand, Gustave Flaubert's encyclopedic \"Bouvard et Pécuchet\" appears to achieve an opposite goal: in his relentless encyclopedic presentation of \"facts and theories\", the two main characters, Bouvard and Pécuchet, appear to be so absorbed in a world of knowledge, of having to gain knowledge, of needing to put knowledge to practical purpose, that Flaubert appears to suggest the civilization they inhabit lacks creativity and art.\n\nWhile an encyclopedia is a factual reference work, a novel stands in opposition to it as a \"literary \"nonreferential\" narrative\". One critical review questions why a novelist would paradoxically reference a fictional universe, and what literary purpose is served by the proliferation of the \"junk text\" that is often a carrier of the encyclopedic conceit. When excessive real-world data is presented to the reader, the author's purpose is unclear: those readers who already know the material will find it superfluous, and those who do not know it may find that it adds nothing of interest to the text. Giving examples of \"junk text\" in encyclopedic fiction, the review cites \"the pseudo-scientific cetology chapter\" in \"Moby-Dick\" and \"minor-character chatter about art and economics\" in William Gaddis's \"The Recognitions\" (1955) and \"J R\" (1975). Yet, a defining characteristic of the encyclopedic novel is the presentation of unwanted or unnecessary information. Such writing \"terminate[s] focused attention\", and is in danger of boring the reader. One view of the encyclopedic novel's method, therefore, is that it requires the reader to practice modulating his attention to the text, bringing more consciousness to the act of filtering the important from the tangential.\n\nMendelson's 1976 essays examine the encyclopedic tendency through the history of literature, considering the \"Divine Comedy\", \"Don Quixote\", \"Faust\", \"Moby-Dick\", and \"War and Peace\", with an emphasis on the modern \"Ulysses\" and \"Gravity's Rainbow\". Commonly cited examples of encyclopedic novels in the postmodern period include, in addition to Pynchon, Richard Powers' \"The Gold Bug Variations\" (1991), David Foster Wallace's \"Infinite Jest\" (1996), and Don Delillo's \"Underworld\" (1997).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216965", "title": "Flinders Petrie", "text": "Flinders Petrie\n\nSir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, FRS, FBA (3 June 1853 – 28 July 1942), commonly known as Flinders Petrie, was an English Egyptologist and a pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology and preservation of artifacts. He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his wife, Hilda Petrie. Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the Merneptah Stele, an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred.\n\nPetrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings.\n\nPetrie was born on 3 June 1853 in Maryon Road, Charlton, Kent, England, the son of William Petrie (1821–1908) and Anne (née Flinders) (1812–1892). Anne was the daughter of Captain Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia. William Petrie was an electrical engineer who developed carbon arc lighting and later developed chemical processes for Johnson, Matthey & Co.\n\nPetrie was raised in a Christian household (his father being a member of the Plymouth Brethren), and was educated at home. He had no formal education. His father taught his son how to survey accurately, laying the foundation for his archaeological career. At the age of eight, he was tutored in French, Latin, and Greek, until he had a collapse and was taught at home. He also ventured his first archaeological opinion aged eight, when friends visiting the Petrie family were describing the unearthing of the Brading Roman Villa in the Isle of Wight. The boy was horrified to hear the rough shovelling out of the contents, and protested that the earth should be pared away, inch by inch, to see all that was in it and how it lay. \"All that I have done since,\" he wrote when he was in his late seventies, \"was there to begin with, so true it is that we can only develop what is born in the mind. I was already in archaeology by nature.\"\n\nThe chair of Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology at University College London was set up and funded in 1892 following a bequest from Amelia Edwards, who died suddenly in that year. Petrie's supporter since 1880, Edwards had instructed that he should be its first incumbent. He continued to excavate in Egypt after taking up the professorship, training many of the best archaeologists of the day.\n\nIn 1913 Petrie sold his large collection of Egyptian antiquities to University College, London, where it is now housed in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology. One of his trainees, Howard Carter, went on to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.\n\nIn his teenage years, Petrie surveyed British prehistoric monuments (commencing with the late Romano-British 'British Camp' that lay within yards of his family home in Charlton) in attempts to understand their geometry (at 19 producing the most accurate survey of Stonehenge). His father had corresponded with Piazzi Smyth about his theories of the Great Pyramid and Petrie travelled to Egypt in early 1880 to make an accurate survey of Giza, making him the first to properly investigate how they were constructed (many theories had been advanced on this, and Petrie read them all, but none were based on first hand observation or logic).\n\nPetrie's published reports of this triangulation survey, and his analysis of the architecture of Giza therein, was exemplary in its methodology and accuracy, disproved Smyth's theories and still provides much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day. On that visit, he was appalled by the rate of destruction of monuments (some listed in guidebooks had been worn away completely since then) and mummies. He described Egypt as \"a house on fire, so rapid was the destruction\" and felt his duty to be that of a \"salvage man, to get all I could, as quickly as possible and then, when I was 60, I would sit and write it all.\"\n\nReturning to England at the end of 1880, Petrie wrote a number of articles and then met Amelia Edwards, journalist and patron of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now the Egypt Exploration Society), who became his strong supporter and later appointed him as Professor at her Egyptology chair at University College London. Impressed by his scientific approach, they offered him work as the successor to Édouard Naville. Petrie accepted the position and was given the sum of £250 per month to cover the excavation's expenses. In November 1884, Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations.\n\nHe first went to a New Kingdom site at Tanis, with 170 workmen. He cut out the middle man role of foreman on this and all subsequent excavations, taking complete overall control himself and removing pressure on the workmen from the foreman to discover finds quickly but sloppily. Though he was regarded as an amateur and dilettante by more established Egyptologists, this made him popular with his workers, who found several small but significant finds that would have been lost under the old system.\nIn 1886, while working for the Egypt Exploration Fund, Petrie excavated at Tell Nebesheh in the Eastern Nile Delta. This site is located 8 miles southeast of Tanis and, among the remains of an ancient temple there, Petrie found a royal sphinx, now located at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nBy the end of the Tanis dig, he ran out of funding but, reluctant to leave the country in case it was renewed, he spent 1887 cruising the Nile taking photographs as a less subjective record than sketches. During this time, he also climbed rope ladders at Sehel Island near Aswan to draw and photograph thousands of early Egyptian inscriptions on a cliff face, recording embassies to Nubia, famines and wars. By the time he reached Aswan, a telegram had reached there to confirm the renewal of his funding. He then went straight to the burial site at Fayum, particularly interested in post-30 BC burials, which had not previously been fully studied. He found intact tombs and 60 of the famous portraits, and discovered from inscriptions on the mummies that they were kept with their living families for generations before burial. Under Auguste Mariette's arrangements, he sent 50% of these portraits to the Egyptian department of antiquities.\n\nHowever, when he later found that Gaston Maspero placed little value on them and left them open to the elements in a yard behind the museum to deteriorate, he angrily demanded that they all be returned, forcing Maspero to pick the 12 best examples for the museum to keep and return 48 to Petrie, who sent them to London for a special showing at the British Museum. Resuming work, he discovered the village of the Pharaonic tomb-workers.\n\nIn 1890, Petrie made the first of his many forays into Palestine, leading to much important archaeological work. His six-week excavation of Tell el-Hesi (which was mistakenly identified as Lachish) that year represents the first scientific excavation of an archaeological site in the Holy Land. Petrie surveyed a group of tombs in the Wadi al-Rababah (the biblical Hinnom) of Jerusalem, largely dating to the Iron Age and early Roman periods. Here, in these ancient monuments, Petrie discovered two different metrical systems.\n\nFrom 1891, he worked on the temple of Aten at Tell-el-Amarna, discovering a New Kingdom painted pavement of garden and animals and hunting scenes. This became a tourist attraction but, as there was no direct access to the site, tourists wrecked neighbouring fields on their way to it. This made local farmers deface the paintings, and it is only thanks to Petrie's copies that their original appearance is known.\n\nIn early 1896, Petrie and his archaeological team were conducting excavations on a temple in Petrie's area of concession at Luxor. This temple complex was located just north of the original funerary temple of Amenhotep III which had been built on a flood plain. They were initially surprised that this building which they were excavating:\n\nDuring the field season of 1895/6, at the Ramesseum, Petrie and the young German Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg became friends. Spiegelberg was in charge of the edition of many texts discovered by his British colleague, and Petrie offered important collections of artefacts to the University of Strasbourg. In 1897, the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität Straßburg gratefully conferred to Petrie the title of doctor honoris causa, and in June 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\n\nIn 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British archaeology and Egyptology. The focus of his work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926 (although he did become interested in early Egypt, in 1928 digging a cemetery at Luxor that proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today). He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including Tell el-Jemmeh and Tell el-Ajjul.\n\nIn 1933, on retiring from his professorship, he moved permanently to Jerusalem, where he lived with Lady Petrie at the British School of Archaeology, then temporarily headquartered at the American School of Oriental Research (today the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research).\n\nPetrie died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His body was interred in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion, but he donated his head (and thus his brain) to the Royal College of Surgeons of London. World War II was then at its height, and the head was delayed in transit. After being stored in a jar in the college basement, its label fell off and no one knew who the head belonged to. However, it was eventually identified, and is now stored, but not displayed, at the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nPetrie married Hilda Urlin (1871–1957) in London on 26 November 1896. The couple had two children, John (1907–1972) and Ann (1909–1989). The family originally lived in Hampstead, where an English Heritage blue plaque has been placed on the building they lived in, 5 Cannon Place. John Flinders Petrie became a noted mathematician, who gave his name to the Petrie polygon.\n\nPetrie's painstaking recording and study of artifacts set new standards in archaeology. He wrote: \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" By linking styles of pottery with periods, he was the first to use seriation in Egyptology, a new method for establishing the chronology of a site. Flinders Petrie was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter. After his death, his wife, Hilda Petrie created a student travel scholarship to Egypt on the Centennial of Petrie's birth in 1953.\n\nMany thousands of artefacts recovered during excavations led by Petrie can be found in museums worldwide.\n\nPetrie remains a controversial figure for his pro-eugenics views and opinions on other social topics, which spilled over into his disputes with the British Museum's Egyptology expert, E. A. Wallis Budge. Budge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was essentially identical to the religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded by his colleagues as impossible, since all but a few followed Petrie in his contention that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading Caucasoid \"Dynastic Race\" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory and introduced the Pharaonic culture. Petrie was a dedicated follower of eugenics, believing that there was no such thing as cultural or social innovation in human society, but rather that all social change is the result of biological change, such as migration and foreign conquest resulting in interbreeding. Petrie claimed that his \"Dynastic Race\", in which he never ceased to believe, was a \"fine\" Caucasoid race that entered Egypt from the south in late predynastic times, conquered the \"inferior\" and \"exhausted\" \"mulatto\" race then inhabiting Egypt, and slowly introduced the finer Dynastic civilisation as they interbred with the inferior indigenous people. Petrie, who was also affiliated with a variety of far right-wing groups and anti-democratic thought in England and was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples, derided Budge's belief that the ancient Egyptians were an African people with roots in eastern Africa as impossible and \"unscientific\", as did his followers.\n\nHis involvement in Palestinian archaeology was examined in the exhibition \"A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection\".\n\nThe Petrie Medal was created in celebration of Petrie's seventieth birthday, when funds were raised to commission and produce 20 medals to be awarded \"once in every three years for distinguished work in Archaeology, preferably to a British subject\". The first medal was awarded to Petrie himself (1925), and the first few recipients included Sir Aurel Stein (1928), Sir Arthur Evans (1931), Abbé Henri Breuil (1934), Prof J.D. Beazley (1937), Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1950), Prof J.B. Wace (1953), Sir Leonard Woolley (1957).\n\nA number of Petrie's discoveries were presented to the Royal Archaeological Society and described in the society's \"Archaeological Journal\" by his good friend and fellow archaeologist Flaxman Charles John Spurrell. Petrie published a total of 97 books.\n\n\n\n"}

It describes itself as \"an unconventional guide to life, the universe, and everything\", in the spirit of the fictional publication \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" from the science fiction comedy series of the same name by Douglas Adams. It was founded by Adams in 1999 and was run by the BBC between 2001 and 2011.\n\nThe intent is to create an Earth-focused guide that allows members to share information about their geographic area and the local sites, activities and businesses, to help people decide where they want to go and what they may find when they get there. It has grown to contain subjects from restaurants and recipes, to quantum theory and history. Explicit advertising of businesses was forbidden when the site was run by the BBC, but customer reviews were permitted.\n\nThe content of the project is written by registered \"Researchers\" on its website. Articles written by Researchers form the \"Guide\" as a whole, with an \"Edited Guide\" being steadily created out of factual articles that have been peer reviewed via the \"Peer Review\" system. The Edited Guide includes both traditional encyclopaedic subjects and more idiosyncratic offerings, and articles in the Edited Guide sometimes aim for a slightly humorous style.\n\nThe h2g2 site was founded on 28 April 1999 as the Earth edition of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by the author of the series, Douglas Adams, and his friends and colleagues at The Digital Village. \"h2g2\" is an abbreviation for the title as well as part of the url. The site was a runner-up for Best Community Site in the Yell.com awards in 2000.\nLike other dot-com companies, Adams' company TDV ran into financial difficulties towards the end of 2000 and eventually ceased operations. In January 2001, the management of the site was taken over by the BBC, and moved to bbc.co.uk (then known as BBCi).\n\n21 April 2005 marked the launch of h2g2 Mobile, an edition of the guide produced for PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) and mobile phones that could access the internet, so that people could read h2g2 entries while on the move. This was done because people wanted h2g2 to be much like the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" described in the books — a mobile, electronic device that anyone could read from anywhere. An earlier attempt at a WAP phone based version of h2g2 started in December 2000 only to end when the BBC took over the site in January 2001.\n\nThe site was redesigned for the BBC by Aerian Studios in 2011, bringing it in line with the general appearance of other BBC websites, while maintaining a degree of the site's old character.\n\nOn 24 January 2011, the BBC announced cuts of 25% to its online budget, resulting in a £34 million less investment into the site. A number of sites were to be closed, including BBC Switch, BBC Blast and 6-0-6. As part of this exercise, the BBC chose to sell h2g2. On 21 June 2011, it was announced the winning bid was a joint bid put together by three parties: Robbie Stamp, h2g2c2 ('The h2g2 Community Consortium') and the owners of Lycos Chat (Brian Larholm and Alyson Larholm) On 31 August 2011, it was announced h2g2 was sold to Not Panicking Ltd, a company founded by Robbie Stamp, Brian Larholm and Alyson Larholm, as well as The h2g2 Community Consortium.\n\nOn 3 October 2011, the BBC incarnation of h2g2 closed, leaving only an announcement reading \"H2G2 has now left the BBC. The new owners of H2G2 are currently preparing the site for relaunch.

Researchers retain the copyright to their articles, but grant Not Panicking Ltd a non-exclusive license to reproduce their work in all formats.\n\nPart of the software for h2g2 is known as DNA, after the initials of author and site founder Douglas Adams. The DNA technology was introduced a few months after the BBC takeover and is still used for BBC blogs, messageboards and commenting systems. Before that there was a technology which was written mostly in Perl.\n\nAdams was involved in the website in its early days. His account name was DNA, and his user number was 42, a reference to the joke in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" that the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything is 42.

Twenty-five years later, the book had grown to 656 pages and included a mug-shot photo of every active NHL player.\n\nTraditionally, the Guide's cover is printed every year in the colors of the reigning Stanley Cup champions.\n\n\nSource: Triumph Books representative in phone conversation conducted on October 11, 2018.\n"}

The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for businessmen. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.\n\nNewspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing editorials written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"op-eds\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and columns that express the personal opinions of columnists, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw data of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no byline; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including literature, film, television, theater, fine arts, and architecture) and of local services such as restaurants; obituaries, birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, editorial cartoons, gag cartoons, and comic strips; advice columns, food, and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on streaming video services like Netflix. Newspapers have classified ad sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in Internet websites for selling goods, such as Craigslist and eBay has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including display ads, classified ads, and their online equivalents). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The editorial independence of a newspaper is thus always subject to the interests of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to news agencies (wire services) (such as the Associated Press, Reuters, or Agence France-Presse), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the content to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55 million copies). The late 2000s–early 2010s global recession, combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses. Worldwide annual revenue approached $100 billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53 billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.\n\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:\n\nIn Ancient Rome, \"Acta Diurna\", or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called Dibao, circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the \"Kaiyuan Za Bao\" (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late Ming Dynasty.\n\nIn early modern Europe, the increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten news-sheets. In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly \"notizie scritte\", which cost one \"gazette\", a small coin. These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers. However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics.\n\nThe emergence of the new media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press from which the publishing press derives its name. The German-language \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", printed from 1605 onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg, is often recognized as the first newspaper. At the time, Strasbourg was a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the first newspaper of modern Germany was the \"Avisa\", published in 1609 in Wolfenbüttel.\n\nThe Dutch \"Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c.\" ('Courant from Italy, Germany, etc.') of 1618 was the first to appear in folio- rather than quarto-size. Amsterdam, a center of world trade, quickly became home to newspapers in many languages, often before they were published in their own country. The first English-language newspaper, \"Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc.\", was published in Amsterdam in 1620. A year and a half later, \"Corante, or weekely newes from Italy, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, France and the Low Countreys.\" was published in England by an \"N.B.\" (generally thought to be either Nathaniel Butter or Nicholas Bourne) and Thomas Archer. The first newspaper in France was published in 1631, \"La Gazette\" (originally published as \"Gazette de France\").\nThe first newspaper in Portugal, \"A Gazeta da Restauração\", was published in 1641 in Lisbon. The first Spanish newspaper, Gaceta de Madrid, was published in 1661.\n\n\"Post- och Inrikes Tidningar\" (founded as \"Ordinari Post Tijdender\") was first published in Sweden in 1645, and is the oldest newspaper still in existence, though it now publishes solely online. \"Opregte Haarlemsche Courant\" from Haarlem, first published in 1656, is the oldest paper still printed. It was forced to merge with the newspaper \"Haarlems Dagblad\" in 1942 when Germany occupied the Netherlands. Since then the \"Haarlems Dagblad\" has appeared with the subtitle \"Oprechte Haerlemse Courant 1656\". \"Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny\" was published in Kraków, Poland in 1661. The first successful English daily, \"The Daily Courant\", was published from 1702 to 1735.\n\nIn Boston in 1690, Benjamin Harris published \"Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick\". This is considered the first newspaper in the American colonies even though only one edition was published before the paper was suppressed by the government. In 1704, the governor allowed \"The Boston News-Letter\" to be published and it became the first continuously published newspaper in the colonies. Soon after, weekly papers began publishing in New York and Philadelphia. These early newspapers followed the British format and were usually four pages long. They mostly carried news from Britain and content depended on the editor's interests. In 1783, the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" became the first American daily.\n\nIn 1752, John Bushell published the \"Halifax Gazette\", which claims to be \"Canada's first newspaper.\" However, its official descendant, the \"Royal Gazette\", is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the \"Quebec Gazette\" was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the \"Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph\". It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belvédère, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. In 1808, the \"Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro\" had its first edition, printed in devices brought from England, publishing news favourable for the government of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves since it was produced by the official press service of the Portuguese crown.\n\nIn 1821, after the ending of the ban of private newspaper circulation, appears the first non-imperial printed publication, \"Diário do Rio de Janeiro\", though there existed already the \"Correio Braziliense\", published by Hipólito José da Costa at the same time as the \"Gazeta\", but from London and with forcefully advocated political and critical ideas, aiming to expose the administration's flaws. The first newspaper in Peru was \"El Peruano\", established in October 1825 and still published today, but with several name changes.\n\n During the Tang Dynasty in China (618–906), the \"Kaiyuan Za Bao\" published the government news; it was block-printed onto paper. It is sometimes considered one of the earliest newspapers to be published. The first recorded attempt to found a newspaper of the modern type in South Asia was by William Bolts, a Dutchman in the employ of the British East India Company in September 1768 in Calcutta. However, before he could begin his newspaper, he was deported back to Europe. In 1780 the first newsprint from this region, \"Hicky's Bengal Gazette\", was published by an Irishman, James Augustus Hicky. He used it as a means to criticize the British rule through journalism.\n\nThe history of Middle Eastern newspapers goes back to the 19th century. Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the Ottoman and Persian Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world. The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in Pera. Indigenous Middle Eastern journalism started in 1828, when Muhammad Ali, Khedive of Egypt, ordered the local establishment of the gazette \"Vekayi-i Misriye\" (\"Egyptian Affairs\"). It was first paper written in Ottoman Turkish and Arabic on opposite pages, and later in Arabic only, under the title \"al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya\".\n\nThe first non-official Turkish newspaper, \"Ceride-i Havadis\" (Register of Events), was published by an Englishman, William Churchill, in 1840. The first private newspaper to be published by Turkish journalists, \"Tercüman-ı Ahvâl\" (Interpreter of Events), was founded by İbrahim Şinasi and Agah Efendi and issued in 1860. The first newspaper in Iran, \"Kaghaz-e Akhbar\" (The Newspaper), was created for the government by Mirza Saleh Shirazi in 1837. The first journals in the Arabian Peninsula appeared in Hijaz, once it had become independent of Ottoman rule, towards the end of World War I.One of the earliest women to sign her articles in the Arab press was the female medical practitioner Galila Tamarhan, who contributed articles to a medical magazine called \"Ya'asub al-Tib\" (Leader in Medicine) in the 1860s.\n\nBy the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspaper-type publications though not all of them developed in the same way; content was vastly shaped by regional and cultural preferences. Advances in printing technology related to the Industrial Revolution enabled newspapers to become an even more widely circulated means of communication, as new printing technologies made printing less expensive and more efficient. In 1814, \"The Times\" (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour. Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.\n\nIn 1830, the first inexpensive \"penny press\" newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston \"Transcript\". Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of other newspapers and appealed to a wider audience, including less educated and lower-income people. In France, Émile de Girardin started \"La Presse\" in 1836, introducing cheap, advertising-supported dailies to France. In 1848, August Zang, an Austrian who knew Girardin in Paris, returned to Vienna to introduce the same methods with \"Die Presse\" (which was named for and frankly copied Girardin's publication).\n\nWhile most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers, usually geographically defined, some focus on groups of readers defined more by their interests than their location: for example, there are daily and weekly business newspapers (e.g., \"The Wall Street Journal and India Today\") and sports newspapers. More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local gay community or indie rock enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\nA daily newspaper is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays) and often of some national holidays. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its cover date, further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include breaking news which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as Newsnight in the United Kingdom. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared, \"Einkommende Zeitung\", published by Timotheus Ritzsch in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a Sunday newspaper, distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to \"The Times\".\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., \"The Observer\", not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by \"The Guardian\" in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as Sunday comics, Sunday magazines (such as \"The New York Times Magazine\" and \"The Sunday Times Magazine\").\n\nDaily newspapers are not published on Christmas Day, but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, Christmas Eve when Christmas Day is falling on Sunday.\n\nWeekly newspapers are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as biweekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or bimonthly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week Christmas Day is falling on.\n\nA local newspaper serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a national newspaper. Some national newspapers, such as the \"Financial Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many national newspapers in the United Kingdom, but only a few in the United States and Canada. In Canada, \"The Globe and Mail\" is sold throughout the country. In the United States, in addition to national newspapers as such, \"The New York Times\" is available throughout the country.\nThere is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as international newspapers. Some, such as \"The New York Times International Edition\", (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to expatriates, significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as Jerusalem and Mumbai, newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and locally published newspapers in many languages, are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of Florida, so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec visit for long stays during the winter (\"snowbirds\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as \"Le Droit\".\n\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.\n\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the mail, sold at newsstands, grocery stores and convenience stores, and delivered to libraries and bookstores. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the Press Complaints Commission in the UK. But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable, Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the \"Southport Reporter\" in the UK and the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50 % decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of personalization through on-demand printing technologies or with online news aggregator websites like Google news. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher. In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer. Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called news bureaus or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors copy edit the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with proofreaders and fact checkers.\nReporters are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and graphic artists provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a beat, such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. Printers and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an offset web press (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's print run might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, webmasters and web designers may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the circulation department liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by newspaper carriers, at retailers, and through vending machines. Free newspapers do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include graphic designers, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an advertising-free newspaper, there is no advertising department.\n\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning.\n\n\"See also Los Angeles Times suburban sections.\"\n\nMost modern newspapers are in one of three sizes:\n\nNewspapers are usually printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, four-color process, offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, word processing software, graphics software, digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the \"Financial Times\" is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the \"Green 'Un\", from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" is also printed on pink paper while \"L'Équipe\" (formerly \"L'Auto\") is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.\n\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the Alliance for Audited Media maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the \"Guinness Book of Records\", the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper \"Trud\" exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly \"Argumenty i Fakty\" boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers—the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", \"Asahi Shimbun\", and \"Mainichi Shimbun\"—with circulations well above 5.5 million. Germany's \"Bild\", with a circulation of 3.8 million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, \"The Sun\" is the top seller, with around 3.24 million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., \"The Wall Street Journal\" has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02 million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed OECD nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008. In India, \"The Times of India\" is the largest-circulation English newspaper, with 3.14 million copies daily. According to the 2009 Indian Readership Survey, the \"Dainik Jagran\" is the most-read, local-language (Hindi) newspaper, with 55.7 million readers. According to Tom Standage of \"The Economist\", India currently has daily newspaper circulation of 110 million copies.\nA common measure of a newspaper's health is market penetration, expressed as a percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total number of households in the paper's market area. In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling. Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a workweek subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\nA newspaper typically generates 70–80% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions. The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called \"editorial content\", \"editorial matter\", or simply \"editorial\", although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time – early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by \"The Sun\", a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the web have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now. Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including Craigslist, employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the advertorial emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.\n\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called \"journalism\". In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived bias; and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called press barons, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as Gannett, The McClatchy Company, Hearst Corporation, Cox Enterprises, Landmark Media Enterprises LLC, Morris Communications, The Tribune Company, Hollinger International, News Corporation, Swift Communications, etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the \"op-ed\" (\"opposite the editorial page\") and \"letters to the editors\" sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing ombudsmen, developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via and then the availability of online journalism posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid circulation has declined, while advertising revenue—which makes up the bulk of most newspapers' income—has been shifting from print to the new media (social media websites and news websites), resulting in a general decline in print newspapers' revenues and profits. Many newspapers around the world launched online editions in the 2000s, in an attempt to follow or stay ahead of their audience. One of the big challenges is that a number of online news websites, such as Google news, are free to access. Some online news sites are free, and rely on online advertising; other online news sites have a paywall and require paid subscription for access. However, in the non-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, the growing middle class and other factors have more than compensated for the emergence of electronic media and newspapers continue to grow.\n\nOn 10 April 1995, \"The American Reporter\" became the first daily Internet-based newspaper, with its own paid reporters around the world and all-original content. The editor-in-chief and founder is Joe Shea. The site is owned by 400 journalists. The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising to Craigslist, eBay and other websites, and precipitous drops in circulation. In the late 1990s the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001. Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.\n\nThe debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008-2009 recession shaved newspapers' profits, and as once-explosive growth in newspaper web revenues has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue. At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete, at least in their traditional paper format. As of 2017, an increasing percentage of Millennials (young adults) get their news from social media websites such as Facebook. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering \"digital editions\", which can be accessed via desktop computer, laptops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers and smartphones. Online newspapers may offer new advertising opportunities to newspaper companies, as online advertising enables much more precise targeting of ads; with an online newspaper, for example, different readers, such as Baby boomers and Millennials can be sent different advertisements.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "83781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83781", "title": "Noah's Ark", "text": "Noah's Ark\n\nNoah's Ark (; Biblical Hebrew: \"Tevat Noaḥ\") appears in the Genesis flood narrative (Genesis chapters 6–9) as the vessel in which God spares Noah, his family, and a remnant of all the world's animals from a world-engulfing flood. The flood myth is common to many cultures around the world, and the biblical version appears to have its primary source in the Mesopotamian myth of Utnapishtim in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". The earliest known written flood myth is a Sumerian flood myth found in the \"Deluge Tablet\" in which the hero is named Ziusudra. The story in Genesis is repeated, with variations, in the Quran, where the ark appears as \"Safina Nūḥ\" ( \"Noah's boat\").\n\nSearches for Noah's Ark have been made from at least the time of Eusebius (c. 275–339 CE), and believers in the myth continue to search for it in modern times. Many searches have been mounted for the ark, but no confirmable physical proof of the ark has ever been found. There is no scientific evidence that Noah's Ark existed as it is described in the bible, nor is there evidence in the geologic record for the biblical global flood. \n\nNoah's instructions for the ark are described in Genesis 6:14–16. It is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, with three internal divisions (which are not actually called \"decks\", although presumably this is what is intended), a door in the side, and a \"tsohar\", which may be either a roof or a skylight. It is to be made of \"gofer\" wood, a word which appears nowhere else in the Bible, and divided into \"qinnim\", a word which always refers to birds' nests elsewhere in the Bible, leading some scholars to emend this to \"qanim\", reeds. The finished vessel is to be smeared with \"koper\": in Hebrew the two words are closely related, \"kaparta\" (\"smeared\") ... bakopper\".\n\nThe dimensions of the ark are based on numerology: the length, 300 cubits, is 60x5, and the height, 30 cubits, is 60/2. The same preoccupation with the number sixty characterises the vessel of the Babylonian flood-hero.\n\nFor well over a century scholars have recognised that the Bible's story of Noah's ark is based on older Mesopotamian models. Because all these flood stories deal with events that allegedly happened at the dawn of history, they give the impression that the myths themselves must come from very primitive origins, but the myth of the global flood that destroys all life only begins to appear in the Old Babylonian period (20th–16th centuries BCE). The reasons for this emergence of the typical Mesopotamian flood myth may have been bound up with the specific circumstances of the end of the Third Dynasty of Ur around 2004 BCE and the restoration of order by the First Dynasty of Isin.\n\nThere are nine known versions of the Mesopotamian flood story, each more or less adapted from an earlier version. In the oldest version, inscribed in the Sumerian city of Nippur c.1600 BCE, the hero is King Ziusudra. This is known as the Sumerian Flood Story and probably derives from an earlier version. The Ziusudra version tells how he builds a boat and rescues life when the gods decide to destroy it. This remains the basic plot for several subsequent flood-stories and heroes, including Noah. Ziusudra's Sumerian name means \"He of long life\". In Babylonian versions his name is Atrahasis, but the meaning is the same. In the Atrahasis version, the flood is a river flood.\n\nThe version closest to the biblical story of Noah, as well as its most likely source, is that of Utnapishtim in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". The most complete text of Utnapishtim's story is a clay tablet dating from the 7th century BCE, but fragments of the story have been found from as far back as the 19th century BCE. The last known version of the Mesopotamian flood story was written in Greek in the 3rd century BCE by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. From the fragments that survive, it seems little changed from the versions of two thousand years before.\n\nThe parallels between Noah's Ark and the arks of Babylonian flood-heroes Atrahasis and Utnapishtim have often been noted. Atrahasis' ark was circular, resembling an enormous quffa, and had one or two decks. Utnapishtim's ark was a cube and had six decks with seven compartments on each, each divided into nine subcompartments (for 63 subcompartments per deck and 378 total). Noah's Ark was rectangular and had three decks. There is believed to be a linear progression from circular to cubic or square to rectangular. The most striking similarity is the near-identical deck areas of the three arks: 14,400 cubits, 14,400 cubits, and 15,000 cubits for Atrahasis', Utnapishtim's, and Noah's ark, respectively (a difference of 4%). This has led professor Finkel to conclude that \"the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.\"\n\nLinguistic parallels between Noah's ark and the ark of the Babylonian flood-hero Atrahasis have also been noted. The word used for \"pitch\" (sealing tar or resin) in Genesis is not the normal Hebrew word, but is closely related to the word used in the Babylonian story. Likewise, the Hebrew word for \"ark\" (\"tevah\") is nearly identical to the Babylonian word for an oblong boat (\"ṭubbû\"), especially given that \"v\" and \"b\" are the same letter in Hebrew: bet (ב).\n\nHowever, the causes for God/gods having sent the flood differ. In the Hebrew myth the flood comes as God's judgment on a wicked humanity. In the Babylonian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the reasons are not given and the flood appears to be the result of the caprice of the gods. In the Atrahasis version of the Babylonian flood story, the flood was sent by the gods to reduce human over-population, and after the flood, other measures were introduced to prevent the problem recurring.\n\nThere is consensus among scholars that the Torah (the first five books of the Bible, beginning with Genesis) was the product of a long and complex process that was not completed until after the Babylonian exile. The Flood narrative in particular shows signs of being composed by the combination of two versions of the story, characterized by different names for God (one story uses \"God\", one \"Yahweh\").\n\nThe story of the flood closely parallels the story of the creation: a cycle of creation, un-creation, and re-creation, in which the ark plays a pivotal role. The universe as conceived by the ancient Hebrews comprised a flat disk-shaped habitable earth with the heavens above and Sheol, the underworld of the dead, below. These three were surrounded by a watery \"ocean\" of chaos, protected by the firmament, a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains which ringed the earth. Noah's three-deck ark represents this three-level Hebrew cosmos in miniature: the heavens, the earth, and the waters beneath. In Genesis 1, God created the three-level world as a space in the midst of the waters for humanity; in Genesis 6–8 (the flood narrative) he fills that space with waters again, saving only Noah, his family and the animals with him in the ark.\n\nTalmudic tractates Sanhedrin, Avodah Zarah, and Zevahim relate that, while Noah was building the ark, he attempted to warn his neighbors of the coming deluge, but was ignored or mocked. In order to protect Noah and his family, God placed lions and other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who tried to stop them from entering the ark. According to one Midrash, it was God, or the angels, who gathered the animals to the ark, together with their food. As there had been no need to distinguish between clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the ark. A differing opinion said that the ark itself distinguished clean animals from unclean, admitting seven pairs each of the former and one pair each of the latter.\n\nAccording to Sanhedrin 108b, Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the ark. The animals were the best of their species, and so behaved with utmost goodness. They abstained from procreation, so that the number of creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that embarked. The raven created problems, refusing to leave the ark when Noah sent it forth and accusing the patriarch of wishing to destroy its race, but as the commentators pointed out, God wished to save the raven, for its descendants were destined to feed the prophet Elijah.\n\nAccording to one tradition, refuse was stored on the lowest of the ark's three decks, humans and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds on the top; a differing interpretation described the refuse as being stored on the utmost deck, from where it was shoveled into the sea through a trapdoor. Precious stones, said to be as bright as the noon sun, provided light, and God ensured that food remained fresh. Some more unorthodox interpretations of the ark narrative also surfaced: the 12th-century Jewish commentator Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the ark as being a vessel that remained underwater for 40 days, after which it floated to the surface.\n\nInterpretations of the ark narrative played an important role in early Christian doctrine. The First Epistle of Peter (composed around the end of the first century AD) compared Noah's salvation through water to salvation through water in baptism.\n\nSt. Hippolytus of Rome (died 235) sought to demonstrate that \"the Ark was a symbol of the Christ who was expected\", stating that the vessel had its door on the east side—the direction from which Christ would appear at the Second Coming—and that the bones of Adam were brought aboard, together with gold, frankincense, and myrrh (the symbols of the Nativity of Christ). Hippolytus furthermore stated that the ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters, making the sign of the cross, before eventually landing on Mount Kardu \"in the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals call it Mount Godash; the Armenians call it Ararat\". On a more practical plane, Hippolytus explained that the lowest of the three decks was for wild beasts, the middle for birds and domestic animals, and the top level for humans. He says that male animals were separated from the females by sharp stakes so that there would be no breeding on board.\n\nThe early Church Father and theologian Origen (c. 182–251), in response to a critic who doubted that the ark could contain all the animals in the world, argued that Moses, the traditional author of the book of Genesis, had been brought up in Egypt and would therefore have used the larger Egyptian cubit. He also fixed the shape of the ark as a truncated pyramid, square at its base, and tapering to a square peak one cubit on a side; it was not until the 12th century that it came to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping roof.\n\nEarly Christian artists depicted Noah standing in a small box on the waves, symbolizing God saving the Christian Church in its turbulent early years. St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), in his work \"City of God\", demonstrated that the dimensions of the ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which according to Christian doctrine is the body of Christ and in turn the body of the Church. St. Jerome (c. 347–420) identified the raven, which was sent forth and did not return, as the \"foul bird of wickedness\" expelled by baptism; more enduringly, the dove and olive branch came to symbolize the Holy Spirit and the hope of salvation and eventually, peace. The olive branch remains a secular and religious symbol of peace today.\n\nIn contrast to the Jewish tradition, which uses a term that can be translated as a \"box\" or \"chest\" to describe the Ark, surah 29:15 of the Quran refers to it as a \"safina\", an ordinary ship, and surah 54:13 describes the ark as \"a thing of boards and nails\". Abd Allah ibn Abbas, a contemporary of Muhammad, wrote that Noah was in doubt as to what shape to make the ark, and that Allah revealed to him that it was to be shaped like a bird's belly and fashioned of teak wood.\n\nAbdallah ibn 'Umar al-Baidawi, writing in the 13th century, explains that in the first of its three levels wild and domesticated animals were lodged, in the second the human beings, and in the third the birds. On every plank was the name of a prophet. Three missing planks, symbolizing three prophets, were brought from Egypt by Og, son of Anak, the only one of the giants permitted to survive the Flood. The body of Adam was carried in the middle to divide the men from the women. Surah 11:41 says: \"And he said, 'Ride ye in it; in the Name of Allah it moves and stays!'\"; this was taken to mean that Noah said, \"In the Name of Allah!\" when he wished the ark to move, and the same when he wished it to stand still.\n\nThe medieval scholar Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Masudi (died 956) wrote that Allah commanded the Earth to absorb the water, and certain portions which were slow in obeying received salt water in punishment and so became dry and arid. The water which was not absorbed formed the seas, so that the waters of the flood still exist. Masudi says that the ark began its voyage at Kufa in central Iraq and sailed to Mecca, circling the Kaaba before finally traveling to Mount Judi, which surah 11:44 states was its final resting place. This mountain is identified by tradition with a hill near the town of Jazirat ibn Umar on the east bank of the Tigris in the province of Mosul in northern Iraq, and Masudi says that the spot could be seen in his time.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Bahá'í belief, only Noah's followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the \"ark\" of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Bahá'í scripture \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had numerous companions on the ark, either 40 or 72, as well as his family, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood. The Bahá'í Faith was founded in 19th century Persia, and it recognizes divine messengers from both the Abrahamic and the Indian traditions.\n\nWhile a literal Noah's Ark did not exist, nor is there geologic evidence of a biblical global flood, believers throughout history have tried to rationalize the Ark's existence. \n\nThe first edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" from 1771 describes the Ark's existence as fact. It also attempts to explain how the ark could house all living animal types: \"... Buteo and Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit as a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged in it ... the number of species of animals will be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to a hundred species of quadrupeds\". It also endorses a supernatural explanation for the flood, stating that \"many attempts have been made to account for the deluge by means of natural causes: but these attempts have only tended to discredit philosophy, and to render their authors ridiculous\".\n\nThe 1860 edition attempts to solve the problem of the ark being unable to house all animal types by suggesting a local flood, which is described in the 1910 edition as part of a \"gradual surrender of attempts to square scientific facts with a literal interpretation of the Bible\" that resulted in \"the 'higher criticism' and the rise of the modern scientific views as to the origin of species\" leading to \"scientific comparative mythology\" being the frame in which Noah's Ark was interpreted by 1875.\n\nIn Europe, the Renaissance saw much speculation on the nature of the ark that might have seemed familiar to early theologians such as Origen and Augustine. At the same time, however, a new class of scholarship arose, one which, while never questioning the literal truth of the ark story, began to speculate on the practical workings of Noah's vessel from within a purely naturalistic framework. In the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada gave a detailed account of the logistics of the ark, down to arrangements for the disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air. The 16th-century geometer Johannes Buteo calculated the ship's internal dimensions, allowing room for Noah's grinding mills and smokeless ovens, a model widely adopted by other commentators.\n\nSearches for Noah's Ark have been made from at least the time of Eusebius (c.275–339 CE) to the present day. Today, the practice is widely regarded as pseudoarchaeology. Various locations for the ark have been suggested but have never been confirmed. Search sites have included Durupınar site, a site on Mount Tendürek in eastern Turkey and Mount Ararat, but geological investigation of possible remains of the ark has only shown natural sedimentary formations.\n\n\nCommentaries on Genesis\nGeneral\n"}

Billingsley who had been trained at the Derby works is now renowned for the quality of his porcelain painting particularly his flower painting but he was also interested in perfecting a porcelain recipe which it is thought he obtained from Zachariah Boreman. Billingsley eventually left Pinxton and briefly set up a decorating shop in Mansfield where he decorated imported porcelain and pottery including some Pinxton porcelain. John Coke continued the business from 1799 to 1806, even taking in Henry Banks as a partner from 1801 to 1802.

{"id": "28818461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28818461", "title": "Planz", "text": "Planz\n\nPlanz is an open source personal information manager developed by the Keeping Found Things Found group at the University of Washington Information School. It integrates e-mail, website links and content, computer files and folders, and informal notes into a simplified, document-like interface. Its purpose is to make the user's personal information easily accessible for use in planning everyday activities as well as larger projects. Planz is a research prototype rather than a commercial product.\n\nPlanz was conceived in response to research conducted by the Keeping Found Things Found (KFTF) group and elsewhere in the field of personal information management (PIM). The research suggested that people often have trouble organizing their digital personal information effectively, due to the fact that this information is both extensive and scattered and in many cases cannot easily be combined with other personal information. The developers hoped to accommodate the fluid and often informal nature of human planning by providing users an interface with powerful organizational features while at the same time leaving the structure of that organization to the user's discretion.\n\nPlanz was developed between 2008 and 2010. The head developer is William Jones, leading the KFTF group. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation. The software has progressed through several development versions, and as of 2010 Planz is not in commercial release.\n\nPlanz is meant to help people better organize their digital personal information by providing a central document linking related personal information around a conceptual theme, usually in the form of a project, such as a home remodel or a trip to Europe. The interface shows users a document in either a draft or outline view. This document can be edited to show all of a user's projects and tasks in a single, scrollable pane. Headings are used to represent high-level projects (\"Re-model the house\"); subheadings represent sub-projects and component tasks (\"Kitchen\"; \"Decide on countertops\").\n\nUsers have the option of working from within the Planz document, sending e-mails and creating documents without leaving Planz, in which case Planz dynamically links these new information items into the document. They also have the option of working from outside the document by dragging and copying files, e-mails, hyperlinks, and other items into Planz in the course of using other applications. The efficient transfer of information between applications was a key objective in the design of Planz, and the interface provides users with specialized tools to facilitate this.\n\nPlanz works in many ways like a word processor. Users can enter notes directly, and these notes can be arranged under numerous levels of headings, promoted or demoted, and moved up or down according to importance or priority. From a design standpoint, the document overlay of Planz makes the realization of additional features straightforward, which was an important goal of the development team.\n\nBy default, Planz presents a document that is anchored at a \"Projects\" folder. However, for any folder selected in the file manager, Planz can also be invoked as a right-click option to present a document anchored at this folder instead.\n\nThe document presented in a Planz window can be saved as an HTML file to be viewed in a web browser or edited in a word processor. Structure as well as content is preserved. The structure of a Planz document can also be exported for re-use either as a project template or for immediate use in another project. On the back-end, the file system headings and subheadings correspond to file system folders and sub-folders. Links within Planz correspond either to local files within these folders or to shortcuts which, in turn, can point to files, web pages or e-mail messages. The mapping from headings and links to folders, files, and shortcuts is one-to-one. Thus, Planz works with, and as an alternative to, the file manager. Users can create, modify or delete folders and files through operations initiated within Planz. In the other direction, a process of synchronization works to ensure the document views of Planz are current with respect to changes to the file system made outside of Planz.\n\nPlanz is designed to provide for the complete life cycle of personal information management from initial information capture, to information's timely use in completing tasks, to its eventual archival for clutter control and future reference.\n\nQuickCapture is a pop-up utility associated with Planz. Its purpose is to quickly copy the content of a webpage, e-mail message, or document, while also linking back to the original. In Planz this information is structured as a note, and as a shortcut within the file system. QuickCapture is able to work independently from Planz. All communication is via a \"XooML\" middleware layer.\n\nUsers can flag headings in Planz as tasks yet to be completed. Flagged headings can optionally appear as tasks or calendar appointments within a separate task management or calendaring application. Shortcuts to these headings can appear as sub-headings under a special \"Today+\" heading in Planz, as a task to do that day or in the otherwise immediate future.\n\n\"PowerD\" support makes it easy for users to mark a heading or note as \"done\" or to \"defer\" for later completion. The heading or note no longer appears in the Planz document, but can reappear again later either at the user’s request or automatically when a deferred date comes due.\n\nTasks marked as done are recorded in a journal. The journal is another file system folder with subfolders for year, month, week and day. Like any other folder, the journal can also appear as a single integrated document in Planz. Users can easily take notes and link in information in the form of pictures, videos, and documents, either as a \"for the record\" of past events or for planning future events.\n\nPlanz works with these other applications:\n\nMicrosoft Outlook: Users can flag a heading in Planz to create a task or calendar appointment in Outlook. They can click on a task or appointment to access relevant information. \"The Days Ahead\" allows them to track deadlines and appointments through dynamic interaction with Microsoft Outlook's Calendar.\n\nMicrosoft Office: New Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote documents can be created from within Planz, or existing Office documents can be linked to Planz. Open documents can also be included in a plan.\n\nWeb browser: Users can links to websites in Planz.\n\nTwitter: Users can tweet directly from Planz. Planz creates a link to that tweet, which can then be incorporated into a project.\n\nPlanz and QuickCapture utilize metadata encoded in XML, called the Cross-Tool Markup Language, or \"XooML\" (pronounced \"zoomul\"). The XooML schema specifies the structure of a fragment of metadata as this might apply to any information item addressed by a URI.\n\nEssentially, a XooML-compliant fragment (or, simply, a XooML fragment) is a bundling of attributes. A fragment can have zero or more associations which, in turn, can point to other fragments representing other information items. Fragments are a bundling of attributes. Some bundles apply to the fragment as a whole; some bundles apply to individual associations. Bundles at each level can be held in common (cross-tool) or tool-specific. A XooML-based tool such as Planz then builds a view as follows:\n\nStep one is to retrieve the XooML fragment for the window's anchor URI and synchronize its metadata as needed with the item pointed to by the URI. The current version of Planz, for example, places XooML fragments in association with file folders in order to support the use of folder structure as a means of organizing not only files but also e-mail messages, web references and informal notes. In a step of synchronization, the folder's contents (as determined by file system calls) are compared to the information in the folder's associated XooML fragment. In cases of conflict, the fragment is modified to agree with the file system (i.e., the file system always wins). From the top-level synchronized XooML fragment, Planz builds a top-level Plan.\n\nStep two is to recursively retrieve and process additional XooML fragments as needed. In Planz, for example, the subfolders and folder shortcuts of a folder appear within the folder's Plan as document-like heading associations. For each of these headings that were last shown as \"expanded,\" Planz retrieves folder content information and an associated XooML fragment and then uses the results of their synchronization to determine the display of a sub-Plan.\n\nStep three is to view completion is tool-dependent. In Planz, the process completes when sub-plans have been generated for each in a list of expanded associations encountered during the processing of XooML fragments.\n\na. Planz is currently Microsoft Windows-based. However, through use of an XML-based XooML middleware layer (see discussion of XooML elsewhere in this article), the Planz approach readily extends to other file systems and other stores.\nb. “Projects” is created on installation of Planz as a sibling folder of “Documents” (or for Windows XP users, “My Projects”).\nc. In Microsoft Word, for example, headings are given a “style” of Heading 1, 2, 3… according to heading level within Planz.\nd. Planz currently includes special integrations for Microsoft Outlook. But the approach readily extends to other calendaring and task/time management applications.\ne. For the complete schema definition, see the KFTF website. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3050350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3050350", "title": "Plural society", "text": "Plural society\n\nA plural society is defined by Fredrik Barth as a society combining ethnic contrasts: the economic interdependence of those groups, and their ecological specialization (i.e., use of different environmental resources by each ethnic group). The ecological interdependence, or the lack of competition, between ethnic groups may be based on the different activities in the same region or on long–term occupation of different regions in the\nDefined by J S Furnivall as a medley of peoples - European, Chinese, Indian and native, who do mix but do not combine. Each group holds by its own religion, its own culture and language, its own ideas and ways. As individuals they meet, but only in the marketplace in buying and selling. There is a plural society, with different sections of the community living side by side, within the same political unit.\n\nDuring research about plural societies, Asim Ejaz, Student of M.phil Political Science in Islamia university bahawalpur, Pakistan, presented his analytical summary about the book of Arend Lijphart, \"democracy in plural societies\" that it is so much difficult to achieve and stable democratic government in plural society. As Aristotle says about stable governing system that, “a state aims at being, as far as it can be, a society composed of equal & peers”. For the stability of democratic regimes, there must be social homogeneity and political consensus among the deep social divisions, and, there must be termination of political differences. There are these criteria, because, the factors that help in producing instability and breakdown of democracies.\nArend Lijphart, therefore, used a particular form of democracy, “Consociational Democracy”, which is, according to him, may be difficult but it is not at all impossible to achieve and maintain stable democratic government in plural societies.\n\nConsociational democracy can be characterized by the cooperative attitude and behavior of the leaders of the different segments of the population. In other meanings, there will be elite cooperation. This model of Consociational democracy is both, normative and an empirical. In Austria, Belgium, Netherland and Switzerland, there are sharp political divisions, but due to Consoiciational democracy, there is existence of political stability. In Austria, political stability can be observed in the forms of Catholic-Socialist elite cooperation and grand coalition.\n\nIn non-Western countries, as Arend Lijphart highlights twin problems, and there are, sharp cleavages of various kind and political stability. For the successful democratic regimes in the third world, due to plural societies, Consociational democracy is based, also on normative model. A Plural society is a society, divided by segmental cleavages, and, political stability is characterized by system maintenance, legitimacy, civil order and effectiveness. Without these four elements, which are also interdependent, political stability cannot exist. According to Gabriel Almond, there are four types of political systems;\n\n1) Anglo-American Political System\n2) Continental European Political System\n3) Pre-Industrial Political System\n4) Totalitarian Political System.\n\nHe says that Anglo-American and Continental European Political systems show democratic regimes. The Anglo-American political system is a homogenous and secular political system, while the Continental European political system is characterized by a fragmentation of political culture due to plural societies within European countries.\n\nAccording to Gabriel Almond, Separation of power doctrine is also concerned with political stability. He extends the idea of “separation of power” from three formal branches of government, executives and legislature, to informal political subcultures like parties, interest groups and the media of communication. He much more emphasizes on input structures than the output structures.\n\nDuverger and Neumann argue that there is a close relationship between the number of parties and democratic stability, but a two party system not only seems to correspond to the nature of things because it can moderate better than multiparty systems. In other words, a two party system is the best aggregation. In Switzerland, there is a multiparty system, while in Austria, there is a two party system.\n\nArend Lijphart says that there are deep divisions between different segments of the population and absence of a unifying consensus in most of the Asian, African and South American countries like Guyana, Surinam and Trinidad. According to Cliffard Geertz, Communal attachment is called “primordial loyalties”, which may be based on language, religion, custom, region, race or assumed blood ties. Each communal group hold its assumed ties, therefore there is political instability and breakdown of democracy up until now.\n\nHe argues that due to political development, western countries have created homogeneity among their plural societies, as like idealize British society. But Gabriel Almond says that, in Continental European political system, there is no secularism and political homogeneity, but there is cultural homogeneity. He argues that, non-western countries would become more comprehensive and less remote they use this continental type, which is based on a multi-racial (multi-national) society and lacking in strong consensus.\n\nFurnivall says that democracy is achieved by the European countries with the help of Consociationalism, and, there is fulfillment of the requirements and demands of the divided societies through appropriate processes. On the other hand, in non-western countries, there is lack of strength in social will and social unity due to divided society, and, it is dangerous for both, the democracy and a considerable degree of political unity.\n\nAs Arend Lijhpart argues that there is constitutionalization for the segments of plural societies, and its better solution is consociational or semi-consociational democratic system. This system provides the facility of Mutual Veto regarding the decision making process on the specific issues within the country, to all the segments of society with equality. but Arend Lijhpart highlights Malaysia and Lebanon for its perfect example. In Lebanon, there are Shia's and Sunni's in the Muslim Segment while Christians are in the minority. Similarly in Malaysia, there are Chinese with local Communities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18633013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18633013", "title": "Postnuptial agreement", "text": "Postnuptial agreement\n\nA postnuptial agreement is a written agreement executed after a couple gets married, or have entered a civil union, to settle the couple's affairs and assets in the event of a separation or divorce. It may be \"notarized\" or acknowledged and may be the subject of the statute of frauds. Like the contents of a prenuptial agreement, provisions vary widely but commonly includes provisions for division of property and spousal support in the event of divorce, death of one of the spouses, or breakup of marriage.\n\nIn Canada, postnuptial agreements are permitted, and in fact most provinces have statutes specifically allowing them. However, courts subject them to more legal scrutiny than prenuptial agreements. The reason for this is the legal theory that prior to marriage, neither spouse has any legal rights, so a spouse is not giving anything up by signing a prenuptial agreement. However, once married, various family law rights crystallize. Thus, if one enters into a postnuptial agreement, one is giving up rights that one already has.\n\nAs with prenuptial agreements, a court has the discretion to reject the terms of a post-nuptial agreements, for example if the court finds that its terms are insufficient to meet the financial needs of partners and children.\n\nPostnuptial agreements only came to be widely accepted in the United States in the latter half of the 20th century. Before that time, U.S. jurisprudence followed the notion that contracts, such as a postnuptial agreements, could not be valid when executed between a husband and wife. The inability of a husband and wife to contract with one another was due to the concept of marital unity: at the time of marriage, husband and wife become a single entity or person. Since one may not enter into a contract with one's self, a postnuptial agreement would thus be invalid.\n\nEven after U.S. courts began to reject marital unity as a legal theory, postnuptial agreements were rejected as being seen to encourage divorce.\n\nIt was only in the 1970s that postnuptial agreements started to gain broad acceptance in the United States. Factors that contributed to this acceptance include the increase in divorce during the 1970s, and the implementation of so-called \"no fault\" divorces pursuant to which a married couple could get a divorce based without the need for an accusation of misconduct against one or both spouses. In the wake of those changes, postnuptial agreements began to find acceptance in American jurisprudence.\n\nIn the United States, much like prenuptial agreements, although laws vary by state there are five basic elements that must generally be met for a postnuptial agreement to be enforceable:\n\n\nAlthough not required in all states, it is a good idea for both spouses to be independently represented by lawyers when they negotiate and finalize a postnuptial agreement.\n\nPostnuptial agreements typically address one or more of the following concerns:\n\nProvisions that are included in a postnuptial agreement that relate to child custody or child support are not enforceable, nor are provisions that attempt to regulate routine aspects of the marital relationship.\n\n"}
{"id": "147885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147885", "title": "Power (social and political)", "text": "Power (social and political)\n\nIn social science and politics, power is the ability to influence or outright control the behaviour of people. The term \"authority\" is often used for power perceived as legitimate by the social structure. Power can be seen as evil or unjust, this sort of primitive exercise of power is historically endemic to humans, however as social beings the same concept is seen as good and as something inherited or given for exercising humanistic objectives that will help, enable and move people. In general, it is derived by the factors of interdependence between two entities and the environment. In business, the ethical instrumentality of power is achievement, and as such it is a zero-sum game. In simple terms it can be expressed as being \"upward\" or \"downward\". With downward power, a company's superior influences subordinates for attaining organizational goals. When a company exerts upward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.\n\nThe use of power need not involve force or the threat of force (coercion). On one side, it closely resembles what egalitarian and consensual nations (Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) might term as \"influence,\" contrasted with the extreme what some authors identify as \"intimidation\" in capitalist nations, a means by which power is used. An example of using power without oppression is the concept \"soft power,\" as compared to hard power.\n\nMuch of the recent sociological debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enablein other words, power as a means to make social actions possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them. The philosopher Michel Foucault saw power as a structural expression of \"a complex strategic situation in a given social setting\" that requires both constraint and enablement.\n\nSocial psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven, in a now-classic study (1959), developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.\n\nAccording to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally \"relative\" – it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship, and requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship, to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power.\n\nFrench and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories. Further bases have since been adduced – in particular by Gareth Morgan in his 1986 book, \"Images of Organization\".\n\nAlso called \"positional power,\" it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization. Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position. It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a uniform, a title, or an imposing physical office.\n\nReferent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build loyalty. It is based on the charisma and interpersonal skills of the power holder. A person may be admired because of specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence. Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities, and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower. Nationalism and patriotism count towards an intangible sort of referent power. For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country. This is the second least obvious power, but the most effective. Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements, for example. The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena. Abuse is possible when someone that is likable, yet lacks integrity and honesty, rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position. Referent power is unstable alone, and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect. When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.\n\nExpert power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise. Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified. When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment, and generally out perform others, then people tend to listen to them. When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say. As subject matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for leadership in that area.\n\nReward power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards, it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions or increases in pay or responsibility. This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused. People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly'. If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there's a high probability that they'll do it. The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required. Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases, and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves. And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions. So when somebody uses up available rewards, or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others, their power weakens. (One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact. Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become satiated by the reward, such that it loses its effectiveness).\n\nCoercive power is the application of negative influences. It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power. Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and punishment are common tools of coercion. Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership. This is a type of power is commonly seen in fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power, it is referred in the industry specific literature's as \"glamorization of structural domination and exploitation.\"\n\nAccording to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in \"Close encounters: Communication in Relationships\":\n\nGame theory, with its foundations in the Walrasian theory of rational choice, is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships. One rational choice definition of power is given by Keith Dowding in his book \"Power\".\n\nIn rational choice theory, human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes. An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises (its beliefs about) the costs associated with different actions in the choice set, and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes.\n\nIn this setting we can differentiate between:\n\nThis framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others. For example, a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set; can change the relative costs of actions; can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome; or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure.\n\nAs with other models of power, this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion'. For example: a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions; so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract, or indeed a friendly offer.\n\nIn the Marxist tradition, the Italian writer Antonio Gramsci elaborated the role of ideology in creating a cultural hegemony, which becomes a means of bolstering the power of capitalism and of the nation-state. Drawing on Niccolò Machiavelli in The Prince, and trying to understand why there had been no Communist revolution in Western Europe, while it was claimed there had been one in Russia, Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a centaur, consisting of two halves. The back end, the beast, represented the more classic, material image of power, power through coercion, through brute force, be it physical or economic. But the capitalist hegemony, he argued, depended even more strongly on the front end, the human face, which projected power through 'consent'. In Russia, this power was lacking, allowing for a revolution. However, in Western Europe, specifically in Italy, capitalism had succeeded in exercising \"consensual\" power, convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists. In this way revolution had been avoided.\n\nWhile Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures, Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life. The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a 'reserve army of labour'. In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks, while after the war the roles are easily reversed. Therefore, according to Barrett, the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women.\n\nTarnow considers what power hijackers have over air plane passengers and draws similarities with power in the military. He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group. If the group conforms to the leader's commands, the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil.\n\nFor Michel Foucault, the real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents. No single human, group nor single actor runs the dispositif (machine or apparatus) but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible, ensuring its agents to do whatever is necessary. It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected that it remains elusive to 'rational' investigation. Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon, entitled \"Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France\" (1778), but turns out to be written by his secretary Jean-Baptise Moheau (1745–1794) and by emphasizing Biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who constantly refers to Milieus as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu, in this case the human species, relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu. This milieu(both artificial and natural) appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty, territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species (biological species).\n\nFoucault originated and developed the concept of \"docile bodies\" in his book \"Discipline and Punish.\" He writes, \"A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved. \" Foucault claims that there is a shift, during the 18th century, in which political power changed. Instead of using corporeal punishment in order to convince people to adhere to the laws of the day, Foucault says power becomes internalized during this period. Instead of watching someone be drawn and quartered in a public space, political power is exerted on individuals in a way that compels them to obey laws and rules on their own - without this show of force. He builds on the ideas of Jeremy Bentham regarding the Panopticon in which prison inmates are compelled to behave and control themselves because they might be in the view of the prison guard. The physical shape of the Panopticon creates a situation in which the prison guard need not be present for this to happen, because the mere possibility of the presence of the guard compels the prisoners to behave. Foucault takes this theory and makes it generalize to everyday life. He claims that this kind of surveillance is constant in modern society, and the populous at large enacts it. Therefore, everyone begins to control themselves and behave according to society's rules and norms.\n\nFeminist philosophers took up Foucault's ideas regarding docile bodies and applied them to the different ways men and women are socialized to use their bodies. For one example, philosopher Sandra Bartky says in her essay, \"\"Foucault, Femininity, and the Modernization of Patriarchal Power\" that “The disciplinary techniques through which the ‘docile bodies’ of women are constructed aim at a regulation that is perpetual and exhaustive - a regulation of the body’s size and contours, its appetite, posture, gestures and general comportment in space, and the appearance of each of its visible parts.\" Bartky theorizes that there is a specific and relentless pressure on women when it comes to bodily movements and comportment; this \"docility\" manifests as women make themselves smaller, groom themselves in ways that make them appear more feminine, and control their bodily movements in order to be as minimally obtrusive as possible. She also cites diet, exercise, and skin care, among other processes, as sites in which the feminine body is made docile.\n\nStewart Clegg proposes another three-dimensional model with his \"circuits of power\" theory. This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The \"episodic circuit\" is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The \"dispositional circuit\" is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The \"facilitative circuit\" is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at \"obligatory passage points\" which are channels for empowerment or disempowerment.\n\nJK Galbraith summarizes the types of power as being \"condign\" (based on force), \"compensatory\" (through the use of various resources) or \"conditioned\" (the result of persuasion), and their sources as \"personality\" (individuals), \"property\" (their material resources) and \"organizational\" (whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure).\n\nGene Sharp, an American professor of political science, believes that power depends ultimately on its bases. Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates, laws and policies. Sharp cites the insight of Étienne de La Boétie.\n\nSharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state – regardless of its particular structural organization – ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.\n\nHis work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, in the 2011 Arab Spring, and other nonviolent revolutions.\n\nBjörn Kraus deals with the epistemological perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of constructivism (named relational constructivism). Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all. Coming from Max Weber's definition of power, he realizes that the term of power has to be split into \"instructive power\" and \"destructive power\". More precisely, instructive power means the chance to determine the actions and thoughts of another person, whereas destructive power means the chance to diminish the opportunities of another person. How significant this distinction really is, becomes evident by looking at the possibilities of rejecting power attempts: Rejecting instructive power is possible – rejecting destructive power is not. By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility. This perspective permits to get over an \"either-or-position\" (either there is power, or there isn't), which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories, and to introduce the possibility of an \"as well as-position\".\n\nThe idea of \"unmarked categories\" originated in feminism. The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful. The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources, those who can exercise power without considering their actions. For the powerful, their culture seems obvious; for the powerless, on the other hand, it remains out of reach, élite and expensive.\n\nThe \"unmarked category\" can form the identifying mark of the powerful. The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else. For most Western readers, it is posited that if a protagonist's race is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is Caucasian; if a sexual identity is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is heterosexual; if the gender of a body is not indicated, will be assumed by the reader that it is male; if a disability is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied, just as a set of examples.\n\nOne can often overlook unmarked categories. Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful, as they often fall within this category. The unmarked category becomes the norm, with the other categories relegated to deviant status. Social groups can apply this view of power to race, gender, and disability without modification: the able body is the neutral body.\n\nThe term 'counter-power' (sometimes written 'counterpower') is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites. A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias'. Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions [of counter-power] maintain themselves in the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation'. Tim Gee, in his 2011 book \"Counterpower: Making Change Happen\", put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use \"counterpower\" to counter this. In Gee's model, \"counterpower\" is split into three categories: \"idea counterpower\", \"economic counterpower\", and \"physical counterpower\".\n\nAlthough the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/anti-globalization movement of the 1990s onwards, the word has been used for at least 60 years; for instance Martin Buber's 1949 book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power'.\n\n\nRecent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less empathy. Adam Galinsky, along with several coauthors, found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead, they are 3 times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power. Powerful people are also more likely to take action. In one example, powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people. Researchers have documented the bystander effect: they found that powerful people are three times as likely to first offer help to a \"stranger in distress\".\n\nA study involving over 50 college students suggested that those primed to feel powerful through stating 'power words' were less susceptible to external pressure, more willing to give honest feedback, and more creative.\n\n\"Power is defined as a possibility to influence others.\"\n\nThe use of power has evolved from centuries. Gaining prestige, honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature. Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences. Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences. It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities. Research experiments were done as early as 1968 to explore power conflict.\n\nEarlier, research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently. In contrast, decreased power relates to more constraint, threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions. It was concluded that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes, to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers.\n\nLater, research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations. Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker. It was concluded that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility.\n\nBargaining games were explored in 2003 and 2004. These studies compared behavior done in different power given situations.\n\nIn an \"ultimatum game\", the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward.\n\nIn a \"dictator game\", the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer. The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer.\n\nThe dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient. The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game. Self-serving also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed.\n\nWhen the counterpart recipient is completely powerless, lack of strategy, social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given (the one with the power).\n\nAbusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) involve the ways in which abusers gain and maintain power and control over victims for abusive purposes such as psychological, physical, sexual, or financial abuse. Such abuse can have various causes - such as personal gain, personal gratification, psychological projection, devaluation, envy or just for the sake of it - as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.\n\nControlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse, thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse. Abusers aim to control and intimidate victims or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.\n\nManipulators and abusers may control their victims with a range of tactics, including:\n\n\nThe vulnerabilities of the victim are exploited, with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets. Traumatic bonding can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment fosters powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change, as well as a climate of fear. An attempt may be made to normalise, legitimise, rationalise, deny, or minimise the abusive behaviour, or to blame the victim for it.\n\nOther often-used strategies include isolation, gaslighting, mind games, lying, disinformation, propaganda, destabilisation and divide-and-rule. Manipulators may ply victims with alcohol or drugs to help disorientate them.\n\nCertain personality-types feel particularly compelled to control other people.\n\nIn everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action. There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day. Some of these tactics include bullying, collaboration, complaining, criticizing, demanding, disengaging, evading, humor, inspiring, manipulating, negotiating, socializing, and supplicating. These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions:\n\nPeople tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics. Machiavellians, however, tend to use nonrational tactics. Moreover, extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts. People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation, and based on whom they are trying to influence. People also tend to shift from soft to hard tactics when they face resistance.\n\nBecause power operates both relationally and reciprocally, sociologists speak of the balance of power between parties to a relationship: all parties to all relationships have \"some\" power: the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths: equal or unequal, stable or subject to periodic change. Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of \"constraint\" rather than of power. Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism. If this were not so, then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power', and its meaning would be lost. Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others, to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency.\n\nPower changes those in the position of power and those who are targets of that power.\n\nDeveloped by D. Keltner and colleagues, approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals. The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways. The reaction of \"approach\" is associated with action, self-promotion, seeking rewards, increased energy and movement. \"Inhibition\", on the contrary, is associated with self-protection, avoiding threats or danger, vigilance, loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity.\n\nOverall, approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies, while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies.\n\n\n\nA number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics (e.g. punishment (both personal and impersonal), rule-based sanctions, and non-personal rewards) are less effective than soft tactics (expert power, referent power, and personal rewards). It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility, depression, fear, and anger, while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation. Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work, while instilling a feeling of autonomy in one’s subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring.\n\nCoercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning. When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded, the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work, leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group. This effect is called \"Disruptive contagion or ripple effect\" and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group, and authority’s requests are vague and ambiguous.\n\nCoercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful, the leader is trusted, and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms. Furthermore, coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions.\n\nHowever, in some cases, group members chose to resist the authority’s influence. When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity, they are more likely to form a \"Revolutionary Coalition\", a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the group’s authority structure. Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power, uses coercive methods, and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments. It is because these conditions create \"reactance\", a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated. When reactance occurs, individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority.\n\nHerbert Kelman identified three basic, step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time.\n\nAt the stage of \"compliance,\" group members comply with authority’s demands, but personally do not agree with them. If authority does not monitor the members, they will probably not obey.\n\n\"Identification\" occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority, mimics authority’s actions, values, characteristics, and takes on behaviours of the person with power. If prolonged and continuous, identification can lead to the final stage – internalization.\n\nWhen \"internalization\" occurs, individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system. At this stage, group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions. Extreme obedience often requires internalization.\n\nPower literacy refers to how one perceives power, how it is formed and accumulates, and the structures that support it and who is in control of it. Education can be helpful for heightening power literacy. In a 2014 TED talk Eric Liu notes that \"we don't like to talk about power\" as \"we find it scary\" and \"somehow evil\" with it having a \"negative moral valence\" and states that the pervasiveness of power illiteracy causes a concentration of knowledge, understanding and clout. Joe L. Kincheloe describes a \"cyber-literacy of power\" that is concerned with the forces that shape knowledge production and the construction and transmission of meaning, being more about engaging knowledge than \"mastering\" information, and a \"cyber-power literacy\" that is focused on transformative knowledge production and new modes of accountability.\n\n"}

The legal distinction between the two is important, as an \"inquiry\" still leaves the original offer live (and still subject to acceptance), whereas a \"counteroffer\" cancels the previous offer.\n\nThe two parties were negotiating a sale of a property. Daley's, the sellers, sent to Powierza, via their real estate agent Lee, a sale agreement for $405,000, with a condition of a $40,000 deposit. Poweirza agreed to the sale price, but changed the deposit on the sale agreement to $20,000.\n\nThe vendor had just changed the deposit from $20,000 to $40,000, and the purchaser changed the deposit back to $20,000, signing the sales agreement, and got Lee to return it to the vendor to consider, which the vendor refused to accept. Nor was his next inquiry of splitting the deposit into 2 instalments accepted either.\n\nPowierza then amended the sales agreement deposit back to the original $40,000, signed it, and returned it to Daley. But by then, the property had been sold elsewhere as Daley had received a higher offer of $435,000 from a 3rd party.\n\nPowierza considered the original sales offer was still open for his acceptance, and sued the Daley's. The Daley's response was that his alterations to the contract were a counteroffer, making the original offer to be at an end.\n\nThe Court of Appeal upheld that the alteration in the sales agreement was merely an inquiry, and not a counter offer, making the original contract still enforceable against the vendor. Cooke J stated \"The line between rejecting an offer and merely inquiring as to a possible variation can be a fine one, but the basic test is the effect on a reasonable person in the shoes of the offerer\".\n"}
{"id": "44209471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44209471", "title": "RAC–HBC Agreement", "text": "RAC–HBC Agreement\n\nThe RAC–HBC Agreement was a series of protocols signed by the Russian-American Company (RAC) and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1839. Over previous decades both monopolies secured regions for control of the Maritime fur trade, the RAC being based in Russian America and the HBC in the Columbia Department of the Oregon Country. As the outposts and trading stations of each company grew closer in proximity, a clash of interests occurred in 1834 at Redoubt Saint Dionysius on the site of modern Wrangell, Alaska. Officials from the two companies felt it was necessary to settle their long standing issues. Ferdinand Wrangel, Governor of Russian America, volunteered to negotiate on behalf of the RAC and the HBC sent George Simpson, Governor of Rupert's Land. Previously Simpson had stated to the HBC committee that if a settlement with the Russians was concluded, \"we ought to be able to put down all competition on the Coast...\" By removing the Russian markets, the Governor felt American merchants would lose an important revenue source. The Imperial Government of Russia in late 1838 ordered the RAC to end its disputes with the British, before it could strain relations with the United Kingdom. Simpson and Wrangel negotiated a commercial treaty in early 1839 while in Hamburg.\n\nThe Russians granted the HBC exclusive fur trapping rights in \"a strip of land ten miles in width, to the north and south of the Stakhina River, that is, the portion of the seacoast from 54°40′ latitude to a line drawn between Cape Spencer on Cross Sound and Mt. Fairweather.\" This lease was to begin on 1 June 1840 and last for one decade. Redoubt Saint Dionysius, with its annual expenses ₽12,000, was handed over to the British. In return for the additional areas to trap furs in the British had to send 2,000 land otter fur pelts. The HBC also had to supply New Archangel with 14,000 poods of wheat, worth ₽52,5000, along with a multitude of provisions needed. The sudden demand for agricultural produce necessitated the creation of the HBC subsidiary, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company (PSAC). Using British supplies from London proved to be far less expensive than shipping from Kronstadt for the RAC. Naval shipments from Great Britain destined for Russian America cost the RAC only ₽80 per ton of supplies, compared to ₽250 from Kronstadt and ₽630 overland through Siberia to Okhotsk. Proceeds from freight transportation often gave an annual profit of £4,000 for the HBC.\n\nThe agreement was continuously renewed, although with several modifications made over the years which followed. A different version was agreed by both companies and came into force on 3 April 1849. This commercial agreement saw the termination of the PSAC, providing agricultural and pastoral products to New Archangel. Encroachment by American settlers on company property after the Oregon Treaty, combined with the California Gold Rush, left Fort Cowlitz and Fort Nisqually understaffed and greatly reduced operational abilities. Despite Fort Langley and Fort Victoria producing much of the wheat quota for Russian America after 1846, the British could not meet the Russians' need for food. The RAC board of directors found the HBC stance for an end to supplying the Russian posts to be \"based on quite valid reasons.\" Additionally, the Russian authorities claimed exclusive rights to the timber, fisheries, and ice within the portion of the Alaska Panhandle occupied by the HBC, to allow further agreements with other companies for exploitation of resources. After the Fraser Gold Rush, numerous small merchants began operating within the HBC concession, undercutting the British fur trading efforts. During the 1860s the Labouchere operated within the leased area. In 1862 the HBC governing board complained to their Russian counterparts that they did not \"afford us any protection and the whole Territory is just as free to Petty Traders who pay no rent...\" Despite this economic competition and declining profits, the HBC signed the renewed protocols.\n\nThe final expiration of the agreement occurred on 1 June 1865. An official of the RAC, A. Rutkovski, was sent to London, reaching the British capital in January 1865, offering a proposition to the HBC. In return for an annual payment of £3,000, retaining company posts and rights to an ice harvesting monopoly, the RAC would lease all lands of Russian America south of Mount Saint Elias. All Russian fur traders would additionally operate only in the name of the HBC. The historian John Galbraith appraised Rutkovski's considered offer as \"Such a proposal would have been unhesitatingly accepted had it been made twenty years earlier. But the same uncertainties of the value of the fur trade which induced the Russians to make such an offer in 1865 prevented the Hudson's Bay Company from accepting.\" Additionally, by this point the British had already formulated plans to create stations in the Yukon, where the interior trade could continue to be accessed. Shortly after the ratification of the Alaska Purchase by the United States of America, the HBC inquired if the lease was still in effect. Mikhail Tebenkov responded that the RAC was itself unaware of the treaty's terms, but stated that the company \"can only suppose the cession itself will cause the refusal of our Government to sanction of our agreement with your honourable body for a continuation of the lease of the Stackine Territory.\" Despite being requesting to end the agreement when the official transfer to the Americans occurred, the HBC felt it could unilaterally continue to operate in the Stikine lisière; an interpretation the Americans didn't acknowledge. The RAC–HBC Agreement later had a part in the Alaska boundary dispute.\n"}

This free radio station had associations with \"RPR\" and with the \"UDF\" and was strongly opposed to the political left of François Mitterrand.\n\nAt the time, Ferré was a radio and television columnist for \"Figaro Magazine\", of which he had been a founder with Louis Pauwels. His columns, frequently kind to \"Radio Solidarité\", brought him to the notice of d'Angevilliers who proposed a radio collaboration with him.\n\nIn May and June 1982, Ferré created the broadcast formula of the \"Libre Journal\": an hour and a half programme each evening based around a guest belonging to the political right. This formula would be taken up by \"Radio Courtoisie\" and extended to three hours.\n\nFerré proposed that the radio should be open to \"all people of the right\". Following this, Serge de Beketch, as many others, was invited to direct a regular Wednesday evening broadcast. However, following the 1984 European elections, his invitiation brought on the radio the accusation of having helped the political breakthrough of the French National Front. De Beketch was ordered to leave; Ferré defended de Beketch and was also dismissed.\n\nHaving been taken off the air, Ferré created the \"\"Radio Solidarité\" listeners' defense committee\" (CDARS). It was under this name, declared to the Paris police prefecture on 12 December 1985, that he founded \"Radio Courtoisie\" (\"courtoisie\" means courtesy). \"Radio Courtoisie\" made its first broadcast on 7 November 1987.\n\nFrom November 1987 until the end of his life, Ferré was the head of the radio station, with title \"President of the editorial committee\", and a full delegation of successive presidents, François Pitti-Ferrandi, Pierre Dehaye and Christian Langlois. Every Monday evening Ferré himself hosted a \"Libre Journal\" without interruption until 31 July 2006, the date of his last broadcast.\n\nAfter Ferré's death on 10 October 2006, a lively dispute pitted Henry de Lesquen, Ferré's successor as head of the station, against a group of four broadcasting patrons including Claude Reichman, who demanded that de Lesquen resign. Claude Reichman was banned from \"Radio Courtoisie\" after a broadcast on 14 November 2006, in which he attacked de Lesquen in terms that de Lesquen judged to be defamatory. He was replaced by Marie Le Méné and Benoîte Taffin. Jean-Gilles Malliarakis in turn announced he would leave the station during his broadcast of 23 February 2007, having been given notice the same morning. Malliarakis was replaced by David Mascré and Catherine Rouvier.\n\nTwo objectives were set out in \"Radio Courtoisie\"'s file for candidacy submitted in 1986: Respecting the right of freedom of expression for all tribes within the French political right, and protecting and illustrating the French language. In practice, the editorial policy was organized relative to three axes, those of (right-wing) politics, religion (mainly traditionalist Catholicism) and culture. While a single broadcast often touched on both political and religious themes, cultural broadcasts rarely strayed into the other areas. A novelty introduced in 2007 was the introduction of a daily information programme, \"le Bulletin de réinformation\", which lasted 15 minutes.\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\" has preserved its editorial freedom by eschewing any form of advertising. It is an associative union-based radio station, and listeners are regularly asked to contribute through an annual membership fee and through donations.\n\nIn his political blueprint, Ferré had desired that \"Radio Courtoisie\" would be anchored in the political right and at the same time \"open to all tribes of the right\", from the centre-right to the French National Front, thus linking the extreme-right with the mainstream right. Ferré often explained on air the attacks which were leveled at his radio station: for certain of its detractors, \"Radio Courtoisie\" was the radio station of Le Pen, for others, the station of Jacques Chirac. He always put to everyone his firm wish (according to him as a Poitiers native) that his radio station should be open to \"all people of the right\", that is, including the French National Front.\n\nFerré was himself a royalist and personally very anti-Gaullist. However, in a broadcast of 3 October 1991, he recalled that he had sacrificed his anti-Gaullism on the altar of reconciliation, that he had resolved for his own part never to argue in public against de Gaulle, and that, in any case, he respected some of the great Gaullists such as Alain Griotteray. As he explained in his own \"Libre journal\" of 16 April 2001, his project was to rally all patriots. On several occasions, Ferré asserted on air at \"Radio Courtoisie\" that he had wished, in accordance with his editorial line, to give full and complete freedom to his broadcasting patrons in their words and in their choice of invited guests. Christian democrats, liberals, Gaullists, nationalists and royalists were regularly heard on \"Radio Courtoisie\".\n\nFor the most specifically political programmes, hosts such as Yannick Urrien, Paul-Marie Coûteaux, Michel de Rostolan, Benoîte Taffin, Henry de Lesquen, Martial Bild, Jacques Garello, Henri Fouquereau, Bernard Antony, Catherine Rouvier, Gérard Marin, Claude Giraud and Emmanuel Ratier were involved. Among former broadcasting patrons were Serge de Beketch (until his death in 2007) , Jean-Gilles Malliarakis, Alain Paucard, Reichman, Griotteray, \"Commandant\" Pierre Guillaume and the historian Pierre Chaunu.\n\nMany of the older broadcasters identified as \"maurrassiens\". The incorporation of Maurras' concept of \"\"pays réel\" (real country) into the \"Radio Courtoisie\"'s slogan witnessed to this historical influence.\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\" was not sectarian, except on Sundays, when it became so. It generally devoted much space to the Catholic religion, and specifically to traditional Catholics practicing the rite of Saint Pius V: The Society of St. Pius X, the Good Shepherd Institute, and the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter. Father Guillaume de Tanoüarn, father Philippe Laguérie, and father Grégoire Celier went on air. Jean Ferré also invited as a permanent adviser Father André Wartelle until his death in 2001. Certain guests were less frequent, but more politically correct such as Father Alain de La Morandais.\n\nThe host who presented the most openly religious broadcasts included Philippe Maxence and Daniel Hamiche.\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\" gave a lot of time to history, literature and issues relevant to French-speakers, and to a lesser extent, painting, sculpture, cinema, theatre and poetry. The most culture-oriented programmes were presented by hosts such as Jean-Paul Bled, Philippe de Saint Robert, Dominique Paoli, Philippe Lejeune, Jean Darnel, Aude de Kerros, Philippe d'Hugues, Bernard Lugan, Albert Salon, and Michel Mourlet. Among former hosts were Pierre Debray-Ritzen and the adventurers Alexandre Poussin and Sylvain Tesson at the end of the 1990s.\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\"'s programmes last between one and three hours. The ethos of the radio favoured a guest being able to express himself at length, so that he could \"get to the bottom of his ideas\" and \"to the bottom of things\".\n\n\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\" broadcasts on the following FM band frequencies:\n\n\"Radio Courtoisie\" was transmitted by the HOT BIRD satellite of Eutelsat. It could be received either by the satellite bouquet satellite TPS (radio no. 80), or directly via transponder 120, at 10911 MHz, vertical polarisation verticale, 27500|Msymb/s, FEC 3/4, SID 3305, audio 3335. This transmission was planned to stop in 2008 with the disappearance of TPS.\n\nRadio Courtoisie has been clearly accessible since January 2008 on the satellite bouquet CanalSat (satellite Astra H1 19°.2) on channel 179. It can also be received by internet via http://tv-radio.com using this Windows Media link.\n\nOn 16 May 1993, \"Radio Courtoisie\" and host Serge de Beketch were convicted of defaming Olivier Biffaud, journalist for the daily newspaper \"Le Monde\", and sentenced to pay a single Franc symbolic of damages and interests, as well as 8,000 Francs court costs. De Beketch had declared, mentioning Biffaud's initials, that it would be a good name for a sanitary towel. The court judged that this phrase \"offended against the delicacy and dignity of the person in question\".\n\nA Radio Courtoisie interview of Alain Menargues in October 2004 caused controversy due to his claim that the Jews created the first ghettoes because they disliked being around \"impure non-Jews.\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 2006, the French \"Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel\" broadcasting authority examined \"Radio Courtoisie\", for statements considered potentially racist, injurious or revisionist which were broadcast on air and originated from a host or speaker, issuing three letters, and two warnings. As a sanction, the CSA ordered its communiqué to be inserted at the beginning of the programme \"Le Libre Journal' on 13 November 2006 at 6 pm.\n\nSome critics of \"Radio Courtoisie\" assert that positions espoused by certain hosts on air are close to those of the extreme right, pointing to broadcasts with contributors from traditionalist Catholicism, the \"Mouvement pour la France\", the \"Mouvement national républicain\" and the \"Front National\". They also base this on the opposition described in certain programmes between the so-called \"droite molle\" (soft right, principally including the \"Union pour un mouvement populaire\"), and the rest of the right wing, meaning to the right of the \"UMP\". Those \"Radio Courtoisie\" hosts who are close to the \"Front national\" or who accept them, reject the \"extreme right\" moniker, with the exception of de Beketch. Le Pen himself recalled on air at \"Radio Courtoisie\" the same refusal to be ascribed to this category, preferring \"national right\".\n\n"}

Edwards, Ian R. Jamieson, Josephine Kains, Jillian Kearny, Howard Lee, Zeke Masters, Frank S. Shawn, and Joseph Silva.\n\nGoulart's first professional publication was a 1952 reprint of the SF story \"Letters to the Editor\" in \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\"; this parody of a pulp magazine letters column was originally published in the University of California, Berkeley's \"Pelican\". His early career in advertising and marketing influenced much of his work. In the early 1960s, Goulart wrote the text for \"Chex Press\", a newspaper parody published on Ralston Purina cereal boxes (Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, Corn Chex). He contributed to \"P.S.\" and other magazines, along with his book review column for \"Venture Science Fiction Magazine\". \"Cheap Thrills: An Informal History of the Pulp Magazines\" (1972) is his best known non-fiction book.\n\nGoulart's fiction is characterized by several themes, including humor, technology gone wrong (usually through incompetence rather than malice) and heroes with superhuman powers. His humorous crime and science fiction includes tales about robots and historical Hollywood figures, such as Groucho Marx. In the 1970s, he wrote several novels based on Lee Falk's \"The Phantom\" for Avon Books, using the pseudonym \"Frank Shawn\" (a play on his wife and son's names). He has also written comic book stories and short stories about The Phantom for Moonstone Books from 2003 to present. Goulart has also written novelizations for televisions programs such as Laverne & Shirley, and wrote several \"romance\" novels under feminine pseudonyms (they contain familiar Goulart themes and are hilarious.)\n\nIt is widely known that Goulart ghost wrote the \"TekWar\" series of books credited to the actor William Shatner (Shatner is said to have written the outlines for the books).

The auction was eagerly followed by bibliophiles, the high point being the sale on 17 June 1812 of a first edition of Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", printed by Christophorus Valdarfer of Venice in 1471, and sold to the Marquis of Blandford for £2,260, the highest price ever given for a book at that time. (The Marquis already possessed a copy, but one that lacked 5 pages.) That evening, a group of eighteen collectors met at the St Albans Tavern, St Albans Street (later renamed Waterloo Place) for a dinner presided over by the 2nd Earl Spencer, and this is regarded as the origin of the Roxburghe Club.\n\nA toast drunk on that occasion has been repeated at every annual anniversary dinner since to the \"immortal memory of John Duke of Roxburghe, of Christopher Valdarfer, printer of the \"Boccaccio\" of 1471, of Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer, the inventors of the art of printing, of William Caxton, Father of the British press [and others; and] the prosperity of the Roxburghe Club and the Cause of Bibliomania all over the world\". It was decided to make the dinner an annual event: further members were admitted the following year. The club was formed by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, author of the book 1809 Bibliomania; or Book-Madness who served as its first secretary and the club was formalised under Earl Spencer's presidency.\n\nThe Club has had a total of 344 members since its foundation. The circle has always been an exclusive one, with just one \"black ball\" (negative vote) being enough to exclude an applicant. Since 1839 the number of members at any one time has been limited to forty.\n\nA photograph exists of the membership in 1892, including the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and anthropologist Andrew Lang, as well as American poet James Russell Lowell, Alfred Henry Huth, and Simon Watson Taylor. James Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, was then President.\n\nThe first female member was Mary, Viscountess Eccles, elected in 1985. In 2011, the Australian comedian Barry Humphries was elected a member. The President since 1998 has been Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont.\n\nThe Club rapidly became more than a merely social institution. Each member was (and remains) expected to sponsor the publication of a rare or curious volume. Other volumes are published by the Club collectively. Initially the volumes were editions of early blackletter printed texts (the first, in 1814, was the Earl of Surrey's translation of parts of Virgil's Aeneid, originally printed in 1557); but from as early as 1819 they began to include texts taken from manuscript originals. The standards of scholarship are high, and the quality of printing, facsimile reproduction, and binding is lavish.

The museum was located from central São Carlos and from São Paulo City.\n\nThe museum was the creation of Rolim Adolfo Amaro, founder and president of TAM Airlines, and his brother João Francisco Amaro. The building is annexed to the TAM Airlines Technology Center at São Carlos Airport, in the district of Água Vermelha in São Carlos.\n\nIn 1996, after finishing the restoration work on a Cessna 195, brothers Rolim Adolfo Amaro and João Francisco Amaro decided to buy some classic aircraft, and keep them near São Paulo, in order to make them available for flights on weekends with friends. However, once purchased, it was realised that the small collection could become a museum representative of the memory of aviation and the world. The brothers then decided to create the \"Museu Asas de um Sonho\" (Wings of a Dream Museum), that was maintained by the Education Service and Culture, a non-profit association founded by TAM on 23 December 1991, to administer the social programs of the company.\n\nIn 2006, the museum opened with 32 aircraft, but in future will house more than 80 aircraft. The opening will also be part of the celebrations of 150 years of the city of São Carlos.\n\nOn January 29, 2016, TAM announced that the museum would be ceasing operations due to budget concerns.\n\nIn July 2008 the museum was closed to visitors in order to allow a complete reorganization of its installations, which included an expansion of the covered space from 9.5 thousand square metres to over 20 thousand square metres. Te grand re-opening occurred in June 2010 and among many new features the collection of 90 airplanes now holds the sole surviving S.55 seaplane christened \"Jahú\", a F4U Corsair, a Bf 109, a Dassault Mirage III, a Brazilian aircraft Neiva Regente among others.\n\nThe museum has 35 aircraft in a historical building measuring 450 metres long by 130 metres wide and 11 metres high.

The first two editions were created by Barry Winkleman, the editorial director of Times Atlases and Managing Director of Times Books. They were edited by the Oxford Chichele Professor of Modern History Geoffrey Barraclough. It contains large full color plates and commentary on each map or set of maps. Includes approximately 600 maps covering the date span of 3000 BCE to 1975. It has been revised and reprinted for many times and the latest edition is the ninth edition, published in 2015, and reflects on the modern world up to the 21st Century.\n\nDimensions: 1.2 x 11.0 x 14.8 inches\n\nIt contains seven sections:\n\nThe book is prefaced with an eleven page \"World Chronology\" which is quick-view timeline across general geographic regions. It is suffixed with a Glossary (38 pages), helpful in cross-referencing names and places, and an index (26 pages).\n\nEach section is further divided into given subjects and contain between one and nine maps, charts to show economic, demographic, manufactures, agricultural output, drug trade and other data as needed. Occasionally illustrations are included on a topic.\n\nIn the introduction to the first edition, Geoffrey Barraclough notes that the desire of \"The Atlas\" was to provide a history based on the viewpoint of its creators, hence the spread of Islam, for example, is centred at Mecca, as might have been the view of the seventh century Arabs.\n\n\"The Atlas\", first published in 1978 in London, UK, sold more than two million copies in many languages. Its stated aim was to describe the major processes and events of world history across a broad canvas and omit tiny details of, say, ruling families, minor battles etc. It wished to give a dynamic view of population migrations, economic developments such as agriculture and industrialisation, wars, the spread of religions and political ideologies.\n\nIt was created by Barry Winkleman, the Publishing Director of \"The Times\", and Geoffrey Barraclough, Chichele Professor of Modern History at Oxford University. They assembled a team of some 100 leading historians from around the world who wrote the texts and provided the map sources and recruited a team of illustrators and designers to create over 6 maps that were not primarily cartographers but illustrators. The map design was the work of Peter Sullivan, an art teacher and principal graphic artist at \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper in London. The illustration team was from Product Support Graphics, a large design group once part of Rolls Royce Motors in Derby, England, who used technical illustration technology to create projections.\n\n\"The Atlas\" was the first work of its kind to be published in Chinese, in Beijing, in 1981, by The Joint Publishing Company, and was a major success in French (\"Encyclopedie Universalis\"), German (\"Droemer Verlag\"), Italian (\"Mondadori\"), Hungarian (\"Akademiai Kiado\"), Serbo-Croat (\"Cankarjeva Zalozba\") and in other languages. In the UK it was published by Times Books Limited and in the USA, where it had a huge success, by Hammond, Inc.\n\nFollowing the death of Geoffrey Barraclough in 1984, three other editors have since edited the atlas. The third edition was edited by Norman Stone, then Geoffrey Parker for the fourth, and Richard Overy for the fifth to the present eighth edition. Also, since the fifth edition the atlas was fully updated with digitalized maps and is renamed \"The Times Complete Atlas of World History\", along with its smaller version of \"The Times Compact History of the World\", previously known as \"The Times Concise Atlas of World History\".\n\nEdited by Geoffrey Barraclough\n\nEdited by Norman Stone\n\nEdited by Geoffrey Parker\n\nEdited by Richard Overy as The Times Complete History of the World\n\nIts critical reception was enthusiastic. For example Lord Blake, Provost of the Queen's College, Oxford, called it a \"splendid book\" (source: inside jacket comment) and the \"Whole Earth Catalog\" called it \"the most engrossing new reference book in decades.\" In the latest eighth edition of \"The Times Complete History of the World\", Harvard historian Niall Ferguson stated that the atlas \"conveys a sense not only of time, but also of place\"; while English journalist and presenter Jon Snow commented that \"in the internet age, proof positive that this reference book still has the edge by a considerable margin\".\n"}

Formed in 1999 and reorganized in 2013, the center consists of the Military History Institute (MHI), the Army Heritage Museum (AHM), the Historical Services Division (HSD), Visitor and Education Services (VES), the U.S. Army War College Library, and Collections Management (CM). The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center is part of the United States Army War College, but has its own campus.\n\nThe Heritage and Education Center makes available contemporary and historical materials related to strategic leadership, the global application of Landpower, and U.S. Army Heritage to inform research, educate an international audience, and honor Soldiers, past and present. The USAHEC team strives to:\n\nUse: The premier choice for researching strategic leadership, employment of Landpower, and U.S. Army Heritage\n\nSupport: Actively support the USAWC mission and JIIM team with value-added products and analysis \n\nAcquire: Purchase or accept donations of relevant contemporary and historical materials \n\nHold: Account for, process, maintain, and secure all contemporary and historical materials, digitize where appropriate\n\nEducate: Communicate and make available our holdings in a variety of formats and programs\n\nConserve: Provide long-term care and preservation for contemporary and historical materials using state-of-the-art techniques\n\nThe current research collection contains military history books, military newspapers, technical and field manuals, periodicals, veteran’s surveys, photographs, and transcribes oral histories. The collections include material from as early as the Revolutionary War to current U.S. Army operations. The USAHEC also provides interpretive exhibits and educational outreach programs to foster a greater understanding of the Army's central role in the growth, development and protection of the nation and its way of life. The USAHEC motto is \"Telling the Army story, one Soldier at a time.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army Military History Institute pre-dates the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center by over 30 years. Formed in 1967 as the Military History Research Collection, a branch of the U.S. Army War College Library, the institute became the primary repository for unofficial Army historical materials. Official U.S. Army records and other materials belong to the National Archives. For most of its existence, the institute was housed in Upton Hall on Carlisle Barracks. Built in 1941 as an academic building for the Medical Field Service School, Upton Hall was adequate as a library but ill-suited for the size and preservation needs of a major archive.\n\nSecretary of the Army Louis Caldera formed the Army Heritage and Education Center in June 1999 as a means of bringing an Army museum to Carlisle and promoting the holdings of the institute. His successor Thomas E. White approved the construction of a new facility, the present-day Ridgway Hall, in 2001. He stated:\n\n\"We will relocate its [the institute's] documents and holdings—the unofficial history of the United States Army—into a newly built state-of-the art archive, give that facility responsibility for administering historical documents and photographs Army wide, and associate it with an educational facility and a museum\".\nThe center, including the holdings of the institute, relocated from Upton Hall to Ridgway Hall in 2004, officially opening on September 24. The Army named the building for former Army Chief of Staff General Matthew B. Ridgway (1895–1993), commander of the 82nd Airborne Division in World War II and of United Nations forces in the Korean War.\n\nThe Army Heritage Museum, formed with the center in 1999, held its artifacts mostly in storage in various places on Carlisle Barracks before the construction of its Interim Storage Facility beside Ridgway Hall in 2004.\n\nBy 2005, the center created the Army Heritage Trail and began placing historical markers and large artifacts such as tanks and field artillery on display for public view. The first permanent structures, the Civil War cabins, officially opened in October of that year. The Trail continued to grow and evolve over time, and continues to expand today.\n\nIn 2009, the USAHEC broke ground for the Visitor and Education Center as plans for the growth of the campus continued. In May 2011, the Center opened to the public and serves as the welcome and orientation site for all visitors to the campus. The building features a exhibit space and two multipurpose rooms for conferences and other presentations. Later in the year, the USAHEC opened the state-of-the-art Conservation Facility to house and preserve the U.S. Army's artifact collection. \n\nThe U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center consists of the following buildings: the Visitor and Education Center, Ridgway Hall, the Conservation Facility, and the Fabrication Facility. The campus also includes a one-mile (1.6 km) outdoor Army Heritage Trail. The Trail consists of macro-exhibits showcasing various periods of the U. S. Army’s history.\n\nNamed after Army Chief of Staff General Matthew B. Ridgway (1895–1993), commander of the 82nd Airborne Division in World War II and of United Nations forces in the Korean War, Ridgway Hall opened to the public in 2004. Home of the Military History Institute, the hall holds over 15 million items (books, periodicals, manuscripts, photographs, military publications) on U.S. Army history, covering the Revolutionary War era to current operations. The collections also include one of the largest American Civil War photograph collection in the world. The research facility is open to the public during normal operating hours, and enjoys use by scholars, students, genealogists, and researchers of all kinds.\n\nAlong with a reading room for researchers, the hall also has several small exhibits that display artifacts and photographs from USAHEC holdings. Currently, the Ridgway Hall exhibits include the General Omar Nelson Bradley Memorial Art Gallery, which features rotating art exhibits and an exhibit showcasing the highlights of the USAHEC Collection. The \"Treasures of the USAHEC\" exhibit highlights many types of materials, collected since 1967, which comprise USAHEC's current historical holdings. Objects on display were selected due to their distinctive nature or because they provide a unique perspective on the history of the U.S. Army, as well as what Soldiers found important about themselves, their units, the people they met, and the places where they served. \n\nStaff in Ridgway Hall oversee the cataloging of books and other items, the processing of archival collections, the transcription of oral histories, the writing of research bibliographies and other finding aids, and patron and visitor services.\n\nThe Visitor and Education Center opened in May 2011 to the general public. It serves as the welcome and orientation site for visitors to the facility. The building includes a museum exhibit space, currently featuring \"The Soldier Experience,\" a museum store, and two large multipurpose rooms for conferences and lectures.\n\n\"The Soldier Experience\" is located in the Visitor and Education Center (VEC) of the USAHEC campus and is open during normal business hours. When exploring the gallery, visitors experience the U. S. Army through the eyes of the men and women who lived its history, in war and peace, from the Spanish–American War to current operations. Visitors can stop at the Information Desk to pick up a “dog tag” representing one of six Soldiers whose story is part of the USAHEC collections. Guests use the dog tag to experience Army life as a Soldier does, learning about their Soldier throughout the gallery.\n\nThe exhibit also features artifacts, oral history recordings accessible from your smart phone, a movie theater, and the opportunity to write a letter to a currently serving Soldier. In addition, guests may test their marksmanship at the digital shooting range, parachute in to Normandy as part of the D-Day invasion, and experience a night attack during the Korean War.\n\nThe museum conservation facility holds the Army Heritage Museum's artifacts and serves as the curatorial work space. The Conservation Facility is not open to the public. The building provides state of the art climate controlled storage and contains objects, paper, analytical, and digital laboratories. The staff of the Collections Management team facilitate the development and preservation of the USAHEC collection by acquiring, conserving, and administering historical materials. The team is responsible for the growth and maintenance of the collection to ensure they are relevant and available for usage. The acquisitions section constantly adds new items to the collection through the donation of historical materials. The USAHEC purchases the newest publications and books to add to its extensive library collections.\n\nThe Army Heritage Trail, a one-mile (1.6 km) walking path of outdoor exhibits and markers on various eras in U.S. Army history. Notable exhibits include:\n\nThe Army Heritage Trail is open for visitation dawn to dusk daily. The buildings and structures on the trail are only open when the USAHEC buildings are open.\n\nThe USAHEC hosts many types of history events, including lectures, large and small living history events, workshops, education programs, and more. In past years, the USAHEC has hosted Army Heritage Days in recognition of Armed Forces Day in the United States. The event features re-enactors from all eras of U.S. Army history occupying the Army Heritage Trail, and various displays and demonstrations allow the public to interact with the living historians. Other events have had many different military history themes; in 2009 and 2010 a late-summer event included 18th and 19th century U.S. Army history concentrating on the American Revolution. In 2011, the theme was the sesquicentennial of the first winter of the American Civil War.\n\nThe U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center is supported by a private non-profit foundation, the Army Heritage Center Foundation, which helps the center with development and educational efforts. It oversaw fundraising for the construction of the Visitor and Education Center and is raising funds for the Army Heritage Center Facility.\n\n\n"}

It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum, on loan to the Rijksmuseum.\n\nThe painting shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometers from Utrecht, with a dominating cylindrical windmill, harmonised by the lines of river bank and sails, and the contrasts between light and shadow working together with the intensified concentration of mass and space. The attention to detail is remarkable. Art historian Seymour Slive reports that both from an aeronautical engineering and a hydrological viewpoint the finest levels of details are correct, in the windmill's sails and the river's waves respectively.\n\nIt is not known for certain when Ruisdael painted the \"Windmill\". The painting is not dated, as very few of his works are after 1653. Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely detective work and speculation. It is assumed that it was painted in 1670.\n\nUnlike many other Ruisdaels the \"Windmill\" seems to have remained in Dutch hands. It was acquired by Adriaan van der Hoop at an unknown date, and bequeathed by him to the young Amsterdam Museum in 1854. Since 30 June 1885 it has been lent to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Its enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the \"Windmill\" ranking third after Rembrandt's \"Night Watch\" and Vermeer's \"View of Delft\".\n\nRuisdael's windmill no longer stands, although its foundations can still be seen. Another windmill located a few hundred meters further is often confused with Ruisdael's. This confusion was created when Hofstede de Groot in 1911 wrote about the painting:\n\nThis scene is very similar to other panorama paintings Ruisdael made of other (unidentified) windmills and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape, such as John Constable.\n\n\n"}
