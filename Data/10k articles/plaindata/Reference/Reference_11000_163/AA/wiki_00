It includes universal meta models and localized content for a variety of users with appropriate interfaces built in collaborative mode in multiple languages. This national portal, designed as an \"agricultural Wikipedia\" hosts wide range of agricultural information on a variety of crops, with an aim to empower farmers with crop information.\n\nBacked by Government of India and sponsored by the World Bank through the \"National Agricultural Innovation Project\" of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the open access online resource project was launched on 12 January 2009. Eventually it aims to use weekly alerts from scientists on different crops, to send text messages to farmers across India.\n\nOriginally titled \"Agropedia Indica\", the development of the project was undertaken by team involving various premier institution of India, and spearheaded by Professor Jayantha Chatterjee, of Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). It was initially envisioned by T. V. Prabhakar also of IIT Kanpur, over three years before, who remained its lead architect.\n\nThe project is nurtured under the aegis of the National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) to accelerate technology-led pro-poor growth and diffusion of new technologies for improving agricultural yield and rural livelihood in India. It is a collaborative project of seven consortium partners' viz. \"ICRISAT\"- Hyderabad, \"NAARM- Hyderabad\", \"IIT Kanpur\", \"IIT Bombay\", \"GBPUAT- Pantnagar\", \"UAS- Raichur\" and IIITM-Kerala. ICRISAT is the Consortium coordinator which works as a channel for communication and overall facilitation. IITK develops the software architecture and deploys it complete with user interface.

Discovered in mysterious circumstances in the early twentieth century, the treasure is now divided between the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin, the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.\n\nIn 1909, a large gold hoard from late antiquity was found either at Tomet near Asyut, or at the ancient site of Antinoë, on the eastern bank of the Nile in central Egypt. The exact circumstances of the find remain obscure as the treasure was not excavated by professional archaeologists. The very high quality of the pieces, some of which were embossed with medallions of the Byzantine Emperor, link the Asyut Treasure to the imperial court in Constantinople. The assemblage of gold jewellery was possibly brought from the capital to the supposedly safer environment of Egypt in the early 7th century, before it was hidden there from the Arab invasions in the mid 7th century.\n\nThirty six objects have been attributed to the treasure that range in date from the third to the sixth century. Twelve pieces came to Berlin, including a large bejewelled pectoral, two elaborate necklaces and several pairs of bracelets, all the gift of Friedrich Ludwig von Gans in 1912/13. Six objects were donated in 1916 to the British Museum by Mrs Burns, sister of the philanthropist J Pierpont Morgan. They include a massive body-chain, the largest piece of jewellery known from the early Byzantine period, plus a matching pair of earrings and necklace, and two spiral bracelets in the form of snake. The remainder of the treasure is held by the Metropolitan Museum, many of which were donated by Pierpont Morgan in 1917. It includes one of the most famous pieces – a plain neck ring attached to a frame, set with a large central medallion of a Byzantine emperor with the obverse showing the figure of Constantinopolis seated on a throne. Other pieces in the Met include another gold pectoral set with the semissis of Emperor Maurice Tiberius, and two matching pairs of bracelets.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34037890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34037890", "title": "Bradshaw's Guide", "text": "Bradshaw's Guide\n\nBradshaw's was a series of railway timetables and travel guide books published by W.J. Adams of London. George Bradshaw initiated the series in 1839; after his death in 1853 the \"Bradshaw's\" range of titles continued until 1961.\n\nBradshaw's name was already known as the publisher of \"Bradshaw's Maps of Inland Navigation\", which detailed the canals of Lancashire and Yorkshire, when, on 19 October 1839, soon after the introduction of railways, his Manchester company published the world's first compilation of railway timetables. The cloth-bound book was entitled \"Bradshaw's Railway Time Tables and Assistant to Railway Travelling\" and cost sixpence (p). In 1840 the title was changed to \"Bradshaw's Railway Companion\", and the price raised to one shilling. A new volume was issued at occasional intervals and from time to time a supplement kept this up to date. The original Bradshaw publications were published before the limited introduction of standardised Railway time in November 1840, and its subsequent development into standard time. The accompanying map of all lines in operation (and some \"in progress\") in England and Wales, is cited as being the world's first national railway map.\n\nIn December 1841, acting on a suggestion made by his London agent, William Jones Adams, Bradshaw reduced the price to the original sixpence, and began to issue the guides monthly under the title \"Bradshaw's Monthly Railway Guide\". \nMany railway companies were unhappy with Bradshaw's timetable, but Bradshaw was able to circumvent this by becoming a railway shareholder and by putting his case at company AGMs. Soon the book, in the familiar yellow wrapper, became synonymous with its publisher: for Victorians and Edwardians alike, a railway timetable was \"a Bradshaw\", no matter by which railway company it had been issued, or whether Bradshaw had been responsible for its production or not.\n\nThe eight-page edition of 1841 had grown to 32 pages by 1845 and to 946 pages by 1898 and now included maps, illustrations and descriptions of the main features and historic buildings of the towns served by the railways. In April 1845, the issue number jumped from 40 to 141: the publisher claimed this was an innocent mistake, although it has been speculated as a commercial ploy, where more advertising revenue could be generated by making it look longer-established than it really was. Whatever the reason for the change, the numbering continued from 141.\n\nWhen in 1865 \"Punch\" praised Bradshaw's publications, it stated that \"seldom has the gigantic intellect of man been employed upon a work of greater utility.\" \nAt last, some order had been imposed on the chaos that had been created by some 150 rail companies whose tracks criss-crossed the country and whose largely uncoordinated network was rapidly expanding. \nBradshaw minutely recorded all changes and became the standard manual for rail travel well into the 20th century.\n\nBy 1918 Bradshaw's guide had risen in price to two shillings (10p) and by 1937 to half a crown (12½p). Although historic money values are difficult to calculate, this would have been equivalent to perhaps £6.00 at 2009 values.\n\nBradshaw's timetables became less necessary from 1923, when more than 100 surviving companies were \"grouped\" into the Big Four. This change reduced dramatically the range and number of individual timetables produced by the companies themselves. They now published a much smaller number of substantial compilations which between them covered the country.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1939 three of the Big Four transferred their timetable production to Bradshaw's publisher Henry Blacklock & Co., and most of the official company timetables therefore became reprints of the relevant pages from Bradshaw. Only the Great Western Railway retained its own format.\n\nBetween the two world wars, the verb 'to Bradshaw' was a derogatory term used in the Royal Air Force to refer to pilots who could not navigate well, perhaps related to a perceived lack of ability shown by those who navigated by following railway lines.\n\nWhen the railways were nationalised in 1948, five of the six British Railways Regions followed the companies' example by using Blacklock to produce their timetable books, but production was eventually moved to other publishers. This change must have reduced Blacklock's revenue substantially. Parts of Bradshaw's guide began to be reset in the newer British Railways style from 1955, but modernisation of the whole volume was never completed. By 1961 Bradshaw cost 12s 6d (62½p), and a complete set of BR Regional timetables could be bought for 6s (30p).\n\nThe conclusion was inevitable, and the last edition, No. 1521, was dated May 1961. The \"Railway Magazine\" of that month printed a valedictory article by Charles E. Lee.\n\nReprints of various Bradshaw's guides have been produced.\n\n19th-century and early 20th-century novelists make frequent references to a character's \"Bradshaw\". Dickens refers it in his short story \"The Portrait-Painter's Story\" (1861). In \"Around the World in 80 Days\", Phileas Fogg carries a Bradshaw. In W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Book Bag\" the narrator states \"I would sooner read the catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores or Bradshaw's Guide than nothing at all, and indeed have spent many delightful hours over both these works\"\n\nCrime writers were fascinated with trains and timetables, especially as a new source of alibis. Examples are Ronald Knox's \"The Footsteps at the Lock\" (1928) and novels by Freeman Wills Crofts. One mention is by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Valley of Fear\": \"the vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited.\" Other references include another Sherlock Holmes story, \"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\"; Lewis Carroll's long poem \"Phantasmagoria\"; and Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", which makes note of Count Dracula reading an \"English Bradshaw's Guide\" as part of his planning for his voyage to England. In the 1866 comic opera \"Cox and Box\", the following exchange takes place: \n\nThere is also a reference in \"Death in the Clouds\" (1935) by Agatha Christie: \"Mr Clancy, writer of detective stories ... extracted a Continental Bradshaw from his raincoat pocket ... to work out a complicated alibi.\" Bradshaw is also mentioned in her \"The Secret Adversary\". In Daphne du Maurier's \"Rebecca\" (1938), the second Mrs de Winter observes that \"Some people have a vice of reading Bradshaws. They plan innumerable journeys across country for the fun of linking up impossible connections.\" (chapter 2). Another reference is in an aside in \"Riddle of the Sands\" (1903) by Erskine Childers: \"... an extraordinary book, Bradshaw, turned to from habit, even when least wanted, as men fondle guns and rods in the close season.\"\n\nIn G. K. Chesterton's \"The Man Who Was Thursday\", the protagonist Gabriel Syme praises Bradshaw as a poet of order: \"No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I say!\" In Max Beerbohm's \"Zuleika Dobson\" (1911), a satirical fantasy of Oxford undergraduates, a Bradshaw is listed as one of the two books in the \"library\" of the irresistible Zuleika.\n\nBradshaw is mentioned in modern novels with a period setting, and in Philip Pullman's \"The Shadow in the North\" (Sally Lockhart Quartet).\n\nIn Jerome K. Jerome's 1891 novel \"Diary of a Pilgrimage\", an aside called A Faithful Bradshaw is contained. This section describes a comical incident where the author gets always misled by referring to outdated guides.\n\nIn June 1847 the first number of \"Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide\" was issued, giving the timetables of the Continental railways. It grew to over 1,000 pages, including timetables, guidebook and hotel directory. It was discontinued in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Briefly resurrected in the interwar years, it saw its final edition in 1939. The 1913 edition was republished in September 2012.\n\nIn December 2007, the Middleton Press took advantage of Network Rail's willingness to grant third-party publishers the right to print paper versions of the National Rail timetable. Network Rail had discontinued official hard copies in favour of PDF editions, which could be downloaded without charge.\n\nAs a tribute to Bradshaw, Middleton Press named its timetables the \"Bradshaw-Mitchell's Rail Times\". A competing edition reproduced from Network Rail's artwork, is published by TSO, This is a same-size reproduction of the Network Rail artwork, although the size is only about 70% in the Middleton Press versions to reduce the page count. A third publisher, UK Rail Timetables, The main timetable for Indian Railways is still known as the \"Newman Indian Bradshaw\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7260105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7260105", "title": "Chinese dictionary", "text": "Chinese dictionary\n\nChinese dictionaries date back over two millennia to the Han Dynasty, which is a significantly longer lexicographical history than any other language. There are hundreds of dictionaries for the Chinese language, and this article introduces some of the most important.\n\nThe Chinese language has two words for dictionary: \"zidian\" (character/logograph dictionary) for written forms, that is, Chinese characters, and \"cidian\" (word/phrase dictionary), for spoken forms.\n\nFor character dictionaries, \"zidian\" () combines \"zi\" ( \"character, graph; letter, script, writing; word\") and \"dian\" ( \"dictionary, encyclopedia; standard, rule; statute, canon; classical allusion\").\n\nFor word dictionaries, \"cidian\" is interchangeably written (/辞典; \"cídiǎn\"; \"tzʻŭ²-tien³\"; \"word dictionary\") or (/词典; \"cídiǎn\"; \"tzʻŭ²-tien³\"; \"word dictionary\"); using \"cí\" (; \"word, speech; phrase, expression; diction, phraseology; statement; a kind of poetic prose; depart; decline; resign\"), and its graphic variant \"cí\" (; \"word, term; expression, phrase; speech, statement; part of speech; a kind of tonal poetry\"). \"Zidian\" is a much older and more common word than \"cidian\", and Yang (1985:xxii) notes \"zidian\" is often \"used for both 'character dictionary' and 'word dictionary'.\"\n\nThe precursors of Chinese dictionaries are primers designed for students of Chinese characters. The earliest of them only survive in fragments or quotations within Chinese classic texts. For example, the \"Shizhoupian\" was compiled by one or more historians in the court of King Xuan of Zhou (r. 827 BCE – 782 BCE), and was the source of the 籀文 zhòuwén variant forms listed in the Han Dynasty Shuowen Jiezi dictionary. The \"Cangjiepian\" \"Chapters of Cang Jie\"), named after the legendary inventor of writing, was edited by Li Si, and helped to standardize the Small seal script during the Qin Dynasty.\n\nThe collation or lexicographical ordering of a dictionary generally depends upon its writing system. For a language written in an alphabet or syllabary, dictionaries are usually ordered alphabetically. Samuel Johnson defined \"dictionary\" as \"a book containing the words of any language in alphabetical order, with explanations of their meaning\" in his dictionary. But Johnson's definition cannot be applied to the Chinese dictionaries, as Chinese is written in characters or logograph, not alphabets. To Johnson, not having an alphabet is not to the Chinese's credit, as in 1778, when James Boswell asked about the Chinese characters, he replied (Boswell 1907:822) \"Sir, they have not an alphabet. They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed.\" Nevertheless, the Chinese made their dictionaries, and developed three original systems for lexicographical ordering: semantic categories, graphic components, and pronunciations.\n\nThe first system of dictionary organization is by semantic categories. The circa 3rd-century BCE \"Erya\" (爾雅 \"Approaching Correctness\") is the oldest extant Chinese dictionary, and scholarship reveals that it is a pre-Qin compilation of glosses to classical texts. It contains lists of synonyms arranged into 19 semantic categories (e.g., \"Explaining Plants\", \"Explaining Trees\"). The Han Dynasty dictionary \"Xiao Erya\" (小爾雅 \"Little Erya\") reduces these 19 to 13 chapters. The early 3rd century CE \"Guangya\" (廣雅 \"Expanded Erya\"), from the Northern Wei Dynasty, followed the \"Erya\"s original 19 chapters. The circa 1080 CE \"Piya\" (埤雅 \"Increased Erya\"), from the Song Dynasty, has 8 semantically-based chapters of names for plants and animals. For a dictionary user wanting to look up a character, this arbitrary semantic system is inefficient unless one already knows, or can guess, the meaning.\n\nTwo other Han Dynasty lexicons are loosely organized by semantics. The 1st century CE \"Fangyan\" (方言 \"Regional Speech\") is the world's oldest known dialectal dictionary. The circa 200 CE \"Shiming\" (釋名 \"Explaining Names\") employs paranomastic glosses to define words.\n\nThe second system of dictionary organization is by recurring graphic components or radicals. The famous 100–121 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (說文解字 \"Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters\") arranged characters through a system of 540 \"bushou\" (部首 \"section header\") radicals. The 543 CE \"Yupian\" (玉篇 \"Jade Chapters\"), from the Liang Dynasty, rearranged them into 542. The 1615 CE \"Zihui\" (字彙 \"Character Glossary\"), edited by Mei Yingzuo (梅膺祚) during the Ming Dynasty, simplified the 540 \"Shuowen Jiezi\" radicals to 214. It also originated the \"radical-stroke\" scheme of ordering characters on the number of residual graphic strokes besides the radical. The 1627 \"Zhengzitong\" (正字通 \"Correct Character Mastery\") also used 214. The 1716 CE \"Kangxi Zidian\" (康熙字典 \"Kangxi Dictionary\"), compiled under the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, became the standard dictionary for Chinese characters, and popularized the system of 214 radicals. As most Chinese characters are semantic-phonetic ones (形聲字), the radical method is usually effective, thus it continues to be widely used in the present day. However, sometimes the radical of a character is not obvious. To compensate this, a \"Chart of Characters that Are Difficult to Look up\" (難檢字表), arranged by the number of strokes of the characters, is usually provided.\n\nThe third system of lexicographical ordering is by character pronunciation. This type of dictionary collates its entries by syllable rime and tones, and comprises the so-called \"rime dictionary\". The first surviving rime dictionary is the 601 CE \"Qieyun\" (切韻 \"Cutting [Spelling] Rimes\") from the Sui Dynasty; it became the standard of pronunciation for Middle Chinese. During the Song Dynasty, it was expanded into the 1011 CE \"Guangyun\" (廣韻 \"Expanded Rimes\") and the 1037 CE \"Jiyun\" (集韻 \"Collected Rimes\").\n\nThe clear problem with these old phonetically arranged dictionary is that the would-be user needs to have the knowledge of rime. Thus, dictionaries collated this way can only serve the literati.\n\nA great number of modern dictionaries published today arrange their entries by pinyin or other methods of romanisation, together with a radicals index. Some of these pinyin dictionaries also contain indices of the characters arranged by number and order of strokes, by the four corner encoding (四角碼) or by the cangjie encoding (倉頡碼).\n\nSome dictionaries employ more than one of these three methods of collation. For example, the \"Longkan Shoujian\" (龍龕手鑑) of the Liao Dynasty uses radicals, which are grouped by tone. The characters under each radical are also grouped by tone.\n\nBesides categorizing ancient Chinese dictionaries by their methods of collation, they can also be classified by their functions. In the traditional bibliographic divisions of the imperial collection \"Siku Quanshu\", the \"Xiaoxuelei\" (小學類 \"Category of Minor Studies\", which includes books on philology and \"pre-modern linguistics\") subdivides dictionaries into three types: \"Xungu\" (訓詁 \"exegesis\"), \"Zishu\" (字書 \"character book\") and \"Yunshu\" (韻書 \"rime book\").\n\nThe \"Xungu\" type comprises \"Erya\" and its descendants. These exegetical dictionaries focus on explaining meanings of words as found in the Chinese classics.\n\nThe \"Zishu\" dictionaries comprise \"Shuowen Jiezi\", \"Yupian\", \"Zihui\", \"Zhengzitong\", and \"Kangxi Zidian\". This type of dictionary, which focuses on the shape and structure of the characters, subsumes both \"orthography dictionaries\", such as the \"Ganlu Zishu\" (干祿字書) of the Tang Dynasty, and \"script dictionaries\", such as the \"Liyun\" (隸韻) of the Song Dynasty. Although these dictionaries center upon the graphic properties of Chinese characters, they do not necessarily collate characters by radical. For instance, \"Liyun\" is a clerical script dictionary collated by tone and rime.\n\nThe \"Yunshu\" type focuses on the pronunciations of characters. These dictionaries are always collated by rimes.\n\nWhile the above traditional pre-20th-century Chinese dictionaries focused upon the meanings and pronunciations of words in classical texts, they practically ignored the spoken language and vernacular literature.\n\nThe \"Kangxi Zidian\" served as the standard Chinese dictionary for generations, is still published and is now online. Contemporary lexicography is divisible between bilingual and monolingual Chinese dictionaries.\n\nThe foreigners who entered China in late Ming and Qing Dynasties needed dictionaries for different purposes than native speakers. Wanting to learn Chinese, they compiled the first grammar books and bilingual dictionaries. Westerners adapted the Latin alphabet to represent Chinese pronunciation, and arranged their dictionaries accordingly.\n\nTwo Bible translators edited early Chinese dictionaries. The Scottish missionary Robert Morrison wrote A Dictionary of the Chinese Language (1815–1823). The British missionary Walter Henry Medhurst wrote a Hokkien (Min Nan) dialect dictionary (1832) and the \"Chinese and English Dictionary\" (1842). Both were flawed in their representation of pronunciations, such as aspirated stops. The British philologist and diplomat Samuel Wells Williams applied the method of dialect comparison in his dictionary (1874), and refined distinctions in articulation. The American missionary and diplomat Samuel Wells Williams compiled the (1874) \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\", which gave variant regional pronunciations in addition to standard Peking pronunciation.\n\nThe British consular officer and linguist Herbert Giles criticized Williams as \"the lexicographer not for the future but of the past\" (Wilkinson 2013: 85), and took nearly twenty years to compile his \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1892, 1912), one that Norman (1988:173) calls \"the first truly adequate Chinese–English dictionary\". It contained 13,848 characters and numerous compound expressions, with pronunciation based upon Beijing Mandarin, which it compared with nine southern dialects such as Cantonese, Hakka, and Fuzhou dialect. It has been called \"still interesting as a repository of late Qing documentary Chinese, although there is little or no indication of the citations, mainly from the Kangxi zidian.\" (Wilkinson 2013: 85.) Giles modified the Chinese romanization system of Thomas Francis Wade to create the Wade-Giles system, which was standard in English speaking countries until 1979 when pinyin was adopted. The Giles dictionary was replaced by the 1931 dictionary of the Australian missionary Robert Henry Mathews. \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\", which was popular for decades, was based on Giles and partially updated by Y.R. Chao in 1943 and reprinted in 1960. (Wilkinson, 2013: 85)\n\nTrained in American structural linguistics, Yuen Ren Chao and Lien-sheng Yang wrote a \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" (1947), that emphasized the spoken rather than the written language. Main entries were listed in Gwoyeu Romatzyh, and they distinguished free morphemes from bound morphemes. A hint of non-standard pronunciation was also given, by marking final stops and initial voicing and non-palatalization in non-Mandarin dialects.\n\nThe Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren wrote the seminal (1957) \"Grammata Serica Recensa\" with his reconstructed pronunciations for Middle Chinese and Old Chinese.\n\nChinese lexicography advanced during the 1970s. The translator Lin Yutang wrote the semantically sophisticated \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" (1972) that is now available online. The author Liang Shih-Chiu edited two full-scale dictionaries: Chinese-English (Liang and Fang 1971) with over 8,000 characters and 100,000 entries, and English-Chinese (Liang 1975) with over 160,000 entries.\n\nThe linguist and professor of Chinese, John DeFrancis edited a groundbreaking Chinese–English dictionary (1996) giving more than 196,000 words or terms alphabetically arranged in a single-tier pinyin order. The user can therefore in a straightforward way find a term whose pronunciation is known rather than searching by radical or character structure, the latter being a 2-tiered approach. This project had long been advocated by another pinyin proponent, Victor H. Mair in his The Need for an Alphabetically Arranged General Usage Dictionary of Mandarin Chinese (1986).\n\nWhen the Republic of China began in 1912, educators and scholars recognized the need to update the 1716 \"Kangxi Zidian\". It was thoroughly revised in the (1915) \"Zhonghua Da Zidian\" (中華大字典 \"Comprehensive Chinese-Character Dictionary\"), which corrected over 4,000 \"Kangxi Zidian\" mistakes and added more than 1,000 new characters. Lu Erkui's (1915) \"Ciyuan\" (辭源 \"Sources of Words\") was a groundbreaking effort in Chinese lexicography and can be considered the first \"cidian\" \"word dictionary\".\n\nShu Xincheng's (1936) \"Cihai\" (辭海 \"Sea of Words\") was a comprehensive dictionary of characters and expressions, and provided near-encyclopedic coverage in fields like science, philosophy, history. The \"Cihai\" remains a popular dictionary and has been frequently revised.\n\nThe (1937) \"Guoyu cidian\" (國語辭典 \"Dictionary of the National Language\") was a four-volume dictionary of words, designed to standardize modern pronunciation. The main entries were characters listed phonologically by Zhuyin Fuhao and Gwoyeu Romatzyh. For example, the title in these systems is ㄍㄨㄛㄩ ㄘㄉ一ㄢ and Gwoyeu tsyrdean.\n\nWei Jiangong's (1953) \"Xinhua Zidian\" (新华字典 \"New China Character Dictionary\") is a pocket-sized reference, alphabetically arranged by pinyin. It is the world's most popular reference work (Xinhua 2004). The 11th edition was published in 2011.\n\nLu Shuxiang's (1973) \"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\" (现代汉语词典 \"Contemporary Chinese Dictionary\") is a middle-sized dictionary of words. It is arranged by characters, alphabetized by pinyin, which list compounds and phrases, with a total 56,000 entries (expanded to 70,000 in the 2016 edition). Both the \"Xinhua zidian\" and the \"Xiandai Hanyu cidian\" followed a simplified scheme of 189 radicals.\n\nTwo outstanding achievements in contemporary Chinese lexicography are the (1986–93) \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" (漢語大詞典 \"Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words\") with over 370,000 word and phrase entries listed under 23,000 different characters; and the (1986–89) \"Hanyu Da Zidian\" (漢語大字典 \"Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Characters\") with 54,678 head entries for characters. They both use a system of 200 radicals.\n\nIn recent years, the computerization of Chinese has allowed lexicographers to create \"dianzi cidian\" (電子詞典/电子词典 \"electronic dictionaries\") usable on computers, PDAs, etc. There are proprietary systems, such as Wenlin Software for learning Chinese, and there are also free dictionaries available online. After Paul Denisowski started the volunteer CEDICT (Chinese–English dictionary) project in 1997, it has grown into a standard reference database. The CEDICT is the basis for many Internet dictionaries of Chinese, and is included in the Unihan Database.\n\nChinese publishing houses print diverse types of \"zhuanke cidian\" (專科詞典/专科词典 \"specialized dictionary\"). One Chinese dictionary bibliography (Mathis et al. 1982) lists over 130 subject categories, from \"Abbreviations, Accounting\" to \"Veterinary, Zoology.\" The following examples are limited to specialized dictionaries from a few representative fields.\n\nDictionaries of Ancient Chinese give definitions, in Modern Chinese, of characters and words found in the pre-Modern (before 1911) Chinese literature. They are typically organized by \"pinyin\" or by \"Zihui\" radicals, and give definitions in order of antiquity (most ancient to most recent) when several definitions exist. Quotes from the literature exemplifying each listed meaning are given. Quotes are usually chosen from the pre-Han Classical literature when possible, unless the definition emerged during the post-Classical period. Dictionaries intended for historians, linguists, and other classical scholars will sometimes also provide Middle Chinese \"fanqie\" readings and/or Old Chinese rime groups, as well as bronze script or oracle bone script forms.\n\nWhile dictionaries published in Mainland China intended for study or reference by high school/college students are generally printed in Simplified Chinese, dictionaries intended for scholarly research are set in Traditional Chinese. \n\nTwenty centuries ago, the \"Fangyan\" was the first Chinese specialized dictionary. The usual English translation for \"fangyan\" (方言 lit. \"regional/areal speech\") is \"dialect\", but the language situation in China is uniquely complex. In the \"dialect\" sense of English dialects, Chinese has Mandarin dialects, yet \"fangyan\" also means \"non-Mandarin languages, mutually unintelligible regional varieties of Chinese\", such as Cantonese and Hakka. Some linguists like John DeFrancis prefer the translation \"topolect\". Here are some general \"fangyan cidian\" (方言词典 \"topolect dictionary\") examples.\n\nChinese has five words translatable as \"idiom\": \"chengyu\" (成語/成语 \"set phrase; idiom\"), \"yanyu\" (諺語/谚语 proverb; popular saying, maxim; idiom\"), \"xiehouyu\" (歇後語/歇后语 \"truncated witticism, aposiopesis; enigmatic folk simile\"), \"xiyu\" (習語/习语 \"idiom\"), and \"guanyongyu\" (慣用語/惯用语 \"fixed expression; idiom; locution\"). Some modern dictionaries for idioms are:\n\nThe Chinese language adopted a few foreign \"wailaici\" (外來詞/外来词 \"loanwords\") during the Han Dynasty, especially after Zhang Qian's exploration of the Western Regions. The lexicon absorbed many Buddhist terms and concepts when Chinese Buddhism began to flourish in the Southern and Northern Dynasties. During the late 19th century, when Western powers forced open China's doors, numerous loanwords entered Chinese, many through the Japanese language. While some foreign borrowings became obsolete, others became indispensable terms in modern vocabulary. \n\nThe 20th century saw the rapid progress of the studies of the lexicons found in the Chinese vernacular literature, which includes novels, dramas and poetry. Important works in the field include: \n\nEmploying corpus linguistics and lists of Chinese characters arranged by frequency of usage (e.g., \"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese)\", lexicographers have compiled dictionaries for learners of Chinese as a foreign language. These specialized Chinese dictionaries are available either as add-ons to existing publications like Yuan (2004) and Wenlin or as specific ones like \n\n\n\n"}

It was released in October 1971 as the second single and title track from the album \"Coat of Many Colors\".\n\nShe composed the song in 1969, while traveling with Porter Wagoner on a tour bus. (She explained in her 1994 memoir, \"My Life and Other Unfinished Business\", because she could find no paper, as the song came to her, she wrote it on the back of a dry cleaning receipt from one of Wagoner's suits; when the song became a hit, Wagoner had the receipt framed.) She recorded the song in April 1971, making it the title song for her\" Coat of Many Colors\" album. The song reached #4 on the U.S. country singles charts.\n\nThe song tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. As she sewed, she told her child the biblical story of Joseph and his Coat of Many Colors. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes\", rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags. \n\nAnd oh I did not understand it, for I felt I was rich<br>And I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch<br>And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed<br>And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes\n\nThe song concludes with Parton singing the moral of her story:But they didn't understand it, and I tried to make them see<br>One is only poor, only if they choose to be<br>Now I know we had no money, but I was rich as I could be<br>In my coat of many colors my momma made for me\n\nOn the original LP release of the 1975 compilation \"Best of Dolly Parton\", the printed lyrics to the song appeared in the inner gatefold of the album, including a final verse that has never been included on any of Parton's recordings of the song:\n\nDolly says the original coat was used for various other purposes but her mother did make a new one to use on display in her Chasing Rainbows Museum at Dollywood. (Wagoner also donated the framed dry cleaning receipt on which Parton composed the song to the museum, where it now hangs.)\n\nShania Twain recorded a cover version of the song on the 2003 Parton tribute album \"\", with accompaniment by Alison Krauss and Union Station. This version peaked at #57 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart based only on unsolicited airplay. Other cover versions include a 1976 recording by Emmylou Harris on her Reprise Records debut, \"Pieces of the Sky\", and a recording by Eva Cassidy released on the 2008 posthumous collection, \"Somewhere\". Scottish comedian Billy Connolly recorded a version in 1975 on his album \"Get Right Intae Him\" (Unicorn Artists). This was a serious version unlike his comical song \"D.I.V.O.R.C.E.\" which parodied \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\", made popular by Tammy Wynette and also covered by Parton. Melinda Schneider and Beccy Cole covered the song on their album \"Great Women of Country\" (2014).\n\nIn 2005, \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" ranked \"Coat of Many Colors\" number 10 on its list of 100 Songs of the South. A 1996 children's picture book of the song, with illustrations by Judith Sutton, was published by Harpercollins Children's Books. In 2008, Kristy Lee Cook performed this song on \"American Idol\" during Dolly Parton Week. \n\nIn 2011 Parton's recording was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that \"are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.\"\n\nA TV movie was broadcast in December 2015 by NBC, with Alyvia Alyn Lind as young Dolly. Lind reprised her role as young Dolly in the 2016 television movie sequel \"Christmas of Many Colors\".\n\n"}

{"id": "80150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80150", "title": "Dynamic DNS", "text": "Dynamic DNS\n\nDynamic DNS (DDNS or DynDNS) is a method of automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name System (DNS), often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.\n\nThe term is used to describe two different concepts. The first is \"dynamic DNS updating\" which refers to systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing. These mechanisms are explained in RFC 2136, and use the TSIG mechanism to provide security. The second kind of dynamic DNS permits lightweight and immediate updates often using an update client, which do not use the RFC2136 standard for updating DNS records. These clients provide a persistent addressing method for devices that change their location, configuration or IP address frequently.\n\nIn the initial stages of the Internet (ARPANET) addressing of hosts on the network was achieved by static translation tables that mapped hostnames to IP addresses. The tables were maintained manually in form of the host file. The Domain Name System brought a method of distributing the same address information automatically online through recursive queries to remote databases configured for each network, or domain. Even this DNS facility still used static lookup tables at each participating node. IP addresses, once assigned to a particular host, rarely changed and the mechanism was initially sufficient. However, the rapid growth of the Internet and the proliferation of personal computers in the workplace and in homes created the substantial burden for administrators of keeping track of assigned IP addresses and managing their address space. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allowed enterprises and Internet service providers (ISPs) to assign addresses to computers automatically as they powered up. In addition, this helped conserve the address space available, since not all devices might be actively used at all times and addresses could be assigned as needed. This feature required that DNS servers be kept current automatically as well. The first implementations of \"dynamic DNS\" fulfilled this purpose: Host computers gained the feature to notify their respective DNS server of the address they had received from a DHCP server or through self-configuration. This protocol-based DNS update method was documented and standardized in IETF publication RFC 2136 in 1997 and has become a standard part of the DNS protocol (see also nsupdate program).\n\nThe explosive growth and proliferation of the Internet into homes brought a growing shortage of available IP addresses. DHCP became an important tool for ISPs as well to manage their address spaces for connecting home and small-business end-users with a single IP address each by implementing network address translation (NAT) at the customer-premises router. The private network behind these routers uses address space set aside for these purposes (RFC 1918), masqueraded by the NAT device. This, however, broke the end-to-end principle of Internet architecture and methods were required to allow private networks, with frequently changing external IP addresses, to discover their public address and insert it into the Domain Name System in order to participate in Internet communications properly. Today, numerous providers, called \"Dynamic DNS\" service providers, offer such technology and services on the Internet.\n\nDNS is based on a distributed database that takes some time to update globally. When DNS was first introduced, the database was small and could be easily maintained by hand. As the system grew this task became difficult for any one site to handle, and a new management structure was introduced to spread out the updates among many domain name registrars. Registrars today offer end-user updating to their account information, typically using a web-based form, and the registrar then pushes out update information to other DNS servers.\n\nDue to the distributed nature of the DNS systems and its registrars, updates to the global DNS system may take hours to distribute. Thus DNS is only suitable for services that do not change their IP address very often, as is the case for most large services like Wikipedia. Smaller services, however, are generally much more likely to move from host to host over shorter periods of time. Servers being run on certain types of Internet service provider, cable modems in particular, are likely to change their IP address over very short periods of time, on the order of days or hours.\n\nDynamic DNS is a system that addresses the problem of rapid updates. The term is used in two ways, which, while technically similar, have very different purposes and user populations. The first is \"standards-based DNS updates\", which uses an extension of the DNS protocol to ask for an update; this is often used for company laptops to register their address. The second is usually a web-based protocol, normally a single HTTP fetch with username and password which then updates some DNS records (by some unspecified method); this is commonly used for a domestic computer to register itself by a publicly-known name in order to be found by a wider group, for example as a games server or webcam.\n\nEnd users of Internet access receive an allocation of IP addresses, often only a single address, by their Internet service provider. The assigned addresses may either be fixed (i.e. static), or may change from time to time, a situation called \"dynamic\". Dynamic addresses are generally given only to residential customers and small businesses, as most enterprises specifically require static addresses.\n\nDynamic IP addresses present a problem if the customer wants to provide a service to other users on the Internet, such as a web service. As the IP address may change frequently, corresponding domain names must be quickly re-mapped in the DNS, to maintain accessibility using a well-known URL.\n\nMany providers offer commercial or free Dynamic DNS service for this scenario. The automatic reconfiguration is generally implemented in the user's router or computer, which runs software to update the DDNS service. The communication between the user's equipment and the provider is not standardized, although a few standard web-based methods of updating have emerged over time.\n\nThe standardized method of dynamically updating domain name server records is prescribed by RFC 2136, commonly known as dynamic DNS update. The method described by RFC 2136 is a network protocol for use with managed DNS servers, and it includes a security mechanism. RFC 2136 supports all DNS record types, but often it is used only as an extension of the DHCP system, and in which the authorized DHCP servers register the client records in the DNS. This form of support for RFC 2136 is provided by a plethora of client and server software, including those that are components of most current operating systems. Support for RFC 2136 is also an integral part of many directory services, including LDAP and Windows' Active Directory domains.\n\nIn Microsoft Windows networks, dynamic DNS is an integral part of Active Directory, because domain controllers register their network service types in DNS so that other computers in the domain (or forest) can access them.\n\nIncreasing efforts to secure Internet communications today involve encryption of all dynamic updates via the public Internet, as these public dynamic DNS services have been abused increasingly to design security breaches. Standards-based methods within the DNSSEC protocol suite, such as TSIG, have been developed to secure DNS updates, but are not widely in use. Microsoft developed alternative technology (GSS-TSIG) based on Kerberos authentication.\n\nSome free DNS server software systems, such as dnsmasq, support a dynamic update procedure that directly involves a built-in DHCP server. This server automatically updates or adds the DNS records as it assigns addresses, relieving the administrator of the task of specifically configuring dynamic updates.\n\nDynamic DNS providers offer a software client program that automates the discovery and registration of the client system's public IP addresses. The client program is executed on a computer or device in the private network. It connects to the DDNS provider's systems with a unique login name; the provider uses the name to link the discovered public IP address of the home network with a hostname in the domain name system. Depending on the provider, the hostname is registered within a domain owned by the provider, or within the customer's own domain name. These services can function by a number of mechanisms. Often they use an HTTP service request since even restrictive environments usually allow HTTP service. The provider might use RFC 2136 to update the DNS servers.\n\nMany home networking modem/routers include client applications in their firmware, compatible with a variety of DDNS providers.\n\nDynamic DNS is an expected feature or even requirement for IP-based security appliances like DVRs and IP cameras. Many options are available for today's manufacturer, and these include the use of existing DDNS services or the use of custom services hosted by the manufacturer themselves.\n\nIn almost all cases, a simple HTTP based update API is used as it allows for easy integration of a DDNS client into a device's firmware. There are several pre-made tools that can help to ease the burden of server and client development, like MintDNS, cURL and Inadyn. Most web-based DDNS services use a standard user name and password security schema. This requires that a user first create an account at the DDNS server website and then configure their device to send updates to the DDNS server whenever an IP address change is detected.\n\nSome device manufacturers go a step further by only allowing their DDNS Service to be used by the devices they manufacture, and also eliminate the need for user names and passwords altogether. Generally this is accomplished by encrypting the device's MAC address using an cryptographic algorithm kept secret on both the DDNS server and within the device's firmware. The resulting decryption or decryption failure is used to secure or deny updates. Resources for the development of custom DDNS services are generally limited and involve a full software development cycle to design and field a secure and robust DDNS server.\n\n"}

Originally named \"Ukiah\" to commemorate the railway's recent extension into the City of Ukiah, the boat was built by the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad Company at their Tiburon yard. \"Eureka\" has been designated a National Historic Landmark and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 1973. \n\nIt is the largest existing wooden ship in the world.\n\nThe ship originally carried people between San Francisco and Tiburon during the day and hauled railroad freight cars at night. In 1907, \"Ukiah\" was re-routed to the Sausalito–San Francisco Ferry Building route by its new owners, Northwestern Pacific Railroad.\n\nAs automobiles became more common, motorists wanted to \"drive across the bay\". Since there were no bridges on San Francisco Bay at the time, \"Ukiah\" was able to meet this demand via a refitted lower deck designed to handle vehicles. The deck above (also enclosed) was expanded for passengers.\n\nDuring World War I, \"Ukiah\" carried munition-filled rail cars for the war effort. Overloading of the ship caused hull strains so severe that the government paid for complete rebuilding of the ship. Shipwrights at the Southern Pacific yard labored for two years—eventually replacing all of its structure above the waterline. This kind of reconstruction was called \"jacking up the whistle and sliding a new boat underneath.\" The refurbished ferry was christened \"Eureka\" in honor of the Northern California city, which also happened to be the new northern termination of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad.\n\nAs a passenger ferry, she could carry 2,300 passengers and 120 automobiles. At that time, she was the biggest and the fastest double-ended passenger ferry boat in the world— long, with an extreme width of and gross tonnage of 2,420 tons.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1941 \"Eureka\" was on the Sausalito commuter run. As the largest of the Northwestern boats, \"Eureka\" made the heaviest commuter trips - the 7:30 from Sausalito and the 5:15 from San Francisco. Each trip averaged 2,200 passengers. During this period the upper deck included seating areas, a magazine stand, and a restaurant that served full meals.\n\nEureka was primarily a passenger boat, carrying very few cars. After 1929, though, she sometimes made an extra run from the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco, carrying autos on Sundays.\n\nCompletion of the Golden Gate Bridge between San Francisco and Marin in 1937 doomed ferry service. Northwestern Pacific first cut service, then abandoned ferries altogether in 1941.\n\nDuring the war years, \"Eureka\" joined a number of bay ferries in the work of transporting troops from Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California, up the Sacramento River, to the Port of Embarkation piers in San Francisco.\n\nBy the 1950s \"Eureka\" served by linking Southern Pacific's cross-country trains, which terminated at Oakland, with San Francisco until 1957, when she snapped an engine crank pin. That service was discontinued the following year. In 1958, \"Eureka\" joined the fleet of historic ships now at the National Historical Park.\n\nIn the late 1990s she was used as a main filming location for the TV-show \"Nash Bridges\".\n\nIn October 1999, Eureka entered San Francisco Drydock for a $1 million restoration project focusing on the vessel's superstructure—the above-water portions of the vessel. A significant portion of that restoration was the replacement of the boat's \"kingposts\"--four large wooden structures that support the paddlewheels and upper decks.\n\nAlthough a number of large ferryboats survive in the US, \"Eureka\" is the only one with a wooden hull. She is one of the most impressive remaining examples of traditional American wooden shipbuilding.\n\nBeneath her upperworks, the round-bottomed hull is wide and long. The house rests on a platform extending from the hull on either side. \n\nHer walking beam engine was originally powered by coal-fired boilers that were converted to oil in 1905. The engine was built in 1890 by the Fulton Iron Works in San Francisco. It is the only walking beam engine in the United States preserved in a floating vessel.\n\nWith the increased length of , \"Eureka\" became the largest wooden passenger ferry ever built. She was certified to carry 3,500 people.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "167360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167360", "title": "Fantômas", "text": "Fantômas\n\nFantômas () is a fictional character created by French writers Marcel Allain (1885–1969) and Pierre Souvestre (1874–1914).\n\nOne of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction, Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from Gothic novel villains of the 19th century to modern-day serial killers.\n\nThe books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of Hollywood, in two respects: First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their \"working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter.\" This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the film studio could produce sequels reliably.\n\nThe popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by André Hunebelle in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1963 with Fantômas, departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone, and by making Fantômas (played by Jean Marais) more of a James Bond enemy. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.\n\nFantômas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Schütt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fantômas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to see Fantômas's tracks.\n\nFantômas was introduced a few years after Arsène Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.\n\nHe is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.\n\nFantômas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.\n\nIn the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.\n\nC. 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian prince who was Fantômas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.\n\nIn 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and Mexico. There, he ruined his then business partner, Etienne Rambert.\n\nIn 1899, he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the Transvaal as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.\n\nUpon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.\n\nFantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, who was truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor who is employed at the newspaper \"La Capitale\". Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was guillotined in his place.\n\nLady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.\n\nFandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas's repeated attempts to break them up, married her.\n\nFantômas's evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girlfriend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe silent film pioneer Louis Feuillade directed five \"Fantômas\" serials starring René Navarre as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, Georges Melchior as Fandor, and Renée Carl as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial \"Les Vampires\", which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual vampires) is also reminiscent of the \"Fantômas\" series.\n\nThere was a 1920 20-episode American \"Fantômas\" serial directed by Edward Sedgwick starring Edward Roseman as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas's nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by John Willard. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title \"Les Exploits de Diabolos\" (\"The Exploits of Diabolos\"). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title \"Fantômas in America\" in 2007.\n\n\nA \"Fantômas\" series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring Helmut Berger as Fantômas, Jacques Dufilho as Juve, and Gayle Hunnicutt as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by Claude Chabrol; episodes 2 and 3 by Luis Buñuel's son, Juan Luis Buñuel.\n\nThe French movie version of \"Fantômas\" appears in the Czechoslovakian 1979-1981 children fantasy series \"Arabela\" as well as its sequel series \"Arabela se vrací\", performed respectively by actors František Peterka and Pavel Nový. In this version, he does not perform a villain's role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children's series \"Lucie, postrach ulice\" as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers' depiction.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a \"Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante\" (Fantomas, the Elegant Threat) comic book series that became popular throughout Latin America. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films. Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.\n\nThis Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal \"Diabolik\" — and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by Mexican wrestling.\n\nThe Latin American Fantômas mixed Italian and Mexican styles creating a hybrid - just as the flag of Mexico and the flag of Italy are made different by the central emblem of the Aztec pictogram for Tenochtitlan on the Mexican flag. The French character wore a black mask like his Italian inspiration, the Latin American a white mask like Mexican wrestling hero Santo (literally 'saint' in Spanish) - Italy faces Africa home to a majority Black population, Mexico the United States mostly with a majority White population. These characters had to remain relevant and mysterious to their specific geographical regions to survive and succeed.\n\nApparently the series was also influenced by the \"James Bond\" movies, as Fantômas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fantômas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American Hugh Hefner, who created \"Playboy\" magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males.\n\nLatino Fantômas also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 \"Zodiac Girls\", beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames – the signs of the zodiac. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their femininity and preceding Charlie's Angels by decades.\n\nAlthough cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival Grupo Editorial Vid in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both Central America and South America. Fantômas continues to be one of Latin America's favorite comic characters. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below.\n\nA \"Fantômas\" short story by Paul Kupperberg and Roy Mann appeared in \"Captain Action Comics\" No. 1, published in 2009 by Moonstone Books.\n\n\"Yes Virginia, There is a Fantomas\" by William Patrick Maynard was published in Tales of the Shadowmen Volume 6, published in 2009 by Black Coat Press.\n\nThe first half of the novella, \"Reign of Terror\" by R. Allen Leider was published in Awesome Tales No. 3, published in 2016 by Bold Venture Press. The second half of the novella is planned for Awesome Tales No. 9.\n\nThe \"Fantômas\" novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the surrealists. Blaise Cendrars called the series \"the modern Aeneid\"; Guillaume Apollinaire said that \"from the imaginative standpoint \"Fantômas\" is one of the richest works that exist.\" The painter René Magritte and the surrealist poet and novelist Robert Desnos both produced works alluding to Fantômas.\n\nThe movies were also very popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fantômas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: \"Seven Old Men and One Girl\" (1968, directed by E. Karelov) and \"Old Men Bandits\" (1971, directed by E. Ryazanov). In 2007, Russian author Andrey Shary published the book \"Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen\", dealing in particular with this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While always done to eliminate ambiguity, this can mean different things dependent on context.\n\nCommonly encountered applications of the notion have been given their own names, such as the fully qualified domain name and the fully qualified file name.\n\nTo distinguish a fully qualified name from a regular name, C++, Tcl, Perl and Ruby use two colons (::), and Java uses dots (.), as does Visual Basic .NET. and C#. In Java, ActionScript, and other object-oriented languages the use of the dot is known as \"dot syntax\". Other examples include:\n\nThe term fully qualified file name means a file on a computer whose exact name is completely specified such that it is unambiguous and cannot be mistaken for any other file on that computer system.

{"id": "35950840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35950840", "title": "Haymon", "text": "Haymon\n\nHaymon is a mythical figure from Tyrol in form of a giant. It is said that Haymon was the founder of \"Stift Wilten\", a premonstratensian abbey, located in the south of Innsbruck. He is said to have lived between 600 and 900 years ago and to have died in the year 878 A.D. in Wilten. According to a 13th-century sources, Haymon's grave is at the altar of the Collegiate Church in Wilten.\n\nIt has been speculated that Haymon was a Bavarian nobleman named Haimo.\nAlbeit its similar spelling and pronunciation to the ancient Greek name Haimon (), no relation could be shown.\nDifferent traditions have been amalgamated in the legend of the giant Haymon.\n\nIn the 15th century, the local legend of the Gold-Guarding Dragon who lives on the hill Bergisel east of the river Sill was created. This dragon was killed by Haymon. Set in gold, the dragon's tongue (the horn extension of a sword fish) is still today shown in the Tyrolean State Museum Ferdinandeum in Innsbruck.\n\nAnother tradition, which comes up about the 16th century, reports of a fight between Haymon and the giant Thyrsus, who lived in the area of Zirl and Seefeld, eventually killing him. From Thyrsus's blood (the so-called \"Thyrsenblut\" the healing Tyrolean Shale Oil or Ichtltyol is extracted. The last words of the giant Thyrsus were: \"Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet! Sei für Viech und Menschen gut!)\" Thus, Haymon, the immigrant from the north, defeats the local Thyrsus.\n\nIn remorse, Haymon takes the Christian faith being baptized by the Bishop of Chur. Thereafter, he founded the monastery Wilten which he hands over Benedictine monks from the Tegernsee Abbey. Then he joined the order as a lay brother and stayed there until his death. Towards the end of the 16th century, all these motives could be found in the founding legend of the monastery Wilten.\n\nEven in the 17th century, the belief in the historical existence of the giant Haymon was still so strong that the then abbot of the monastery Wilten had an excavation for Haymon's bones carried out in the church. The excavations ended without result, eventually throwing over parts of the church.\n\nAccording to contemporary scholarly interpretation of the 17th Century, the giant\nThyrsus represents the Romansh people while the invading Bavarians, who populated the Inn valley as of the 6th century, are being represented through Haymon. In the fight between Haymon and Thyrsus the defeat of the Romansh people by the Bavarians is symbolized.\n\nWhile Thyrsus is often depicted as a somewhat primitive layman who is fighting with a torn tree, Haymon is depicted as a gallant giant with a sword. Life-size figures of the two giants Haymon and Thyrsus can be found at Wilten where they are at the entrance to the church. An engraving from 1677 by J.J. Jezl shows Haymon as a knight with a sword and the dragon's tongue in his hands. The signature says \"Haymon Fundator Monasterii Wilthinensis, obiit Anno D. 878\" (Haymon founder of the monastery in Wilten, died 878).\n\nIn the region around Innsbruck, various restaurants and institutions are named after the giant Haymon.\n\n\n"}

It is the third feature-length live-action/animation hybrid film to feature \"Looney Tunes\" characters, after \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988) and \"Space Jam\" (1996). The plot follows Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny (both voiced by Joe Alaskey) as they help aspiring daredevil Damian \"D.J.\" Drake, Jr. (Brendan Fraser) and Warner Bros. executive Kate Houghton (Jenna Elfman) find the \"blue monkey\" diamond in order to prevent the evil Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin) of the Acme Corporation from using it to turn mankind into monkeys that will manufacture his products; the group also attempts to rescue D.J.'s father (Timothy Dalton), an actor and spy who has been captured by Mr. Chairman.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on November 14, 2003 with mixed-to-positive critical reception. However, the film was a box office bomb, grossing $68.5 million worldwide against an $80 million budget. This was the final film to be scored by composer Jerry Goldsmith, who died less than a year after the film's release. This was also the final film to be produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation.\n\nTired of playing second banana to Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck demands his own cartoon from Warner Bros., but is promptly fired. Aspiring stuntman DJ Drake is asked to escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the Batmobile demolishing the studio water tower. DJ is also fired in the process, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father, action film star, Damian Drake, is actually a secret agent. Damian instructs his son to travel to Las Vegas, find his associate Dusty Tails, and gain the mystical \"blue monkey\" diamond, but he is shortly thereafter captured by the Acme Corporation, led by the childish Mr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall apart without Daffy, so \"Vice-President of Comedy,\" Kate Houghton, is sent to rehire Daffy or face being fired herself. Bugs informs Kate of the situation, so they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy.\n\nIn Las Vegas, DJ and Daffy meet Dusty in a casino owned by Acme operative Yosemite Sam. Dusty gives them a strange playing card, but when Sam attempts to kill them, they flee in the spy car with Bugs and Kate. The spy car, which can also fly, crashes in the Nevada desert. The group eventually stumbles upon Area 52, run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation, and plays a video recording, which reveals that Acme intends on using the blue monkey to transform mankind into monkeys to manufacture their products, before turning them back into human beings to purchase them. Marvin the Martian, imprisoned in the facility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the playing card, but the heroes escape. Seeing that the card has Mona Lisa's face on it, the group conclude they must view the painting in the Louvre, located in Paris.\n\nAt the Louvre, they discover that the card contains a viewing window, and looking through it, the window reveals that the Mona Lisa has a map of Africa hidden beneath. Elmer Fudd appears, and, revealing himself as an Acme operative, chases Bugs and Daffy through the gallery for the card whilst Kate is kidnapped by Mr. Chairman's bodyguard, Mr. Smith, to obtain a photo of the African map. DJ rescues Kate. Elmer is disintegrated by Bugs after jumping out of a pointillism artwork. Bugs and Daffy reunite with DJ and Kate, and they leave Paris.\n\nDJ, Kate, Bugs, and Daffy travel to Africa, meeting Granny, Sylvester, and Tweety, who escort them to the ruins of a jungle temple where they find the blue monkey. Granny and company reveal themselves to be Mr. Chairman, Smith, and the Tasmanian Devil in disguise. Mr. Chairman uses a disintegration gun to transport himself and the heroes to the Acme headquarters where he forces DJ to give him the diamond, when Damian is revealed to be his prisoner.\n\nMarvin is sent to place the blue monkey on an Acme satellite which will emit an energy beam around the world to turn everyone, except Mr. Chairman, into monkeys. DJ and Kate rescue Damian from a death trap, whilst Bugs and Daffy pursue Marvin into space. Bugs is incapacitated, prompting Daffy to become Duck Dodgers, in order to destroy the blue monkey. The transforming energy beam only strikes Mr. Chairman, turning him into a monkey.\n\nBugs and Daffy return to Earth, where Daffy discovers the whole adventure was staged to make a film. However, Bugs promises Daffy they will be equal partners, but just as Daffy's luck seems to be improving, he is flattened by the Looney Tunes iris, where Porky Pig attempts to close the film with \"That's all folks!\" only for the studio to shut down before he can finish, and he tells the audience to go home.\n\n\n\nA follow-up to \"Space Jam\" was planned as early as the film's release. As development began, \"Space Jam 2\" was going to involve a new basketball competition between the Looney Tunes and a new villain named Berserk-O!. Artist Bob Camp was tasked with designing Berserk-O! and his henchmen. Joe Pytka would have returned to direct and Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone signed on as the animation supervisors. However, Michael Jordan did not agree to star in a sequel. According to Camp, a producer lied to design artists, claiming that Jordan had signed on in order to keep development going. Warner Bros. eventually canceled plans for \"Space Jam 2\".\n\nThe film then re-entered development as \"Spy Jam\" and was to star Jackie Chan. Warner Bros. was also planning a film titled \"Race Jam\" which would have starred Jeff Gordon. Both projects were ultimately cancelled. Warner Bros. eventually asked Joe Dante to direct \"Back in Action\", having had previous success with \"Gremlins\" (1984) and \"Innerspace\" (1987). In the early 1990s, Dante wanted to produce a biographical comedy with HBO, called \"Termite Terrace\". It centered around director Chuck Jones' early years at Warner Bros. in the 1930s. On the project, Dante recalled \"It was a hilarious story and it was very good except that Warner Bros. said 'Look, it’s an old story. It’s got period stuff in it. We don’t want that. We want to rebrand our characters and we want to do \"Space Jam\".'\" \n\nDante agreed to direct \"Back in Action\" as tribute to Jones. He and screenwriter Larry Doyle reportedly wanted the film to the \"Anti-\"Space Jam\"\" as Dante disliked how that film represented the \"Looney Tunes\" brand and personalities. Dante said \"I was making a movie for them with those characters [\"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\"] and they did not want to know about those characters. They didn’t want to know why Bugs Bunny shouldn’t do hip-hop. It was a pretty grim experience all around.\" Warner Bros. hired Walt Disney Feature Animation's Eric Goldberg, most known for his fast-paced, Warner Bros.-inspired animation of the Genie in \"Aladdin\" (1992), to direct the animation.\n\nOn the film, Dante stated \"It's a gagfest. Not having a particularly strong story, it just goes from gag to gag and location to location. It's not a particularly compelling narrative, but, of course, that's not where the charm of the movie is supposed to lie.\" On the subject of filming, Dante said \"[W]e would shoot each scene three times. First we'd rehearse with a stand-in—a 'stuffy,' we called it. Then, we'd shoot the scene without anything in it; then, we'd shoot the scene again with this mirror ball in the shot which shows the computers where the light sources are. Then the animators would go to work and put characters into the frame. The problem with that movie came when the studio [executives] started to get tired of our jokes and wanted us to change them. But, of course, the animation is done to the voices and not the other way around. It was difficult trying to convince them that you don't just bring in 25 gag writers and try to write a joke that's short enough to put in somebody's mouth.\" Although the production had twenty-five gag writers, the film has only one credited writer.\n\nDespite being directed by acknowledged fans of the original cartoons, Dante stated that he had no creative freedom on the project, and called it \"the longest year and a half of my life.\" Dante felt that he and Goldberg managed to preserve the original personalities of the characters. However, the opening, middle, and end of the film are different from what Dante envisioned.\n\nGoldberg also provided the voices of Tweety, Michigan J. Frog, Marvin the Martian and Speedy Gonzales. Brendan Fraser provided the voice of the Tazmanian Devil and She-Devil, having impressed Dante with his Taz vocal impression.\n\nThis was the final film scored by composer Jerry Goldsmith. Due to Goldsmith's failing health, the last reel of the film was actually scored by John Debney, though Goldsmith was the only credited composer in marketing materials and the Varèse Sarabande soundtrack album only contains Goldsmith's music (although the first and last cues are adaptations of compositions heard in Warner Bros. cartoons). Debney receives an \"Additional Music by\" credit in the closing titles of the film and \"Special Thanks\" in the soundtrack album credits. Goldsmith died in July 2004, eight months after the film's release.\n\n\"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\" was released on November 14, 2003, originally planned to open earlier that summer. The film grossed $68.5 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million.\n\nWarner Bros. was hoping to start a revitalized franchise of \"Looney Tunes\" media and products with the success of \"Back in Action\". New animated shorts and a \"Duck Dodgers\" TV series were commissioned to tie-in with \"Back in Action\". The film instead triggered Warner Bros. to release new TV projects in an effort to re-brand the \"Looney Tunes\" such as \"Loonatics Unleashed\" (2005–2007), \"The Looney Tunes Show\" (2011–2014), and \"Wabbit\" (2015–present).\n\nCritical response aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 57% based on 134 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The plot is a nonsensical, hyperactive jumble and the gags are relatively uninspired compared to the classic \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons.\" At Metacritic, the film scored a 64/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" movie critics, Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, gave the film \"Two Thumbs Up\"; Roeper called it a \"cheerful and self-referential romp blending animation with live action in a non-stop quest for silly laughs,\" while Ebert called it \"goofy fun.\"\n\nThe film was also nominated for Saturn Award for Best Animated Film, Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature.\n\nWarner Home Video released \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\" on VHS and DVD on March 2, 2004. The film was re-released on DVD in separate widescreen and editions on September 7, 2010. It was also released on Blu-ray with bonus features on December 2, 2014. A double DVD and Blu-ray release, paired with \"Space Jam\", was released on June 7, 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "2036409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036409", "title": "Michelin Guide", "text": "Michelin Guide\n\nMichelin Guides ( ) are a series of guide books published by the French tire company for more than a century. The term normally refers to the annually published Michelin \"Red Guide\", the oldest European hotel and restaurant reference guide, which awards up to three \"Michelin stars\" for excellence to a select few establishments. The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. Michelin also publishes a series of general guides to cities, regions, and countries, the \"Green Guides\".\n\nIn 1900, there were fewer than 3,000 cars on the roads of France. To increase the demand for cars and, accordingly, car tires, car tire manufacturers and brothers Édouard and André Michelin published a guide for French motorists in 1900, the Michelin Guide. Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free edition of the guide were distributed; it provided useful information to motorists, such as maps, tire repair and replacement instructions, car mechanics listings, hotels, and petrol stations throughout France. \n\nFour years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.\n\nMichelin subsequently introduced guides for Algeria and Tunisia (1907); the Alps and the Rhine (northern Italy, Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Netherlands) (1908); Germany, Spain, and Portugal (1910); Ireland and the British Isles (1911); and \"The Countries of the Sun\" (\"\") (Northern Africa, Southern Italy and Corsica) (1911). In 1909, an English-language version of the guide to France was published.\n\nDuring World War I, publication of the guide was suspended. After the war, revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920. It is said that André Michelin, whilst visiting a tire merchant, noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench. Based on the principle that \"man only truly respects what he pays for\", Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide, which was about 750 francs or $2.15 in 1922. They also made several changes, notably listing restaurants by specific categories, adding hotel listings (initially only for Paris), and removing advertisements in the guide. Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide, the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants, who were always anonymous.\n\nFollowing the usage of the Murray's and Baedeker guides, the guide began to award stars for fine dining establishments in 1926. Initially, there was only a single star awarded. Then, in 1931, the hierarchy of zero, one, two, and three stars was introduced. Finally, in 1936, the criteria for the starred rankings were published:\n\n\nIn 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red, and has remained so in all subsequent editions. During World War II, publication was again suspended, but in 1944, at the request of the Allied Forces, the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use; its maps were judged the best and most up-to-date available. Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945, a week after VE Day.\n\nIn the early post-war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard. The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.\n\nIn 2005, Michelin published its first American guide, covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of New York City and 50 hotels in Manhattan. In 2007, a Tokyo Michelin Guide was launched. In the same year, the guide introduced a magazine, \"\". In 2008, a Hong Kong and Macau volume was added. As of 2013, the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries.\n\nIn 2008, the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor-in-chief of the French edition of the guide. She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. She became the first woman and first non-French national to occupy the French position. The German newspaper \"\" commented on the appointment, \"In view of the fact German cuisine is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France, this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian.\"\n\nRed Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines. Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialties. Short summaries (2–3 lines) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published (though the Spain and Portugal volume is in Spanish only) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.\n\nMichelin reviewers (commonly called \"inspectors\") are anonymous; they do not identify themselves, and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin, never by a restaurant being reviewed:\nThe French chef Paul Bocuse, one of the pioneers of in the 1960s, said, \"Michelin is the only guide that counts.\" In France, when the guide is published each year, it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual Academy Awards for films. Media and others debate likely winners, speculation is rife, and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose, and who might gain a Michelin star.\n\nThe Michelin Guide also awards Rising Stars, an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star, or an additional star.\n\nSince 1955, the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering \"exceptionally good food at moderate prices\", a feature now called \"\". They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards. () is the company's nickname for the Michelin Man, its corporate logo for over a century.\n\nIn 2014, Michelin introduced a separate listing for gastropubs in Ireland. In 2016, the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments. Additionally in 2016, the Singapore guide introduced the first Michelin stars for street food locations, for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.\n\nAll listed restaurants, regardless of their star- or -status, also receive a \"fork and spoon\" designation, as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant. Rankings range from one to five: One fork and spoon represents a \"comfortable restaurant\" and five signifies a \"luxurious restaurant\". Forks and spoons colored red designate a restaurant that is considered \"pleasant\" as well.\n\nRestaurants, independently of their other ratings in the guide, can also receive a number of other symbols next to their listing.\n\n\nThe Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants. There is a Green Guide for France as a whole, and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France. Other Green Guides cover many countries, regions, and cities outside France. Many Green Guides are published in several languages. They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest. Like the Red Guides, they use a three-star system for recommending sites ranging from \"worth a trip\" to \"worth a detour\", and \"interesting\".\n\nPascal Rémy, a veteran France-based Michelin inspector, and also a former Gault Millau employee, wrote a tell-all book published in 2004 entitled \"L'Inspecteur se met à table\" (literally, \"The Inspector Sits Down at the Table\"; idiomatically, \"The Inspector Spills the Beans\", or \"The Inspector Lays It All on the Table\"). Rémy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book. He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.\n\nRémy described the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rémy said only about one visit every 3½ years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003.\n\nRémy also accused the guide of favoritism. He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs, such as Paul Bocuse and Alain Ducasse, as \"untouchable\" and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser-known chefs. Michelin denied Rémy's charges, but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France. In response to Rémy's statement that certain three-star chefs were sacrosanct, Michelin said, \"There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it weren't true, if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us.\"\n\nSome non-French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favor of French cuisine or French dining standards. In the UK \"The Guardian\" commented in 1997 that \"some people maintain the guide's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism\". When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of \"The New York Times\" noted that Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, a restaurant rated highly by \"The New York Times\", Zagat Survey, and other prominent guides, received a no star-rating from Michelin. (He did acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambiance, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars). Kurutz also claimed the guide appeared to favor restaurants that \"emphasized formality and presentation\" rather than a \"casual approach to fine dining\". He also claimed that over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars \"could be considered French\". The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants, compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007; after The Four Seasons Restaurant received no stars in that edition, co-owner Julian Niccolini said Michelin \"should stay in France, and they should keep their guide there\". The 2007 guide does, however, include menus, recipes, and photographs, and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants.\n\nIn 2010 Michelin guides ranked Japan as the country with the most starred restaurants. This sparked questioning over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants, or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tire-selling company to market itself in Japan. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2010 that some Japanese chefs were surprised at receiving a star, and were reluctant to accept one, because the publicity caused an unmanageable jump in booking, affecting their ability to serve their traditional customers without lowering their quality.\n\nSome restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star, because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and decor. Some cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "709546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=709546", "title": "Oldway Mansion", "text": "Oldway Mansion\n\nOldway Mansion is a large house and gardens in Paignton, Devon, England. It was built as a private residence for Isaac Merritt Singer (1811–1875), and rebuilt by his third son Paris Singer in the style of the Palace of Versailles.\n\nAround 1871 the Fernham estate in Paignton was purchased by Isaac Singer, the founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The old buildings on the site were demolished and he commissioned a local architect, George Soudon Bridgman, to build a new mansion as his home. As part of the designs, Singer instructed Bridgman to build a theatre within the house. Bridgman was at that time being apprenticed by a young Frank Matcham who had just returned from London where he had been studying architecture in a surveyors office. In an edition of \"The Builder\", dated 1873, Matcham was named in the request for tender section as being the accepted party to work alongside Bridgman on the Oldway Mansion project. The architectural historian Gorel Garlick considers it entirely possible that Matcham was given sole responsibility by Bridgman for the theatre's design because of his educational experiences in London. Singer spared no cost in terms of Oldway Mansion's construction; he sourced the finest materials from around the world and instructed Bridgman to design the interior in exuberant French style. Garlick notes that it was highly likely that Singer's exuberance would have influenced someone as architecturally impressionable as Matcham whose later theatres used such extravagant decoration. The work was completed in 1873 Singer died on 23 July 1875, shortly before work on the original mansion was completed.\nParis Eugene Singer, Isaac Singer's third son, supervised the alterations at Oldway Mansion between 1904 and 1907. The rebuilding work was modelled on the Palace of Versailles. and the eastern elevation of the building was inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The interior of the building is noted for its grand staircase made from marble and balusters of bronze. The ceiling of the staircase is decorated with an ornate painting based on an original design for the Palace of Versailles for Louis XIV by the French painter and architect Charles Le Brun.\n\nAbove the grand staircase there is a reproduction of the first version of Jacques-Louis David's painting \"The Crowning of Josephine by Napoleon.\". The original was purchased by Paris Singer in the late 19th century. The painting was sold to the French government in 1946 and now hangs in the Palace of Versailles. The reproduction at the mansion, which is in the same place as the original, is a copy made by Rutters Scanachrome and was unveiled in 1995.\n\nThe gallery on the first floor is a reproduction of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, and is floored in parquet. The gallery leads into the ballroom, which contains walls of gilt panelling and mirrors. Above the fireplace there is an oil painting of Louis of Bourbon dating from 1717.\n\nOldway Mansion is set in of gardens, which are laid out on an Italian theme by the French landscape gardener Achille Duchesne. Beneath the eastern elevation of the building is the maze, which consists of dwarf box hedging and flower beds. To the south of the mansion there is the grotto garden where a waterfall passes over a rocky cave into a pool below. The grounds of the mansion contain many sub-tropical plants and shrubs.\n\nOpposite the main entrance to the mansion is a large round building known as The Rotunda. This was built in 1873, and was used originally as a horse riding pavilion and exercise area. Isaac Merritt Singer gave this building the nickname of \"The Wigwam\".\n\nThe formal gardens and parkland are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nFollowing the end of an affair with the dancer Isadora Duncan in 1917, Paris Singer became an American citizen and went to live in the United States. This was done partly for tax reasons, and after 1918 Oldway Mansion was no longer the permanent home of the Singer family.\n\nDuring the period of the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Oldway Mansion was transformed into the American Women's War Relief Hospital. The Rotunda was converted to house rows of beds for the wounded soldiers being brought back to England from the trenches of France and Belgium. King George V visited the mansion in 1915.\n\nOldway Mansion became the Torbay Country Club in 1929. During this period tennis courts and a bowling green were added to the grounds.\n\nTorbay Golf & Country Club opened in 1933. Oldway Mansion was used as the club house, with the course in the hills above the Mansion. The course closed in the mid 1950s.\n\nDuring the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, Oldway was used in the war effort by housing RAF cadets training to be aircrew. In 1943, Oldway was damaged in an air raid, along with many other buildings in Paignton.\nPaignton Urban District Council purchased Oldway Mansion from the Singer family in 1946 for £46,000. It is estimated that around £200,000 was spent on building the mansion. Until 2013, the building was used as council offices and for civil marriage ceremonies. Oldway Mansion has been a Grade II* listed building since 1993.\n\nIn January 2007, Torbay Council announced that it was considering selling the mansion as it had become too expensive to maintain. The suggestion was controversial, since local residents argued that the mansion was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be open to the public. On 30 April 2012, plans for Oldway Mansion to be converted into a luxury hotel and sheltered retirement flats were approved by Torbay Council. The deal was finalised in September 2012.\n\nAs of October 2013, Oldway Mansion is empty, with Torbay Council no longer using the buildings. The bowling green is still in use, and the tennis courts are closed.\n\nIn January 2016, it was reported that the property developer Akkeron had filed a claim for more than £8 million in damages against Torbay Council, due to a dispute over the leases which it said had caused a delay in starting work on the redevelopment. Torbay Council rejected the claim and said that it would defend the allegations \"robustly\". On 15 August 2016, it was reported that the agreement between Torbay Council and Akkeron to develop the mansion had been terminated.\n\nOldway Mansion has been used as a film location on several occasions. During the spring of 2004, it doubled as Buckingham Palace for the filming of \"\", starring Christian Slater and Neve Campbell. Pink gravel, guard houses and period vehicles were used to recreate the royal courtyard. The 1968 film \"Isadora\" starring Vanessa Redgrave and telling the life story of the dancer Isadora Duncan also used Oldway Mansion as one of its locations.\nOn 21 December 2005, the ballroom at Oldway Mansion was the location for Devon's first civil partnership. The registration was officially witnessed by the Mayor of Torbay and his dignitaries.\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n"}

It led to the independence of Vietnam.\n\nVietnam became a colony of France in the late 19th century, but during World War II, Japan occupied Vietnam. During this period the Viet Minh fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese and were to a degree supported by the Americans in 1945 via the Office of Strategic Services.\n\nOn August 22, 1945 the OSS agent Archimedes Patti, who had previously met Ho Chi Minh in Southern China arrived in Hanoi on a mercy mission to liberate allied POWs and were accompanied by Jean Sainteny a French government official. The Japanese forces informally surrendered (the official surrender took place on Sept. 2, 1945 in Tokyo Bay) but being the only force capable of maintaining law and order the Japanese Imperial Army remained in power while keeping French colonial troops detained.\n\nJapanese forces allowed the Việt Minh and other nationalist groups to take over public buildings and weapons without resistance, which began the August Revolution. On the morning of August 26, 1945, at No. 48 Hàng Ngang, Hà Nội, chairman Hồ Chí Minh had called and presided over the meeting of the Central Standing Communist Party of Vietnam. In the decisions made at this meeting, the Standing unanimously prepared to proclaim independence and organized a large meeting in Hà Nội for the Provisional Government to present itself to the people, also the day that Vietnam officially promulgated the right of freedom and established the democratic republic system.\n\nOn August 30, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh invited several people to contribute their ideas toward his Proclamation of Independence. OSS officers met repeatedly with Ho Chi Minh and other Viet Minh officers during late August and Archimedes Patti claims to have listened to Ho read to him a draft of the Proclamation which he believed sounded very similar to the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh read the Proclamation during a public meeting in front of thousands of people, at what is now Ba Đình Square, Hà Nội, announcing the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the country's independence from France.\n\n"}

{"id": "297034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297034", "title": "Rexist Party", "text": "Rexist Party\n\nThe Rexist Party (), or simply Rex, was a far-right Catholic, nationalist, authoritarian and corporatist political party active in Belgium from 1935 until 1945. The party was founded by a journalist, Léon Degrelle, and, unlike other fascist parties in the Belgium of the time, advocated Belgian unitarism and royalism. Initially the party ran in both Flanders and Wallonia but never achieved much success outside Wallonia and Brussels. Its name was derived from the Roman Catholic journal and publishing company \"Christus Rex\" (Latin for Christ the King).\n\nThe highest point that the Rexist party had achieved was its success on sending 21 out of 202 deputies (with 11.4% of the vote) and twelve senators in the 1936 election. Never a mass movement, it was on the decline by 1938. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, Rex was the largest collaborationist group in French-speaking Belgium, paralleled by the \"Vlaams Nationaal Verbond\" (VNV) in Flanders. By the end of the war Rex was widely discredited, and was banned following the liberation.\n\nInitially modelled on Italian Fascism and Spanish Falangism, it later drew closer to German Nazism. The Party espoused a \"right-wing revolution\" and the dominance of the Catholic Church in Belgium, but its ideology came to be vigorously opposed by the leader of the Belgian Church Cardinal van Roey, who called Rexism a \"danger to the church and to the country\".\n\nThe ideology of Rex, which was loosely based on the writings of Jean Denis, called for the \"moral renewal\" of Belgian society through dominance of the Catholic Church, by forming a corporatist society and abolishing liberal democracy. Denis became an enthusiastic member of Rex and later wrote for the party newspaper, \"Le Pays Réel\". The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from Charles Maurras' integralism. It rejected liberalism which it deemed decadent and was strongly opposed to both Marxism and capitalism, instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional family values.\n\nIn its early period — until around 1937 — Rexism cannot accurately be categorised as a fascist movement. Rather it was a populist, authoritarian and conservative Catholic nationalist movement that initially tried to win power by democratic means, and did not want to totally abolish democratic institutions. The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but it was only after Degrelle's own defeat in a by-election in April 1937 that it openly embraced anti-Semitism and anti-parliamentarism, following the model of German Nazism. The historian and fascism expert Roger Griffin only considers the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as \"fully fascist\", until then he considers it \"proto-fascist\".\n\nThe Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936 Degrelle made a secret agreement with \"Rex\"'s Flemish counterpart, the \"Vlaams Nationaal Verbond\" (VNV; \"Flemish National Union\") led by Staf De Clercq. Both movements strove for a corporatist system, but unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the Netherlands. The Flemish side cancelled the agreement after just one year. It also faced competition from the ideologically similar (but explicitly anti-German) \"Légion Nationale\" (\"National Legion\") of Paul Hoornaert.\n\nThe Rexist Party was founded in 1935 after its leader Léon Degrelle had left the mainstream Catholic Party which he deemed too moderate. It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the Depression era, it initially won considerable popularity—mostly due to its leader's charismatic appearance. Its greatest success was when it won 11.5% of the votes in the 1936 election. Therefore, the Rexist Party could take 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 8 out of 101 in the Senate, making it the fourth-strongest force in Parliament, behind the major established parties (Labour, Catholic, Liberal). However, the support for the party was extremely localized: Rexists succeeded in garnering over 30 per cent of the vote in the French-speaking province of Luxembourg, compared with just 9 per cent in equally French-speaking Hainaut. Degrelle admired Adolf Hitler's rise to power and progressively imitated the tone and style of fascist campaigning, while the movement's ties to the Roman Catholic Church were increasingly repudiated by the Belgian clergy. Rexism received subsidies from both Hitler and Mussolini.\n\nDegrelle ran in the April 1937 Brussels by-election against Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland of the Catholic Party, who was—to avoid victory of the Rexists—supported by all other parties, including even the Communists. The Archbishop of Mechelen and primate of the Catholic Church of Belgium, Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey intervened, rebuking Rexist voters and calling Rexism \"a danger to the country and to the Church\". Degrelle was decisively defeated: he lost by 20 to 80 percent.\n\nAfterwards, Rexism allied itself with the interests of Nazi Germany even more strongly and incorporated Nazi-style antisemitism into its platform. At the same time, its popularity declined sharply. In the 1939 election, Rex's share of votes fell to 4.4% and the party lost 17 of its 21 seats, largely to the mainstream Catholic and Liberal parties.\n\nWith the German invasion of Belgium in 1940, Rexism welcomed German occupation, even though it had initially supported the pre-war Belgian policy of neutrality. While some former Rexists went into the underground resistance or (like José Streel) withdrew from politics after they had come to see the Nazis' anticlerical and extreme anti-Semitic policies enforced in occupied Belgium, most Rexists, however, proudly supported the occupiers and assisted German forces with the repression of the territory wherever they could. Nevertheless, the popularity of Rex continued to drop. In 1941, at a reunion in Liège, Degrelle was booed by about a hundred demonstrators.\n\nIn August 1944, Rexist militia were responsible for the Courcelles Massacre.\n\nClosely affiliated with Rex was the \"Légion Wallonie\", a paramilitary organization which later became the \"Wallonien\" Division of the Waffen SS. After Operation Barbarossa started, the Légion Wallonie and its Flemish counterpart, the \"Legion Flandern\" sent respectively 25,000 and 15,000 volunteers to fight against the Soviet Union. Degrelle took command of the Wallonien division, where he fought on the Eastern Front. Whilst Degrelle was absent, nominal leadership of the party passed to Victor Matthys.\n\nFrom the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the party had been banned. With the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, many former Rexists were imprisoned or executed for their role during collaboration. Victor Matthys and José Streel were both executed by firing squad, Jean Denis (who had played only a minor role during the war) was imprisoned.\n\nDegrelle took refuge in Francoist Spain. He was convicted of treason \"in absentia\" in Belgium and sentenced to death, but repeated requests to extradite him were turned down by the Spanish government. Stripped of his citizenship and excommunicated (later lifted in Germany), Degrelle died in Málaga in 1994.\n\n\n"}

Scopus covers nearly 36,377 titles (22,794 active titles and 13,583 Inactive titles) from approximately 11,678 publishers, of which 34,346 are peer-reviewed journals in top-level subject fields: life sciences, social sciences, physical sciences and health sciences. It covers three types of sources: book series, journals, and trade journals. All journals covered in the Scopus database, regardless of who they are published under, are reviewed each year to ensure high quality standards are maintained. The complete list is on the SCImago Journal Rank website. Searches in Scopus also incorporate searches of patent databases. Scopus gives four types of quality measure for each title; those are \"h\"-Index, CiteScore, SJR (SCImago Journal Rank) and SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper).\n\nEvaluating ease of use and coverage of Scopus and the Web of Science (WOS), a 2006 study concluded that \"Scopus is easy to navigate, even for the novice user. ... The ability to search both forward and backward from a particular citation would be very helpful to the researcher. The multidisciplinary aspect allows the researcher to easily search outside of his discipline\" and \"One advantage of WOS over Scopus is the depth of coverage, with the full WOS database going back to 1945 and Scopus going back to 1966.

Knox I (1861–1915), who merged his chain of five-and-dime stores with those of his first cousins, Frank Winfield Woolworth and Charles Woolworth, to form the F. W. Woolworth Company in 1912. Knox was one of three children born to Seymour and Grace:\nKnox attended Nichols School in Buffalo and the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. He was a 1920 graduate of Yale University. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon.\n\nIn 1921, upon graduation from Yale, Knox became a Marine Midland Bank director. In 1926, he became vice-president, followed by chairman in 1943 until 1970. He joined the F. W. Woolworth board in 1926 and was chairman from 1943 until reaching the mandatory retirement age forty-five years later in 1971. He became Chairman of The University at Buffalo's governing Council from 1950-69. Knox served on the board of directors of Marine Midland Bank, F. W. Woolworth Company, New York Central Railroad, Penn Central Railroad, and the American Steamship Company.\n\nIn 1926, he joined the board of Albright Art Gallery. From the beginning, he was a leader in the modernism movement and in modern cultural life in Buffalo. He spent 60 years working with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and by 1939, he was President of the Academy. He bolstered the Contemporary Abstractionism collection during his tenure. He is best known for his 1962 addition to the Albright Art Gallery, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. After the completion of the addition, the Gallery was renamed the Albright-Knox Art Gallery Knox in his honor. He donated more than 160 works for the new wing, and over 700 pieces over his lifetime. He is said to be in part responsible for the popularity of Jackson Pollock. Under his direction, the Gallery became the first museum to purchase a Clyfford Still, one of the first to purchase a Henry Moore, and as leading champions of Abstractionism, they acquired selections from almost every major abstractionist. In 1965 he was appointed to a commission to choose modern art works for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.\n\nIn 1923, he married Helen Northrup (1902-1971), who had attended the Albright Art School. The lived in a mansion at 57 Oakland Place in Buffalo, designed by C. P. H. Gilbert. Construction on the home began in 1924 and was a gift to the couple from Knox's mother, who lived nearby at 800 Delaware Avenue. Together, they had two sons:\nBoth sons were the original principal owners of the Buffalo Sabres NHL team. Knox was the subject of the 1985 Andy Warhol painting \"Portrait of Seymour H. Knox\". He also donated significant funds to the Yale University Art Gallery, in New Haven, Connecticut, which both the Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art and Seymour H. Knox Jr., Curator of European and Contemporary Art positions bear his name. He was an avid polo player and led his Aurora team to the United States Championship in 1932, later touring South America, and winning a tournament in Europe.\n\nKnox died on September 27, 1990 and was eulogized in Congress by U.S. Representative Bill Paxon.\n\nIn 1986, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Ronald Reagan for his contributions to the arts in Buffalo and the nation.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "17117300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17117300", "title": "Sustainable packaging", "text": "Sustainable packaging\n\nSustainable packaging is the development and use of packaging which results in improved sustainability. This involves increased use of life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to help guide the use of packaging which reduces the environmental impact and ecological footprint. It includes a look at the whole of the supply chain: from basic function, to marketing, and then through to end of life (LCA) and rebirth. Additionally, an eco-cost to value ratio can be useful\nThe goals are to improve the long term viability and quality of life for humans and the longevity of natural ecosystems. Sustainable packaging must meet the functional and economic needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is not necessarily an end state but is a continuing process of improvement.\n\nSustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see Packaging and labeling). It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle. This is not just the vague \"green movement\" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years. Companies implementing these eco-friendly actions are reducing their carbon footprint, using more recycled materials and reusing more package components. They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.\n\nFor example, researchers at the Agricultural Research Service are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging. Instead of being made of synthetic polymers, these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as casein and whey, which are found in milk. The films would be biodegradable and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic, chemical-based films. More research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film, but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued.\n\nEnvironmental marketing claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous greenwashing titles such as \"green packaging\" and \"environmentally friendly\" can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers\n\nCompanies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements, consumer pressure, and regulation. All phases of packaging, distribution, and logistics are included.\n\nSustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling. Just as packaging is not the only eco target, although it is still top of mind for many. Right or wrong, packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company's overall sustainability, even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things, such as transportation, and water and energy use.\n\nThe criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development. General guidance, metrics, checklists, and scorecards are being published by several groups.\n\nGovernment, standards organizations, consumers, retailers, and packagers are considering several types of criteria.\n\nEach organization words the goals and targets a little differently. In general, the broad goals of sustainable packaging are:\n\nSpecific factors for sustainable design of packaging may include:\n\nThe chosen criteria are often used best as a basis of comparison for two or more similar packaging designs; not as an absolute success or failure. Such a multi-variable comparison is often presented as a radar chart (spider chart, star chart, etc.).\n\nSome aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by each packager. Investors, employees, management, and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies. When investors seek to purchase stock, companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive. Potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision: lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates. Companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers, can boost sales as well as product reputation. Going green is often a sound investment that can pay off.\n\nThe process of engineering more environmentally acceptable packages can include consideration of the costs. Some companies claim that their environmental packaging program is cost effective. Some alternative materials that are recycled/recyclable and/or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs. Though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production (producer pays, producer responsibility laws, take-back laws). There may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public, and approval may take up to two years. It is important to note here, that for most of the developed world, tightening legislation, and changes in major retailer demand (Walmart's Sustainable Packaging Scorecard for example) the question is no longer \"if\" products and packaging should become more sustainable, but how-to and how-soon to do it.\n\nEfforts toward “greener” packaging are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end. Some picture a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal ecological footprint, fewer consumer packaged goods, local purchasing with short food supply chains, little processed foods, etc.\nLess packaging would be needed in a sustainable carbon neutral economy; fewer packaging options would exist; simpler packaging forms may be necessary.\n\n\n"}

The title is a parody of \"The Case of the Stuttering Bishop\", a Perry Mason mystery that Warner Bros. had filmed earlier that year.\n\nOn a dark and stormy night, Porky and his brothers (Patrick, Percy, Portis, Peter) and sister (Petunia) learn from lawyer Goodwill that they are set to inherit a fortune from their deceased rich uncle Solomon, with the \"kindly\" lawyer next in line after them.

The dictionary includes verbal entries on the website with paragraph-length descriptions and videos on YouTube for individual entries. The neologisms, while completely created by Koenig, are based on his research on etymologies and meanings of used prefixes, suffixes, and word roots. The terms are often based on \"feelings of existentialism\" and are meant to \"fill a hole in the language\", often from reader contributions of specific emotions. Some videos involve a large number of photographs, such as the video for \"Vemödalen\", which uses an \"almost exhausting—yet seamless—fusion of 465 similar photos from different photographers\". Other videos are more personal, such as \"Avenoir\",which involves a \"collage of his own home movies to piece together an exploration of life’s linearity\". \n\nAn official book for the \"Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\" is expected to be published soon.\n\nThe dictionary was first considered in 2006 when Koenig was a \"student at Macalester College in Minnesota\" and was attempting to write poetry. The \"Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\" was the idea he came up with that would contain all the words he needed for his poetry, including emotions that had never been linguistically described. The popularity of the website and web series began to grow in June 2015 after a list of twenty-three words from the dictionary began to be shared on multiple social media sites.\n\nSeveral of the neologisms presented in \"The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\", especially those that have an accompanying video, have received attention and interest. The term \"Vemödalen\" focuses on the lack of creativity within photography due to the existence of similar photographs having been taken in the past. However, the video also focuses on how it is \"inevitable that the “same” image will be captured by different individuals\" while it is also correct that \"just because some things seem similar, their uniqueness is not annulled\". Using a quote from Walt Whitman, the video points out that something being unique will always be based on adding to what came before and that every photo ever made is being added to the story of photographs that all people are collaborating on. \n\nThe term \"Sonder\" has been noted as well for its relation to other people, its definition meaning \"the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own\". \"Sonder\" has also been appropriated by various companies for use as the name of a bike brand and the title of a video game. The third album from indie pop artist Kaoru Ishibashi was named \"Sonderlust\" after this term from the dictionary and references the separation from his wife and his attempts to understand her life.\n\nMultiple words from the dictionary, such as ellipism, énouement, and onism, were used as titles for various cocktails served at the Chicago restaurant Knife. Similarly, an art gallery exhibit for the works of Michael Sagato in Los Angeles uses words from the \"Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\" to title each of his art pieces and to reference the meaning behind each piece.\n\n\"The Times of India\" referred to the dictionary as a \"delightful website for etymologists and wordsmiths\". Sharanya Manivannan, writing for \"The New Indian Express\", described the dictionary as a \"beautiful experiment on the fine line between babble and Babel.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53404298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53404298", "title": "The Post (film)", "text": "The Post (film)\n\nThe Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer. It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham, the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of \"The Washington Post\", with Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Bradley Whitford, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Carrie Coon, and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles. Set in 1971, \"The Post\" depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at \"The Washington Post\" to publish the \"Pentagon Papers\", classified documents regarding the 30-year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War.\n\nPrincipal photography began in New York City in May 2017. The film premiered at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. on December 14, 2017, and went into limited release in the United States on December 22, 2017. It entered wide release on January 12, 2018, and grossed $179 million worldwide.\n\nThe film received positive reviews; critics praised the performances (particularly those of Streep, Hanks, and Odenkirk) and described the references and allusions to the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Donald Trump. \"The Post\" was chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2017 and was named as one of the top 10 films of the year by \"Time\" and the American Film Institute. \n\nThe film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress (for Streep) at the 90th Academy Awards, and also received six nominations at the 75th Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Actress – Drama (for Streep), Best Actor – Drama (for Hanks), Best Screenplay and Best Original Score.\n\nIn 1966, during the Vietnam War, State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies United States troops in combat, documenting the progress of U.S. military activities in the region for Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the flight home, McNamara expresses to Ellsberg and William Macomber his view. He thinks that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet, upon landing, tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this and becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the RAND Corporation, Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn 1971, newspaper heiress Katharine Graham tries to balance her social life with her responsibility as owner and publisher of \"The Washington Post\", following the deaths of her husband, Phil Graham, and her father, Eugene Meyer. She is troubled over preparations for the newspaper's stock-market launch, a move she recognizes as important for strengthening the paper's economic stability. Graham lacks experience and is frequently overruled by more assertive men who advise or work for her, such as editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee and board member Arthur Parsons.\n\nSecretary McNamara, Graham's longtime friend, confides in her that he is to be the subject of unflattering coverage by \"The New York Times\". The story, another example of the \"Times\"' ability to get scoops while \"The Post\" languishes, turns out to be an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public regarding Vietnam. However, the series is halted by a court injunction against further publication by the \"Times\".\n\n\"Post\" assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down former colleague Ellsberg as the source for the leak, who provides him with copies of the same material given to the \"Times\". A hand-picked team of \"Post\" reporters sorts through the piles of papers, searching for further headline stories. The lawyers for the \"Post\" advise against publishing the material, lest the Nixon administration bring criminal charges against them. Graham talks to McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted \"Post\" chairman Fritz Beebe, agonizing over the decision of whether to publish. Bradlee, a close friend of former President John F. Kennedy, tells Graham that their politician friends (including JFK, as shown in the documents) have abused their friendships by lying to their faces, proving that her friendship with McNamara must no longer stop her. The situation is made even more complicated when the \"Post\"s lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the \"Times\"s, possibly putting Graham in contempt of court. If charges are brought against the company, Graham could destroy the newspaper she sees as a family legacy. Alternately, if she were to win any legal challenge, the \"Post\" could instead establish itself as an important journalistic institution. She chooses to run the story.\n\nThe White House retaliates, and in short order the \"Post\" and \"Times\" appear together before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment case for the right to publish the material. Meanwhile, newspapers across the country pick up the story in solidarity with the \"Post\" and \"Times.\" On June 30, 1971, the court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor, vindicating Graham's decision. A short while after, Nixon demands that the \"Post\" be barred from the White House. One year later, on June 17, 1972 (two weeks before the first anniversary of the court’s ruling), security guard Frank Wills discovers a break-in in progress at the Watergate complex.\n\nIn October 2016, Amy Pascal won a bid for the rights to the screenplay \"The Post\", written by Liz Hannah. In February 2017, Steven Spielberg had halted pre-production on \"The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara\" after a casting setback, and consequently opened his schedule to other potential films to direct. The following month, it was announced that Spielberg was in negotiations to direct and produce the film, with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in talks for the roles of Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee, respectively. \"The Post\" is the first time that Spielberg, Streep, and Hanks had all worked together on a film.\n\nSpielberg read the screenplay and decided to direct the film as soon as possible, citing that \"when I read the first draft of the script, this wasn't something that could wait three years or two years — this was a story I felt we needed to tell today.\" Spielberg worked on \"The Post\" while post-production work continued on the visual-effects-heavy \"Ready Player One\", a situation familiar to him from concurrently producing, in the early 1990s, \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Schindler's List\". Josh Singer was hired to re-write the screenplay ten weeks before filming.\n\nAs filming commenced, a number of \"New York Times\" figures who were associated with the \"Pentagon Papers\" case—among them James Greenfield, James Goodale, Allan Siegal, and Max Frankel—objected to the film's production due to the script's lack of emphasis on the \"Times\" role in breaking the story. Goodale, who was at the time the \"Times\"s in-house counsel, later called the film \"a good movie but bad history.\"\n\nThe film began principal photography in New York on May 30, 2017. On June 6, 2017, it was announced that the project, retitled \"The Papers\", would also star Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford, and Zach Woods. On August 25, 2017, the film's title reverted to \"The Post\". Spielberg finished the final cut of the film on November 6, 2017, with the final sound mix also completed along with the musical score a week later, on November 13.\n\nWriting for \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis indicated some high points in the costume design used in the film stating, \"The costume designer Ann Roth subtly brightens Katharine, taking her from leaden gray to free-flowing gold.\".\n\nThe score for the film was written by John Williams; it is his 28th collaboration with Spielberg. The music is a combination of traditional orchestral instrumentation and what Williams has called \"very light, computerised electronic effects.\" Williams was originally attached to write the music for Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", but, because both films had similar post-production schedules, Williams chose to work on \"The Post\", while Alan Silvestri composed for \"Ready Player One\". Spielberg has said that \"The Post\" was a rare instance in which he went to the recording sessions \"having not heard a note\" in advance.\n\nRecording began on October 30, 2017 in Los Angeles. The soundtrack was released digitally by Sony Classical Records on December 22, 2017 and in physical form on January 12, 2018.\n\n\"The Post\" premiered at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. on December 14, 2017. It began a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 22, 2017, and a wide release on January 12, 2018. The film is distributed internationally through Amblin Partners' distribution agreements with Universal Pictures, Reliance Entertainment, and Entertainment One Films. The film was released by Reliance in India. Tom Hanks expressed disinterest in appearing at a potential White House screening for Donald Trump.\n\nThe first official image from \"The Post\" was released on October 31, 2017. The trailer for \"The Post\" premiered exclusively on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", on November 7, 2017, and the film's poster, designed by BLT Communications, was released the next day. The first TV spot, titled \"Uncover the Truth\", was released on November 21, 2017.\n\n\"The Post\" was released on Digital HD on April 3 and on Blu-ray/DVD April 17 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\n\n\"The Post\" grossed $81.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $97.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $179.8 million, against a production budget of $50 million.\n\nDuring \"The Post\"s limited opening weekend, December 22 to 24, it grossed $526,011 (and a total of $762,057 over the four-day Christmas weekend) from nine theaters. The following weekend, the film grossed $561,080 for a per-theater average of $62,342, one of the highest of 2017. The film had its wide release alongside the openings of \"The Commuter\", \"Paddington 2\" and \"Proud Mary\", and was projected to gross around $20 million from 2,819 theaters over the weekend. It made $5.9 million on its first day and $18.6 million over the weekend (and a four-day MLK weekend total of $23.4 million), finishing second at the box office behind holdover \"\". 66% of its opening weekend audience was over the age of 35. It dropped 37% the following weekend to $12.2 million, finishing 4th behind \"Jumanji\" and newcomers \"12 Strong\" and \"Den of Thieves\". It dropped to 5th in its third week of wide release, grossing $8.9 million.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 352 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Post\" period setting belies its bitingly timely themes, brought compellingly to life by director Steven Spielberg and an outstanding ensemble cast.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 63% of audience members gave the film a \"definite recommend\".\n\nAlonso Duralde of \"TheWrap\" praised the acting and Spielberg's direction, though he noted the script was too on-the-nose at times, saying, \"\"The Post\" passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama: it makes us understand that decisions validated by the lens of history were difficult ones to make in the moment, and it generates suspense over how all the pieces fell into place to make those decisions come to fruition.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film an A– and wrote: \"Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles, but \"The Post\" is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution hasn't been this much fun since \"Hamilton\".\"\n\nChris Nashawaty, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", gave the film a positive review, but also compared it with previous journalism films such as \"All the President's Men\" stating, \"Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow. But if you look at \"The Post\" next to something like \"All the President's Men\", you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it. That's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film. But it's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one.\"\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" awarded the film an NYT Critic's Pick with a strong acknowledgment of Spielberg as director saying, \"Mostly, (the \"Post\" decision to publish) went down fast, a pace that Mr. Spielberg conveys with accelerated rhythms, flying feet, racing cameras and an enjoyably loose approach to the material. With his virtuosic, veteran crew, Mr. Spielberg paints the scene vividly and with daubs of beauty; most notably, he creates distinct visual realms for the story's two main overlapping, at times colliding worlds. Katharine reigns over one; at first she's all but entombed in her darkly lighted, wood-paneled empire. Ben rules the other, overseeing the talking and typing warriors of the glaring, noisily freewheeling newsroom\".\n\nMatt Bobkin, writing for \"Exclaim!\", gave the film a 6 out of 10 score, saying the film \"has all the makings of an awards season hit, but is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate.\"\n\nThe film downplays the original role that \"The New York Times\" had in breaking the \"Pentagon Papers\" and emphasizes \"The Washington Post\"'s subsequent involvement. In an interview with the \"Columbia Journalism Review\", former \"New York Times\" associates James Greenfield, who coordinated the \"Pentagon Papers\" project as the \"Times\" foreign editor; James Goodale, the\"Times\" general counsel at the time; and Max Frankel, the \"Times\"' Washington bureau chief when the \"Papers\" were published\",\" criticized the film's more minor portrayal of the paper. \"The New York Times\" had not only published the \"Pentagon Papers\" before \"The Washington Post\", but had also set the stage for the major legal battle between the press and the United States government. The newspaper also won the 1972 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its contributions. \n\nThe 1972 Pulitzer jury of journalists noted in their recommendation not only the significance of Daniel Ellsberg's \"Pentagon Papers\" leak, but also that of \"Times\" reporters Neil Sheehan, Hedrick Smith, Fox Butterfield and E. W. Kenworthy, and stated that their effort was \"a combination of investigative reporting, analysis, research, and writing — all of which added to a distinctly meritorious public service, not only for readers of The Times but also for an entire nation.\" Goodale noted in an article for \"The Daily Beast\" that the \"Times\" published the \"Papers\" after Ellsberg had leaked them to Sheehan, and further stated that the film \"creates a false impression that the Post was a major player in such publication. It's as though Hollywood had made a movie about the Times' triumphant role in Watergate.\" On \"PBS NewsHour\", Goodale further said, \"Although a producer has artistic license, I think it should be limited in a situation such as this, so that the public comes away with an understanding of what the true facts are in this case . . . And I think that if you're doing a movie now, when [President Donald] Trump is picking on the press for 'fake news', you want to be authentic. You don't want to be in any way fake.\"\n\n\n"}

The center is responsible for the appropriate use of history and military records throughout the United States Army. Traditionally, this mission has meant recording the official history of the army in both peace and war, while advising the army staff on historical matters. CMH is the flagship organization leading the Army Historical Program.\n\nThe center traces its lineage back to historians under the Secretary of War who compiled the \"Official Records of the Rebellion\", an extensive history of the American Civil War begun in 1874. A similar work on World War I was prepared by the Historical Section of the Army War College.\n\nThe modern organization of the army's historical efforts dates from the creation of the General Staff historical branch in July 1943 and the subsequent gathering of a team of historians, translators, editors, and cartographers to record the official history of World War II. They began publication of the \"United States Army in World War II\" series, which numbers 78 volumes, in 1946. Since then, the Center has produced detailed series on the Army's role in the Korean and Vietnam Wars and has begun a series on the U.S. Army in the Cold War. These works are supplemented by monographs and other publications on a mix of topics.\nSince its formation, the center has provided historical support to the Army Secretariat and Staff, contributing background information for decision making, staff actions, command information programs, and public statements by army officials. It has expanded its role in the areas of military history education, the management of the army's museum system, and the introduction of automated data-retrieval systems. The center's work with army schools ensures that the study of history is a part of the training of officers and noncommissioned officers. Much of this educational work is performed at field historical offices and in army museums.\n\nUnder the direction of the chief of military history and his principal adviser, the army’s chief historian, CMH’s staff is involved in some 50 major writing projects. Many of these efforts involve new research that ranges from traditional studies in operational and administrative history to the examination of such areas as procurement, peacekeeping, and the global war on terror. Those works under way and projected are described in the Army Historical Program, an annual report to the Chief of Staff on the Army’s historical activities. All center publications are listed in the catalog \"Publications of the United States Army Center of Military History,\" which explains how to access them.\n\nIn addition, army historians maintain the organizational history of army units, allowing the center to provide units of the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve with certificates of their lineage and honors and other historical material concerning their organizations. The center also determines the official designations for army units and works with the army staff during force reorganizations to preserve units with significant histories, as well as unit properties and related historical artifacts.\n\nCMH also serves as a clearinghouse for the oral history programs in the army at all levels of command. It also conducts and preserves its own oral history collections, including those from the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and the many recent contingency operations. In addition, the center’s end-of-tour interviews within the Army Secretariat and Staff provide a basis for its annual histories of the Department of the Army.\n\nAs tangible representations of the service’s mission, military artifacts and art enhance the soldier’s understanding of the profession of arms. CMH manages a system of more than 120 army museums and their holdings, encompassing some 450,000 artifacts and 15,000 works of military art. The Center also provides professional museum training, staff assistance visits, teams of combat artists such as those deployed under the Vietnam Combat Artists Program, and general museum support throughout the army. Current projects include the establishment of a National Museum of the United States Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and a complementary Army Heritage and Educational Center at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Chief of Military History is responsible for ensuring the appropriate use of military history in the teaching of strategy, tactics, logistics, and administration. This mission includes a requirement that military leaders at all levels be aware of the value of history in advancing military professionalism. To that end, the center holds a biennial history conference and workshop; publishes \"Army History\", a professional bulletin devoted to informing the larger military history education community; and supplies readings for the army school system, including the ROTC community, and texts and other support for the army’s staff ride program. In this effort, the chief of military history is assisted by a historical advisory committee that includes leading academic historians and representatives of the army school system.\n\nStaff rides enable military leaders to retrace the course of a battle on the ground, deepening their understanding of the recurring fundamentals of military operations. As one of the army’s major teaching devices, staff rides are particularly dependent on a careful knowledge of military history. Center historians lead rides directed by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff and attended by senior members of the army Staff.\n\nIt administers the army’s Command History Program, to provide historical support to army organizations worldwide. In addition, since the first Persian Gulf War, the center has coordinated the deployment of military history detachments and the collection of historical data during peacekeeping and wartime operations, including those in northern Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nTo stimulate interest in military history in the army and the nation, CMH sponsors professional programs.\n\nCMH’s art and documents collections, library, and reference services are available to private researchers. Official priorities permitting, its historians, curators, and archivists advise researchers on military history and stand ready to share their expertise concerning the location of sources. The Collections Branch of the Museum Division arranges temporary loans of paintings and drawings from the Army Art Collection to private organizations that agree to display the art publicly in accordance with Army regulations. The army’s museums and historical holdings throughout the country and abroad are generally open to the public, and their curators are available to answer reference questions. As a secured facility, requests for an appointment at Fort Lesley J. McNair must be made at least a week in advance.\n\n\nThe following publications provide additional information about the activities, services, and products of the Center of Military History:\n\n"}
{"id": "53941328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53941328", "title": "Warkworth's Chronicle", "text": "Warkworth's Chronicle\n\nThe Warkworth's Chronicle, now stylized \"Warkworths\" \"Chronicle\", is an English chronicle formerly ascribed to John Warkworth, a Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. Known from only two manuscripts, it covers the years 1461–1474 and provides information on the recording and reception of historical events including the accession of King Edward IV and the murder of King Henry VI.\n\nFor a long time the chronicle was known from only a single manuscript, Cambridge, Peterhouse, MS 190, fols. 214v – 225r. Not until 1972 was a second copy discovered, by Lister M. Matheson, in Glasgow Library, MS Hunterian 83, fols 141r – 148v; the chronicle had been overlooked since the catalogue of Hunterian manuscripts incorrectly listed its contents. In both manuscripts, Warkworth follows the \"Brut\" Chronicle, as a continuation; that version of the \"Brut\" ended in 1419 and is continued until 1461, with the additional text pulled from one of the \"Chronicles of England\" printed by William Caxton, itself a continuation of the \"Brut\". Matheson concluded that the continuation in Hunterian 83, covering the years 1461–1474, was added to the manuscript in 1484, and was thence copied into Peterhouse 190, likely under Warkworth's supervision. A third manuscript, British Library MS. Harley 3730, is incomplete but contains material similar or identical to that of the Hunterian and Peterhouse manuscripts.\n\nJohn Warkworth was Master of Peterhouse from 1473–1500, and he owned the \"Brut\" Chronicle of Peterhouse 190; for this reason the Warkworth Chronicle was ascribed to him as well, and thus named \"Warkworth Chronicle\". Alexander Kaufman describes how Matheson changed its appellation: \"Matheson chose to remove the italics from Warkworth and place the name instead in quotation marks to signify John Warkworth's involvement with the manuscript that contained the chronicle that was, at one time, attributed to him\".\n\nThe author, says Matheson, must have been a Northerner (based on orthographic and linguistic evidence), \"an educated man with some sense of proportion and critical discrimination\", likely a bibliophile with access to many texts and connected to the Peterhouse library. Since he was allowed to make additions to a manuscript in that library he must have had a certain standing. Matheson calculates that the author may have been in his late twenties when he wrote the chronicle and identified Roger Lancaster (d. 1502) and Thomas Metcalf (d. 1503), both Yorkshiremen, as the most likely candidates from the list of fellows of Peterhouse.\n\nIt was first published in 1839 by the Camden Society, edited by James Halliwell-Phillipps, and reprinted in facsimile in 1988 and 1990. Lister Matheson published an edition (collated from the two manuscripts) as \"Death and Dissent: Two Fifteenth-Century Chronicles\" (Boydell & Brewer, 1999).\n\nThe chronicle covers the events of 1461 to 1474; it is \"a well-known and frequently cited source\" for that period. Matheson notes that the account of the first eight years are \"confused\", but that it improves from the account of the rebellion led by Robin of Redesdale (1469). It is especially valuable since it covers \"the turbulent events in [the North of] England in 1470 and 1471\", since sources for that period are difficult to come by and since it offers a \"more provincial viewpoint\" in contrast to chronicles produced in London. Given the general propagandistic tone of contemporary chronicles that document the Wars of the Roses, the chronicle is \"generally moderate\" in tone, even though its probable author was \"a Yorkshireman whose sympathies lay with Richard III\".\n\nThe descriptions of historical events are accompanied by a number of marvels or portents, which can be organized in two categories: natural phenomena, such as a heat wave and an incident of unstinting rain and flooding, which presage political turmoil; and true marvels, including two occurrences of the bleeding of the corpse of King Henry VI in 1471, and the appearance of a headless man crying \"Bowes, bowes, bowes\" on Dunsmore Heath in Warwickshire. Kaufman suggests that the man might be a barghest, \"a fiend that is attached to a specific place\", and that \"bowes\" is a conjugation of the verb \"to bow\", that is, the barghest signifies that in these difficult times it is good \"to bend down in reverence, to be obedient and submit to God's will\".\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1968 by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, the yeshiva has several branches in Israel and the United States, and spawned several educational programs for Diaspora Jews.\n\nThe name of the yeshiva is an acronym for Israel Torah Research Institute, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit. From its founding, the yeshiva was officially called \"Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Tiferes Avraham – Itri\" (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Glory of Abraham – Itri). After the death of its founder, Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, in 2009, the name was changed to \"Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Zehav Mordechai – Itri\" (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Gold of Mordechai – Itri).\n\nYeshivas Itri was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, an American-born educator who was a close student of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Rabbi Aryeh Leib Malin and Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik. He married the granddaughter of Yaakov Yosef Herman. The initial student body comprised 60 kollel students, but enrollment soon expanded with unmarried yeshiva students. The yeshiva met for several years in the Orient House hotel in East Jerusalem. Elefant successfully relocated it to the premises of an old British Mandate hospital in the southeast of the city, near the Arab village of Beit Safafa, in the 1970s. Students were housed in adjacent apartments.\n\nBy 1971, enrollment was at 250 students, the majority from the United States. The yeshiva received funding from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, government sources, and private donations.\n\nOver time, the institution grew to encompass a kollel, yeshiva gedola, yeshiva ketana, and Talmud Torah. Branches of the yeshiva were also opened in Hadera and in the United States.\n\nIn 1999 yeshiva administrator Rabbi Chaim Weiss and businessman David Appel were suspected of embezzling NIS 9 million from yeshiva coffers during Elefant's medical leave. The police investigation carried on for years; by 2014, police theorized that the stolen money was meant to pay for the defense of Aryeh Deri, who was convicted on charges of fraud and bribery in 2000.\n\nSeveral educational programs for Diaspora Jews were spun off from Yeshivas Itri. They include:\n\n\n\n\nElefant founded the Kiryat Itri neighborhood in northern Jerusalem in 1967, the year before he established the yeshiva. This Orthodox Jewish housing development, adjacent to Kiryat Mattersdorf and designed for 250 families, was undertaken in cooperation with the Jewish Agency for Israel to encourage American Jewish immigration to Israel. Rabbi Nathan Kamenetsky, an instructor at Yeshivas Itri, lived in Kiryat Itri with his family.\n\n"}
