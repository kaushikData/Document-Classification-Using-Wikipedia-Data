The office of \"Bobohizan\" or \"Bobolian\", is also the chief preserver of Momolianism, i.e. the philosophy and way of life of the Kadazan-Dusun people.\n\nOne of the primary roles of a \"Bobohizan\" is to appease the rice spirit Bambaazon during harvest festival or Kaamatan. During the event, she will lead a procession of people from her village through the paddy field under the full moon, to give thanks and to seek a bountiful harvest for the rice-cultivating Kadazan-Dusun people. A \"Bobohizan\" also plays a role as a mediator between the spirits and the people. One of the commonest duties of a \"Bobohizan\" is to heal and cure illnesses with herbal remedies and rites.\n\n\"Bobohizan\" is said to stem from the first ancestors of the Kadazan-Dusun people, \"Kinoingan\" and his wife \"Suminundu\". It is not certain whether the calling of \"Bobohizan\" (\"Bobolian\" in the Bundu-Liwan dialect) exist prior to or after the settling of the ancestors at Nunuk Ragang. Long after the first ancestors passing to \"Hibabou\" (Heaven), the rites, prayers, and incantations (\"Rinait\" or \"Inaait\") were lost and forgotten. This is when Suminundu sent a spirit to earth to teach the people about the \"rinait\". The spirit came every evening, calling upon anyone brave enough to learn. The call was repeated for years but no one was brave enough to come forth until one day a brave woman went out and meet the spirit in the dark. She soon learned the art of \"rinait\" and rites from the spirit and passed it on to other women in the village. According to legend, because of the woman who was brave enough to meet the spirit, all \"Bobohizan\" in Penampang was by custom, women only.\n\nA \"Bobohizan\" plays a pivotal role in a daily life of the Kadazan people before the advent of Christianity. This ranges from appeasing the rice spirit during 'Kaamatan and Magavau festivals, appeasing the skull spirits during the Magang celebration, appeasing and offering sacrifices to the spirits of the sacred jars (\"gusi\") and to exorcise evil spirits. \"Bobohizans\" are also involved in charms, reading omens and to a lesser extent augury.\n\n"}

The participants were at the time subnational divisions of Ukraine.\n\nThe international community widely condemned the Declaration of Independence. A major source of criticism was that the referendum's adoption came after the building of the Supreme Council of Crimea was seized by the Russian military prior to adoption. During that time, no journalists were allowed inside the building to witness the council seating on the referendum. The Council seating on the referendum was not included the in Supreme Council's original schedule, which had no meetings originally scheduled for March 11, 2014. Deputies were forcefully brought to the building by Russian militants, and there is no evidence that there was quorum, which was a requirement for the seating to even occur. Further evidence of undemocratic tampering in the referendum was that the Sevastopol local election results recorded an impossible 123% support in favour of independence from Ukraine.\n\nThe document reads as follows:\n\nRussia had officially recognized the Republic of Crimea as an independent state and agreed to incorporate the Republic into Russian Federation. However, the international community condemned the referendum as undemocratic and illegal.

{"id": "670666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=670666", "title": "Derby Museum and Art Gallery", "text": "Derby Museum and Art Gallery\n\nDerby Museum and Art Gallery was established in 1879, along with Derby Central Library, in a new building designed by Richard Knill Freeman and given to Derby by Michael Thomas Bass. The collection includes a gallery displaying many paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby; there is also a large display of Royal Crown Derby and other porcelain from Derby and the surrounding area. Further displays include archaeology, natural history, geology, military collections and world cultures. The Art Gallery was opened in 1882.\n\nThe museum can trace its start to the formation of the Derby Town and County Museum and Natural History Society on 10 February 1836. The society was housed by Full Street Public Baths but it was a private society funded by its members' subscriptions. Its collections were created by donations initially from Dr Forrester who had been a President of Derby Philosophical Society. The patron of the Museum Society was William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the President was Sir George Crewe who was a keen naturalist. Col. George Gawler contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor in South Australia. In 1839 a major exhibition was held at the Mechanics' Institute which contained many items including those from Joseph Strutt's collection. Many of these made their way into Derby Museum's collection. The society moved in 1840 to the Athenaeum in Victoria Street. The society's collections grew in 1856 and they were first offered for incorporation into the town by William Mundy, but the offer was rejected.\n\nIn 1857, Llewellyn Jewitt became secretary and the museum was opened to the general public on Saturday mornings. In 1858 the Derby Philosophical Society moved to a house on the Wardwick in Derby as it merged with what was called the Derby Town and County Museum and the Natural History Society. This move included the society's library of 4,000 volumes, mathematical and scientific apparatus and its collection of fossils. In 1863 the botanist Alexander Croall was appointed the first Librarian and Curator and the following year the museum and library were joined together. Croall left in 1875 to become the curator of the Smith Institute in Stirling.\n\nThe Derby Town and County Museum was finally transferred into the ownership of Derby Corporation in 1870, but there were difficulties in finding space to display the collections. After placing all the artefacts into storage for three years, the museum was finally opened to the public on 28 June 1879. The Art Gallery opened in 1882 and in 1883 the museum had electricity supplied for new lighting.\n\nIn 1936 the museum was given a substantial collection of paintings by Alfred E. Goodey who had been collecting art for 50 years. At his death in 1945 he left £13,000 to build an extension to the museum. The extension, which now houses the museum, was completed in 1964. Refurbishment to parts of both the new and old buildings were undertaken in 2010–11.\n\nIn 2012, over 1,000 items were stolen from the museum's storage facility between 2 May and 19 June. The museum did not know about the theft until they accessed the facility to remove an item from storage. Stolen items included coins, medals, and watches. A man was charged with receiving stolen goods in connection with the theft in January 2013.\n\nDerby was significant in the eighteenth century for its role in the Enlightenment, a period in which science and philosophy challenged the divine right of kings to rule. The enlightenment has many strands, including the largely philosophical \"Scottish enlightenment\" centred around the philosopher David Hume, and political changes that culminated in the French revolution, but the English Midlands was an area where many key figures of industry and science came together. The Lunar Society included Erasmus Darwin, Matthew Boulton, Joseph Priestley and Josiah Wedgwood with Benjamin Franklin corresponding from America. Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, started the Derby Philosophical Society when he moved to Derby in 1783.\n\nSome of the paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby, which are renowned for their use of light and shade, are of Lunar Society members. The Derby Gallery possesses over 300 sketches and 34 oil paintings by Wright, and also holds a document collection. One of the paintings is entitled \"The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher's Stone\" (1771) and it depicts the discovery of the element phosphorus by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. A flask into which a large quantity of urine has been boiled down is seen bursting into light as the phosphorus, which is abundant in urine, ignites spontaneously in air.\n\n\"A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery\" shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the sun, and an actual orrery is on display in the centre of the gallery in front of the painting. The Scottish scientist, astronomer and lecturer James Ferguson undertook a series of lectures in Derby in July 1762. They were based on his book \"Lectures on Select Subjects in Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics &c.\", published in 1760. In order to illustrate his lectures he used various machines, models and instruments. Wright possibly attended Ferguson’s lecture, especially as tickets for the event were available from John Whitehurst, his close neighbour, the clockmaker and scientist. The artist could also have drawn on Whitehurst's practical knowledge to find out more about the orrery and its operation.\n\nThese factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the airpump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science. These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry which began the undermining of the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later scientists worldwide would find themselves persecuted, or even put to death in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789, itself the culmination of enlightenment thinking. Joseph Priestley, member of the Lunar Society and discoverer of oxygen would flee Britain after his laboratory in Birmingham was smashed and his house burned down in the Birmingham riots of 1791, by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution; and his colleague Lavoisier in France would be executed at the guillotine. The politician and philosopher Edmund Burke, in his famous \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain \"considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump\". In the light of this comment, Wright's painting of the bird in the air pump, completed over twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.\n\nBecause of this web of connections related to science, and the tensions it created which were so subtly illustrated by the art of the painter Joseph Wright of Derby, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, far from being just a collection of fine paintings as the casual visitor might imagine, is significant for being in a place that some would see as having a very significant role in the birth of modern science and industry worldwide. Birmingham, with its science and industry, has been described as the 'silicon valley' of the eighteenth century.\n\nErasmus Darwin has only a small display. Herbert Spencer, friend of Charles Darwin and originator of the phase \"the survival of the fittest\", who was born in Derby and has been described as the founder of sociology, does not appear to be mentioned at all.\nIn 2011, Derby City Council announced that it was to use Joseph Wright of Derby to brand the city of Derby. At the same time, the Museum announced that it was \"joining forces\" with Wikipedia to improve the quality of its information. In February 2011 the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) announced that it had awarded Designated status to Derby Museum and Art Gallery for its nationally significant holdings of paintings and drawings by Joseph Wright.\n\nA replica of the room in Derby where Bonnie Prince Charlie held his council of war in 1745, while on his way south to seize the British crown. The paneling is from the original Exeter House, which was demolished in 1854. At the time of demolition, the panels were brought to the museum, which then received related objects as donations. Queen Victoria provided an original letter of Bonnie Prince Charlie from her own collection.\n\nBesides the Wright collection there are also works by Benjamin West, E.E. Clark, Robert Priseman, Harold Gresley, Alfred John Keene, Georg Holtzendorff, David Payne, George and William Lakin Turner, William Wood, Ernest Townsend, Samuel and Louise Rayner.\n\nThe Soldier’s Story gallery is dedicated to the history of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, the Sherwood Foresters and the Derbyshire Yeomanry.\n\nA fragment of a cross shaft from Repton includes on one face a carved image of a mounted man which, it has been suggested, may be a memorial to Æthelbald of Mercia. The figure is of a man wearing mail armour and brandishing a sword and shield, with a diadem bound around his head. In 757, Æthelbald was killed at Seckington, Warwickshire, near the royal seat of Tamworth and buried at Repton, Derbyshire. If this is Æthelbald, it would make it the earliest large-scale pictorial representation of an English monarch.\n\nThe museum has a large collection of items from the Bretby Art Pottery.\n\n"}

He is the son of Dory Funk and brother of Terry Funk, and was the promoter of the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion. He is credited with the invention of the Texas cloverleaf submission hold and runs the Funking Conservatory, a professional wrestling school.\n\nFunk held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once. He is the fifth-longest reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time, holding it for over four years. He also held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once and the CWA World Heavyweight Championship once. He is a 2009 WWE Hall of Fame inductee. He is working for All Japan Pro Wrestling as the Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) chairman.\n\nFunk's career in professional wrestling began in 1963 just after a college football career with West Texas State University (now West Texas A&M University), culminating in a 15 to 14 victory over Ohio University in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. Funk's first match was a victory over Don Fargo in Amarillo, Texas. West Texas State University All American Jerry Logan was in Funk's corner and Fargo's brother, Jim, was in his corner. Funk was supported by the whole West Texas State University football team and the Tascosa High School amateur wrestling team. He was doing his student teaching as coach of the Tascosa High wrestling team under coach James Kyle.\n\nFunk started in his father's Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion and fought Harley Race, Iron Mike DiBiase and Wild Bull Curry. He demonstrated a rugged hard-hitting style that gained attention. He would eventually move on to Florida, Missouri and Japan where his skills improved as he used uppercut forearm smashes, a variety of suplexes and leglocks. Funk won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Gene Kiniski on February 11, 1969 in Tampa, Florida with a spinning toe hold and remained NWA World Champion for the next four and a half years, which is the second-longest uninterrupted reign of any NWA World Champion (Lou Thesz held the NWA world title from November 27, 1949, to March 15, 1956). Dory and Terry are the only brothers in history to each hold the title. Funk finally lost the NWA World Championship on May 24, 1973 after a hurried recovery from a pickup truck accident on his father's Flying Mare Ranch in West Texas. Dory was forced into the ring in Kansas City, losing the belt to Harley Race. Race held the title only a few months before dropping it to Brisco. In truth his father told the NWA board of directors that he didn't want Dory Jr. to lose to fellow face Jack Brisco, so Race was given the nod instead. He performed regularly throughout the NWA, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and Ontario as a heel, Georgia, Florida and Central States regions, through the 1970s and early 1980s. In Toronto he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship. In 1984, he and his brother Terry competed in a tag team match against Bruiser Brody and Stan Hansen that later received a 5-star rating by Dave Meltzer. As well they had a series of matches against Abdullah the Butcher and The Sheik. In Tokyo they were placed against each other in a tournament and Dory won the match.\n\nIn 1986, Dory (given the nickname \"Hoss\") made his WWF debut in a team alongside his brother Terry. The brothers performed at WrestleMania 2 defeating the Junkyard Dog and Tito Santana. Terry left the WWF shortly after WrestleMania, but Dory remained, mostly tagging with storyline brother Jimmy Jack Funk, who in truth had no relation to the Funk family. He made an appearance for WCW at the Slamboree 1993: A Legends Reunion Pay-Per-View, wrestling Nick Bockwinkel to a time limit draw. He also made a single appearance with the WWF as a participant in the 1996 Royal Rumble.\n\nFunk is now the Coach of the Funking Conservatory Professional Wrestling School in Ocala, Florida and teaches the Dory Funk Method of Professional Wrestling. Dory's students included Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, Christian Cage, Lita, Kurt Angle, Mickie James, Edge, Ted DiBiase and Test. His wife Marti runs BANG TV in which Dory`s matches are featured. On March 1, 2008, Funk and Nishimura defeated Genichiro Tenryu and Masanobu Fuchi in Funk's retirement match via spinning toe hold.\n\nOn the February 16, 2009 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Dory along with his brother Terry would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2009 by Dusty Rhodes. On the April 1, 2010 edition of TNA Today, Funk appeared on the show to have an interview with Jeremy Borash.\n\nOn October 27, 2013, Funk returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling, teaming with Terry in a tag team match, where they wrestled Masanobu Fuchi and Osamu Nishimura to a twenty-minute time limit draw. Funk was then announced as the new Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) chairman. Funk returned to All Japan on July 27, 2014, teaming with Osamu Nishimura and Yutaka Yoshie in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Masanobu Fuchi, Takao Omori and Último Dragón, with Funk submitting Fuchi for the win. Funk's next match with All Japan took place on May 31, 2015, when he and Nishimura wrestled Fuchi and Yoshiaki Fujiwara to a twenty-minute time limit draw. The day before at age 74 he teamed with old student Tenryu and Nosawa Rongai for Tenryu Project to beat Kohei Suwama, Hikaru Sato and Atsushi Aoki. He returned to All Japan the next month to team with Fuchi and Ultimo Dragon to beat his student Nishimura, Masao Inoue and Soma Takao.\n\nDory married his first wife, Jimmie, on June 8, 1960. Together, they have three children: Dory III, Adam Dirk, and Penny. They also have five grandchildren. They later separated and were officially divorced on July 6, 1983. Dory III went into medicine and now practices out of Colorado. Dory IV is now training to be a wrestler under Dory Jr. In 1980, Dory met his second and current wife, Marti; the couple married in 1989. He has two children.\n\n\n"}

Austria was a case held before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) case where the court upheld a domestic court's fine on an Austrian woman who had called Mohammed a pedophile. \n\nThe applicant, E.S., is an Austrian national who was born in 1971 and lives in Vienna.\n\nIn October and November 2009, Mrs S. held two seminars entitled “Basic Information on Islam”, in which she discussed the marriage between the Prophet Muhammad and a six-year old girl, Aisha, which allegedly was consummated when she was nine. Inter alia, the applicant stated that Muhammad “liked to do it with children” and “… A 56-year-old and a six-year-old? … What do we call it, if it is not paedophilia?”.\n\nOn 15 February 2011 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court found that these statements implied that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies, and convicted Mrs S. for disparaging religious doctrines. She was ordered to pay a fine of 480 euros and the costs of the proceedings. Mrs S. appealed but the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the decision in December 2011, confirming in essence the lower court’s findings.\n\nThe statement that the Austrian woman originally said was:\n\nOnly where expressions under Article 10 went beyond the limits of a critical denial, and certainly where they were likely to incite religious intolerance, might a state legitimately consider them to be incompatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion and take proportionate restrictive measures.\n\nThe court noted that the domestic courts comprehensively explained why they considered that the applicant’s statements had been capable of arousing justified indignation; specifically, they had not been made in an objective manner contributing to a debate of public interest (e.g. on child marriage), but could only be understood as having been aimed at demonstrating that Muhammad was not worthy of worship\n\nFurthermore her statements were partly based on untrue facts and apt to arouse indignation in others. The national courts found that Mrs S. had subjectively labelled Muhammad with paedophilia as his general sexual preference, and that she failed to neutrally inform her audience of the historical background, which consequently did not allow for a serious debate on that issue. Hence, the court saw no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ qualification of the impugned statements as value judgments which they had based on a detailed analysis of the statements made.\n\nThe court held further that even in a lively discussion it was not compatible with Article 10 of the Convention to pack incriminating statements into the wrapping of an otherwise acceptable expression of opinion and claim that this rendered passable those statements exceeding the permissible limits of freedom of expression.\n\nThe case was subject to much misinformation in public reporting, including the accusation that the judgment \"imposed\" a blasphemy law in Europe. Nevertheless, it was a source of concern for human rights commentators. The International Humanist and Ethical Union, an INGO concerned with humanist advocacy and repeal of blasphemy laws, was \"frustrated\" that the court did not uphold the complainant's Article 10 rights, criticising the court's \"timidity\".\n\nThe British charity Humanists UK, which campaigns on similar issues internationally, criticised the ruling as \"fundamentally at odds with the spirit and tradition of free expression in Europe\" expressed hope the case would be appealed and overturned in the Grand Chamber. It criticised the court's rationale in balancing the Article 10 right it is sworn to protect against \"a previously nonexistent right to protection of one’s ‘religious feelings’\".\n\nWriting in \"The Atlantic\", Simon Cottee expressed serious concerns about the judgment, saying \"it has given legitimacy to what is in all but name an Austrian blasphemy law, and by invoking the slippery notion of “religious peace,” it has effectively given a veto to those who would deploy violence in defense of their religious beliefs.\"\n"}
{"id": "38132270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38132270", "title": "European Case Law Identifier", "text": "European Case Law Identifier\n\nThe European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) is an identifier for case law in Europe, implemented by the European Union Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Patent Office and several EU Member States. The identifier consists of 5 parts separated by colons: ECLI:[country code]:[court identifier]:[year of decision]:\"[specific identifier]\". The system contains also a set of uniform metadata to improve search facilities for case law. The standard is laid down in the Council Conclusions inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law of the European Union.\n\nThe concept of ECLI was first launched at the Legal Access Conference (Paris, December 2008) and at Jurix Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law in Florence (December 2008). \nAround the same time, the study by a task group of the EU Council Working Group on e-Law showed that accessibility of judicial decisions, both at the national and European level, was seriously hampered by the lack of standardised identifiers and metadata:\n\"The task group suggested to establish a voluntary common identification system based on the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI). ECLI as an identifier would be linked to an index with references. This would enable any citizen or legal practitioner to find any decision to which ECLI has been attributed from any public or private register or database in the EU. In addition a Dublin-core implementation for case-law should be established to facilitate searching case-law in different search engines.\"\n\nBased on the report of this task group, the Council of Ministers agreed on the principles of ECLI and common metadata, and asked the EU Council Working Party on Legal Data Processing (e-Law) to elaborate the initial work. This continued work resulted in the Council Conclusion inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law of the European Union., decided upon by the Council of Ministers on 22 December 2010. It was published in the Official Journal of 29 April 2011 (2011/C 127/01).\n\nECLI does not primarily identify a paper or electronic document containing a judgment, but instead identifies the judgment at a more abstract level. In the terminology of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records on which it is based, ECLI is a work-level identifier. It is constructed with the intention to be meaningful, open, technological neutral, recognisable for both humans and computers, error-proof and interoperable with other identifiers. \nThe formatting rules for ECLI are prescribed in detail in the Annex to the Council Conclusions. Summarized, an ECLI always consists of five parts, separated by a colon: \nOnly the Latin alphabet is to be used, and that ECLI is case-insensitive, although it is written preferably in capitals. \nAn example of a case law identifier of the Rotterdam court is ECLI:NL:RBROT:2013:5042, which indicates a Dutch decision (NL) of 2013 of the Rotterdam court (RBROT) with serial number 5042.\n\nAccording to paragraph 4 of the Annex to the Council Conclusions an ECLI website has to be set up, containing\nThe ECLI website was set up within the frame work of the e-justice portal of the European Union and contains this information.\n\nAccording to paragraph 5 of the Annex to the Council Conclusions an ECLI search interface has to be set up, enabling search by ECLI and metadata. \nThis ECLI search engine launched on 4 May 2016.

The latter document also has English and French metadata.\n\nDocuments are indexed by the ECLI search engine in cooperation between the European Commission and data providers, using the sitemaps protocol and robots.txt.\n\nThe Council of Ministers is responsible for any future changes in the standard, while the European Commission is responsible for the ECLI-website and the (planned) ECLI search interface. The Commission is also responsible for handing out 2 letter \"country codes\" for international organisations that use the system.\n\nEvery Member State (or other entity that wishes to participate in the ECLI system, including the EU itself) must have a national ECLI co-ordinator. The main responsibilities of this national ECLI co-ordinator are: \n\nAccording to the Council Conclusions, Member States are free to decide on their own implementation route. A big-bang scenario is possible, but also a step-by-step approach is allowed. International organizations may also participate and can request a \"country code\" from the European Commission.\n\nAustria started the introduction of ECLI in the beginning of 2014. Currently the ECLI is assigned to judgments of the , the , the , the and the . The national ECLI co-ordinator in Austria is the Federal Chancellery.\n\nSince the first of April 2012 in the Czech Republic decisions of the Supreme Court have an ECLI, e.g. 'ECLI:CZ:NS:2012:6.TDO.1416.2012.1'. The national ECLI co-ordinator in the Czech Republic is the Supreme Court.\n\nStarting in March 2014, the decisions of the Constitutional Court also use ECLI.\n\nIn March 2016 ECLI was implemented on the open data portal of Finland.\n\nFrance started assigning ECLI's to judgments of the Council of State (Conseil d'Etat) and Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) in September 2012. ECLI's of the Council of State can be found on Legifrance, e.g. 'ECLI:FR:CESSR:2013:358751.20130123'. Judgments of the Supreme Court have an ECLI on the website of the Court, e.g. 'ECLI:FR:CCASS:2013:AV00005'. Also all published decisions of the Constitutional Council (Conseil Constitutionnel) have an ECLI assigned. With regard to the only decisions from 2012 on have an ECLI. The national ECLI co-ordinator in France is .\n\nIn Germany the ECLI was introduced for the Federal administrative court on 23 September 2013. An example of an ECLI from this court: . In 2015 ECLI was also introduced for the Constitutional Court and the Federal Labour Court. The national ECLI co-ordinator in Germany is the Competence center for the federal legal information system of the Federal Office of Justice. ECLI is also available for 100 000 decisions of the courts of North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nIn Malta 'Courts of Malta' is the national ECLI co-ordinator. According to the information supplied by Malta, ECLI has been introduced in December 2011 for all new court decisions, but the code is as of August 2014 not visible to the public.\n\nThe decisions of the Council of State have an ECLI and are available through the ECLI search engine. The country code for Greece is EL, and the court code for the council of state is COS.\n\nIn the Netherlands the Council for the Judiciary is the national ECLI co-ordinator. On 28 June 2013 ECLI was introduced for all courts, replacing the national identifier. ECLI is not only assigned to those decisions published on the national judicial portal website Rechtspraak.nl, but also to those published in commercial law reviews and those stored in an internal database of the judiciary. In total, more than 2 million decisions have been assigned an ECLI.\n\nIf a decision previously has had an LJN, this code (two letters and four digits) has been transposed to the fifth part of ECLI. E.g. LJN BN5158, a decision of the court of appeal Den Bosch, is now . Decisions which are published after the introduction of ECLI have a serial number in the fifth part of ECLI. E.g. , a decision by the district court of Rotterdam.\n\nBoth a list of the most used court codes and a full list of all court codes can be found at the website of the judiciary. The full ECLI register and all decisions published on the portal are also available as open data. The register covers all judicial organizations of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, including the parts which are outside the European Union.\n\nHaving started in January 2017, a beta version of the Portuguese portal was released in May 2017, Portugal assigns an ECLI to all judicial decisions which have been rendered after 1932 on a total of 175 000 decisions. The country code for Portugal is PT. The national ECLI co-ordinator in Portugal is the Judicial High Council, and the Portal is being developed by a team of the Information Division of Judicial High Council. An example of a Portuguese ECLI is 'ECLI:PT:TRP:2017:671.14.0GAMCN.P1'. The Portuguese ECLI portal url is https://jurisprudencia.csm.org.pt\n\nSlovakia assigns an ECLI to all judicial decisions which have been rendered after 25 July 2011. Also judgments rendered before that date, but appealed after it have an ECLI assigned.\n\nHaving started on 1 October 2011, Slovenia was the first country to assign ECLI's to judgments on their judiciary website. ECLI is assigned to all judgments of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeal. An example of a Slovenian ECLI is 'ECLI:SI:VSRS:2012:III.IPS.15.2012'.\n\nIn November 2014 the Council of the Judiciary in Spain assigned ECLI to all judgments published in its public case law database. ECLI is based on the national case law identifier 'ROJ'. E.g. for ROJ 'ROJ: STS 12/2014' the ECLI is 'ECLI:ES:TS:2014:12'. The first character of the ROJ-code, indicating the type of decision (in this example the 'S' of 'sentencia'), is not used in the ECLI.\n\nThe European Patent Office (an organ of the European Patent Organization, which has 38 Member States in Europe) is one of two not-EU related organisations which has introduced ECLI.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights - connected to the Council of Europe - introduced ECLI in 2015 retroactively in its HUDOC case law database. The country code is 'CE' (Council of Europe), the court code is 'ECHR'. The fifth part of the ECLI identifier contains from left to right: the month the document was rendered (2 digits), the day the document was rendered (2 digits), the type of document ('JUD' for judgment, 'DEC' for decision, 'REP' for report) and finally the application number (with leading zeros to a total of nine digits). The Pretto judgment can serve as an example ECLI:CE:ECHR:1983:1208JUD000798477.\n\nThe European Patent Office introduced ECLI publicly in 2013 with \"country-code\" EP retroactively. An example is of a case before the Board of Appeal (BA) from 1991 is: ECLI:EP:BA:1991:W000491.19910131.\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union is the 'national' ECLI co-ordinator for the EU and introduced ECLI on 24 March 2014. ECLI is assigned to all decisions of the Court and opinions of the Advocate General. The institution uses three court codes, which also include decisions of its legal predecessors Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Communities:\nThe fifth part of the ECLI code is serial number, that has no relation to any other identifier. ECLI is now also used when the Court is citing its own case law. For this the Court uses the ECLI without the prefix 'ECLI:'. This is explained by the Court as: \n\"In the interest of not extending the reference to no good purpose, the prefix ‘ECLI' will not be included in the citation of the decisions of the Court of Justice, the General Court or the Civil Service Tribunal,\"\nSince 24 March 2014 the case law of the Court of Justice can also be searched by ECLI on EUR-Lex and since 4 May 2016 all case law is also available on the ECLI search engine.\n\nMetadata are to be attached to documents containing a judicial decision. They can relate to the ECLI itself (on the bibliographic work level, e.g.: date of the decision), but also to a specific editorial version (the 'expression level', e.g. a summary). In the Council Conclusions nine mandatory and eight optional metadata are listed. All these are based on the Dublin Core metadata standard. The mandatory means that without these metadata, a document can not be indexed by the future ECLI search interface.\n\nThe mandatory metadata, as listed in the Annex to the Council Conclusions, are: \n\nThe optional metadata, as listed in the Annex to the Council Conclusions, are: \n\n\n"}

It included approximately 80,000 books, serials, pamphlets, compact discs, microfilms, atlases, maps, and databases. A large portion consisted of unpublished manuscripts that were rare or unique to the collection. The materials in the collection related to every state in the United States and the District of Columbia. While the focus was on the United States, there were resources for other nations as well.\n\nThe Everton Genealogy Collection was started in 1947 by Walter Everton when he established the Everton Publishing Company. He and his successors in the company gathered items to be included in this collection. Some were donated, but most were added when they were sent to be reviewed in their magazine, \"The Genealogical Helper\". Over the course of nearly sixty years, the collection gradually grew to its present size.\n\nIn 2001, the publishing company was purchased by the Family History Network, Inc. and in 2004, then owner Bill Schjelderup, donated the collection to Logan City. In October 2006 the collection opened to the public in the former Logan Justice building. In early 2008, the collection was closed to the public while city departments shuffled buildings.\n\nIn 2010, a condensed collection opened to the public within the Logan Library in the space formerly occupied by the Logan Municipal Council. It is no longer identified as the Everton Collection but continues to be a large portion of the items housed in the library's Virginia Hansen Special Collections Room.\n"}

Considered illegal or inappropriate, these actions were conducted over the span of decades, from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. William Colby, who was the CIA director in the mid-1970s and helped in the compilation of the reports, dubbed them the \"skeletons\" in the CIA's closet. Most of the documents were publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy. The non-governmental National Security Archive had filed a FOIA request fifteen years earlier.\n\nThe reports that constitute the CIA's \"Family Jewels\" were commissioned in 1973 by then CIA director James R. Schlesinger, in response to press accounts of CIA involvement in the Watergate scandal—in particular, support to the burglars, E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, both CIA veterans. On May 7, 1973, Schlesinger signed a directive commanding senior officers to compile a report of current or past CIA actions that may have fallen outside the agency's charter. The resulting report, which was in the form of a 693-page loose-leaf book of memos, was passed on to William Colby when he succeeded Schlesinger as Director of Central Intelligence in late 1973.\n\nInvestigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed some of the contents of the \"Family Jewels\" in a front-page \"New York Times\" article in December 1974, in which he reported that:\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency, directly violating its charter, conducted a massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation during the Nixon Administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States according to well-placed Government sources.\n\nAdditional details of the contents trickled out over the years, but requests by journalists and historians for access to the documents under the Freedom of Information Act were long denied. Finally, in June 2007, CIA Director Michael Hayden announced that the documents would be released to the public at an announcement made to the annual meeting of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations. A six-page summary of the reports was made available at the National Security Archive (based at George Washington University), with the following introduction:\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency violated its charter for 25 years until revelations of illegal wiretapping, domestic surveillance, assassination plots, and human experimentation led to official investigations and reforms in the 1970s.\n\nThe complete set of documents, with some redactions (including a number of pages in their entirety), was released on the CIA website on June 25, 2007.\n\nThe reports describe numerous activities conducted by the CIA during the 1950s to 1970s that violated its charter. According to a briefing provided by CIA Director William Colby to the Justice Department on December 31, 1974, these included 18 issues which were of legal concern:\n\nThen-President of Cuba, Fidel Castro, who was the target of multiple CIA assassination attempts reported in these documents, responded to their release on July 1, 2007, saying that the United States was still a \"killing machine\" and that the revealing of the documents was an attempt at diversion. David Corn of the liberal / progressive magazine \"The Nation\" wrote that one key 'jewel' had been redacted and remained classified. Writing for \"The New York Times\", Amy Zegart wrote: \"Given all the illegal activities actually listed in this document, the hidden sections are all the more disturbing.\"\n\nAccording to the Family Jewels documents released, members of the American mafia were involved in CIA attempts to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The documents showed that the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Johnny Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests. Roselli introduced Maheu to mobster leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante, Jr.. Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Gianacana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro's food.\n\n\n"}

It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0, released on 3 June 2015.\n\nIn the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory codice_1, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.\n\nMost of these directories exist in all Unix-like operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS, and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.\n\nMost Linux distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and declare it their own policy to maintain FHS compliance. GoboLinux and NixOS provide examples of intentionally non-compliant filesystem implementations.\n\nSome distributions generally follow the standard but deviate from it in some areas. Common deviations include:\n\nModern Linux distributions include a codice_20 directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in codice_21 but this was a problem in some cases because this directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using codice_22, codice_23, codice_24 or codice_25 directories, even though the device directory isn't intended for such data. Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only.\nFor example, below are the changes Debian made in its 2013 Wheezy release:\n\nFHS was created as the FSSTND (short for \"Filesystem Standard\"), largely based on similar standards for other Unix-like operating systems. Notable examples are these: the hier(7) description of file system layout, which has existed since the release of Version 7 Unix (in 1979); the SunOS filesystem(7) and its successor, the Solaris filesystem(5).\n\n\n"}

It is a simple tool that relies on seven primary indicators which are categorized into a Material Well-being Index and a Spiritual Well-being Index. It was launched on September 23, 2016 at a Fordham conference entitled \"Pope Francis' Call for Escaping Poverty\" co-sponsored by the Vatican Foundation \"Centesimus Annus Pro Pontifice.\" The research was conducted by students from Fordham's Graduate Program in International Political Economy and Development(IPED), under the research direction of Dr. Henry Schwalbenberg. The Fordham Francis Index is a response to the Pope's Address to the United Nations in New York last September 25, 2015.\n\nPope Francis’ Address to the United Nations was part of his apostolic journey to Cuba, the United States of America and to the United Nations Organization Headquarters on the occasion of his participation at the \"Eighth World Meeting of Families\" in Philadelphia from 19–28 September 2015.\nIn his speech at the UN, he stated that: “the simplest and best measure and indicator of the implementation of the new Agenda for Development will be effective, practical and immediate access, on the part of all, to essential material and spiritual goods: housing, dignified and properly remunerated employment, adequate food and drinking water; religious freedom and, more generally, spiritual freedom and education. These pillars of integral human development have a common foundation, which is the right to life and, more generally, what we could call the right to existence of human nature itself.”\n\nThe Fordham Francis Index is a broad measure of global poverty - it is based on a small number of indicators that are strongly correlated with many aspects of development and can therefore serve as a proxy for overall success in achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. It is also an innovative measure of human well-being since it explicitly attempts to measure spiritual welfare.\n\nSelection of these well-being indicators took into consideration availability of data for many countries, credibility of the data source, and the breadth of its measure. These 7 primary indicators are categorized into two areas: Material Well-being and Spiritual Well-being.\n\n * Water – the percentage of a population using an improved drinking water source\n\n * Education – Adult literacy rates\n\nThe approach to computing the Fordham Francis Index is identical to the methodology employed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in their calculation of the Human Development Index (HDI). Using the same methodology means that any differences between the two indices are solely attributed to substantive differences in their components. The Fordham Francis Index is an equally weighted geometric mean of Material Index and Spiritual Index.\n\nThe Material Index and Spiritual Index are also equally weighted geometric means of the standardized value of their primary indicators. To achieve this, the primary indicators were transformed into standardized formula so that they each yielded indices with values between 0 and 1. Measures of food, employment and religious freedom were inverted so that for all seven measures a higher number would represent a more desirable outcome.\n\nFor details and results, refer to the latest IPED Publication of the report: https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/11505/fordham_francis_index_2018.pdf\n"}

The \"Gazetteer\" was published in secret by the British government in India in 1908 and 1915 and it served as a handbook for British diplomats in the Arabian Peninsula and Persia.\n\nThe work was declassified in 1955 under the fifty-year rule, and was widely praised for its extensive coverage of the region's history and geography. It is considered to be \"the most important single source of historical material on the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia\" from the 17th to early 20th century.\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, the British Empire sought to strengthen its connections to British-controlled India which in turn resulted in a greater interest in the Persian Gulf region, culminating in the visit of the Viceroy of India Lord Curzon to the Gulf in 1903. To ensure that British agents in the region were adequately informed and prepared to strengthen their influence in the region, a light-weight and easily accessible handbook was needed.\n\nIn November 1903, the British authorities commissioned John Gordon Lorimer, a member of the Indian Civil Service serving in the North-West Frontier Province, to compile such a document. Lorimer was initially given six months to accomplish the task, but repeatedly insisted on being granted more time to ensure the work was completed thoroughly. Placed under special duty and with a team of researchers, over the next 10 years data was collated from government archives in Calcutta and Bombay, and from multiple field expeditions to the Gulf.\n\nThe gazetteer is a 5000-page document divided into two volumes; the first details the region's history and the second details its geography. The geography portion of the gazetteer was completed first and was published in 1908. The history portion of the gazetteer was only completed and published in 1915, one year after Lorimer himself died in a shooting accident.\n\nTitled \"History, geography and genealogy\", the volume was split into three sections which were divided by ethnicity. Section 1 (the Arab section) was dedicated to the history of the Persian Gulf, central Arabia and Ottoman Iraq. Section 2 (the Persian section) regarded the history of Persia with particular reference to the predominantly-Arab populated region of Arabistan. Section 3 consisted of 19 genealogical charts pertaining to the ruling families of the region. The research was compiled from Lorimer's own notes and the work of colleagues such as J.A. Saldanha and C.H. Gabriel and ranged from the 17th to the 20th centuries.\n\nTitled the \"Geographical and Statistical\" section, this is a 2000-page document and lists an extensive alphabetical arrangement of tribes and settlements across the region, divided into different countries. The data was obtained through research missions carried out by Lorimer and his group. Also in the volume are 56 reproduced images of the region taken from colonial records and two maps showing the distribution of pearling sites and the overall political geography.\n\nClassified \"for official use only\", the gazetteer was published in secrecy in 1908 and 1915 respectively with only dozens of copies in circulation. As such, there was no public awareness of the existence of the work. Consequently, Lorimer's obituary makes no mention of the gazetteer. He was credited as the author only when the work was declassified in 1955.\n\nIn 1971, \"The Times Literary Supplement\" praised the historical coverage of the work as \"stupendous\" and its geographical section as \"without modern substitute\". The gazetteer, although drawn from British sources and written from a British perspective, is still regarded as a valuable resource for the serious researcher.\n\nThe gazetteer was digitised and made available online by the Qatar Digital Library in January 2015.\n\n"}

They depend on information to develop products and services, make critical strategic decisions, protect property rights, propel marketing, manage projects, process transactions, service customers, and generate revenues. This critical information is contained in the organizations' business records. \nIt has not always been easy to describe what \"good recordkeeping\" looks like. Yet, this question gains in importance as regulators, shareholders, and customers are increasingly concerned about the business practices of organizations.\n\nARMA International recognized that a clear statement of \"Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles®\" (The Principles) would guide:\n\n\nThe principles identify the critical hallmarks of information governance, which Gartner describes as an accountability framework that \"includes the processes, roles, standards, and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.\" As such, they apply to all sizes of organizations, in all types of industries, and in both the private and public sectors. Multi-national organizations can also use the Principles to establish consistent practices across a variety of business units.\n\nThe Maturity Model for Information Governance begins to paint a more complete picture of what effective information governance looks like. It is based on the eight principles as well as a foundation of standards, best practices, and legal/regulatory requirements. The maturity model goes beyond a mere statement of the principles by beginning to define characteristics of various levels of recordkeeping programs. For each principle, the maturity model associates various characteristics that are typical for each of the five levels in the model:\n\n\nThe Information Governance Maturity Model will assist an organization in conducting a preliminary evaluation of its recordkeeping programs and practices. Thoughtful consideration of the organization's practices should allow users to make an initial determination of the maturity of their organization’s information governance. Initially, it is not unusual for an organization to be at differing levels of maturity for the eight principles. It is also important to note that the maturity model represents an initial evaluation. In order to be most effective, a more in-depth analysis of organizational policies and practices may be necessary.\n\nThe maturity model will be most useful to leaders who wish to achieve the maximum benefit from their information governance practices.

It is written by Claudio Sanchez, illustrated by Christopher Shy, and published by Evil Ink Comics\n\nThe story of Good Apollo takes a step outside the science fiction narrative of the first three chapters and examines the life of the Writer, a character who is crafting the lives of the protagonist Claudio and his companions in the form of a fictional story. The graphic novel alternates between the two different worlds of Claudio the Writer and Claudio the Character, which can be confusing for one unacquainted with the concept as the Writer and Character are similar in appearance.\n\nThe novel opens with a dream taking place in the mind of Claudio the Character, in which he sits in priest's garb in the Writer's study looking upon the phrase \"God Only Knows\" scrawled in front of him in blood (a line repeated in the song \"Mother May I\"). He is approached by several skeletal figures begging for Claudio to save them. As their protests become more emphatic and they begin to overwhelm Claudio, he realizes he is dreaming and forces himself to awaken by stabbing himself in the hand with a screwdriver. Aboard his uncle Jesse's ship, the Grail Arbor, he explains the dreams to Jesse and his daughter Chase as the enslaved souls of the Keywork pleading for liberation. Jesse and Chase (who appears to have some prophetic power) believe the only way to free them is by destroying Heaven's Fence and that Claudio is a messiah-like figure called the Crowing who has the power to do this. Claudio, however, is having trouble accepting this daunting role.\n\nThe novel's focus now shifts to the Writer, who resides in Rockland County, New York. He is haunted by memories of a former lover, Erica Court, who had been unfaithful. The Writer suffers a series of delusions involving the death of Erica at his hands. These visions make up the song \"Welcome Home\" on the Good Apollo album. Suddenly, the Writer's window is broken and then someone apparently steals his ten-speed bicycle. As the Writer walks off to investigate, the novel re-enters the story with an exchange between the story's villains, Supreme Tri-Mage Wilhelm Ryan and his General, Mayo Deftinwolf, in which they vaguely speak of Claudio's role as the Crowing and their plans to crush him and the rebellion his uncle Jesse has been leading against the Mages of Heaven's Fence. Back aboard the Grail Arbor, Claudio is awakened from a nightmare about his lost family by the Prise Ambellina. They discuss a plan formulated by Jesse to penetrate the defenses of Apity Prime, a planet in the Omega star system, by landing in the city of Kalline, which is adjacent to Wilhem's lair, the House Atlantic. Claudio needs to get there to fulfill his destiny as the Crowing, however he points out that the opening in the defenses is likely a trap and argues further with Chase and Ambellina about his role, which he still doubts. Jesse explains the plan to the pilot of the Grail Arbor, who also expresses doubts, and the group prepares for the final assault on the forces of Wilhelm Ryan.\nIn the Writer's world, he has wandered off into deeper hallucinations, arriving at the house of Newo Ikkin, a fictional character from his story and his character's former love interest, and witnessing Claudio the character speak to Newo's dog Apollo, as he had written in his story before (Claudio utters the phrase \"Good Apollo, where shall I begin?\" At the end of the first track on , The Ring In Return, one can hear a voice quietly saying \"Hello Apollo. Where shall I begin?\" It's believed the slight differentiation was accidental). In Newo's place is Erica Court, and the Writer's bicycle has taken on a demonic persona, Ten Speed of God's Blood and Burial, and begins speaking with him. The Writer is seeking a way to end the story, which Ten Speed claims he can provide if he kills Ambellina (though the Writer thinks Ten Speed wants him to kill Erica). Exact quotes of their bickering can be heard during part of the song, \"Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial),\" from the Good Apollo album. The exchange ends with Claudio saying \"You say a lot of things. And how's that work? You're a bicycle.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a rebel strike team has disabled the generator on Kalline, allowing the Grail Arbor to land. Mayo springs his trap, destroying the strike force by unleashing one of the beast-like Priests upon them. As the Arbor prepares to land, more of the Writer's delusions are portrayed, including Erica's murder at the hands of the Writer using the same poison Mayo gave to Coheed to kill his children in the Second Stage Turbine Blade. This delusion makes up the song \"Once Upon Your Dead Body\" on the Good Apollo album. While Mayo prepares for the rebel's ground assault, Ten Speed explains that he doesn't actually want the Writer to murder Erica, but rather to exact his vengeance metaphorically by killing Ambellina, who represents Erica's good side in the story, which will in turn cause Claudio to accept his destiny as the Crowing and destroy the Keywork; an ending for the story.\n\nMayo's trap comes to full fruition as a planetary defense cannon called a Jackhammer is fired into the Grail Arbor when it tries to land, damaging it. The Arbor retreats while Claudio, Ambellina, Jesse, Chase, and Jesse's other IRO-bot children abandon ship and land on the surface of Apity Prime. Ambellina and Claudio split off from the group while Jesse and his children stay behind to confront Mayo. As Ten Speed and the Writer further argue about the fate of Ambellina, Jesse delivers a final goodbye to his children who proceed to mutate into monstrous forms and attack Mayo's forces. Jesse confronts Mayo and is killed by him in hand-to-hand combat when Mayo rips Jesse's heart out of his body.\n\nClaudio and Ambellina arrive at a mirror (the Willing Well) in which they can see the Writer's argument with Ten Speed take place. Claudio and Ambellina then combat a Priest in front of the mirror, resulting in Ambellina being injured. As the battle takes place, the Writer is swept further into his delusion by the skeletal figures the Character dreamt of earlier, who, apparently at the behest of a hallucinated Erica Court, take him to a large, winged guillotine and have him beheaded. Erica hauntingly says \"This is no beginning. This is the final cut\"—a phrase repeated as the chorus of the song \"The Willing Well IV: The Final Cut\" on the Good Apollo album. The Writer awakens from this delusion, once again finding himself at the house of Newo Ikkin, and decides to take Ten Speed's advice. Passing through the mirror into his own story, the Writer sees Claudio has made the transformation into his powerful role as the Crowing after witnessing Ambellina's injury at the hands of the Priest. Ignoring the Writer's command to stop, Claudio kills the Priest and proceeds to confront the Writer. The Writer explains he must kill Ambellina for his own peace of mind, so that the story may have an ending. The Crowing furiously declares, \"My God is a coward!\" The Writer kills Ambellina, easily overwhelming Claudio's resistance despite his newfound power as the Crowing. As Ambellina dies in Claudio's arms, she professes that she would have loved Claudio had she been able. The Writer walks off into the distance with his bicycle, leaving Claudio with the cryptic message \"You're Burning Star IV.\" He also tells Claudio to listen to the Vishual (Chase) and that \"all worlds from here must burn,\" implying that it is the Crowing's duty to destroy the Keywork.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23962884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23962884", "title": "Inventory (library)", "text": "Inventory (library)\n\nInventories are the one method that libraries use to determine whether some items in their collection are in need of preservation or conservation activities. A modern inventory might involve examining item by item with a barcode scanner and a laptop, with the objective of adjusting bibliographic and item records in theirs and OCLC's WorldCat databases.\n\nLibraries have thousands of books; large academic libraries may have millions of books;. Doing an annual (or less frequent) physical inventory with the laying on of hands on each individual item may not be practical for several reasons. It may not be financially feasible, employees required may not have extra time to devote to such an inventory, and there are no financial rewards for the Library for completing an inventory. Problems that are discovered (books in need of repurchase, rebinding, repair, or digitization) may require solutions that are expensive and labor-intensive. Because of these restraints, inventories may not take place for decades, if ever, at large academic institutions. By contrast, complete inventories are often a regular part of the school library media specialist's job at K-12 institutions, where inventory may be a legal requirement that shows that the libraries are accountable for the money they have spent throughout the year. Checking for lost books and materials can be similarly compared to auditing.\n\nAlthough collecting new materials is viewed as a central mission of the library, maintaining the condition of library collections, which includes less satisfactory activities such as weeding, book repair, shifting and counting what libraries think they have on their shelves, are also a vital part of the library's mission to provide access to current patrons, as well as those people who will use the library at some point in the future.\n\nInventories help guarantee that the collections as listed in Online public access catalogs and Finding aids do not lack integrity. School libraries also use the inventory to assess the collection (numbers, age and ratio:student) against benchmarks of accrediting institutions, and also to examine each resource and determine its future in the collection based on age, relevance, currency and condition—which may include repair, replacement, disposal or cleaning to ensure that attractive, up-to-date resources are available for patrons. Inventory can also identify anomalies in the catalog and provide an opportunity to correct catalog records and labeling of items. This is also a time when shelves can be rearranged to minimize overcrowding to prevent damage.\n\nSampling is a compromise measure, which can be an important management tool. Random sampling of library collections can give a quick and clear assessment measure of a collection — whether the books are present, and whether those books present are in good physical condition. In 1982, the California State University libraries, suggested inventory procedures to insure that the 19 campus collections were secure and intact. They recognized that a complete regular inventory was too expensive, and decided that the best method of assessing book loss would be to use sampling. Every three years, a sample was to be taken of an identified number of items in each Library of Congress letter classification. If loss rates were more than 1% for two years in a row, this would indicate that a full inventory was needed.\n\n\"A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection. If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections' records is just as reliable. However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections' records.\"\n\nFirst, it must be determined if the entire collection, including stacks, reference and special collections will be sampled together or if just a particular area will be analyzed. At the University of Illinois, their bookstacks included government publications and the Asian library, but these special holdings were not included in their study. Unbound items may also be excluded.\n\nNext, the Library needs to decide upon the size of its sample. More datapoints, of course result in more accurate data about the collection. There are two types of errors possible in sampling: tolerance and confidence. Tolerance is the unexact percentage, a maximum deviation from the nominal error value, for example, a survey question may be accurate for 85-95% of the population, it could also be stated 90% ±5; in this case, the tolerance is five. Confidence is the second error, measuring the certainty of a true answer within the limits stated in the tolerance. If there is a 90 per cent confidence, it is predicted that if the sample study is repeated ten times using different samples, but with the same tolerance, then the results would be accurate for nine of those studies out of ten.\n\nIn the table below, for a tolerance of ±5%, the sample sizes for a collection of more than 50,000 books would be 381 items for 95% confidence, and 648 items for 99% confidence. To achieve a lower tolerance of ±1% one would have to sample thousands of books, which might stretch the resources available for even a sample inventory. Surveying 270 to 655 volumes is much more reasonable for the average-sized library staff.\n\nAn alternative for counting hundreds of books in a given random sample is to count until you know that you do or do not have a problem. The Prescott Memorial Library at Louisiana Tech employed sequential analysis in the late 1980s when working on automation of the collections.\n\nRandom selection of the books can take place in a couple of different ways. If in addition to the physical condition of items, a library also wants to know whether items are missing from shelves, random samples should be generated from the library's integrated library system (ILS). If librarians are just accessing the collection for preservation purposes, they can easily count ranges, columns, shelves and books and use Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet software to create random samples. It should be noted, however, that misplacement of books on shelves does have associated costs—in the patron's satisfaction with the library's services and in staff time trying to locate missing books. It may be well worth the extra time to figure out how to extract random items from your library's ILS to complete your sample.\n\nOnce librarians are laying hands on individual books in their sample, what do they look for? They should check the cover of the book for discoloration, peeling, damage. Then they should open the book and look at the pages of the text—are they yellowing, brittle? An archival marking pen may be used to determine whether a book is acidic. How is the binding? Are the pages intact? This data can be recorded in a spreadsheet for use of later analysis of the entire sample. Include the item's call number, place of publication, place of production, publication date, measurements (spine height, cover width, depth of back to front cover, the amount of shelving space surrounding the item, horizontally and vertically); describe the case style, leaf attachment and binding condition, text attachment, acidity, paper strength, and text contrast ; list the damaged pages and describe the enclosure type and condition; record any additional notes that will be useful for future reference and analysis.\n\nCosts for sampling 384 random items at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1987 were less than $5000. The UIUC Library employed eleven graduate students from the school of library and information science, who received training and supervision. Each surveyor collected forty samples, 90% of the surveys were completed on the first day in 5.5 survey hours.\n\nInformation from samples can easily be recorded in Excel or some other spreadsheet program, where simple analysis can be performed. For preservation purposes, librarians want to know the condition of their collections: what percentage of the books are acidic? What percentage of the collection is damaged? Does more damage take place on cramped shelves? Does the library need to be concerned with books printed in Eastern Europe? Etc. After identifying the issues of primary concern in the collection, preservation measures should be considered. What needs to happen as soon as possible to preserve the collection? What choices can be delayed for some time? Does the library have a preservation plan in its collection management policy? Is there a budget for maintaining the collections? What can be extrapolated from the data about what might happen to the collection in ten to twenty years?\n\nUsing the results of the library's collection assessment, budgetary requests can be substantiated by data. The library needs an increase in budget to care for aging collections, or the library needs an increase in funding to add new materials for our students to meet deficiencies and weaknesses. This strategy was employed by the Joyner Library at East Carolina University after an inventory and shelf-analysis project in 2005.\n\nSampling can also be used to calculate optimum intervals for shelf reading. Average misplacement of books on a shelf in a university library is 5.6%. 65 percent of the books were located on the correct shelf, but not in the right order. Cooper and Wolthausen developed equations indicating that the optimal shelf-reading interval is a function of the number of books in a section, the likelihood that a book in one section will migrate to another, checking and users costs, and the error rate of the shelf reader.\n\n"}

{"id": "780817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=780817", "title": "Lightweight markup language", "text": "Lightweight markup language\n\nA lightweight markup language (LML), also termed a simple or humane markup language, is a markup language with simple, unobtrusive syntax. It is designed to be easy to write using any generic text editor and easy to read in its raw form. Lightweight markup languages are used in applications where it may be necessary to read the raw document as well as the final rendered output.\n\nFor instance, a person downloading a software library might prefer to read the documentation in a text editor rather than a web browser. Another application for such languages is to provide for data entry in web-based publishing, such as weblogs and wikis, where the input interface is a simple text box. The server software then converts the input into a common document markup language like HTML.\n\nLightweight markup languages were originally used on text-only displays which could not display characters in italics or bold, so informal methods to convey this information had to be developed. This formatting choice was naturally carried forth to plain-text email communications. Console browsers may also resort to similar display conventions.\n\nIn 1986 international standard SGML provided facilities to define and parse lightweight markup languages using grammars and tag implication. The 1998 W3C XML is a profile of SGML that omits these facilities. However, no SGML DTD for any of the languages listed below is known.\n\nLightweight markup languages can be categorized by their tag types. Like HTML (codice_1), some languages use named elements that share a common format for start and end tags (e.g. BBCode codice_2), whereas proper lightweight markup languages are restricted to ASCII-only punctuation marks and other non-letter symbols for tags, but some also mix both styles (e.g. Textile codice_3) or allow embedded HTML (e.g. Markdown), possibly extended with custom elements (e.g. MediaWiki codice_4).\n\nMost languages distinguish between markup for lines or blocks and for shorter spans of texts, but some only support inline markup.\n\nSome markup languages are tailored for a specific purpose, such as documenting computer code (e.g. POD, RD) or being converted to a certain output format (usually HTML) and nothing else, others are more general in application. This includes whether they are oriented on textual presentation or on data serialization.\n\nPresentation oriented languages include AsciiDoc, atx, BBCode, Creole, Crossmark, Epytext, Haml, JsonML, MakeDoc, Markdown, Org-mode, POD, reST, RD, Setext, SiSU, SPIP, Xupl, Texy!, Textile, txt2tags, UDO and Wikitext.\n\nData serialization oriented languages include Curl (homoiconic, but also reads JSON; every object serializes), JSON, OGDL, and YAML.\n\nMarkdown's own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since Markdown supports the inclusion of native HTML code, these features can be implemented using direct HTML. (Some extensions may support these features.)\n\ntxt2tags' own syntax does not support class attributes or id attributes; however, since txt2tags supports inclusion of native HTML code in tagged areas, these features can be implemented using direct HTML when saving to an HTML target.\n\nAlthough usually documented as yielding italic and bold text, most lightweight markup processors output semantic HTML elements codice_5 and codice_6 instead. Monospaced text may either result in semantic codice_7 or presentational codice_8 elements. Few languages make a distinction, e.g. Textile, or allow the user to configure the output easily, e.g. Texy.\n\nLMLs sometimes differ for multi-word markup where some require the markup characters to replace the inter-word spaces (\"infix\").\nSome languages require a single character as prefix and suffix, other need doubled or even tripled ones or support both with slightly different meaning, e.g. different levels of emphasis.\n\nHeadings are usually available in up to six levels, but the top one is often reserved to contain the same as the document title, which may be set externally. Some documentation may associate levels with divisional types, e.g. part, chapter, section, article or paragraph.\n\nMost LMLs follow one of two styles for headings, either Setext-like underlines or atx-like line markers, or they support both.\n\nThe first style uses underlines, i.e. repeated characters (e.g. equals codice_9, hyphen codice_10 or tilde codice_11, usually at least two or four times) in the line below the heading text.\n\nRST and Texy determine heading levels dynamically, which makes authoring more individual on the one hand, but complicates merges from external sources on the other hand.\n\nThe second style is based on repeated markers (e.g. hash codice_12, equals codice_9 or asterisk codice_14) at the start of the heading itself, where the number of repetitions indicates the (sometimes inverse) heading level. Most languages also support the reduplication of the markers at the end of the line, but whereas some make them mandatory, others do not even expect their numbers to match.\nPOD and Textile choose the HTML convention of numbered heading levels instead.\nOrg-mode supports indentation as a means of indicating the level.\nBBCode does not support section headings at all.\nHyperlinks can either be added inline, which may clutter the code because of long URLs, or with named codice_15 or numbered codice_16 references to lines containing nothing but the address and related attributes and often may be located anywhere in the document.\nMost languages allow the author to specify text codice_17 to be displayed instead of the plain address codice_18 and some also provide methods to set a different link title codice_19 which may contain more information about the destination.\n\nLMLs that are tailored for special setups, e.g. wikis or code documentation, may automatically generate named anchors (for headings, functions etc.) inside the document, link to related pages (possibly in a different namespace) or provide a textual search for linked keywords.\n\nMost languages employ (double) square or angular brackets to surround links, but hardly any two languages are completely compatible. Many can automatically recognize and parse absolute URLs inside the text without further markup.\n\nHTML requires an explicit element for the list, specifying its type, and one for each list item, but most lightweight markup languages need only different line prefixes for the bullet points or enumerated items. Some languages rely on indentation for nested lists, others use repeated parent list markers.\n\nLanguages differ on whether they support optional or mandatory digits in numbered list items, which kinds of enumerators they understand (e.g. decimal digit \"1\", roman numerals \"i\" or \"I\", alphabetic letters \"a\" or \"A\") and whether they support to keep explicit values in the output format. Some Markdown dialects, for instance, will honor a start value other than 1, but ignore any other explicit value.\n\nSlack assists the user in entering enumerated and bullet lists, but does not actually format them as such, i.e. it just includes a leading digit followed by a period and a space or a bullet character codice_20 in front of a line.\n\n\n"}

It is native to the eastern coast of North America.\n\nThe American anglerfish is unique in its appearance and has no relatives with which it can be confused in the areas where it is caught. A fish of lesser importance than other food fish in the region, such as cod, its various names suggest its unusual appearance - a very large mouth, more than twice the width of the tail, with several spines and strong teeth, enabling it to snare prey larger than itself. The body is flattened dorsoventrally to allow it to hide on the sea floor. The front of the head carries erectile spines, the primary of which has a flattened end to resemble a small organism or piece of algae. The pectoral fins are like wide fans behind the head, and the pelvic fins are like small hands below the head.\n\nThe American anglerfish can grow to a length of , but is a more usual size. The greatest recorded weight is and the greatest recorded age is 30 years.\n\nThe American anglerfish is found in the western Atlantic from Newfoundland and Quebec south to northern Florida, but is commoner in the more northerly parts of its range, north of Cape Hatteras. It is a demersal fish living close to the seabed at depths down to about . It is found on sand bottoms, gravel, shell fragments, mud and clay.\n\nThe American anglerfish is an ambush predator. It spends most of its time on the seabed partly covered in sediment waiting for suitable prey to pass. It can swim slowly or \"walk\" with the help of its pectoral fins. Its diet normally consists of fin and ray fish, squids, cuttlefish and occasionally carrion. After storms it has been reported on the sea surface where it has been recorded as catching seabirds.\n\nSpawning takes place in the summer with a peak in May and June. The eggs are large and are believed to be unique among fish in being attached to a floating mucus veil. The number of eggs in a veil can range from 1 to 3 million and the veil drifts on the surface of the sea. The eggs hatch after 6 to 100 days, depending on the sea temperature, and remain protected within the veil for a few days, absorbing nutrients from their yolk sacs. They then become pelagic and join other fish larvae in the \"ichthyoplankton community\". The larvae feed on zooplankton and look quite different from the adult fish, being laterally compressed and having long dorsal and pectoral fin rays. When about long they become juveniles, changing their appearance over a period of several weeks into the adult shape and starting to live on the seabed. They grow fast in their first year and more slowly thereafter.\n\nThe flesh of the anglerfish is located primarily in the body, less so in the \"shoulders\" and cheeks. The flesh is very white and moist, becoming quite firm when cooked. It is served both in soups and grilled, and is similar in texture to the flesh of crustaceans. Fillets are thick and boneless resembling crab or lobster tail. Connoisseurs believe the liver is also excellent. The fish is covered with a soft, scaleless, elastic skin, under which another thin edible membrane covers the flesh. Though much less so than in cod, one can sometimes find parasitic worms in the flesh of anglerfish, whose opacity can make them easier to find. Worms are usually found between the skin and outer portion of the flesh ranging in size from a few millimeters to over one inch.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added \"Lophius americanus\" or the American anglerfish to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\n"}

This toponym is roughly synonymous with the term the Greater Middle East.\n\nThe population of the MENA region at its least extent is estimated to be around 381 million people.

The term \"MENA\" is often defined in part in relation to majority Muslim countries that based on the countries located in the region, although several nations in the region are not majority Muslim-dominated.\n\nFrom April 2013, the International Monetary Fund started using a new analytical region called MENAP (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan), which adds Afghanistan and Pakistan to MENA countries.\nNow MENAP is prominent economic grouping in IMF reports.\n\nThe term MENAT has been used to include Turkey in the list of MENA countries.\n\nDue to rich resources, mainly oil and gas, combined with its location between three continents, (Asia, Africa and Europe), the MENA region has been in conflict since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire; notably due to the creation of Israel, a Jewish state among Arab and Muslim countries; Israeli–Palestinian conflict; the Iran–Iraq War; Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict; and the rise of terrorism. Conflict in the region had come to its highest peak so far in the 21st century, with incidents such as the U.S. intervention of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent Iraq War and the rise of ISIS; the Arab Spring, which spread war to throughout the region such as the Syrian Civil War, Libyan Civil War and Yemeni Civil War.\n\n"}

It was designed by Betty Moys and first published in 1968. It is used primarily in law libraries in many common law jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Moys system is designed to fit into a library that utilises Library of Congress Classification (LCC). The primary reason for this is that LCC had not fully developed the K class (the class for Law) at the time when the Moys system was developed. In addition, LCC is the main classification system used in academic libraries. This commonality is the rationale behind adopting the same notation style used in the . The subclasses and enumeration are very different in the two systems, though. As with LCC, a set of numbers follows the class letters to indicate specific subject areas (however there is notably less use of decimal points in the Moys system than in LCC).\n\nNote: Not all of these subclasses are mandatory, and certain classes may not be utilised in some libraries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1086830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1086830", "title": "Null-subject language", "text": "Null-subject language\n\nIn linguistic typology, a null-subject language is a language whose grammar permits an independent clause to lack an explicit subject; such a clause is then said to have a null subject.\n\nTypically, null-subject languages express person, number, and/or gender agreement with the referent on the verb, rendering a subject noun phrase redundant. In the principles and parameters framework, the null subject is controlled by the pro-drop parameter, which is either on or off for a particular language.\n\nFor example, in Italian the subject \"she\" can be either explicit or implicit:\n\nThe subject \"(s)he\" of the second sentence is only implied in Italian. English and French, on the other hand, require an explicit subject in this sentence.\nOf the thousands of languages in the world, a considerable number are null-subject languages, from a wide diversity of unrelated language families. They include Albanian, Arabic, Basque, Berber, Catalan, Chinese, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Romanian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Punjabi, Slavic languages, Spanish, Tamil and the Turkic languages, as well as most languages related to these, and many others still. In fact, it is rather the absence of pronoun dropping that is an areal feature of Standard Average European, including French, German, and English.\n\nIn the framework of government and binding theory of syntax, the term \"null subject\" refers to an empty category. The empty category in question is thought to behave like an ordinary pronoun with respect to anaphoric reference and other grammatical behavior. Hence it is most commonly referred to as \"pro\".\n\nThis phenomenon is similar, but not identical, to that of pro-drop languages, which may omit pronouns, including subject pronouns, but also object pronouns. While all pro-drop languages are null-subject languages, not all null-subject languages are pro-drop.\n\nIn null-subject languages that have verb inflection in which the verb inflects for person, the grammatical person of the subject is reflected by the inflection of the verb and likewise for number and gender.\n\nThe following examples come from Portuguese:\n\n\nAs the examples illustrate, in many null-subject languages, personal pronouns exist and can be used for emphasis but are dropped whenever they can be inferred from the context. Some sentences do not allow a subject in any form while, in other cases an explicit subject without particular emphasis, would sound awkward or unnatural.\n\nMost Bantu languages are null-subject. For example, in Ganda, 'I'm going home' could be translated as \"Ŋŋenze ewange\" or as \"Nze ŋŋenze ewange\", where \"nze\" means 'I'.\n\nArabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:\n\n\"Gəldim, gördüm, işğal etdim\" (\"Veni, vidi, vici\").\nLiteral translation: came, saw, conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\n\"Дойдох, видях, победих\" (\"Veni, vidi, vici\").\nLiteral translation: came, saw, conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\nIn Catalan, as in Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, etc., the subject is also encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.\n\nIn Catalan, one may choose whether to use the subject or not. If used in an inclined tone, it may be seen as an added emphasis; however, in colloquial speaking, usage of a pronoun is optional. Even so, sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence.\n\nMost varieties of Chinese tend to be non-null-subject. However, in certain circumstances, most Chinese varieties would remove the subjects, thus forming null-subject sentences. One of the instances where the subject would be removed is when the subject is known. Below is an example in Mandarin:\n\nThe above example clearly shows that a speaker could omit the subject if the doer of the verb is known. In a Chinese imperative sentence, like the first text, the subject is also left out.\n\nIn Emilian (a Gallo-Italic language) at least one pronoun (of two) is mandatory.\n\n\"Ήρθα, είδα, νίκησα\" (equivalent of \"Veni, vidi, vici\" in Latin).\nTransliteration: Írtha, eída, níkisa.\nLiteral translation: came, saw, conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\nHebrew is considered a partially null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:\n\nHebrew text: עזור לאחרים, יעזרו לך\nTransliteration: azor l'aherim, ya'azru lkha\nLiteral translation: help others, will-help you\nIdiomatic translation: you help others, they will help you.\n\nSubjects can usually be omitted only when the verb is conjugated for grammatical person, as in the third-person plural in the example above.\nIn Hebrew one can also construct null-subject sentences as in the Latin and Turkish language examples: \"We/they are going to the beach\" can be expressed as \"holkhim la-yam\" (הולכים לים), lit. \"Are going to the beach.\" This is truly a null-subject construction.\n\nAs in Spanish and Turkish though, Hebrew conjugates verbs in accordance with specific pronouns, so \"we went to the beach\" is technically just as much a null-subject construction as in the other languages, but in fact the conjugation does indicate the subject pronoun: \"Halakhnu la-yam\" (הלכנו לים), lit. \"Went (we) to the beach.\" The word \"halakhnu\" means \"we went\", just as the Spanish and Turkish examples indicate the relevant pronoun as the subject in their conjugation. So these should perhaps not be considered to be true null-subject phrases. \nPotentially confusing the issue further, is the fact that Hebrew word order can also make some sentences appear to be null-subject, when the subject is in fact given after the verb. For instance, \"it's raining\" is expressed \"yored geshem\" (יורד גשם) which means \"descends rain\" - rain is the subject. The phrases meaning \"It's snowing\" and \"It's hailing\" are formed in the same way.\n\nJapanese and several other null-subject languages are topic-prominent languages; some of these languages require an expressed topic in order for sentences to make sense. In Japanese, for example, it is possible to start a sentence with a topic marked by the particle \"wa\", and in subsequent sentences leave the topic unstated, as it is understood to remain the same, until another one is either explicitly or implicitly introduced. For example, in the second sentence below, the subject (\"we\") is not expressed again but left implicit:\n\nIn other cases, the topic can be changed without being explicitly stated, as in the following example, where the topic changes implicitly from \"today\" to \"I\".\n\nLatin text: Veni, vidi, vici. \nLiteral translation: (I) came, (I) saw, (I) conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\nLatin text: Cogito ergo sum. \nLiteral translation: (I) think, therefore (I) am.\nIdiomatic translation: I think, therefore I am.\n\n\"Дојдов, видов, победив\" (\"Veni, vidi, vici\").\nLiteral translation: came, saw, conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\n\"Myślę, więc jestem.\" (\"Cogito ergo sum\").\nLiteral translation: (I) think, therefore (I) am.\nIdiomatic translation: I think, therefore I am.\n\nIn Polish, the subject is omitted almost every time, although it can be present to put emphasis on the subject.\n\n\"Пришёл, увидел, победил\" (\"Veni, vidi, vici\").\nLiteral translation: came, saw, conquered.\nIdiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\nIn Spanish, as with Latin and most Romance languages, the subject is encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.\n\nIn Spanish, for the most part one may choose whether to use the subject or not. Generally if a subject is provided, it is either for clarity or for emphasis. Sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence.\n\n\"Geldim, gördüm, yendim\" (\"Veni, vidi, vici\").\nLiteral translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.\n\"Ben geldim, ben gördüm, ben yendim\"\nIdiomatic translation: \"I\" came, \"I\" saw, \"I\" conquered.\n\nVerb conjugations in Tamil incorporate suffixes for number (singular and plural) and person (1st, 2nd and 3rd), and also for gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) in the third person. An explicit subject, therefore, is unnecessary, and can be inferred from the verb conjugation.\n\nTamil script: முடிந்துவிட்டது \nTransliteration: muḍinduviṭṭadu\nLiteral Translation: It has left, having ended.\nActual Translation: It has come to an end.\n\nIn some cases (impersonal constructions), a proposition has no referent at all. Pro-drop languages deal naturally with these, whereas many non-pro-drop languages such as English and French must fill in the syntactic gap by inserting a dummy pronoun. \"*Rains\" is not a correct sentence; a dummy \"it\" must be added: \"\"It rains\"; in French \"Il pleut\". In most Romance languages, however, \"Rains\" can be a sentence: Spanish \"Llueve\", Italian \"Piove\", Catalan \"Plou\", Portuguese \"Chove\", Romanian \"Plouă\", etc. Uralic and Slavic languages also show this trait: Finnish \"Sataa\", Hungarian \"Esik\"; Polish \"Pada\"\".\n\nThere are constructed languages that are not pro-drop but do not require this syntactic gap to be filled. For example, in Esperanto, \"He made the cake\" would translate as \"Li faris la kukon\" (never \"*Faris la kukon\"), but \"It rained yesterday\" would be \"Pluvis hieraŭ\" (not \"*Ĝi pluvis hieraŭ\").\n\nOther languages (sometimes called non-null-subject languages) require each sentence to include a subject: this is the case for most Germanic languages, including English and German, as well as many other languages. French, though a Romance language, also requires a subject. In some cases—particularly in English, less so in German, and occasionally in French—colloquial expressions allow for the omission of the subject in a manner similar to that of Spanish or Russian:\n\nEven in such non-null-subject languages as English, it is standard for clauses in the imperative mood to lack explicit subjects; for example:\n\nAn explicit declaration of the pronoun in the imperative mood is typically reserved for emphasis:\n\nFrench and German offer less flexibility with respect to null subjects. \n\nIn French, it is neither grammatically correct nor possible to include the subject within the imperative form; the \"vous\" in the expression \"taisez-vous\" stems from the fact that \"se taire\", \"to be silent,\" is a reflexive verb and is thus the object with similar meaning to \"yourself\" in an English imperative.\n\nIn German, the pronoun (singular \"du\" or plural \"ihr\") is normally omitted from the informal second-person imperative (\"Mach das\", \"Do it\"), although it may be added in a colloquial manner for emphasis (\"Macht ihr das!\", \"\"You [guys]\" do it!\"). By contrast, the addressee-specific formal imperative requires the addition of the pronoun \"Sie\" (as in \"Machen Sie das!\", \"Do it, [sir/ma'am]!\") to avoid confusion with the otherwise morphologically identical infinitive, whereas the addressee-nonspecific or \"neutral\" formal imperative omits the pronoun and moves the verb to final position (as in \"Bitte nicht stören\", \"Please do not disturb\"). On the other hand, the pronoun \"wir\" is always included in the first-person plural imperative (\"Machen wir das!\", \"Let's do it!\"), with the verb appearing in first position to differentiate the imperative from the indicative mood, wherein the verb appears in second position (as in \"Wir machen das\", \"We're doing it\").\n\nMany international auxiliary languages, while not officially pro-drop, permit pronoun omission with some regularity.\n\nIn Interlingua, pronoun omission is most common with the pronoun \"il\", which means \"it\" when referring to part of a sentence or to nothing in particular. Examples of this word include\n\n\"Il\" tends to be omitted whenever the contraction \"it's\" can be used in English. Thus, \"il\" may be omitted from the second sentence above: \"Es ver que ille arriva deman\". In addition, subject pronouns are sometimes omitted when they can be inferred from a previous sentence:\n\nSimilarly, Esperanto sometimes exhibits pronoun deletion in casual use. This deletion is normally limited to subject pronouns, especially where the pronoun has been used just previously:\n\nIn \"official\" use, however, Esperanto admits of null-subject sentences in two cases only:\n\nContrary to the Interlingua example above, and as in English, a repeated subject can normally be omitted only within a single sentence:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23910198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23910198", "title": "Seiðr", "text": "Seiðr\n\nIn Old Norse, seiðr (sometimes anglicized as \"seidhr\", \"seidh\", \"seidr\", \"seithr\", \"seith\", or \"seid\") was a type of sorcery practiced in Norse society during the Late Scandinavian Iron Age. Connected with Norse religion, its origins are largely unknown, although it became gradually eroded following the Christianization of Scandinavia. Accounts of \"seiðr\" later made it into sagas and other literary sources, while further evidence has been unearthed by archaeologists. Various scholars have debated the nature of \"seiðr\", some arguing that it was shamanic in context, involving visionary journeys by its practitioners.\n\n\"Seiðr\" practitioners were of both sexes, although females are more widely attested, with such sorceresses being variously known as \"vǫlur\", \"seiðkonur\" and \"vísendakona\". There were also accounts of male practitioners, known as \"seiðmenn\", but in practising magic they brought a social taboo, known as \"ergi\", on to themselves, and were sometimes persecuted as a result. In many cases these magical practitioners would have had assistants to aid them in their rituals.\n\nIn pre-Christian Norse mythology, \"seiðr\" was associated with both the god Oðinn, a deity who was simultaneously responsible for war, poetry and sorcery, and the goddess Freyja, a member of the Vanir who was believed to have taught the practice to the Æsir.\n\nIn the 20th century, adherents of various modern pagan new religious movements adopted forms of magico-religious practice that include \"seiðr\". The practices of these contemporary \"seiðr\"-workers have since been investigated by various academic researchers operating in the field of pagan studies.\n\nSeiðr is believed to come from Proto-Germanic \"*saiðaz\", cognate with Lithuanian \"saitas\", \"sign, soothsaying\" and Proto-Celtic \"*soito-\" \"sorcery\" (giving Welsh \"hud\", Breton \"hud\" \"magic\"), all derived from Proto-Indo-European \"*soi-to-\" \"string, rope\", ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*seHi-\" \"to bind\".\n\nRelated words in Old High German (see German , used both in string instruments and in bows) and Old English refer to \"cord, string,\" or \"snare, cord, halter\" and there is a line in verse 15 of the skaldic poem Ragnarsdrápa that uses seiðr in that sense. However, it is not clear how this derivation relates to the practice of seiðr. It has been suggested that the use of a cord in attraction may be related to seiðr, where attraction is one element of the practice of seiðr magic described in Norse literature and with witchcraft in Scandinavian folklore. However, if seiðr involved \"spinning charms\", that would explain the distaff, a tool used in spinning flax or sometimes wool, that appears to be associated with seiðr practice.\n\nOld English terms cognate with seiðr are \"siden\" and \"sidsa\", both of which are attested only in contexts that suggest that they were used by elves (\"ælfe\"); these seem likely to have meant something similar to seiðr. Among the Old English words for practitioners of magic are \"wicca\" (m.) or \"wicce\" (f.), the etymons of Modern English \"witch\".\n\nSeiðr involved the incantation of spells (galðrar, sing. \"galðr\") and possibly a circular dance. Practitioners of seiðr were predominantly women (vǫlva or \"seiðkona\" \"seiðr woman\"), although there were male practitioners (\"seiðmaðr\" \"seiðr-man\") as well.\n\nThese female practitioners were religious leaders of the Viking community and usually required the help of other practitioners to invoke their deities, gods or spirits. The seiðr ritual required not just the powers of a female spiritual medium but of the spiritual participation of other women within the Norse community: it was a communal effort. As they are described in a number of other Scandinavian sagas, Saga of Erik the Red in particular, the female practitioners connected with the spiritual realm through chanting and prayer. Viking texts suggest that the seiðr ritual was used in times of inherent crisis, as a tool used in the process of seeing into the future, and for cursing and hexing one's enemies. With that said, it could have been used for great good or destructive evil, as well as for daily guidance.\n\nIn the Viking Age, the practice of seid by men had connotations of unmanliness or effeminacy, known as ergi, as its manipulative aspects ran counter to masculine ideal of forthright, open behavior. Freyja and perhaps some of the other goddesses of Norse mythology were seiðr practitioners, as was Oðinn, a fact for which he is taunted by Loki in the Lokasenna.\n\nIn the 13th century \"Saga of Eric the Red\", there was a \"seiðkona\" or \"vǫlva\" in Greenland named Thorbjǫrg (\"Protected by Thor\"). She wore a blue cloak and a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white ermine, carried the symbolic distaff (\"seiðstafr\"), which was buried with her, and would sit on a high platform. As related in the Saga:\n\nAs described by Snorri Sturluson in his Ynglinga saga, seiđr includes both divination and manipulative magic. It seems likely that the type of divination of seiđr-practitioners was generally distinct, by dint of an altogether more metaphysical nature, from the day-to-day auguries performed by the seers (\"menn framsýnir\", \"menn forspáir\").\n\nHowever, in the Icelandic saga Ǫrvar-Oddr, the \"seiðkona\"'s cloak is black but she also carries a distaff, which allegedly had the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it.\n\nPrice noted that, because of its connection with ergi, seidr was undoubtedly located on 'one of society's moral and psychological borders'.\n\nCertain aspects of seiðr were sexual in nature, leading Neil Price to argue that it was very likely that it actually involved sexual acts. Scholars have highlighted that the staffs have phallic epithets in various Icelandic sagas.\n\nBritish archaeologist Neil Price noted that \"the realm of sorcery\" was present in Oðinn's many aspects.\n\nIn Lokasenna, according to the Poetic Edda, Loki accuses Oðinn of practising seiðr, condemning it as an unmanly art (\"ergi\"). A justification for this may be found in the \"Ynglinga saga\", where Snorri opines that following the practice of seiðr rendered the practitioner weak and helpless.\n\nOne possible example of seiðr in Norse mythology is the prophetic vision given to Oðinn in the Vǫluspá by the Völva after whom the poem is named. Her vision is not connected explicitly with seiðr; however, the word occurs in the poem in relation to a character called Heiðr (who is traditionally associated with Freyja but may be identical with the Völva). The interrelationship between the vǫlva in this account and the Norns, the fates of Norse lore, is strong and striking.\n\nAnother noted mythological practitioner of seiðr was Gróa, who attempted to assist Thor, and who in the Svipdagsmál in a poem entitled Grógaldr \"Gróa's spell\" is summoned from beyond the grave.\n\nLike Oðinn, the Norse goddess Freyja is also associated with 'seiðr' in the surviving literature. In the \"Ynglinga saga\" (c.1225), written by Icelandic poet Snorri Sturluson, it is stated that \"seiðr\" had originally been a practice among the Vanir, but that Freyja, who was herself a member of the Vanir, had introduced it to the Æsir when she joined them.\n\nFreyja is identified in \"Ynglinga saga\" as an adept of the mysteries of seiðr, and it is said that it was she who taught it to Oðinn:\nDóttir Njarðar var Freyja. Hon var blótgyðja. Hon kenndi fyrst með Ásum seið, sem Vǫnum var títt.\n\n\"Njǫrðr’s daughter was Freyja. She presided over the sacrifice. It was she who first acquainted the Æsir with seiðr, which was customary among the Vanir.\"\nSince the publication of Jacob Grimm's socio-linguistical Deutsches Wörterbuch (p. 638) in 1835, scholarship draws a Balto-Finnic link to seiðr, citing the depiction of its practitioners as such in the sagas and elsewhere, and linking seiðr to the practices of the noaidi, the patrilineal shamans of the Sami people. However, Indo-European origins are also possible. Note that the Finnish word \"seita\" and the Sami variants of the term \"sieidde\" refer to a human-shaped tree or a large and strangely-shaped stone or rock and do not necessarily reference magical power. There is a good case, however, that these words do derive ultimately from seiðr.\n\nContemporary Paganism, also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an umbrella term used to identify a wide variety of new religious movements, particularly those influenced by the various pagan beliefs of premodern Europe. Several of these contemporary pagan religions draw specifically on the original mediaeval religious beliefs and practices of Anglo-Saxon England as sources of inspiration, adopting such Anglo-Saxon deities as their own.\n\nSeiðr is interpreted differently by different groups and practitioners, but usually taken to indicate altered consciousness or even total loss of physical control. Diana L. Paxson and her group \"Hrafnar\" have attempted reconstructions of seiðr (particularly the oracular form) from historical material. Jan Fries regards seiðr as a form of \"shamanic trembling\", which he relates to \"seething\", used as a shamanic technique, the idea being his own and developed through experimentation. According to Blain, seiðr is an intrinsic part of spiritual practice connecting practitioners to the wider cosmology in British Germanic Neopaganism.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 2003 by programmer and photographer Jon Oringer, Shutterstock maintains a library of around 200 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations, with around 10 million video clips and music tracks available for licensing. Originally a subscription site only, Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in 2008, and has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 2012.\n\nSince its founding Shutterstock has acquired a handful of other companies, starting with Bigstock in 2009 and followed by digital asset management software provider Webdam in 2014. After acquiring Rex Features and PremiumBeat in 2015, Shutterstock signed a partnership agreement with the Associated Press and most recently acquired Flashstock in 2017. It also has licensing deals with companies such as Penske Media Corporation. The company had over 100,000 contributors as of March 2016, with an \"active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries.\"\n\nShutterstock was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneur and computer programmer Jon Oringer. Creating his own online marketplace, Oringer initially uploaded 30,000 of his own stock photos and made them available via subscription, with unlimited downloads and a monthly starting fee of US$49. When demand exceeded his photo supply, he became an agent and began hiring additional contributors. Helping pioneer the subscription based microstock photography business model, Shutterstock claimed that it was the \"largest subscription-based stock photo agency in the world\" as of 2006, with 570,000 images in its collection. Shutterstock branched into film in 2006 with the launch of Shutterstock Footage, and by 2007, the company had 1.8 million photos. Insight Venture Partners invested in the company that year. Shutterstock expanded beyond subscriptions into a la carte pricing in August 2008, with its \"On Demand\" service removing daily download limits.\n\nOn September 23, 2009, Shutterstock announced that it had purchased Bigstock, a rival credit-based microstock photography agency. \"Fast Company\" argued the deal put \"Shutterstock on a competitive playing field with Getty, whose iStockPhoto is also credit-based.\" Shutterstock's CEO Jon Oringer stated the addition would \"enable Shutterstock to better satisfy the diverse payment preferences of stock photo buyers worldwide.\" Shutterstock had 11 million royalty-free stock images by early 2010. In February 2011, Shutterstock announced a two-year partnership with the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) to provide creative inspiration to its members. Claiming it licensed more images than \"any other brand worldwide\" in 2011, that November Shutterstock debuted Shutterstock for iPad, which it provided for free.\n\nWith 200 million licensed image downloads as of February 2012, by April 2012 the company had 18 million royalty-free stock images, which grew to 19 million the following month. Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool in May 2012, which displayed images in an interlocking mosaic to increase viewing speed. Shutterstock Instant was launched under the auspices of the newly formed Shutterstock Labs, which develops tools and interfaces for Shutterstock, among other projects. Also in May 2012, Shutterstock filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which it completed on October 17, 2012 under the ticker SSTK. In November 2012, Shutterstock debuted a universal iOS application meant for iPhone and iPad, among other devices.\n\nShutterstock, Inc. announced Spectrum, a new \"image discovery tool,\" in March 2013. At the time, Shutterstock had 24 million licensable photos, vectors and illustrations in its portfolio. In August 2013, Shutterstock and Facebook announced a partnership to integrate Shutterstock's library within Facebook's Ad Creator, allowing advertisers to select from Shutterstock's images when creating ads. At the time, Shutterstock was available in 20 languages including Thai, Korean, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nIn September 2013, Shutterstock launched Offset, marketplace prioritizing high end curated photos from established artists. A few months later, it launched its first Android app. In October 2013, Shutterstock opened offices in Berlin, Germany. At the time, Shutterstock stated it served 750,000 customers, with 30 percent of those customers in Europe. Shutterstock's shares had reached a $2.5 billion market value by the fall of 2013, while revenue for 2013 was US$235 million.\n\nIn March 2014, Shutterstock acquired Webdam, a provider of online digital asset management software. Also in March 2014, Shutterstock relocated its headquarters to the Empire State Building. In May 2014, Shutterstock and Salesforce partnered to integrate Shutterstock's image library into Salesforce's Social Studio. Shutterstock debuted its Palette tool in July 2014, a \"multi-color image discovery tool.\" Shutterstock announced it had surpassed 2 million video clips on September 2, 2014. Shortly afterwards it revealed a new app meant to help contributors with uploading and categorizing photos. Shutterstock's revenue was $328 million in 2014, an increase of 39% from 2013. In 2014, Shutterstock paid \"over $83 million to its roughly 80,000 contributors.\"\n\nIn January 2015, Shutterstock acquired both Rex Features, Europe's largest independent photo press agency, and PremiumBeat, a stock music and sound effects service. The Rex acquisition was estimated at $33 million, while PremiumBeat was purchased for $32 million. Penske Media Corporation formed a partnership with Shutterstock in June 2015 to create and license entertainment and fashion images. According to the terms of the deal, by 2016 Shutterstock would have an exclusive right and license to PMC's archive, which included magazines such as \"Variety\", \"Women's Wear Daily,\" and \"Deadline\". \"Crain's\" wrote that with the partnership, \"Shutterstock, a provider of stock imagery and music tracks, is stepping into the world of red carpets and fashion runways—and taking a key provider of fashion and entertainment photos and video away from archrival Getty Images.\"\n\nBy March 2016, the company had \"over 100,000 contributors,\" with around 70 million images and 4 million video clips available for licensing and sale. That month Shutterstock announced it would be distributing material from the Associated Press in the United States, with the deal to last 3 years and cover 30 million photos and around 2 million videos. The photos were expected to go live in April. According to \"Entrepreneur\", Shutterstock also had an \"active customer base of 1.4 million people in 150 countries.\"\n\nIn July, 2016, Shutterstock revealed a partnership with Google advertising products including adsense, adwords, and admob. The integration allows marketers creating Google ads to directly access Shutterstock images and track ad performance via the Shutterstock API.\n\nIn May, 2018, IBM's Watson Content Hub officially announced its partnership with Shutterstock which will be made available in July, 2018. The Watson Content Hub is a content management system (CMS) that allows marketers to create content using the IBM Watson AI search tool. See Watson (computer). According to Richard Hearn, chief revenue officer, \"Now customers can use AI to quickly sift through Shutterstock’s library, which includes millions of professional quality content, and create and launch campaigns that resonate with their target audiences and move them to take action.\"\n\nShutterstock is headquartered in New York City's Silicon Alley. In October 2013 Shutterstock opened its new European headquarters in Berlin, Germany in the Kulturbrauerei, and by March 2014, Shutterstock had additional offices in Amsterdam, Chicago, Denver, London, Montréal, Paris and San Francisco. After maintaining its New York headquarters for years in a Wall Street office, in March 2014 Shutterstock relocated into the Empire State Building. According to \"Inc.\", the office was selected with the goal of decreasing commute times for New York employees. The new location was built with no private offices, instead with 23 \"pop-in rooms\" for private meetings and conferences when needed.\n\nAfter its founding in 2003 with CEO Jon Oringer as the sole employee, by 2007 Shutterstock had grown to 30 people. In 2010 Oringer hired Thilo Semmelbauer as COO, who had previously worked with TheLadders.com and Weight Watchers. With 295 employees as of October 2013, that had grown to 700 employees as of 2016. In 2014, \"Fast Company\" published an article featuring Shutterstock as an example of a successful \"intrapreneur\"-reliant company, touting the company's \"hackathons\" for fostering staff creativity. Explains \"Fast Company,\" \"the most obvious benefit of intrapreneurship is the ability to pursue more opportunities, allowing Shutterstock to test boundaries and experiment with offshoot products that can keep their core consumer base from turning to a competitor for their needs.\"\n\nShutterstock licenses media for online download on behalf of photographers, designers, illustrators, videographers and musicians, maintaining a library of almost 200 million royalty-free stock photos, vector graphics, and illustrations. Shutterstock also has 10 million video clips and music clips in its portfolio. While Shutterstock currently has several payment models, \"The Atlantic\" wrote in 2012 that Shutterstock \"pioneered the subscription approach to stock photo sales, allowing customers to download images in bulk rather than à la carte.\" \"The Atlantic\" further wrote that Shutterstock is \"a web community in the manner of a Facebook or a Twitter or a Pinterest, with its value relying almost entirely on the enthusiasms of its contributors.\"\nWith potential contributors able to apply to the site for free, Shutterstock has a team of reviewers \"charged with ensuring editorial consistency and quality.\" As of 2016, if one of ten of a photographer's pictures are accepted, then they become a Shutterstock contributor. As of 2011, only around 20 percent of applicants were approved, and \"less than 60 percent of all the images uploaded by those approved contributors were ultimately put up on the site.\" Once approved, contributors can begin uploading their work through the website. They supply keywords, categorize the images, and submit them to the \"inspection queue\", where images are examined for quality, usefulness and copyright and trademark laws. Each time an image is downloaded, the photographer receives a flat rate. Explains VICE, \"photographers retain copyright over their images, but Shutterstock is given full permission to market, display, and license the image to the customers on their site without final approval from the photographer.\" As of March 2015, contributors added around 50,000 new images daily, and Shutterstock had paid around $250 million to contributors since its founding. In 2014, it paid $80 million to contributors.\n\nShutterstock began selling stock video in February 2006. Shutterstock Footage operates similarly to their image library, offering video clips by subscription or on a per-clip basis. As of 2014, Shutterstock Footage contained around 2 million royalty-free video clips. Shutterstock Music debuted later, with new content submittable by contributors.\n\nShutterstock for iPad was launched in November 2011, and in May 2012 the app received a Webby Award for People's Voice in the tablet app category for utilities and services. Shutterstock for iPad was followed in 2012 by a universal iOS app, which by 2013 had been downloaded 650,000 times. The iOS app originally lacked the ability to download images, with that functionality added later. The universal iOS app also included new features for Shutterstock, including the ability to filter image searches by color. Shutterstock debuted an Android App in 2013, and in September 2014, Shutterstock launched an app dedicated to its contributors, both available for iOS and Android. The app allows contributors to upload, keyword and categorize new images.\n\nIn 2012, Shutterstock launched Shutterstock Labs, a lab for \"exploratory tools and products.\" In May 2012, Shutterstock Images LLC announced the Shutterstock Instant tool, which according to the company was inspired by Shutterstock for iPad. The interface displays images in an interlocking mosaic view, allowing users to view more photos in less time. Shutterstock Instant was made available on the Shutterstock Labs website. The prototype for the search tool Spectrum was launched on March 21, 2013. With development in-house by Shutterstock Labs, the tool \"indexes hexagram data to yield search results by color.\" In July 2014, Shutterstock launched Palette, which allows users to add colors to the terms of the search, in addition to keywords.\n\nIn September 2013 Shutterstock launched Offset, a stock photography marketplace that focuses on high-quality curated images from established artists. Described as a \"high-end imagery service,\" the photo marketplace is operated by an independent company, which in turn is owned by Shutterstock. Explains \"Fast Company\" in 2014, Offset \"was created to serve the adjacent needs of existing customers who were looking for premium imagery for billboards, book covers, and high-profile signage for a fraction of the cost of a custom photo shoot.\" At its launch, Offset had 45,000 images from around 100 artists and publishers such as \"National Geographic\".\n\nShutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a \"convolutional neural network\" that it created to help with reverse image search technology. The network is \"essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images – there are millions of specific items such as cats, bicycles, the night sky – and pull up the most relevant photos.\" The network was dubbed computer vision by Shutterstock, and it \"breaks down the key components of a photo numerically, drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords.\"\n\nOn March 10, 2016, Shutterstock debuted its Reverse Image Search tool. According to \"Entrepreneur,\" with the tool \"users can upload an image, either from Shutterstock or another source, and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo.\" The reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords, but to also find images based on \"color schemes, mood, or shapes.\" Later that month, Shutterstock also debuted its Similar Search and Discovery tools, with the \"similar search\" option provided beneath photos on the Shutterstock website.\n\n"}
{"id": "12127081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12127081", "title": "Soul eater (folklore)", "text": "Soul eater (folklore)\n\nA soul eater is a folklore figure in the traditional belief systems of some African peoples, notably the Hausa people of Nigeria and Niger.\n\nBelief in soul eaters is related to traditional folk beliefs in witchcraft, zombies, and related phenomena. The soul eater is supposedly able to consume an individual's spirit, causing a wasting disease that can be fatal; \"the soul eater is a classical form of the cannibalistic witch\". In Hausa belief, the desire and capacity for the practice, termed \"maita,\" is rooted in special stones kept in a person's stomach. The trait allegedly can be inherited from one's parents, or can be acquired from an existing practitioner. The soul eater can take the form of a dog or other animal in pursuit of his or her practice—a belief that connects with the beliefs in werewolves, werecats, selkies, and other were-creatures and human/animal beings found in world folklore.\n\nAnother belief about soul eaters is that they are men who were cursed by witches and have to eat the souls of humans to live their lives. After the soul eater devours a victim's soul, the victim disappears as dust.\n\nThe belief survived into African-American folklore in the United States and the Caribbean region. Related beliefs can be found in other traditional African cultures, like the Fulbe and the Serer, and in cultures outside of Africa too—such as in the tribes of the Mount Hagen area of Papua New Guinea. The \"hix\" or \"ix\" of the Maya and related peoples is a comparable figure; the Pipil term \"teyollocuani\" translates literally as \"soul eater\".\n\nSome traditional religions, from that of the ancient Egyptians to the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Natchez, contain figures whose names have been translated into English as \"soul eater\". These mythological figures, however, are spiritual and not human beings, and so are distinctly different from Hausa and comparable beliefs.\n\nThe traditional belief in soul-eaters has been adopted by a range of modern horror fiction and fantasy writers, contemporary songwriters, and anime and video game creators for their own uses.\n"}

This “mini-Smithsonian” is rich with arts, natural sciences and local history.\n\nThe museum’s holdings are formally organized into three main collections: Natural Sciences, Fine Art, and History Archives & Library. The natural science collections encompass over 500,000 botanical, biological, anthropological and mineral specimens including bird nests and eggs, mounted animals, fossils, shells, and a significant collection of insects, including important type specimens. Based upon a 19th-century model, the art collection includes works spanning prehistory to the modern period, with representations of diverse world cultures from both the Western and Non-Western traditions. The historical collections include a library, maps and atlases, early films, audio recordings, photographs, historical objects, ephemera and archival documents reaching back to the 17th century.\n\nThe Staten Island Museum was founded in 1881 as a private society of local naturalists and antiquarians who pooled their personal collections to create the public museum in 1908. William T. Davis, along with Nathaniel Lord Britton, Arthur Hollick, Charles W. Leng, are some of the founding fathers who also contributed significantly to the city’s nature preserve, research and education. The museum focused on environmental protection and has participated in the preservation of High Rock Park and the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge. Since 1908, the staff has conducted annual bird counts together with the Audubon Society. In 1909, the Section of Art was organized, and in 1919 the Staten Island Institute of Arts & Sciences was incorporated to reflect the broader mission which also includes local history. \n\nThe museum has been called a \"Mini Smithsonian\" because of the breadth of its collections, and is based on a 19th-century model of creating within one's own community the complete resources for a cultural education. As a general interest museum, it is one of the last intact examples of the first type of public museum in America, and today serves a diverse audience of 80,000 people annually, with the goal of providing cross-disciplinary exhibitions for a wide cross-section of visitors. \n\nAs the oldest cultural organization on Staten Island, the museum has been instrumental in the founding of many other cultural organizations in the area. These include the New York Botanical Garden (the institute's co-founder Nathaniel Lord Britton became its first director), the Staten Island Zoo (originally the Staten Island Zoological Society, a Section of the Museum in 1933), the Staten Island Historical Society (running Historic Richmond Town), and the Staten Island Children's Museum. The museum also greatly impacted Staten Island's environment, contributing to the preservation of the Greenbelt and the establishment of other environmental organizations.\n\nIt is the mission of the Staten Island Museum to document, research, preserve, collect, interpret and exhibit significant objects and themes in the areas of natural science, art and local history, with the goal of educating, celebrating and enriching the community of Staten Island in particular, and the New York metropolitan region in general.\n\nThe Museum’s art collection ranges from ancient Egyptian sculpture, to Renaissance paintings, to 19th century Hudson River School landscapes of Staten Island and New York Harbor, to 21st-century abstract art, photography and new media. It is the only museum actively collecting works by contemporary Staten Island artists. Its collections include American landscape paintings, Old Master prints, historic costume pieces and costume accessories, African sculpture and masks, Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, Japanese prints, Pre-Columbian ceramics, ancient and modern Native American artifacts, English and American silver, and both Western and Non-Western objects of vertu, for example collections of Chinese snuff bottles, carved smoking pipes, and pocket watches, the bequests of local benefactor-collectors. It has a group of Samuel H. Kress Italian Renaissance paintings, and several complementary small 19th-century Renaissance-revival bronzes. There are important 19th–20th-century paintings featuring Staten Island and New York Harbor, fine 19th and 20th-century portraits, and works by prominent local contemporary artists. Examples of traditional representational art in the Staten Island Museum’s permanent collection include prints by Rembrandt, Goya, Piranesi and Audubon, paintings by Cropsey, Moran, Alma-Tadema, Giovanni di Paolo and Pordenone, sculpture by Hiram Powers and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. There are Japanese prints by Hiroshige, Hokusai, Utamaro and Kunisada. The Modern Art collection includes works by John Sloane, Guy Pene du Bois, George Bellows, Chagall, Leger, Maillol, Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, Isabel Bishop, Peter Max, Donald Judd and the folk artist Clementine Hunter. Over 150 women artists are represented in the Staten Island Museum’s holdings.\n\nThe museum has over half a million items in the local History Collection, including authentic land grants with the wax seals of King Charles II (1674) and King William III (1696) as well as a 1776 military document signed by William Howe, Commander in Chief of the British Armies.\n\nThe Museum houses a 130-year comprehensive record of the changing biodiversity of the New York metro area, fully documented with specimens, including specimens of birds and mammals, a collection of fish, amphibians and reptiles preserved in alcohol, 500,000 mounted insects, and 25,000 plants preserved in the herbarium.\n\nRemember the Mastodon is about the hard facts of extinction, the wonder of enduring species, the importance of bio-diversity and the challenge of preservation. Includes fossils, lost bird species, and a full-size replica of a Mastodon emerging through the wall! Visit the Museum opening weekend to help name the newest addition to the Museum team! \n\nA display of over 150 beetles, cicadas, butterflies and moths from the permanent collection.\n\nThe exhibition traces this borough’s unique history and landscape from the 17th century to the present. These works are made by amateur and professional artists, working in a broad range of styles and materials from ink drawing to anaglyph 3-D video.\n\nAfter a successful run of one year, about half of our inaugural exhibition, Staten Island SEEN has been taken down to make way for our latest offering, Infinite Compassion. You can still view parts of Staten Island SEEN on the second floor in the Elizabeth Egbert Gallery.\n\nPresenting art objects spanning 4,000 years of artistic endeavor gathered from five continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. Countries represented include Germany, Greece, India, Japan, Liberia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, and the United States. The oldest piece is an Egyptian funerary statuette of a striding man, dating from 2,000 BCE.\n\nA glimpse into Staten Island’s unique history, its people, and the themes that resonate as collective truths on this unusual island using images and historic documents, audio interviews, and digital collections. This exhibition strives to reunite Islanders with their past and share the evolving story of New York City’s Borough of Parks with visitors. From Farm to City: Staten Island 1661–2012 was created by the Museum of the City of New York. The exhibition focused on land-use on Staten Island. This legacy exhibition focuses on the people and themes that define the Island throughout history.\n\nStaten Island’s \"hometown\" museum has consolidated its collection to the Staten Island Museum at Snug Harbor. A state of the art LEED certified building opened to the public as of September 2015. In addition, the Museum operates its Art Conservation Studio and the Staten Island History Center & Archives at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, joining other cultural institutions at the site. The museum has transformed from the 19th-century model of a museum as a \"cabinet of curiosities\", into a fully realized 21st-century institution that is accessible, diverse, technologically advanced, and demonstrates leadership in collections management, exhibitions, education and public programming.\n\nThe new museum, on the Snug Harbor Campus, is the first federal historic landmark on Staten Island designed to achieve LEED Gold certification, including geo-thermal heating and cooling. The mainly city-funded ($23 million) renovation of Building A added over , with additional space to follow in Building B (Bio-Diversity) in 2022. \n\nThe Museum displays 'Staten Island Scene/Seen', a new interpretation of Staten Island across three centuries, including commissioned works by contemporary artists and featuring Hudson River School landscape paintings by Jasper Cropsey and Edward Moran from the museum's collection. \n\nIn addition, a life-size replica of a mastodon greets visitors as they explore the museum, a creature that once roamed the hills of Staten Island as evidenced by local discoveries held in the museum's fossil collection on display in the new lobby.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44657216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44657216", "title": "System for Cross-domain Identity Management", "text": "System for Cross-domain Identity Management\n\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains, or IT systems.\n\nFor example, as a company hires and fires employees, they are added and removed from the company's electronic employee directory. SCIM could be used to automatically add/delete (or, provision/de-provision) accounts for those users in external systems such as Google Apps for Work, Office 365, or Salesforce.com. Then, a new user account would exist in the external systems for each new employee, and the user accounts for former employees might no longer exist in those systems.\n\nIn addition to simple user-record management (creating & deleting), SCIM can also be used to share information about user attributes, attribute schema, and group membership. Attributes could range from user contact information to group membership. Group membership or other attribute values are generally used to manage user permissions. Attribute values and group assignments can change, adding to the challenge of maintaining the relevant data across multiple identity domains.\n\nThe SCIM standard has grown in popularity and importance, as organizations use more SaaS tools. A large organization can have hundreds or thousands of hosted applications (internal and external) and related servers, databases and file shares that require user provisioning. Without a standard connection method, companies must write custom software connectors to join these systems and their IdM system.\n\nSCIM uses a standardised API through REST with data formatted in JSON or XML.\n\nThe first version, SCIM 1.0, was released in 2011 by a SCIM standard working group organized under the Open Web Foundation. In 2011, it was transferred to the IETF, and the current standard, SCIM 2.0 was released as IETF RFC in 2015.\n\nSCIM 2.0 was completed in September 2015 and is published as IETF RFCs 7643 and 7644. A use-case document is also available as RFC7642.\n\nThe standard has been implemented in various IdM software.\n\nThe standard was initially called Simple Cloud Identity Management (as it is still called this in some places), but the name was officially changed to \"System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)\" when the IETF adopted it.\n\nInteroperability was demonstrated in October, 2011, at the Cloud Identity Summit, an IAM industry conference. There, user accounts were provisioned and de-provisioned across separate systems using SCIM standards, by a collection of IdM software vendors: Okta, Ping Identity, SailPoint, Technology Nexus and UnboundID. In March 2012, at IETF 83 in Paris, Interoperability tests continued by the same vendors, joined by Salesforce.com, BCPSoft, WSO2, Gluu, and Courion (nine companies, total).\n\nSCIM is not the first standard for exchanging user data, but it builds on prior standards (e.g. SPML, PortableContacts, vCards, and LDAP directory services) in an attempt to be a simpler and more widely adopted solution for cloud services providers.\n\nGoogle, Salesforce.com, Cisco, SailPoint and Ping Identity have been considered as the initial driving forces to create this open standard.\n\n"}

Private-charter entertainment boats also use Tower Pier.\n\nTower Millennium Pier was opened on 14 July by London Mayor Ken Livingstone.

On the day after the Hottest 100, Triple J plays the Hottest 200 ('the songs that didn't quite make it') from 10am.\n\nThe poll has grown from 500,000 votes in 2004 to 2.38 million in 2018, and has subsequently been referred to as \"the world's greatest music democracy\", and inspired a retrospective podcast. Following the completion of each year's countdown, a compilation CD featuring highlight tracks is released by ABC Music. Kendrick Lamar's \"Humble\" is the most recent song to be voted into first place, making him the first person of colour ever to top a Hottest 100.\n\nThe idea for the poll came from Triple J producer Lawrie Zion in late 1988. During this time, he conceived the idea of running a listener poll to determine their 100 favourite songs of all time. The idea was allegedly stolen from Brisbane community radio station 4zzz, which developed the original Hot 100 in 1976.\n\nFor the Hot 100, before Triple J had become a national broadcaster, Sydney listeners were required to write their 10 favourite tracks on the back of an envelope. Some entries were sent into the station written on a variety of items, including paintings, sculptures, and hand-rolled cannabis cigarettes. The results of the first poll were counted down on Sunday 5 March 1989 between 10am and 6pm.\n\nThe station repeated the event the following year when it started broadcasting to other capital cities besides Sydney. In 1991, Triple J was forced to change the poll's name to 'Hottest 100' to avoid legal action with 4zzz.\n\nDuring the poll's first few years — from 1989 to 1991 — the winner in the first two years was \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" by Joy Division, while 1991's favourite song was \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" by Nirvana, which had been released that year.\n\nRealising that the poll's results were unlikely to significantly change from year to year, Triple J rested the Hottest 100 in 1992 and relaunched it as an annual poll the following year. The newly launched poll required listeners to vote for their favourite songs of that year. Denis Leary's comedy anthem \"Asshole\" was voted number 1 in 1993.\n\nThe inaugural Hottest 100 compilation CD, \"Triple J Hottest 100 (The Hottest Of The Hottest)\", was released by ABC Music in 1994. Denis Leary's \"Asshole\" was voted in the number-one position in that year, while the radio-edited version of Ween's \"Push the Little Daisies\", featuring a sample of musician Prince howling in place of the word \"shit\", appeared on the CD.\n\nIn 1996, Spiderbait became the first Australian act to reach number 1. Since 1999, Australian acts have made up the majority of the polls.\n\nThe first Hottest 100 DVD, \"Triple J Hottest 100: The Hottest Videos For 2002\", was released in 2002. Queens Of The Stone Age's \"No One Knows\" was voted into the top position in that year, while Grinspoon, Motor Ace, Darren Hanlon, Machine Translations and Ms Dynamite were other Hottest 100 artists featured on the release.\n\nIn 2003, Powderfinger became the first act to be featured three times in the top 10 poll with \"(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind\", \"Sunsets\" and \"Love Your Way\" placing in the 4th, 7th and 10th places, respectively. All three songs appeared on the 2003 \"Vulture Street\" full-length studio album, which attained \"6 x Platinum\" sales in Australia. Powderfinger is also the only Australian artist to reach number 1 twice.\n\nAfter its beginnings as a write-in poll, the Hottest 100 progressed to phone-in voting, which then progressed to SMS and online voting. In 2003, only web votes through the Triple J website were accepted, with registration required and a limit of 10 votes applied. In 2004, the guidelines were expanded so that voters were entitled to 10 internet votes and 10 SMS votes.\n\nIn 2014, Chet Faker, whose real name is Nick Murphy, repeated Powderfinger's achievement from 2003 by placing three times in the top 10 positions. Faker reached the number-one spot with \"Talk Is Cheap\" and the 7th and 8th positions, respectively, with \"Gold\" and \"1998\". All three songs came from Faker's 2014 album \"Built On Glass\". Chet Faker placed a total of four times in the entire poll, with a cover version of Sonia Dada's \"Lover You Don't Treat Me No Good No More\" in the 22nd position. The 22nd Hottest 100 poll received a record 2,099,707 million votes, cast by 258,762 voters from 188 countries.\n\nIn 2017, Triple J announced that they would be holding 2018's Hottest 100 on January 27, instead of the traditional date of January 26. Triple J cited \"growing dialogue around Indigenous recognition and perspectives on 26 January.\n\nIn the 25 years since its inception, the bands who have been featured the most are Powderfinger, with 22 songs between the 1996 and 2009 countdowns, and the Foo Fighters, who charted 22 times between 1995 and 2014. In 2011, it was incorrectly stated that Foo Fighters had the most appearances.\nPowderfinger's frontman, Bernard Fanning, has taken the top spot on three occasions, twice with Powderfinger in 1999 and 2000 and once as a solo artist in 2005.\n\nDave Grohl has appeared 32 times throughout the countdown's history, including the top spot on two occasions (1991, 2002); 13 of those appearances were from the Hottest 100 Of All Time countdowns. He has appeared 4 times with Nirvana, 22 with Foo Fighters, 6 with Queens of The Stone Age and once with Them Crooked Vultures. In fact, Grohl has appeared in the most countdowns run by Triple J, only excluding those in 1989, 1990, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012.\n\nRobert Smith of The Cure has appeared 34 times throughout the countdown's lifetime; 28 of those instances were in the All Time countdowns. Five additional entries came from countdowns between 1993 and 1997 with a final appearance, to date, through a collaboration with Crystal Castles in 2010.\n\nThere has been increased debate regarding lack of representation of female artists in the Hottest 100 each year. In 2017 only sixteen of the artists were female, compared to 2015 where despite 48% of voters being female, only thirteen female solo artists and eight female fronted or duo artists received votes. A break down was provided by Casey Briggs for the 2014 Hottest 100 and previous Hottest 100 polls over the Last 20 years (2013).\n\nFollowing a 13 January 2015 article on BuzzFeed, the \"#Tay4Hottest100\" hashtag campaign began during the voting period for the Hottest 100 poll for 2014. According to those critical of the campaign, the Hottest 100 is reserved for non-mainstream artists who were \"discovered or fostered by Triple J\" and provides valuable exposure for artists in the outer circles of the music industry.\n\nThe campaign led to discussion about the broader cultural implications of the controversy generated by Swift. The \"Guardian\"s Elle Hunt wrote: \"... the virulent response to #Tay4Hottest100 has revealed the persistence of a dichotomy I'd thought we'd thrown out long ago: that of high art versus low.\" Writing for \"The Conversation\" on 23 January 2015, Charles Darwin University academic Gemma Blackwood concluded:\nThe cultural and economic meanings attached to the celebrity-sign of \"Taylor Swift\" seems antithetical to Triple J's self-representation as a place for exciting new music, with a supposed focus on emerging Australian talent. This perhaps explains why Swift is excluded from the playlist when other \"mainstream\" American artists and chart toppers ... are still played on the station heavily: the alignment and transfer of values of what is considered \"cool\" and \"hip\" between the station and its chosen artists ... The concept of \"youth\" seems to be used in reference to a musical market and to identify particular music genres rather than being a real or an accurate signifier of young tastes and interests. It raises the question: what responsibility does a national youth broadcaster have in the shaping and the adapting of young musical interests?\n\nStation manager Chris Scaddan told the media that the Swift campaign was within the rules of the poll, later instructing Triple J employees not to comment to \"media, friends, family\" about the campaign, as \"it will all become clear when we get to the countdown next Monday.\" The station said: \"we don't comment on voting campaigns whilst Hottest 100 voting is open. It draws attention to them and may influence the results of the poll.\" Marketing website Mumbrella suggested on 20 January that a Facebook post by KFC incorporating the \"#Tay4Hottest100\" hashtag was against the Hottest 100 rules and could see Swift disqualified. The \"Guardian\" submitted a freedom of information request to the ABC in regard to the station's response to the campaign.\n\nAfter journalist Peter Vincent reported that the Swift campaign had \"swallowed\" the Hottest 100 for 2014, citing research from the University of Queensland that showed that over 7,341 Hottest 100 posts in a 30-day period leading up to the poll results related to Swift, \"Shake It Off\" was eventually disqualified by the radio station in an announcement on 26 January 2015. The official announcement read: \"it became pretty clear, pretty quick that a lot of people just wanted to prod some 'hipsters' for the lulz\", acknowledging that the station \"had a heap of fun\", while Swift is \"smart\", \"cool\" and \"successful\". The song would have placed in the number-12 position if it had been allowed to compete.\n\nOn the inside cover of the Triple J Hottest 100 Volume 22 CD, bold capital initials spell out \"TAYLOR SWIFT BAN\".\n\nIn mid-2016, support grew for a campaign calling on Triple J to change the date of the Hottest 100. Calls were led by Indigenous Australian activists and supporters, many of whom regard Australia Day as \"Invasion Day\". Australian hip hop duo A.B. Original and their anti-Australia Day single \"January 26\" were instrumental in drawing support to the cause. Triple J responded to the campaign in September 2016, announcing a review over whether the date of the Hottest 100 should be changed.\n\nThe review of the date continued into 2017, including consultation with Reconciliation Australia, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, and the National Australia Day Council, while 2016's Hottest 100 was held on Australia Day without change. In August 2017, Triple J launched a survey asking for public opinion on whether the date should be changed. Shortly after the survey began, former Triple J presenters Matt Okine and Kyran Wheatley came out in support of a date change.\n\nOn 27 November 2017, Triple J announced plans to move the Hottest 100 to the fourth weekend of January. This followed analysis led by Rebecca Huntley of the aforementioned survey, which attracted 64,990 responses, indicating that 60% of listeners supported moving the date. The announcement was welcomed by many musicians and the Australian Greens. Within the Liberal Party, however, Communications Minister Mitch Fifield was reportedly \"bewildered\" by the choice, one that MP Alex Hawke described as \"disappointing\" and \"pathetic\". As the minister responsible for the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which Triple J is part of, Fifield wrote to the ABC's board of directors on 28 November asking them to return the Hottest 100 to Australia Day.\n\nSome organisations offered alternatives to Triple J's Hottest 100 in response to the date change. These include nationwide rock radio station Triple M broadcasting an \"Ozzest 100\" countdown of only Australian songs on 26 January, and Senator Cory Bernardi's Australian Conservatives publishing an \"AC100\" playlist of Australian music on Spotify.\n\n"}

{"id": "207245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207245", "title": "USS Dolphin (AGSS-555)", "text": "USS Dolphin (AGSS-555)\n\nUSS \"Dolphin\" (AGSS-555) was a United States Navy diesel-electric deep-diving research and development submarine. She was commissioned in 1968 and decommissioned in 2007, and this 38 year career was the longest in history for a US Navy submarine. She was the Navy's last operational non-nuclear-powered submarine.\n\n\"Dolphin\"s keel laid on 9 November 1962 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 8 June 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Daniel K. Inouye, and commissioned on 17 August 1968 with Lieutenant Commander J.R. McDonnell in command. Despite a recent repair and upgrade, \"Dolphin\" was decommissioned on 15 January 2007 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on the same date. She is now a museum ship in San Diego Bay under the management of the San Diego Maritime Museum.\n\nThe single most significant technical achievement in the development of \"Dolphin\" is the pressure hull itself. It is a constant diameter cylinder, closed at its ends with hemispherical heads, and utilizes deep frames instead of bulkheads. The entire design of the pressure hull was kept as simple as possible to facilitate its use in structural experiments and trials. Hull openings were minimized for structural strength and minimum hull weight, in addition to eliminating possible sources for flooding casualties. The submarine has no snorkel mast; her one hatch must be open while her diesels are running.\n\nEmployed by both civilian and Navy activities, \"Dolphin\" was equipped with an extensive instrumentation suite that supported missions such as acoustic deep-water and littoral research, near-bottom and ocean surveys, weapons launches, sensor trials, and engineering evaluations.\n\nBecause she was designed as a test platform, \"Dolphin\" could be modified both internally and externally to allow installation of up to 12 tons of special research and test equipment. She has internal and external mounting points, multiple electronic hull connectors, and up to ten equipment racks for project use.\n\nIn August 1969, \"Dolphin\" launched a torpedo from the deepest depth that one has ever been fired.\nOther examples of \"Dolphin\"'s work include\n\n\"Dolphin\" was overhauled in 1993.\n\nIn the late 1990s, \"Dolphin\" tested a new sonar system. As a result of \"Dolphin\"'s efforts, this new system will now be retrofitted into the fleet.\n\nOn 21 May 2002, at about 2330 PDT, while operating approximately off the coast of San Diego, California, \"Dolphin\" was cruising on the surface, recharging her batteries, when a torpedo shield door gasket failed, and the boat began to flood. Due to high winds and swells in the ocean, approximately 70 to 85 tons of seawater entered the ship, an amount perilously close to the boat's reserve buoyancy. The flooding shorted electrical panels and started fires.\n\nChief Machinist's Mate (SS) John D. Wise Jr. dove into the water of the flooded pump room. With less than a foot of breathable space in the compartment, he ensured the seawater valves were lined up, allowing pumping out to commence. Once the valves were aligned, he remained in the pump room for more than 90 minutes in order to keep a submersible pump from becoming clogged. His courageous efforts prevented the loss of the ship and crew. Wise received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his efforts.\n\nAfter 90 minutes, with fire and flooding beyond the ability of the crew to control, Commander Stephen Kelety, \"Dolphin\"'s commanding officer, ordered the crew of 41 and two civilian Navy employees to abandon ship. The Oceanographic Research ship \"McGaw\" was operating in the vicinity and immediately responded to Kelety's call for assistance. They were evacuated by boat to \"McGaw\" after the hatches had been secured. All crewmembers were safely recovered with only a few minor injuries. Two were recovered from the water by United States Coast Guard helicopter during the transfer. \"McGaw\" transported the crew to San Diego. also came alongside \"Dolphin\" and rescued several crewman from the water but the seas were too rough for full recovery or towing operations.\n\nThe quick response of the crew placed the submarine in a stable condition. Submarine Support Vessel \"Kellie Chouest\" got underway from San Diego early on 22 May to assist in recovery. \"Dolphin\" was towed back to San Diego the following day.\n\n\"Dolphin\" underwent three and a half years of repairs and upgrades at a cost of $50 million, then completed sea-trials during the summer of 2005 and returned to her duties for one year.\n\nIn mid-2006, the Navy decided to retire \"Dolphin\", citing the $18 million her operations cost annually. She was deactivated on 22 September 2006, and decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 2007. Her 38 year career was the longest in history for a US Navy submarine.\n\n\"Dolphin\" was officially transferred to the San Diego Maritime Museum in September 2008, to become the eighth vessel in their floating collection. She was opened to the public for the first time on 4 July 2009.\n\n\n"}

It opened in October 2004 and is the first state archives in the United States dedicated specifically to the preservation of electronic records.\n\nThe Washington State Archives began strategic planning for the Digital Archives in 2000, and planning for the physical design and technical infrastructure occurred in 2002. Construction began in January 2003.\n\nConcurrent with construction, research began on the programmatic and technological aspects of the Digital Archives. Site visits by project team members were made to the National Archives and the Library of Congress. A strategic plan was developed that included extensive involvement of staff, executive management and external stakeholders.\n\nIn June 2004, custom development on the web interface and database design began, blending the latest technologies with traditional archival theory to create a first of its kind repository. The goal of the program was to make the historical electronic records of State and Local government agencies easily accessible to the public, from anywhere, at anytime. The first records brought into the facilities care were marriage records from three pilot counties (Chelan, Snohomish and Spokane) along with the Historic Census and Naturalization records from the State Archives and State Library.\n\nThe grand opening of the facility occurred on October 4, 2004 and was attended by Washington State legislators, county officials, and archivists from throughout the United States. Among the speakers at this prestigious event were Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed and Lew Bellardo, Deputy Archivist of the United States.\n\nSome significant milestones have occurred over the years. In 2005 the staff of the digital archives worked quickly to preserve outgoing governor Gary Locke's website, an important public record, before it was replaced by the website for incoming governor Christine Gregoire. Three years later, through a collaboration with Microsoft Research, the archives released a ground-breaking new feature that made it possible to keyword search audio files. As of May 15, 2017, there are nearly 30,000 keyword searchable audio files on the archives website. Starting in 2007, the archives partnered with the Library of Congress on their Multi-State Preservation Consortium, an effort to spread digital archiving of state government records into other states across the country.\n\nThe Washington State Digital Archives is part of the Office of the Secretary of State currently directed by Kim Wyman.\n\nThe archives is located in Cheney, Washington on the campus of Eastern Washington University. The archives has extensive educational partnerships with the university including internships for students, an archive crash-course for history survey classes, and facilitated student research projects using surrogate archival collections. One student-driven project, \"Treasures of the Archives,\" showcases a compelling series or records in the collection each month. These short bits are featured on the archives' home page.\n\nThe archives is located on the southwest corner of EWU's campus in a two-story building that it shares with the Eastern Region Branch of the Washington State Archives, a regional archives for paper records created by local government agencies in Washington's eleven easternmost counties.\n\nWhen the facility opened in 2004 the Archives only held a few record series but as of April 3, 2017, the Archives has preserved 187,121,397 records, of which 65,559,111 were searchable on the Archives website. Many of these records were born digital but the Archives also preserves digitized historic paper records to provide easy access to the records to researchers around the world. Some of the Archives notable collections that can be found on the website are:\n\n\n\n"}
