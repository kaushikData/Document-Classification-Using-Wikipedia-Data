Ice Cube, Peter Stormare, Jillian Bell, Amber Stevens West and Wyatt Russell also star. It is the sequel to the 2012 film \"21 Jump Street\", based on the television series of the same name. The plot follows police officers Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko as they go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug.\n\nPlans for a \"Jump Street\" sequel began the week of the first film's release. Hill and Tatum were quickly confirmed to be reprising their roles, while Miller and Lord announced they'd be returning to direct in July 2013. Filming took place from September to December 2013 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n\"22 Jump Street\" was released on June 13, 2014, by Columbia Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film received positive reviews, with some critics calling it one of the best comedy sequels of all time, and grossed $331 million worldwide.\n\nTwo years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) – now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as \"WHY-PHY\" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.\n\nAt college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), they later become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya (Amber Stevens), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about \"getting laid\", much to Dickson's fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nWhen Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) and Eric (Dave Franco) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.\n\nSpring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea due to Jenko's injured arm. However, Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a med school.\n\nDuring the credits, Jenko and Schmidt go on to a variety of undercover missions to different schools, which are portrayed as fictional sequels, an animated series, and a toy line. One mission features Detective Booker (Richard Grieco) while another sees the return of Ghost, who survived the helicopter explosion. In a post-credits scene, Walters reveals to Eric that he is late, implying he is pregnant.\n\nOn March 17, 2012, Sony Pictures announced that it was pursuing a sequel to \"21 Jump Street\", signing a deal that would see Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall return to write a script treatment that would be again developed by Bacall. The film was originally scheduled to be released on June 6, 2014. On May 8, 2013, it was announced that the film would be pushed back a week until June 13, 2014. In June 2013, it was announced the film would be titled \"22 Jump Street\". In July 2013, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller confirmed they would return to direct the film. On September 6, 2013, Amber Stevens joined the cast of the film. On September 27, 2013, Kurt Russell mentioned that his son Wyatt turned down a role for \"The Hunger Games\" sequels to star in \"22 Jump Street\". Principal photography began on September 28, 2013, in New Orleans, Louisiana, with shots in San Juan, Puerto Rico as well (acting for the shots in the movie as the spring break in \"Puerto Mexico\") and ended on December 15, 2013.\n\nThe end titles, featuring satirical concepts for an ongoing series of Jump Street films and merchandise, were designed by the studio Alma Mater.\n\nThe score for the film was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh and was released by La-La Land Records on a double disc album, limited to 2,000 copies, in September 2014. The second disc of the album also contains the score from the film's predecessor, \"21 Jump Street\", composed by Mothersbaugh as well.\n\n\"22 Jump Street\" grossed $191.7 million in North America and $139.4 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $331.3 million, against a budget of $84.5 million. It outgrossed the first \"Jump Street\" film, which made a total of $201.6 million during its theatrical run.\n\n\"22 Jump Street\" grossed $5.5 million at its early Thursday night showings.

In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number three, grossing $9.8 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Boasting even more of the bromantic chemistry between its stars -- and even more of the goofy, good-natured humor that made its predecessor so much fun – \"22 Jump Street\" is the rare sequel that improves upon the original.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nInkoo Kang of \"The Wrap\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"If \"22\" isn't as trim and tight as its predecessor, it's certainly smarter and more heartfelt. Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate, but the franchise has definitely grown up.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B−, saying \"Hill's neurotic-motormouth act and Tatum's lovable-lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"This is the ultimate meta movie. The repetition is exactly the point.\" Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"What's the difference between \"21 Jump Street\" and \"22 Jump Street\"? Same as the difference between getting a 21 and a 22 at blackjack.\" Jocelyn Noveck of the Associated Press gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Hill and Tatum ... have a Laurel-and-Hardy-like implausible chemistry that keeps you laughing pretty much no matter what they're doing.\" Bill Goodykoontz of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"What makes it all work is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, which in turn, of course, is a rich source of the film's humor.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The peculiar sweetness of \"21 Jump Street\" has taken a hiatus in \"22 Jump Street\", a brazen sequel that's both slightly disappointing and a reliable, often riotous 'laffer' in the old \"Variety\" trade-magazine parlance.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"22 Jump Street\" is damn funny, sometimes outrageously so. It laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun.\" Joe Neumaier of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Like its stars, \"Jump Street\" gets extra credit for getting by on charm while sticking to the rules.\" Ian Buckwalter of NPR gave the film a seven out of ten, saying \"What separates \"22 Jump Street\" from sequel mediocrity is that everyone's in on the joke.\"\n\nSean Fitz-Gerald of \"The Denver Post\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"Jump Street\" knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip-offs – and in this case, to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas, embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd, unique franchise.\" Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"This sequel's spoof of its predecessor's riff on the original 1980s-era buddy-cop TV show coalesces into a raucous, raunchy, irreverent, imperfect riot.\" Ty Burr of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Lord and Miller are on a roll, and there may be no better moviemakers at playing to our modern need for irony – at giving us the entertainment we crave while acknowledging our distrust of it.\" Rene Rodriguez of the \"Miami Herald\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"There's something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of \"22 Jump Street\", a testament to the care and attention to detail directors Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material.\" Stephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"At what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit? Exactly when does joking about how all sequels are just lame, repetitive cash-grabs start to suggest that maybe yours is, too? Actually, in this case, about 40 minutes in.\" Bill Zwecker of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Though I enjoyed enormously this latest offering in the rebooted Jump franchise, it's the effortless, unexpected bromance/partnership between the two unlikely undercover cops is what makes this franchise work.\"\n\nJames Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"There are times when \"22 Jump Street\" is borderline brilliant. Unfortunately, those instances are outnumbered by segments that don't work for one reason or another.\" Jaime N. Christley of \"Slant Magazine\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"As funny and batshit insane as the movie often is, the fact that \"22 Jump Street\" knows it's a tiresome sequel doesn't save it from being a tiresome sequel, even as Lord and Miller struggle to conceal the bitter pill of convention in the sweet tapioca pudding of wall-to-wall jokes.\" Scott Tobias of The Dissolve gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying \"\"22 Jump Street\" squeezes every last drop of comic inspiration it can get from Tatum and Hill, as well as the very notion of a sequel to such a superfluous enterprise.\" Steve Persall of the \"Tampa Bay Times\" gave the film a B, saying \"\"22 Jump Street\" is a mixed bag of clever spoofery and miscalculated outrageousness. The unveiled homoeroticism of practically all interaction between Jenko and Schmidt is amusing to the point when it isn't.\" Ann Hornaday of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"This is a sequel that wears its well-worn formula, mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly, flying the high-lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not-too-dumb.\" Scott Foundas of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"\"22 Jump Street\" hits far more often than it misses, and even when it misses by a mile, the effort is so delightfully zany that it's hard not to give Lord and Miller an 'A' for effort.\"\n\nPeter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"If it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldn't possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of \"21 Jump Street\", you lost that bet.\" Tom Long of \"The Detroit News\" gave the film a B-, saying \"There's no real reason \"22 Jump Street\" should work. Yet it does.\" Joe Williams of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"A self-aware sequel has to hop over hurdles to keep from swallowing its own tail, but the sharp writing and tag-team antics lift \"22 Jump Street\" to a high level.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"\"22 Jump Street\" is exactly what comedy is today. It's coarse, free-flowing and playful.\" In 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #13 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\".\n\n\"22 Jump Street\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2014.\n\nOn September 10, 2014, \"23 Jump Street\" was confirmed. Channing Tatum had yet to sign on to the project, stating, \"I don't know if that joke works three times, so we'll see.\" On August 7, 2015, it was revealed that Lord and Miller would not direct the film, but instead write and produce. A first draft of the film's script has been completed. On December 10, 2014, it was revealed that Sony was planning a crossover between \"Men in Black\" and \"Jump Street\". The news was leaked after Sony's system was hacked and then confirmed by the directors of the films, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, during an interview about it. James Bobin was announced as the director in March 2016. The title of the crossover was later revealed as \"MIB 23\", and it was revealed that the crossover would replace a \"23 Jump Street\" film. However, development has since appeared to cease.\n\nIn early 2015, a female-driven \"21 Jump Street\" film was rumored to also be in the works. In December 2016, Rodney Rothman was confirmed to make his directorial debut on the film.\n\n"}

She has completed more than thirty film and video works and installations, and six books. An acknowledged pioneer in montage, Child’s early film work addressed the interplay between sound and image through reshaping narrative tropes, prefiguring many concerns of contemporary film and media.\n\nIn 1968, Abigail Child graduated from Radcliffe College in Harvard University with a degree in history and literature. She has received a Guggenheim Fellowship in Film. She has taught at several universities, including New York University, Massachusetts College of Art, and Hampshire College. She has been the chair of Film and Animation department at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston since 2000 and was appointed to a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In 2009, she was awarded the Rome Prize.\n\nChild began making films in the 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm. From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative. \"Is This What You Were Born For?\" is a major, seven-part experimental work from this period, completed over nine years, which included the cult classics \"Mayhem\" and \"Covert Action\". (see Filmography). In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as \"B/side\"(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city, and \"Below the New: A Russian Chronicle\" (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity. Digital works like \"Cake + Steak\" (2004) and \"The Future Is Behind You\" (2005) investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. \"Mirror World\" (2006) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess. Key works include \"Surface Noise\" (2000), \"Dark Dark\" (2001), \"Where The Girls Are\" (2002), \"Cake and Steak\" (2004), \"The Future Is Behind You\" (2004), \"To and No Fro\" (2005), and \"Mirror World\" (2006). Her feature video documentary \"On The Downlow\" (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little-viewed underground scene.\n\nIn 2012, Child completed a feature film, \"Shape of Error,\" an imaginary “home movie” based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.\n\nChild is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012) and a book of critical writings: \"This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film\" (2005).\n\nA collection of writings by various authors on \"Is This What You Were Born For?\", including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8457216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8457216", "title": "Anti-Romanian sentiment", "text": "Anti-Romanian sentiment\n\nAnti-Romanian sentiment or Romanophobia (, \"românofobie\") is hostility toward or prejudice against Romanians as an ethnic, linguistic, religious, or perceived racial group, and can range from individual hatred to institutionalized, violent persecution.\n\nAnti-Romanian discrimination and sentiment has been present in various degrees among the peoples and/or governments of countries bordering on Romania, either toward Romania itself or towards Romanian ethnic minorities residing in these countries. Similar patterns have existed toward other groups both in the region and elsewhere in the world, especially where political borders do not coincide with the patterns of ethnic population.\n\nTransylvania in the Middle Ages was organized according to the system of Estates, which were privileged groups (\"universitates\") with power and influence in socio-economic and political life, being nonetheless organized according to certain ethnic criteria as well. The first Estate was the lay and ecclesiastic aristocracy, ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing a process of homogenization around its Hungarian nucleus. The other Estates were Saxons, Szeklers and Romanians (or Vlachs - \"Universitas Valachorum\"), all with an ethnic and ethno-linguistic basis (\"Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis\"). The general assembly (\"congregatio generalis\") of the four Estates had mainly supra-legislative powers in Transylvania, but it sometimes took measures regarding order in the country, relationships between the privileged, military issues, etc.\n\nThe turning point in the history of the Romanian population in Transylvania was in 1366, when through the Decree of Turda the king Louis I Anjou of Hungary redefined nobility in terms of membership in the Roman Catholic Church and, thus specifically excluding the Eastern Orthodox Romanians. The only possibility for Romanians to retain or access nobility was through conversion to Roman Catholicism. Some Orthodox Romanian nobles converted, being integrated in the Hungarian nobility, but the most of them declined, thus losing their status and privileges. \n\nAs a result, gradually, after 1366 Romanians lost their status as an Estate and were excluded from Transylvania's assemblies. This meant that the Romanian population of Transylvania was never directly represented in the Transylvanian Diet, which consisted of Hungarian nobles, German and Székely nobles (the Unio Trium Nationum). Moreover, in Medieval times, the Romanians were not allowed to reside within the walls of such Transylvanian cities as Sibiu (\"Nagyszeben\"/\"Hermannstadt\"), Braşov (\"Brassó\"/\"Kronstadt\") or Cluj (\"Kolozsvár\"/\"Klausenburg\"). This led to extensive persecution against the under-represented Romanians. For example, in the 16th century, Transylvanian laws of justice separated the rights of Hungarians, Saxons and Szeklers from the rights of the Romanians.\n\nAs a consequence, Romanian peasants would sometimes revolt and demand better treatment. These revolts, such as the 1784 Romanian peasant uprising, were ruthlessly suppressed as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor after learning the escalated situation ordered the army to intervene. Horea and Cloșca were caught by Romanians in their subterfuge and handled them to Paul Kray general. Horea and Cloșca were executed by breaking on the wheel. This method of execution consisted of the victim being laid on the ground whilst the executioner would break the prisoner’s bones with a spiked wheel. Other peasants would be forced to watch the executions in order to frighten them from attempting future uprisings. Crișan committed suicide in the prison.\n\nIn 1918, after the First World War, the union of Transylvania with Romania was declared at Alba Iulia by an assembly of the delegates of ethnic Romanians in Transylvania. Following the Treaty of Trianon, eventually Transylvania became part of Romania.\n\nBulgaria and Romania are neighbors, however, both two countries have been in conflicts in the past, especially over the Dobruja region. In the 1st millennium AD, Bulgaria owned the territory of modern-day Romania. For many Bulgarians, at that time, Romanians were considered as being just Bulgarians, who spoke Bulgarian and belonged to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, a fact denied by the Romanians. It remained controversial even until the Ottoman Empire's arrival to the Balkans.\n\nAfter 1878, when Romania became independent, the two countries tried to resolve the conflict until the Second Balkan War, when Romania attacked Bulgaria and took Tutrakan from the country, causing anti-Romanian sentiment to raise to higher levels. During World War I, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers and occupied Bucharest and Dobruja including the now retaken Tutrakan, which is still a part of Bulgaria today. After the end of the war, however, relations cooled down. In 1940, by the Treaty of Craiova Dobruja was divided between them with Bulgaria getting the Southern part and Romania getting the Northern part. After, in World War 2, the two countries were allies. After the establishment of the Eastern Bloc, both countries became socialist republics, which furthered the friendship. The two countries currently have strong ties and have a very special relationship (both joined the EU in 2007), considering their opposed linguistic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nAlthough the 1940 issue was reaffirmed later in 1947 by the Paris Peace Treaties, today, most Romanians and Bulgarians get along with each other, but Romania is still being held at a negatively by certain groups, which still believe the whole of Romania belongs to them or at least all the Dobruja region.\n\nBessarabia became a part of the Russian Empire according to the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest. A period of autonomy followed, after which all Romanian government institutions, schools and presses were closed and replaced by a Russian-style provincial administration in 1828. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Bessarabia saw an intense process of Russification. Military service also became a new instrument of Russification. The process of Russification and colonization of this territory started to be carried out by representatives of other ethnic groups of the Russian Empire, including Jews, Germans, Bulgarians, Gagauz, and Ukrainians.\n\nWhen the Russian Empire collapsed after the Russian Revolution of 1917, a local body called “Sfatul Ţării” (\"Council of the Country\") was created in Bessarabia. Moldova became an independent republic on December 2, 1917. Given that Soviet raids already menaced the newly formed authority, the local body (\"Sfatul Ţării\") called in support troops from the Kingdom of Romania. The troops entered Bessarabia on December 13. On March 27, 1918, the local body (Sfatul Ţării) voted to unite with Romania. Subsequently, the Soviet Union refused to recognize the union, and supported an intense propaganda stating that the Kingdom of Romania was an imperialistic multi-ethnic state.\n\nBessarabia was a part of Romania until 1940 when the USSR re-annexed the territory as well as Northern Bukovina.\n\nThe convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. Moscow also encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia.\n\nThe exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to Bucharest on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the \"democratic forces\" opposed to alteration of the status quo in Transylvania in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.\n\nAccording to official NKVD documents, over 15,000 Romanians from Northern Bukovina were deported to Siberia in 1940 alone. The Soviet action culminated with the Fântâna Albă massacre when 2,500 to 3,000 Romanian refugees who were attempting to leave Northern Bukovina for Romania were blocked by the USSR Border Troops and about 200 of them were shot, at a place called \"Fântâna Albă\" (\"White Fountain\" in Romanian). This policy resulted in a substantial shrinkage of the Romanian population in the province. By 1941, out of 250,000 Romanians in Northern Bukovina, only 192,000 were left.\n\nThe territory of the Moldavian SSR was composed of Bessarabia (except for Southern Bessarabia, assigned to Ukraine) and a part of the territory of the former Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Transnistria), founded in 1924 within the territory of Ukraine. In the document confirming the establishment of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) of 12 October 1924 the West frontier of the republic was traced out not along the Dniester River but the Prut River. In the MASSR the ideology of a separate Moldovan identity was pursued, including the introduction of Moldovan language, distinct from Romanian. The Cyrillic alphabet and abundant Russisms were introduced.\n\nAnother historical event which contributed to the future implementation of the anti-Romanian feelings was Romania’s behaviour in World War II, when the Romanian regime allied itself with Nazi Germany.\n\nIn Bessarabia, the Soviet government pursued a policy of assimilation of the native Romanian population. First, the province was divided into a \"Moldovan\" Socialist Republic and a southern region known as Budjak, which was renamed Izmail Oblast and attached to the Ukrainian SSR. Elite elements of the Romanian population were then deported to Siberia much like their Bukovinian counterparts. Russian and Ukrainian settlers were used to fill the vacant areas caused by the deportation of Romanians.\n\nIn 1946-1947, as a result of the famine organised in the MSSR (according to some data of certain scientists; official data has not yet been published), around 300,000 died and many cases of cannibalism occurred. In addition, the population of the former MASSR, as a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, also suffered from the artificial famine in the 1930s when several million people died in Ukraine (\"see also Holodomor\").\n\nThe territory of Transnistria was more industrialised in comparison with the other part of Moldova and the industrialisation process of Transnistria was accompanied by a population flow from other areas of the USSR, especially from Russia. Although in the Republic of Moldova the level of population density was the highest one in the USSR, Moscow continued to stimulate the arrival of labour force from outside, including that with a poor qualification. Even Igor Smirnov himself, current leader of the separatist regime of Transnistria, was sent in 1987 from Russia to Bender to be the director of an enterprise. This process was also amplified by the excessive militarization of the area.\n\nThe 1989 adoption of the Law on state language (official language) and Law on functioning of languages on the territory of the MSSR generated an extremely negative reaction in the industrial centres of Transnistria, where the largely Russian-speaking population was not being consulted, and felt threatened by the prospects of Romanianization. These laws proclaimed the Moldovan (Romanian) language, written in the Latin alphabet, as the only state language. The fact that Moldovan and Romanian are identical was recognised. Although a majority of the Transnistrian population never read these laws which served as a reason for the conflict's outburst, they feared that by the application of the new linguistic legislation, Russian language speakers would become second-class citizens. At the industrial enterprises, including those of the military-industrial complex of the USSR, strikes occurred protesting against granting official language status to the Moldavian (Romanian) language.\n\nAfter the breakup of the USSR, various legislative reforms consolidated the position of ethnic Romanians/Moldovans, especially by establishing the Moldovan language as the official language. The 2001 parliamentary elections, won by the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova, initially brought a series of attempts to raise Russian to the status of a state language. However, the project was dropped by popular opposition.\n\nRelations between the Moldovan and Romanian governments have initially included some tension as the Moldovan government led by President Vladimir Voronin accused Romania of \"imperialism\". Nevertheless, in the recent past relations have improved and President Voronin as well as Romanian President Traian Băsescu have called for cooperation between the two sovereign states.\n\nIn 2006, the Gheorghe Asachi Romanian-French School was forced by the government to change its name to the Gheorghe Asachi Moldovan-French School. Critics argued that the government acted unilaterally and discriminated against Romanians, as other schools such as the Necui-Leviţki Russian-Ukrainian School were allowed to continue using that name. In protest, four high school students from Asachi replaced the new high school sign with another with the old name. They were charged with \"group-committed aggravated hooliganism\".\n\nIn Transnistria, the situation is considered to be far worse than the rest of Moldova. After the 1992 war, the Romanian population was substantially persecuted, causing at least 5,000 to 10,000 Romanians to flee the region. Although the number of Romanians in Transnistria is significant, Romanian is almost never used in public.\n\nRomanian schools comprise about 11% of the total schools in Transnistria. Most of the schools are forced to teach in the Cyrillic script and use outdated, 40-year-old, communist-era books, and 6 schools are permitted to teach in Romanian using the Latin script; however, pressure is often put on the institutions to close. The 2004 school crisis is a prime example of this, when the pro-Russian government in Tiraspol forcefully attempted to close down 2 of the schools. In the orphanage of Tighina, Romanian children returning from vacations found the orphanage locked by police. After spending a night outdoors, they forced their way into the building and had to stay there without water and electricity for a few months, until pressure from the Moldovan and Romanian governments and from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) made the conflict get resolved. Numerous Romanian parents were arrested or fired from their jobs for their political views and their determination to keep their children in Romanian-language schools.\n\nCitizens who express pro-Romanian or pro-Moldovan attitudes are likewise persecuted in Transnistria. The Ilie Ilaşcu group is the most commonly known and well-documented of organisation.\n\nNorthern Bukovina, as well as the Tiachiv and Rakhiv raions (districts) of Zakarpattia Oblast (Transcarpathia), are the regions in Ukraine with considerable Romanian minorities, according to the 2001 Ukrainian Census.\n\nThe Ukrainian Census of 2001 was criticized by Dr. Ion Popescu, leader of the National Council of the Interregional Union of the Romanian Community in Ukraine and also one of the authors of the Constitution of Ukraine, who claims that the very existence of the classification of Moldovans as a separate ethnic group in census results is a \"continuation of the Stalinist and Soviet policies of artificially dividing Romanians into Romanians and Moldovans\". However, the response to the census question about the ethnicity had to be written in into the census form rather than picked from a pre-determined set of choices and the census respondents were free to claim their ethnicity as they wished not to respond to this or any other particular census question or not answer any questions at all; besides, no allegation of counting fraud were ever brought up. It is therefore unclear if Dr. Popescu criticizes the way in which the census was conducted or the way in which data was processed.\n\nThe number of Romanian students at Chernivtsi University declined sharply in Soviet times. In 1991-92, the last year of Soviet rule, the number of Romanian students was only 4.44% (434 out of 9,769) . Among teaching faculty, under-representation of Romanians is also evident. The breakdown by nationalities (in the same year) reveals: Ukrainian teachers 465 (77.1%), Russians 102 (16.9%), Moldovans 9 (1.4%), Romanians 7 (1.1%), Belorussians 6 (0.9%), etc. Even after Ukrainian independence, the number of Romanian students at the University continued to decline, to only 3.9% in 1992-93, which is much less than the overall percentage of Romanians in the region's general population. Since 1997, arrangements have been made for some students to study at universities in Romania . In 2001 the Christian-Democratic Alliance of the Romanians from Ukraine reported that Romanians in Chernivtsi lack an opportunity to study at the university level in their native language.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that according to the Ukrainian Constitution adopted after its 1991 independence, Ukrainian is the only state language in the country, and the state higher education system was switched to Ukrainian, according to the common practice in many countries worldwide and this practice was not directed specifically at the Romanian population. For example, the majority of Ukrainian universities do not provide education in Russian either, despite the fact that Russian is the native language of a much more considerable part of the population in Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time, there are schools teaching Romanian as a primary language, as well as newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting in Romanian , , . Future teachers for Romanian schools are trained in at the Chernivtsi University in the fields of Romanian philology, mathematics and physics . Romanian organizations still complain that despite this, 19 villages inhabited by Romanians have been deprived of schooling in their native language, therefore creating a worse situation than that which existed under the repressive Soviet regime .\n\nThe Romanians living in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina are very well represented at the provincial level despite their small presence (about 30,000 people, 1.5% of the province's population of around 2 million), and Romanian is one of the six official languages of the province. However, their counterparts in Eastern Central Serbia (mostly in the Timok Valley and Branicevo), known as Vlachs and outnumbering the Vojvodinian Romanians, have not had any privileges. As example from Negotin in Vrsac, the Romanian local television station door was vandalized with the inscription \"Out Romanians, Serbia!!!\" (Serbian: \"Napolje Rumuni, Srbija!!!\").\n\nThe Timok Vlachs speak the same dialect (Daco-Romanian) as is spoken to the north, in Romania. However, the Serbian authorities have pursued a policy of de-nationalization as they have slowly changed the term \"Romanian\" into \"Vlach\" through the years.\n\nThese people declare themselves on census forms as ethnic Vlachs and their number is about 40,000. Nevertheless, older Serbian censuses counted up to 200,000 Romanians (Vlachs) in present-day Central Serbia (the 1895-census counted 159,510 Romanians, the 1921-census counted 150,098 Romanians, the 1953-census counted 198,793 Vlach (Romanian) - speakers).\n\nSince 2004 they are regular clashes between the Serbian authorities and the Romanian community in Timok when Bojan Aleksandrovic, a Romanian Orthodox priest decided to build a small church where he would hold services in Romanian. The priest has been subjected to threats while children attending mass with their parents have been humiliated in the village school by their Serbian teacher. Romanians in Serbia proper do not have the right to schooling and public worship in their native language.\n\nIn the town of Negotin, the Romanian Cultural Association was vandalized in 2004 when Serbian pro-fascist ultra-nationalists wrote \"Out of Serbia\" on the windows of the main doors.\n\nIn 2013 accusations of discrimination in Covasna surfaced against Hungarian students and teachers. During a ceremony for the national day of Hungary, some Romanian students wearing the Romanian flag were physically assaulted by older students, and threatened by teachers with punishment for wearing the national symbol. As a result, the Romanian human rights organisation ActiveWatch issued a statement condemning the actions of the school's administration, which it considers a blunt infringement of human rights and freedom of expression.\n\nIn 2009, a right-wing political party (Swiss People's Party (SVP)) had run an anti-immigration campaign, against Romanians and Bulgarians, distributing and displaying banners depicting citizens of these countries as \"crows\".\n\nAnti-Romanian sentiment in the European Union refers to the discrimination of Romanian citizens within the European Union. As a member of the E.U., Romanian citizens have faced ethnic profiling in various European countries and open discrimination in countries like Italy or Austria.\n\nIn June 2009, having had their windows broken and deaths threats made against them, twenty Romanian families were forced from their homes in Lisburn Road, Belfast, in Northern Ireland. Up to 115 people, including women and children, were forced to seek refuge in a local church hall after being attacked. They were later moved by the authorities to a safer location. An anti-racist rally in the city on 15 June was attacked by youths chanting neo-Nazi slogans.\n\nFollowing the arrest of three local youths in relation to the attacks, the church where the Romanians had been given shelter was badly vandalised. Using 'emergency funds', Northern Ireland authorities assisted most of the victims to return to Romania.\n\nBased on growing dissatisfaction with the European Union, several British politicians have posed a stance against the free movement of Romanians (and Bulgarians) within the E.U. and subsequently in the United Kingdom. As a result, multiple British newspapers have started publishing discriminatory articles about Romanian citizens, thus inciting an anti-Romanian sentiment; mainly against the Roma minority.\n\nIn 2013, Romanian ambassador Ion Jinga stated that a part of the British media launched a series of negative articles concerning Romanians, with reference to their “invasion” to the United Kingdom, criminality, social benefits abuse, and accusing Romania of involvement in the meat adulteration scandal. Ambassador Jinga responded to these allegations through a series of interviews and articles in British newspapers, radio and television, presenting his views on the professional value of Romanians and their significant contribution to the UK economy. He also blamed the United Kingdom Independence Party for inciting anti-Romanian prejudice and violent attacks.\n\nIn 2013, the Daily Express newspaper launched a 'Crusade' against new European Union migrants from Bulgaria and Romania. The frontpage on Thursday 31 October declared 'Britain is full and fed up. Today join your Daily Express Crusade to stop new flood of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants'. UKIP leader Nigel Farage declared that he had signed the petition, and urged other to do the same. Romanian politician Cătălin Ivan expressed 'outrage' at the campaign.\n\nIn 2013 a prominent German newspaper, Der Spiegel, has published a short video displaying Roma-Romanians living in the city of Duisburg. The video shows a small number of Roma-Romanians and uncensored under-aged children living in a ghetto-like part of the city, without access to proper public services and living in poor housing conditions. Although there is no proof that the Romanian citizens were unemployed, the video claims they are a burden on the local welfare system. The discriminatory aspect of this video is visible through the fact that a number of German citizens are shown living in the same conditions; yet blaming the foreign citizens. This further increases the anti-Romanian sentiment, in a country where the majority of Romanian (and Bulgarian) citizens are well integrated.\n\nHistorically, France had cultivated a close relationship with the Romanian Principalities being a strong supporter of their independence and unification in 1859 and ultimately of Greater Romania in 1918. Many of the prominent Romanian scientists and artists like Henry Coanda and Constantin Brancusi had studied and worked in Paris and Bucharest was nicknamed Le Petit Paris for its cosmopolitan atmosphere. Furthermore, the Romanian flag bears homage to the ideals of the French Revolution and has been interpreted as Liberty (blue) Justice (yellow) Fraternity (Red). \nFollowing the deportation of Roma-Romanian citizens from France, and numerous discriminatory articles in the French media, a small protest occurred in front of the French embassy in Bucharest, against the discrimination against Romanians in France.\n\nA Dutch right wing political party (Wilders’ Freedom party (PVV)), launched a website aimed at gathering denunciations against Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian nationals living in the Netherlands. Denunciations consist of competition on the job market, and others, with the slogan: “Are they causing you problems? Or did you lose your job to a Pole, Bulgarian, Romanian or other Central or East European? We would love to hear from you,”; thus inciting social tension between European Citizens exercising their treaty right of freedom of movement and the local population. The Netherlands is one of the main countries blocking Romania and Bulgaria from joining the Schengen Agreement; as well as one of the countries with growing populism.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25124571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25124571", "title": "Beast of Bladenboro", "text": "Beast of Bladenboro\n\nThe Beast of Bladenboro refers to the creature responsible for a string of deaths amongst Bladenboro, North Carolina animals in the winter of 1953-54. According to witnesses and trackers it was likely a wildcat, but the uncertain nature of its identity lends itself to speculation. According to reports, the entity was known to most commonly crush or decapitate its victims, which were mostly dogs.\n\nPossibly related to the Bladenboro incidents, a dog was found dead in Clarkton, North Carolina (about eight miles from Bladenboro), killed by what Police Chief Roy Fores reported witnesses as describing as \"sleek, black, about 5 feet long...\" on December 29, 1953.\n\nOn December 31, two dogs belonging to a Bladenboro man named Johnny Vause were found dead. There was reportedly a significant amount of blood at the scene near their kennels. The two dogs were \"torn into ribbons and crushed,\" according to Vause.\n\nOn the next day, January 1, 1954, two more dogs were found dead in Bladenboro at Woodie Storm's farm. One was \"sort of eaten up,\" according to a witness.\n\nOn the night of January 2, a farmer named Gary Callahan reported that a dog of his had been killed.\n\nTwo more dogs were found dead on January 3. One of the dogs was autopsied, and according to Police Chief Roy Fores \"...there wasn't more than two or three drops of blood in him [...] The victim's bottom lip had been broken open and his jawbone smashed back.\" Fores also said of the dogs found dead so far, \"The ear of one dog was gnawed off and the tongues of two had been chewed out.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Charlotte News\", on the night of the 5th a pet rabbit was found \"cleanly decapitated and still warm.\"\nOn January 7, a dead dog was found in a pasture near the Bladenboro swamp.\n\nJulian \"Tater\" Shaw, who owned a local gas station, heard that a goat had died in a strange way and traveled to the edge of town to see for himself. According to him, \"His head was flat as a fritter [...] it had a great big ol' track... It was weird.\" Shaw also claimed that whatever killed the goat killed cows and hogs.\n\nResident Malcolm Frank reported seeing the animal crossing the street. He described it as \"about four and a half feet long, bushy, and resembling either a bear or a panther,\" according to the January 4 edition of the \"Wilmington Morning Star\". A son of a Bladenboro man named Carl Pate reported seeing the monster as well on the night of January 3. According to him, \"it was small, and a little one just like it was running beside it.\" A third sighting on January 3rd was reported by James Pittman: \"[...] about 11:00 o'clock I heard a strange noise outside my window, like a baby crying.\" He went outside to follow the noise for \"close to a mile [...] I saw bushes moving, but I never did actually see whatever it was. However, I think it must have been close to 150-pounds, the way it went through the bushes.\"\n\nAround 8 o'clock in the evening on January 4, Lloyd Clemmons claims to have seen the beast. The following account, reported in the \"Wilmington Morning Star\", contains a physical description.\n\nA group of hunters from Wilmington including S. W. Garret, G. V. Garret, and Joe Gore spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80 lb. to 90 lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.\n\nDuring the early hours of January 5, Chief Fores and one D.G. Pait witnessed the beast attacking a dog from a hundred or so feet away. According to them, the dog ran away, yelping, and was not found. Pait also reported seeing tracks along a creek bank near one of the attack sites. He said that there were two sets of prints, and one was smaller. Later that day, in the early evening, Mrs. C. E. Kinlaw went to her front porch upon hearing whimpering dogs. She saw what she described as looking like \"a big mountain lion\" near the dogs, three houses down. The creature ran toward her, but turned and fled when she screamed. Outside her home, the tracks left in the dirt road were \"bigger than a silver dollar\" according to Police Chief Fores. \n\nA young boy named Dalton Norton reported seeing what he called \"a big cat\" on January 6. According to him: \"We heard a noise on the porch [...] whatever it was made a noise like a baby crying. It jumped off the porch and I watched it through the window. It went over to one house, then went off towards another and I didn't see it anymore.\"\n\nOn January 11, two cars stopped for an animal reported to be four feet long. Jeff Evers, one of the men in the cars, was quoted as saying the animal had \"runty-looking ears\" and being \"brownish and tabby.\" Fores said the animal \"really upset the women. They were wringing their hands and like that.\"\n\nThe night of January 3, Police Chief Roy Fores searched for the creature with his dogs, but they reportedly would not follow the trail.\n\n\"A half-dozen brave youths\" and their dogs spent January 4 searching for the creature responsible for the deaths. That night, Police Chief Roy Fores and eight to ten other officers conducted their own hunt. Hunters who traveled to Bladenboro from Wilmington also searched for the beast that evening, reportedly tracking it for 3 miles around the swamp.\n\nOn the night of January 5, more than 500 people and dogs hunted through the woods and swamps for the creature.\n\nOn January 6, more than 800 people turned out to hunt for the beast in the swamps. Fores planned to tie up dogs as bait to lure the creature in. This particular plan was called off, and the hunt itself was also ended by officials as safety became a concern.\n\nOn January 7, another 800 to 1,000 people gathered to hunt the creature.\n\nDuring the evening of the 8th, four fraternity brothers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were the only reported hunters. Mayor Fussell officially called off the hunt unless the creature made another obvious kill or there was a legitimate sighting. The armed hunting parties of previous nights had become too large for safety, and Fores received a telegram from a humane society in Asheville, North Carolina protesting his plan to stake out dogs as bait for the creature.\n\nIn an interview with Amy Hotz for \"Star News\", Julian \"Tater\" Shaw recalled, \"Everybody was scared. Everybody, near ‘bout, that had a gun was carrying it. [...] Anyhow, it was getting so bad, it was getting in the newspapers and the radio [...] There came hunters from all over, I mean big hunters.\" Another gas station owner, Jabe Frink, said the panic \"[...] kept snowballing and snowballing. It got so nobody would walk out on the street at night.\"\n\nLuther Davis, a local farmer, produced a dead bobcat on January 13. He found the bobcat struggling with a steel trap in Big Swamp, four miles from the city, at 6:00AM. He proceeded to shoot it in the head at about 8:30AM. Woodrow Fussell, the mayor of Bladenboro, told newspapers that the beast of Bladenboro had been found and killed. According to Gallehugh, however, it was unlikely that such a small cat could have killed and mangled the dogs. On the same day, Bruce Soles from Tabor City was leaving Bladenboro when he hit a cat with his vehicle. According to reports, it was \"spotted like a leopard,\" about 20 to 24 inches high, and weighed between 75 and 90 pounds. He took the cat home with him to Tabor City. Yet a third man is credited in some newspapers as having killed the animal. There are conflicting newspaper reports about whether it was Davis's or \"professional hunter and guide\" Berry Lewis's cat that Mayor Fussell photographed and sent out to the press. According to Corey, from \"The Carolina Farmer\", Lewis was hunting in a different part of Bladen county when he shot and killed his bobcat.\n\nMany reported accounts describe the Beast of Bladenboro as feline, but do not agree on any one species.\n\nMalcolm Frank described the animal as \"[...] resembling either a bear or a panther.\" Wilmington hunter S.W. Garrett claimed to have heard the creature scream while hunting, and likened it to that of a panther. Harry Davis, curator at the Raleigh State Museum, has said that a panther \"[...] never occurs in this country [...] We've checked on panther stories before. One turned out to be a big house cat.\" He was of the opinion that it might have actually been a coyote: \"[...] they've been traded around quite a bit, brought East as pets and released after owners got tired of them.\"\n\nJames Pittman claimed the beast had tracks like those of a dog, but he also said \"only I've never seen a dog that large.\" Chief Fores was also reported as believing the beast to be a mad wolf. He said that \"old folks say they remember seeing wolves in the bay-swamp area and talk about them every now and then.\"\n\nC.E. Kinlaw described the creature as looking like \"a big mountain lion\" when it charged her on January 5. ('Mountain lion' is another name for 'cougar'.)\nThe January 7 edition of \"The Bladen Journal\" reports that some people described the animal as likely being a wolverine. The article goes on to mention that there is speculation the creature may have been a \"wild police dog.\"\n\nThe game warden of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Sam Culberth, said that the tracks he investigated indicated a \"catamount.\" (This is yet another name for a cougar.)\n\nA.R. Stanton, a man from Lumberton, North Carolina thought that the beast of Bladenboro was a German Shepherd and Hound mix named \"Big Boy\" that he gave to a Native American boy who lived along the edge of Big Swamp. Big Boy was dark and had a \"long, bushy tail.\" Stanton was quoted as saying: \"I raised him from a pup [...] but if I met him in the woods I wouldn't call him I'd kill him.\" He claimed Big Boy was capable of leaping over a six-foot fence and killed chickens from time to time. Lumberton veterinarian N.G. Baird said, in regards to Big Boy, that it was \"very feasible\" he was responsible for the attacks. Baird also said that it was possible Big Boy (or another dog) could have killed the other dogs and lapped up blood, rather than sucking it.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of \"The Robesonian\", Daisy Morris claimed to have heard a wild panther years before, and remarked \"a dog can't scream or cry like a baby - and I can testify that towns mean nothing to a hungry panther and certainly not to a mad panther.\"\n\nLiterature about the events of the winter of 1953-54 tends towards skepticism, particularly because of the publicity involved for the town through the sensational news reports.\n\nMayor Woodrow Fussell, who operated the town theater, went to Charlotte, North Carolina on January 6 to book the film \"The Big Cat\" for a day. Leaflets published by the theater proclaimed \"Now you can see the 'Cat.' We've got him on our screen! And in Technicolor too! 'The Big Cat.' All day Saturday, Jan 9.\" In an interview with John Corey, Fussell said that he believed the creature to be a hoax, even though he was the one who called the Wilmington newspapers about the dead dogs. He found the manner of their deaths strange, and said that \"a little publicity never hurts a town.\" What he didn't anticipate however, was how far the \"Wilmington Morning Star\", \"The Wilmington News\", and other newspapers would take the story.\nCorey writes that a \"one-arm sign painter\" tailored his art to fit the sensationalism surrounding the incidents in 1954, making bumper plates proclaiming \"Home of the Beast of Bladenboro.\"\n\nOn the morning of December 15, 1954 on a tenant farm near Robeson Memorial Hospital, a man named Marvin McLamb found \"five mediumsized pigs and three chickens\" dead. According to \"The Robesonian\", \"[...] strewn around a sty approximately 10 by 15 feet in area. The animals were mutilated and four had crushed skulls. Three of the pigs had legs torn apart from their bodies. Strangely enough, no blood was evident, indicating the killer employed the same blood-sucking traits as the Bladenboro beast.\" The next day, a stray dog weighing 65 pounds was killed. Carol Freeman, the County Dog Warden, said it was \"most probably\" the killer from the day before, even though the tracks found at the farm were not compared to the dead dog's, and it was not explained how the dog could have reached the chickens, who McLamb said were roosting in a tree. According to Dog Warden Raymond Kinlaw, the feeding of raw meat to pet dogs \"[...] definitely would cause a dog to become blood thirsty.\"\n\nBoost The 'Boro, a community booster for Bladenboro, holds an annual \"Beast Fest\" in which the Beast of Bladenboro (or 'BOB', as they call him) serves as mascot. Boost The 'Boro makes use of the beast's sensational history amongst locals to generate excitement for the community event.\n\n"}
{"id": "12276216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12276216", "title": "Brief (architecture)", "text": "Brief (architecture)\n\nAn architectural brief is a statement of a client's requirements, which form the basis for appointing an architect. The brief describes the requirements that need to be reconciled and accommodated, and is developed first as a design which is submitted for approval, and subsequently constructed as a building or other structure. A brief is a written document that might be anything from a single page to a multiple volume set of documents. \nThe term program is often used today, in conjunction with, and in part as a synonym of, an \"architectural brief\". \"Program\" is used more often in the United States whereas 'brief' is used more outside the United States, internationally. An architect's design is considered the response to the building program.\n\nThe architectural brief is often formulated by, or in collaboration with, the architect. It often includes opportunities assessed, constraints identified and needs for further investigation clarified.\n\nIn the early stages of the design process the brief may be continuously reappraised as the requirements become clearer - this is known as 'firming up the brief'. Ultimately, a clear set of instructions setting out the overarching goals and detailed requirements will emerge which form the starting point of the architect's designs and will be continually tested against, as designs are progressed.\n\nIn the later stages of writing a brief, a schedule of accommodation is sometimes drawn up that will specify precisely the number and size of rooms that will be required, the relationships between rooms and groups of rooms, the finishes, equipment, furniture that will fit the room for its functional purpose and the environmental conditions that will assist the purpose. Environmental conditions might include temperature range, humidity, air movement, acoustic isolation, etc..The schedule of accommodation is prepared by an expert to help in determining the minimum space required on site to develop and finish a given design .The schedule of accommodation is guided by the brief analysis of every space since every space have set standards and requirement.\n\nFor complex facilities, the brief may be prepared by a specialist consultant, separate from the design architect. In such projects, workshops are often employed with project participants: owners, users, customers, facility experts, builders/contractors and other designers brought together for an intensive one- or two-day period to devise the critical aspects of the brief.\n\nIf the brief will provide a large number of similar spaces, for example, in a hospital, then room/space 'types' might be defined, as a type of 'space dictionary' that is then used to inform room or space groupings. These space groupings are then assembled into related sets of rooms to meet a functional or service requirement. The critical component of the related sets is that the interactions between rooms are set out, with details as to the type of interaction. For example, if escorted patients, beds and medical equipment are to be moved, or if individuals or groups of people will move between spaces, the architect's design will need to acknowledge the different design responses to be made.\n\nThe information used to assemble a 'space dictionary' can be quite detailed, with a schedule produced that lists, for each room, parameters, the requirement against the parameter, and any particular performance needs.\n\nParameters might include: population (median and peak), area, minimum height, floor loading, floor finish and skirting requirements, including any plinths, hobs or set-downs, wall finishes, including wall protection needs (pertinent in hospitals, warehouses, etc.), ceiling finish, including acoustic needs, engineering services required: power, lighting, air-conditioning, water, drainage, communications, etc.; environmental conditions: air temperature, humidity, noise level, air movement; access and security needs; FFE (furniture, fittings and equipment), with note made of mass, dimensions, power requirements, energy evolved, noise produced, ventilation and extraction needed, service and operating clearances; fire safety.\n\nA thorough brief will start with a definition of the services or functions to be accommodated, decomposing these functions into specific sub-functions and then to activities. A 'functional brief' is thus compiled. This brief is used to, in turn, create the architectural brief, that sets out the accommodation specifics for preparation of design options.\n\nFor critical facilities, the project manager or owner may require the architect to validate the design against the brief, producing a report that shows in tabular form, how and where, the design meets the brief. This avoids misunderstanding of drawings that can arise when non-experts are asked to review them. A graphical validation might include demonstration of the movement expected between spaces, and show how a proximity diagram is modeled onto the design layout.\n\n"}

It represents the international artistic style of the royal courts in the court of Louis I of Hungary.\n\nIts full name is: \"Chronicon pictum, Marci de Kalt, Chronica de gestis Hungarorum\", that is \"Illustrated Chronicle, Mark of Kalt's Chronicle About the Deeds of the Hungarians\".\n\nThe chronicle was written by Márk Kálti (lat. \"Marci de Kalt\") shortly after the year 1358, with the last of the illuminations being finished between 1370 and 1373. The chronicle was given by the Hungarian king Louis I to the French king Charles V, when the daughter of Louis, Catherine, was engaged to Charles' son Louis I, Duke of Orléans.\n\nIt was then gifted to Đorđe Branković in 1456, where it was copied, and later lost, possibly spending some time in Turkish possession.\n\nThe chronicle reappears in the first half of the 17th century in royal archives of Vienna by unknown means, this is why it is also referred as the \"Vienna Illuminated Chronicle\". The manuscript is now kept in the National Széchényi Library in Budapest (Országos Széchényi Könyvtár, Budapest).\n\nThe 147 pictures of the chronicle are great source of information on medieval Hungarian cultural history, costume, and court life in the 14th century. Many miniatures seen inside this chronicle are painted with gold. The artistic value of the miniatures are quite high, if we compare similar miniatures from other parts of Western Europe from the same time. The characters are drawn with detail and with knowledge of anatomy. Even the eyeballs are painted, which can only be checked through microscope.\n\nAll miniatures showing Attila the Hun are disrupted or even rubbed out (especially the last, showing Attila's death); this cannot be due to the time as all other miniatures and text are preserved well. The miniatures make use of symbolism, i.e. \"primus ingressus\" ('first incoming') is with a camel, while the \"secundus ingressus\" ('second incoming') is with a white horse, probably meaning that entering the Carpathian Basin the first time was not a successful or was a culturally diverted act (as the camel is a \"diverted\" horse and white horse is the \"pure quality\"). The text of Latin is without error and is representing a high quality.\n\n"}

She was active from the late 1960s through the 1980s. She frequently wrestled women such as Ann Casey, Vicki Williams, Evelyn Stevens and Leilani Kai throughout the 1970s.\n\nChristanello was employed at a restaurant in Pittsburgh when she decided to contact a wrestling promoter to become a professional wrestler. Male wrestlers Waldo Von Erich and Klondike Bill helped set her up with women's wrestling trainer The Fabulous Moolah. She moved to South Carolina in 1963 to train with Moolah. In 1969, Christanello competed during an Australian tour with Toni Rose, Jessica Rodgers, Betty and Rita Boucher, Ramona Isbell, Marva Scott and Evelyn Stevens.\n\nShe was the frequent tag team partner of Toni Rose. She and Rose won the National Wrestling Alliance's NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship in 1970. In 1972, she competed at the Superbowl of Wrestling, where she and Rose defended the time World Women's Tag Team Championship against Sandy Parker and Debbie Johnson. They eventually lost the title in October 1973 to Joyce Grable and Vicki Williams at Madison Square Garden in New York. There is also an unrecorded title change. Susan Green and Sandy Parker won the World Tag Team title from Christanello and Rose in November 1971 in Hawaii and lost them in February 1972 to Christanello and Rose in Hong Kong. They also defended the title in the NWA and American Wrestling Association, and the title was eventually integrated into the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). As a result, they were recognized as the first WWF Women's Tag Team Champions.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s she competed in the WWF's women's division. Christianello continued to wrestle in tag team matches. On May 5, 1984, Susan Starr and Christianello defeated Wendi Richter and Peggy Lee. On June 5, 1984, Peggy Lee and Christianello defeated The Fabulous Moolah and Desiree Petersen. The next day Moolah and Petersen defeated the team of Christianello and Judy Martin. On June 9, Moolah and Petersen defeated Martin and Christianello. The following day, Moolah and Petersen once again defeated Christianello and Judy Martin.\n\nIn August 1984, Christianello wrestled primarily singles matches. On August 19, Susan Green defeated Christianello. In matches on both August 20 and 21, Susan Starr defeated Christianello. In 1987, she wrestled as part of Sensational Sherri's team at the Survivor Series pay-per-view.\n\nChristanello was born and raised in Pittsburgh and was of Italian descent. She lived with The Fabulous Moolah on-and-off for forty years, ending in May 1999 when she moved back to Pittsburgh. While living with Moolah, she helped train women wrestlers Sherri Martel and Brittany Brown. After retiring from the ring, she was employed by Wal-Mart in the accounting department.\n\nHer niece, Marie Minor, was trained by Christanello and worked as a wrestler under the ring name Angie Minelli for several years in the 1980s.\n\nOn August 25, 2011, she died from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD].

{"id": "1452257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1452257", "title": "Dudley Tunnel", "text": "Dudley Tunnel\n\nDudley Tunnel is a canal tunnel on the Dudley Canal Line No 1, England. At about long, it is now the second longest canal tunnel on the UK canal network today. (Standedge Tunnel is the longest, at , and the Higham and Strood tunnel is now rail only). However, since the Dudley Tunnel is not continuous this status is sometimes questioned: (the main tunnel is , Lord Ward's tunnel is and Castle Mill basin is ).\n\nIn 1959 the British Transport Commission sought to close the tunnel but this led to an Inland Waterways Association-organised massed protest cruise in 1960. The tunnel was however closed in 1962; and was further threatened with permanent closure by British Railways who wished to replace a railway viaduct at the Tipton portal with an embankment and a culvert. However, this never happened as the railway was closed in 1968 and the disused bridge demolished in the 1990s.\n\nThe tunnel was reopened in 1973, as a result of restoration, which had been a collaboration between local volunteers (originally the Dudley Canal Tunnel Preservation Society, later the Dudley Canal Trust), and the local authority, Dudley Borough Council. The opening ceremony was advertised as \"TRAD 1973 - Tunnel Reopening at Dudley\".\n\nA private Act of Parliament to construct the tunnel and associated canal, later to be known as the Dudley Canal Line No. 1, was passed in 1776. However Lord Dudley and Ward started building a canal and tunnel, in 1775, to link his Tipton Colliery and his lime works to the Birmingham Canal Navigations, at Tipton, on the 473 ft \"Wolverhampton Level\". The work was completed in 1778 and was known as Lord Ward's canal. He later agreed to sell the canal and tunnel to the Dudley Canal Company. The Dudley Canal Line No. 1 and Dudley Tunnel were reported as finished on 25 June 1791.\n\nThe earliest part of tunnel system was built to help with the transport of limestone extracted from the mines inside Castle Hill through which the tunnel runs. This was Lord Ward's tunnel, which leads to Castle Mill Basin. From there the main tunnel runs, via the Cathedral Arch, to Parkhead, near Netherton. At Cathedral Arch a branch canal led into the Little Tess Cavern mine workings. This route is now blocked, but has been by-passed by two new tunnels (see below). The southern end, including the southern portal, of the tunnel had to be rebuilt in 1884 due to subsidence caused by adjacent coal mines. This section of the tunnel was built several feet wider than the original tunnel bore. The southern portal bears a brick \"date stone\" of 1884.\n\nAnother canal tunnel at Castle Mill Basin, now blocked off by a dam, leads under Wren's Nest to two under ground basins, east basin and west basin, and was used to transport limestone from the underground mine workings. Surface quarries were also opened; they outlasted the underground workings and were last used in the early 1920s. The land above the underground workings, together with the surface quarries, became a National Nature Reserve.\n\nBy 1959, the tunnel was virtually disused, and British Waterways announced plans to officially close it. A number of protest groups organised cruises through the tunnel during 1960 in hope of it being kept open, but in 1962 the tunnel was finally closed. Its very existence was threatened the following year when the railway viaduct above it was found to be structurally unsafe; this was largely a goods line since the closure of passenger stations along it the previous year, but the railway authorities planned to preserve the railway line and wanted to replace the viaduct with an embankment. The plans involved sealing the tunnel off. \n\nHowever, the railway closed completely in 1968 and so the tunnel was saved. Following several years of preparation work, the tunnel was officially re-opened in 1973.\n\nIn 1989 two completely new canal tunnels were made, linking Singing Cavern and the Rock Tunnel, via Little Tess Cavern, to Castle Mill Basin (the northern portal of the main tunnel).\n\nThe restrictive dimensions of the tunnel and the absence of a towpath mean that many boats are unable to pass through it. Those that can are not allowed to use diesel engines due to the lack of ventilation in the tunnel.\n\nVisitors may take a battery-powered narrowboat trip operated by Dudley Canal Trust either through the tunnel or partway through the tunnel and the adjacent mines; and, also, try legging the boat.\n\nThe rock of Castle Hill into which the tunnel is dug, oolitic limestone, allows visitors to see trilobite fossils preserved within it. Some fossils which were considered notable and were located close to the waterline, have been removed to prevent them from being eroded and attacked by visitors. Other parts of the tunnel pass through a dolerite known locally as Rowley Rag; and through Coal Measures rocks.\n\nThe Netherton Tunnel follows a parallel route 1½ miles to the south east; it is much larger and has twin towpaths running through it. It was built to ease congestion in the Dudley Tunnel.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6732160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6732160", "title": "Ecclesiastical letter", "text": "Ecclesiastical letter\n\nEcclesiastical letters are publications or announcements of the organs of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authority, e.g. the synods, but more particularly of pope and bishops, addressed to the faithful in the form of letters.\n\nThe popes began early, by virtue of the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff, to issue canon laws as well for the entire Church as for individuals, in the form of letters which popes sent either of their own will or when application was made to them by synods, bishops or individual Christians.\nApart from the Epistles of the Apostle Peter, the first example of this is the Letter of Pope Clement I (90-99?) to the Corinthians, in whose community there was grave dissension. Only a few papal letters of the first three Christian centuries have been preserved in whole or part, or are known from the works of ecclesiastical writers. Among them are Adversus Aleatores by Pope Victor I, some fragments of a letter by Pope Stephen I, three letters by Pope Cornelius, and one by Pope Dionysius. As soon as the Church was recognized by the (Roman) State and could freely spread in all directions, the papal primacy of necessity began to develop, and from this time on the number of papal letters increased.\nNo part of the Church and no question of faith or morals failed to attract the papal attention. The popes called these letters with reference to their legal character, \"decreta, statuta, decretalia constituta\", even when the letters were often hortatory in form. Thus Siricius, in his letter of the year 385 to Himerius of Tarragona, a Greek Sophist, Rhetorician and archbishop of Tarragona. Or the letters were called sententiæ, i. e. opinions; præcepta; auctoritates. On the other hand, more general letters, especially those of dogmatic importance, were also called at times \"tomi; indiculi; commonitoria; epistolae tractoriae\", or simply \"tractatoriae\".\nIf the matter were important, the popes issued the letters not by their sole authority, but with the advice of the Roman presbytery or of a synod. Consequently, such letters were also called \"epistolae synodiae\". By \"epistola synodica\" was also understood in Christian antiquity the letter of the newly elected bishop or pope by which he notified the other bishops of his elevation and of his agreement with them in the Faith. Thus an epistola of this kind had a certain relationship to the \"litterae formatae\" by which a bishop certified, for presentation to another bishop, to the orthodoxy and unblemished moral character of an ecclesiastic of his diocese. Closely related to the litterae formatae are the \"litterae dimissoriae\" (dimissorials) by which a bishop sends a candidate for ordination to another bishop to be ordained.\nWhile these names indicate sufficiently the legal character of the papal letters, it is to be noted that the popes repeatedly demanded in explicit terms the observance of their decrees; thus Siricius, in his letter of the year 385 to Himerius, and Innocent I in his letter of the year 416 addressed to Decentius, Bishop of Gubbio. In the same manner they repeatedly required from the persons to whom they wrote that these should bring the letter in question to the notice of others. Thus again Siricius, in his letter to Himerius; and Pope Zosimus, in the year 418 to Hesychius of Sabona.\nIn order to secure such knowledge of the papal laws, several copies of the papal letters were occasionally made and dispatched at the same time. In this way arose the letters a pari: \"a paribus uniformes, ta isa\".\nFollowing the example of the Roman emperors, the popes soon established archives (\"scrinium\") in which copies of their letters were placed as memorials for further use, and as proofs of authenticity. The first mention of papal archives is found in the Acts of a synod held about 370 under Pope Damasus I. Pope Zosimus also makes mention in 419 of the archives. Nevertheless, forged papal letters appeared even earlier than this. But by far the greater number of the papal letters of the first millennium have been lost; only the letters of Pope Leo I, edited by the Ballerini brothers, the \"Registrum Epistolarum\" of Gregory I, edited by Ewald and Hartmann, and the \"Registrum Epistolarum\" of Gregory VII, edited by Jaffé, have been more or less completely preserved.\nAs befitted their legal importance, the papal letters were also soon incorporated in the collections of canon law. The first to collect the epistles of the popes in a systematic and comprehensive manner was the monk Dionysius Exiguus, at the beginning of the sixth century. In this way the papal letters took rank with the canons of the synods as of equal value and of equal obligation. The example of Dionysius was followed afterwards by almost all compilers of the canons, Pseudo-Isidore and the Gregorian canonists, e.g. Anselm of Lucca, Deusdedit etc.\n\nWith the development of the papal primacy in the Middle Ages the papal letters grew enormously in number. The popes, following the earlier custom, insisted that their rescripts, issued for individual cases, should be observed in all analogous ones. According to the teaching of the canonists, above all of Gratian, every papal letter of general character was authoritative for the entire Church without further notification.\nThe names of the letters of general authority were very varied: constitutio(n); edict(um); statutum; decretum; decretalis; sanctio. Decrees (decreta) was the name given especially to general ordinances issued with the advice of the cardinals. On the other hand, ordinances issued for individual cases were called rescripta, responsa, mandata. Thus a (papal) constitution was always understood to be a papal ordinance which regulated ecclesiastical conditions of a general character judicially, in a durable manner and form, for all time; but by a rescript was understood a papal ordinance issued at the petition of an individual that decided a lawsuit or granted a favour. Compare the Bulls of promulgation prefixed to the \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX, the \"Liber Sextus\" of Boniface VIII and the \"Clementinæ\"; also the titles, \"De constitutionibus\" and \"De rescriptis\" in the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". Notwithstanding all this, usage remained uncertain.\nThe above-mentioned distinctions between papal documents were based on the extent of their authority. Other names again had their origin in the form of the papal documents. It is true they all had more or less evidently the form of letters. But essential differences appeared, especially in regard to the literary form (\"stylus\") of the document and the method of sealing, these depending in each case on the importance of the contents of the respective document. It was merely the difference in the manner of sealing that led to the distinction between Bulls and Briefs. For Papal Bulls, legal instruments almost entirely for important matters, the seal was stamped in wax or lead, seldom in gold, enclosed in a case, and fastened to the document by a cord. For Briefs, instruments used as a rule in matters of less importance, the seal was stamped upon the document in wax. Curial letters (\"litterae curiales\" or \"litterae de curia\") denoted particularly letters of the popes in political affairs.\nDuring the Middle Ages, just as in the early Church, the letters of the popes were deposited in the papal archives either in the original or by copy. They are still in existence, and almost complete in number, from the time of Innocent III (1198–1216). Many papal letters were also incorporated, as their legal nature required, in the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". Others are to be found in the formularies, many of which appeared unofficially in the Middle Ages, similar in kind to the ancient official \"Liber Diurnus\" of the papal chancery in use as late as the time of Gregory VII. The papal letters were forwarded by the papal officials, above all by the Apostolic Chancery, for whose use the chancery rules, \"regulae cancellariae Apostolicae\", were drawn up with regard to the execution and dispatch of the papal letters, dating back to the twelfth century. Nevertheless, the forging of papal letters was even more frequent in the Middle Ages than in the early Church. Innocent III refers to no less than nine methods of falsification. From the thirteenth century on to January, 1909 it sufficed, in order to give a papal document legal force, to post it up at Rome on the doors of St. Peter's, of the Lateran, the Apostolic Chancery and in the Piazza del Campo di Fiori, but since they acquired force only by publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis.\n\nIn the modern period also, papal letters have been constantly issued, but they proceed from the popes themselves less frequently than in the Middle Ages and Christian antiquity; most of them are issued by the papal officials, of whom there is a greater number than in the Middle Ages, and to whom have been granted large delegated powers, which include the issuing of letters. Following the example of Paul III, Pius IV and Pius V, Sixtus V by the Papal Bull \"Immensa aeterni\" of 22 January 1587, added to the already existing bodies of papal officials a number of congregations of cardinals with clearly defined powers of administration and jurisdiction. Succeeding popes added other congregations.\nPius X in the Constitution \"Sapienti consilio\" of 29 June 1908, reorganized the papal Curia, papal writings being divided into (Apostolic) Constitutions, (papal) Rescripts, (Papal) Bulls, (Papal) Briefs and Apostolic Letters (\"Litterae Apostolicae\").\nThe papal documents are still deposited in the Roman archives. There are no official collections of them corresponding to the medieval \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". The last(?) official collection is that of the Constitutions of Benedict XIV (1740–1758). From the sixteenth century, on the other hand, private collections have appeared, some of which are called \"bullaria\", from the more important part of their contents. Many papal letters are also found in the collections of the Acts of the Councils. The documents issued by the officials of the Curia and the Congregations of Cardinals contain either resolutions (decisions) for individual cases, or declarations (extensivae or comprehensivae) interpreting laws, or decrees, which are entirely new laws. Some congregations of cardinals have issued official collections of their decisions.\n\nCoustant, \"Epistolæ Romanorum Pontificum et quæ ad eos scriptæ sunt a S. Clemente I usque ad Innocentium III\" (Paris, 1721), goes to only 440; Schönemann, \"Pontificum Romanorum a Clemente I usque ad Leonem M. genuinæ ... epistolæ\" (Göttingen, 1796); Thiel, \"Epistolæ Romanorum Pontificum genuinæ ... a S. Hilaro usque ad Pelagium II\" (Brunsberg, 1868).\n\nFrom 1881 the École Française of Rome has published, with particular reference to France, the \"Registra\" of Gregory IX, Innocent IV, Alexander IV, Urban IV, Clement IV, Gregory X, John XXI, Nicholas III, Martin IV, Honorius IV, Nicholas IV, Boniface VIII, and Benedict XI. The \"Registra\" of the Avignon popes are also in course of publication. Cf. \"Mélanges d'archéologie et d'histoire\", XXV, 443 sqq.; Joseph Hergenröther, \"Leonis X Pontificis Maximi Regesta\" (Freiburg, 1884-); \"Regesta Clementis Papæ V cura et studio monachorum ordinis S. Benedicti\" (Rome, 1885-); Pressuti, \"Registrum Honorii III\" (Rome, 1888-).\n\nThere are innumerable collections of papal letters issued from a partisan point of view. All known papal letters up to 1198 are enumerated by Jaffé in the \"Regesta Rom. Pont.\" The papal letters of 1198-1304 are found in August Potthast, \"Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab anno 1198 ad annum 1304\" (Berlin, 1874).\n\nPaul Kehr prepared a critical edition of all papal letters up to Innocent III. See the \"Nachrichten\", of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, 1896, 72 sqq.; \"Pii IX acta\" (Rome, 1854-); \"Leonis XIII acta\" (Rome, 1881); \"Pii X acta\" (Rome, 1907). For the Bullaria, see Tomasetti, \"Bullarum, diplomatum et privilegiorum s. Romanorum Pontificum Taurinensis editio locupletissima\" (Turin, 1857-); for collections of the Acts of the Councils, Mansi, \"Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio\" (Florence and Venice, 1759), goes to 1439. It is continued by \"Collectio conciliorum recentioris ecclesiæ universæ\", ed. Martin and Petit (Paris, 1905); \"Decreta authentica S. Congregationis Indulgentiarum edita jussu et auctoritate Leonis XIII\" (Ratisbon, 1883); \"Jus Pontificium de Propaganda Fide Leonis XIII jussu recognitum\" (Rome, 1888); \"Decreta authentica Congregationis S. Rituum ... promulgata sub auspiciis Leonis XIII\" (Rome, 1898).\n\nThe above-mentioned \"Sapienti Consilio\" of Pope Pius X decreed, that \"all\" papal laws were to be promulgated through publication in an official bulletin called the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, the first issues of which, at intervals of about twice a month, appeared in 1909. From 1865 to 1908, papal documents had been published in a similar series under the title Acta Sanctae Sedis, which was declared official in 1904. Before 1865, papal documents were not systematically published in documentary fashion and were promulgated by other means such as being affixed to the doors of basilicas in Rome.\n\nJust as the popes rule the Church largely by means of letters, so also the bishops make use of letters for the administration of their dioceses. The documents issued by a bishop are divided according to their form into pastoral letters, synodal and diocesan statutes, mandates or ordinances or decrees, the classification depending upon whether they have been drawn up more as letters, or have been issued by a synod or the diocesan chancery.\nThe pastoral letters are addressed either to all the members of the diocese (\"litterae pastorales\") or only to the clergy, in this case generally in Latin (\"litterae encyclicae\"). The mandates, decrees or ordinances are issued either by the bishop himself or by one of his officials.\nThe synodal statutes are ordinances issued by the bishop at the diocesan synod, with the advice, but in no way with the legislative co-operation, of the diocesan clergy. The diocesan statutes, regularly speaking, are those episcopal ordinances which, because they refer to more weighty matters, are prepared with the obligatory or facultative co-operation of the cathedral chapter.\nIn order to have legal force the episcopal documents must be published in a suitable manner and according to usage. Civil laws by which episcopal and also papal documents have to receive the approval of the State before they can be published are irrational and out of date according to the First Vatican Council (Sess. III, De eccles., c. iii). (See Exequatur.)\n\n"}

The term “eel” originally referred to the European eel, and the name of the genus means “European-eel-shaped.”\n\nThe term “eel” is also used for some other eel-shaped fish, such as electric eels (genus \"Electrophorus\"), spiny eels (family Mastacembelidae), and deep-sea spiny eels (family Notacanthidae). These other clades, however, evolved their eellike shapes independently from the true eels.\n\nEels are elongated fish, ranging in length from in the one-jawed eel (\"Monognathus ahlstromi\") to in the slender giant moray. Adults range in weight from to well over . They possess no pelvic fins, and many species also lack pectoral fins. The dorsal and anal fins are fused with the caudal fin, forming a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal. Eels swim by generating body waves which travel the length of their bodies. They can swim backwards by reversing the direction of the wave.\n\nMost eels live in the shallow waters of the ocean and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks. A majority of eel species are nocturnal, thus are rarely seen. Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or \"eel pits\". Some species of eels also live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as . Only members of the \"Anguilla\" regularly inhabit fresh water, but they, too, return to the sea to breed.\n\nThe heaviest true eel is the European conger. The maximum size of this species has been reported as reaching a length of 3 m (10 ft) and a weight of 110 kg (240 lb). Other eels are longer, but do not weigh as much, such as the slender giant moray which reaches 4 m (13 ft).\n\nEels begin life as flat and transparent larvae, called leptocephali. Eel larvae drift in the surface waters of the sea, feeding on marine snow, small particles that float in the water. Eel larvae then metamorphose into glass eels and then become elvers before finally seeking out their juvenile and adult habitats. Many eels remain in the sea throughout their lives, but freshwater elvers of eels in the family anguillidae travel upstream and are forced to climb up obstructions, such as weirs, dam walls, and natural waterfalls.\n\nLady Colin Campbell found, at Ballisodare, the eel fisheries were greatly improved by the hanging of loosely plaited grass ladders over barriers, enabling the elvers to ascend.\n\nThis classification follows FishBase in dividing the eels into 20 families. Additional families included in other classifications (notably ITIS and Systema Naturae 2000) are noted below the family with which they are synomized in the Fish Base system.\n\nIdentifying the origin of the freshwater species has been problematic. Genomic studies indicate they are a monophyletic group which originated among the deep-sea eels.\n\nTaxonomy based on Neslon, Grande and Wilson 2016.\n\n\nIn some classifications, the family Cyematidae of bobtail snipe eels is included in the Anguilliformes, but in the FishBase system that family is included in the order Saccopharyngiformes.\n\nThe electric eel of South America is not a true eel, but is a South American knifefish more closely related to the carps and catfishes.\n\nPhylogeny based on Johnson et al. 2012.\n\nFreshwater eels (\"unagi\") and marine eels (conger eel, \"anago\") are commonly used in Japanese cuisine; foods such as \"unadon\" and \"unajū\" are popular, but expensive. Eels are also very popular in Chinese cuisine, and are prepared in many different ways. Hong Kong eel prices have often reached 1000 HKD (128.86 US Dollars) per kg, and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kg. The European eel and other freshwater eels are eaten in Europe, the United States, and other places. A traditional east London food is jellied eels, although the demand has significantly declined since World War II. The Northern Spanish delicacy \"angulas\" consists of elver (young eels) sautéed in olive oil with garlic; elvers usually reach prices of up to 1000 euro per kg. New Zealand longfin eel is a traditional Māori food in New Zealand. In Italian cuisine, eels from the Valli di Comacchio, a swampy zone along the Adriatic coast, are especially prized, along with freshwater eels of Bolsena Lake and pond eels from Cabras, Sardinia. In northern Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden, smoked eel is considered a delicacy.\n\nElvers, often fried, used to be a cheap dish in the United Kingdom; but, during the 1990s, their numbers collapsed across Europe. They are now not just a delicacy, but the UK's most expensive species.\n\nEels, particularly the moray eel, are popular among marine aquarists.\n\nEel blood is toxic to humans and other mammals, but both cooking and the digestive process destroy the toxic protein. The toxin derived from eel blood serum was used by Charles Robert Richet in his Nobel Prize-winning research which discovered anaphylaxis (by injecting it into dogs and observing the effect). The poison used by Richet was actually obtained from sea anemones.\n\nEelskin leather is highly prized. It is very smooth and exceptionally strong. However, it does not come from eels. It comes from the Pacific hagfish, a jawless fish which is also known as the slime eel.\n\nThe large lake of Almere, which existed in the early Medieval Netherlands, got its names from the eels which lived in its water (the Dutch word for eel is aal or ael, so: \"ael mere\" = \"eel lake\"). The name is preserved in the new city of Almere in Flevoland, given in 1984 in memory of this body of water on whose site the town is located.\n\nThe daylight passage in the spring of Elvers upstream along the Thames was at one time called \"eel fare\". The word 'elver' is thought to be a corruption of \"eel fare.\"\n\nA famous attraction on the French Polynesian island of Huahine (part of the Society Islands) is the bridge across a stream hosting 3- to 6-ft-long eels, deemed sacred by local culture.\n\nEel fishing in Nazi-time Danzig plays an important role in Günter Grass' novel \"The Tin Drum\". The cruelty of humans to eels is used as a metaphor for Nazi atrocities, and the sight of eels being killed by a fisherman triggers the madness of the protagonist's mother.\n\nSinister implications of eels fishing are also referenced in Jo Nesbø's \"The Cockroaches\", the second book of the Harry Hole detective series. The book's background includes a Norwegian village where eels in the nearby sea are rumored to feed on the corpses of drowned humans – making the eating of these eels verge on cannibalism.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the European eel, Japanese eel, and American eel to its seafood red list. Japan consumes more than 70% of the global eel catch.\n\nThe English name \"eel\" descends from Old English \"ǣl\", Common Germanic \"*ēlaz\". Also from the common Germanic are West Frisian \"iel\", Dutch \"aal\", German \"Aal\", and Icelandic \"áll\". Katz (1998) identifies a number of Indo-European cognates, among them the second part of the Latin word for eels, \"anguilla\", attested in its simplex form \"illa\" (in a glossary only), and the Greek word for \"eel\", \"egkhelys\" (the second part of which is attested in Hesychius as \"elyes\"). The first compound member, \"anguis\" (\"snake\"), is cognate to other Indo-European words for \"snake\" (compare Old Irish \"escung\" \"eel\", Old High German \"unc\" \"snake\", Lithuanian \"angìs\", Greek \"ophis, okhis\", Vedic Sanskrit \"áhi\", Avestan \"aži\", Armenian \"auj, iž\", Old Church Slavonic \"*ǫžь\", all from Proto-Indo-European \"*ogis, ēgis\").The word also appears in the Old English word for \"hedgehog,\" which is \"igil\" (meaning \"snake eater\"), and perhaps in the \"egi-\" of Old High German \"egidehsa\" \"wall lizard\".\n\nAccording to this theory, the name Bellerophon (Βελλεροφόντης, attested in a variant Ἐλλεροφόντης in Eustathius of Thessalonica), is also related, translating to \"the slayer of the serpent\" (\"ahihán\"). On this theory, the ελλερο- is an adjective form of an older word, ελλυ, meaning \"snake\", which is directly comparable to Hittite \"ellu-essar-\" \"snake pit\". This myth likely came to Greece via Anatolia. In the Hittite version of the myth, the dragon is called \"Illuyanka\": the \"illuy-\" part is cognate to the word \"illa\", and the \"-anka\" part is cognate to \"angu\", a word for \"snake\". Since the words for \"snake\" (and similarly shaped animals) are often subject to taboo in many Indo-European (and non-Indo-European) languages, no unambiguous Proto-Indo-European form of the word for eel can be reconstructed. It may have been \"*ēl(l)-u-\", \"*ēl(l)-o-\", or something similar.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1492011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1492011", "title": "F for Fake", "text": "F for Fake\n\nF for Fake (, \"Truths and lies\") is a 1973 docudrama film co-written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles who worked on the film alongside François Reichenbach, Oja Kodar, and Gary Graver. Initially released in 1974, it focuses on Elmyr de Hory's recounting of his career as a professional art forger; de Hory's story serves as the backdrop for a fast-paced, meandering investigation of the natures of authorship and authenticity, as well as the basis of the value of art. Loosely a documentary, the film operates in several different genres and has been described as a kind of film essay.\n\nFar from serving as a traditional documentary on Elmyr de Hory, the film also incorporates Welles's companion Oja Kodar, notorious \"hoax-biographer\" Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles as himself.\n\nIn addition to the 88-minute film, in 1976 Welles also shot and edited a self-contained 9-minute short film as a \"trailer\", almost entirely composed of original material not found in the main film itself.\n\nOrson Welles was hired to edit a documentary by François Reichenbach about the art forger Elmyr de Hory. The film grew over time to encompass de Hory, as well as de Hory's biographer Clifford Irving, who was revealed to be a forger himself. Welles used these circumstances to produce a meditation on the nature of fakery. \n\nSeveral storylines are presented in the film, including those of de Hory, Irving, Welles, Howard Hughes and Kodar. About de Hory, we learn that he was a struggling artist who turned to forgery out of desperation, only to see the greater share of the profits from his deceptions go to doubly unscrupulous art dealers. As partial compensation for that injustice, he is maintained in a villa in Ibiza by one of his dealers. What is only hinted at in Welles's documentary is that de Hory had recently served a two-month sentence in a Spanish prison for homosexuality and consorting with criminals. (De Hory would commit suicide two years after the initial release of Welles' film, on hearing that Spain had agreed to turn him over to the French authorities.)\n\nIrving's original part in \"F for Fake\" was as de Hory's biographer, but his part grew unexpectedly at some point during production. There has not always been agreement among commentators over just how that production unfolded, but the now-accepted story is that the director François Reichenbach shot a documentary about de Hory and Irving before giving his footage to Welles, who then shot additional footage with Reichenbach as his cinematographer.\n\nIn the time between the shooting of Reichenbach's documentary and the finishing of Welles', it became known that Irving had perpetrated a hoax of his own, namely a fabricated \"authorized biography\" of Howard Hughes (the hoax was later fictionalized in \"The Hoax\"). This discovery prompted the shooting of still more footage, which then got woven into \"F for Fake\". Interweaving the narratives even more, there are several pieces of footage in the film showing Welles at a party with De Hory, and, at one point, De Hory even signs a painting with a forgery of Welles' signature. Some of Hughes' career is outlined in the form of a parody of the \"News on the March\" sequence in \"Citizen Kane\". Welles also draws parallels between the De Hory and Irving hoaxes and his own brush with early notoriety by including a recreation of part of his 1938 \"War of the Worlds\" radio drama, which had simulated a newscast about a Martian invasion and sparked panic among some listeners.\n\nThe story about Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso and some forger paintings that the grandfather supposedly made is presented at the end of the film before Welles reminds the viewer that he only promised to tell the truth for an hour and that \"for the last 17 minutes, I've been lying my head off.\" In the commentary to the Criterion Collection DVD release of \"F for Fake\", Kodar claims the idea for this segment as her own. She also claims credit for the movie's opening sequence, which consists of shots of a miniskirt-clad Kodar walking down streets while rubbernecking male admirers (unaware that they are being filmed) stop and openly stare. This sequence is described by Kodar as inspired by her feminism; in his narration, Welles claims the footage was originally shot for an unrelated production.\n\nThe film opens with Welles performing magic tricks for some children while Kodar watches nearby. Welles quotes Robert-Houdin to the effect that a magician is just an actor. Welles promises that for the next hour everything in the film will be based on solid fact. Kodar is then shown strolling around a street in a miniskirt while being ogled by the men on the street. Welles reveals the footage is taken from another experiment about girl-watching, where Kodar deliberately drew attention to herself and the men were unaware they were being filmed. Welles says her story will continue later in the film, and then narrates the story of Elmyr de Hory, an art forger who sold many fake paintings to museums and collectors all over the world. Elmyr is shown throwing a dinner party at his home in Ibiza and being feted by European society, although he dances around the question of whether he is guilty or not. One of those filmed is Clifford Irving, who had published a biography of Elmyr called \"Fake\", and later in a notorious scandal was revealed to have been the forger of Howard Hughes's diary. Welles discusses the irony of Irving commenting on Elmyr's forgery while having committed a version of it himself. Irving and Elmyr tell about the art dealers who were fooled by the forgeries, and Welles considers the question whether this means art dealers and appraisers are fake also. \n\nWelles presents more of Irving's story of having had secret contact with Hughes, and the odd stories of Hughes's behavior that may or may not have been true. He wonders if believing such stories makes a person credulous or not, and questions the true wisdom of so-called experts, who verified Irving's forgery as authentic. Reichenbach is shown telling how Elmyr provided him with several paintings of questionable authenticity, but the art dealers he gave them to were willfully blind to it. Welles notes that Elmyr doesn't even own the house he lives in; it's provided for him by an art dealer. Welles recounts his own past use of fakery: how he got a job in Ireland by falsely claiming to be a famous New York actor, and how his broadcast of War of the Worlds made deliberate use of fake news to enhance the story. He also notes the coincidence that his first film \"Citizen Kane\" was originally going to be a fictionalized version of Howard Hughes.\n\nIrving describes how Elmyr was nearly destitute when younger and subsisted in America by making and selling forgeries that were indistinguishable from the real works, while remaining one step ahead of the law through frequent relocations. He finally moved to Ibiza, but was not prosecuted for lack of witnesses to the actual forging, as well as the scandal that might be aroused by revealing the depth of the art market's complicity in the deception. Elmyr insists he never signed any forgery, and Welles wonders whether, given the fact that all art eventually falls away to ruin, a signature truly matters to any art work. He illustrates the point by shots of the cathedral of Chartres, pointing out that the names of the men who created the magnificent building and the sculptures which adorn it are unknown. They did not sign their work, but it has endured.\n\nWelles finally presents Kodar's story: she holidayed in the same village as Picasso, who noticed her and painted 22 pieces with her as the model. She insisted she be allowed to keep the paintings, but later when Picasso read about an acclaimed exhibit of 22 new pieces of his, he flew there in a rage, only to discover the pieces were all forgeries. Kodar took Picasso to her grandfather, the forger, who defended his work with pride while Picasso angrily demanded the paintings back. This dialogue is presented by Welles and Kodar re-enacting the parts of the grandfather and Picasso respectively. Welles then confesses that he had promised everything in the \"next hour\" was true, and that hour had already passed. He admits the entire story of Kodar, her grandfather, and Picasso was made up. He apologizes, quotes Picasso's statement that art is a lie that makes us see the truth, and bids the audience good night.\n\n\n\n\n\"F for Fake\" was not released in the USA until 1976. When it finally came out, Welles produced a preview \"trailer\" for it, which was effectively a wholly original 9-minute film, shot and edited in a similar style to the film itself. Apart from some very brief split-second camera shots, the entire film is a self-contained short containing original material starring Welles, Gary Graver and Oja Kodar. The trailer has subsequently been restored in colour, and is included as an extra on some DVD versions of the film.\n\n\"F for Fake\" faced widespread popular rejection. Critical reaction ranged from praise to confusion and hostility, with many finding the work to be self-indulgent and/or incoherent. \"F for Fake\" has grown somewhat in stature over the years. In that the film embraces everything from self-conscious notation of the film process to ironic employment of 1950s-era B movie footage (\"Earth vs. the Flying Saucers\"), Welles thought he was creating not so much a documentary as a \"new kind of film,\" as he once told writer Jonathan Rosenbaum. \"F for Fake\" is now sometimes referred to as a \"film essay.\" It currently holds an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 49 critics.\n\nAccording to some reviews, the \"F for Fake\" mash-up has possibly paved the way for the modern \"attention-deficit\" style of editing. More likely, Welles was influenced by those that came before, such as the French New Wave director Jean Luc Godard and Dadaist filmmakers like René Clair who used editing to alternately build and deconstruct. What is unique to the film is the concept of the unreliable narrator — a key subject of the film itself, which at many points shows Welles sitting at an editing controller, as he narrates and draws self-reflexive attention to the problems with veracity in life and filmmaking. Several filmmakers contributed to the forgery that is \"F for Fake\" including B-movie cinematographer Gary Graver (who contributes all footage filmed in the U.S., as well as some very choppy editing, and his own voice/image as the dubious on-screen \"newscaster\") as well as Welles' girlfriend and muse, Oja Kodar (who at one point appears in a series of butt shots as she is ogled both by Welles' camera and by stock footage of males who \"see\" her). It is in fact a trick of editing and/or creative geography and Welles' first lie in the film, or is it? Who directed these shots? Kodar claims she did. It is unclear where Welles' participation stops and his lesser-known collaborators begins, as the film employs multiple editors, multiple directors, multiple cross cuttings of unrelated footage and the often erratic use of creative geography as well as multiple voice overs. An example of this appears with a series of near wordless shots of Irving and de Hory seemingly in debate as to whether de Hory ever signed his forgeries (the shots of Irving and de Hory were in fact taken at different times).\n\nWelles's autobiographical asides in the film reflect on his 1938 radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\", which caused a nationwide panic with its fake news broadcast. In introducing this chapter of his life, Welles declares his uncertainty as to his own authenticity, as he believes he too has engaged in fraud. While the basic facts of \"The War of the Worlds\" incident are correctly given, the apparent excerpts from the play featured in the movie are complete fabrications, including a scene in which President Roosevelt meets the Martian invaders—something which did not happen in the original (fabricated) broadcast.\n\nAuthor Robert Anton Wilson, a great fan of the film, argued in \"\" that the film was itself largely an intentional effort at fakery by Welles in support of the film's themes. Most directly, Wilson reports that in the BBC documentary \"Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film\", Welles stated that \"everything in that film was a trick.\" Secondly, many of the interviews in the film were with people who were themselves directly involved with forgery in one way or another, often making statements that would have been known by the filmmakers to be false, but which were allowed to pass without comment in the film. Similarly, Welles himself made numerous false statements about Oja Kodar in the film. Finally, Wilson points out several scenes which, while presented in a way that implies they were filmed in real time, were upon further inspection clearly fabricated from unrelated pieces of footage in a way guaranteed to mislead the casual viewer.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jinman Kwak is the current president.\n\nIn his address at the Inaugural Ceremony, Hyun Jin Moon expressed that the Family Peace Association was created to carry on the trans-religious work his late father, Sun Myung Moon, sought to accomplish with the establishment of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU). Hyun Jin Moon held a key leadership role in FFWPU from 1998 to 2008. He stated, \"I can no longer work through the FFWPU because it is not true to my father’s original mission\", and dedicated the Family Peace Association as the \"new vehicle\" to realize his father's intentions of \"creating a global movement to inspire all humanity to establish God-centered families.\"\n\nIt was suggested that the Family Peace Association could play a leadership role in the reunification of the Korean peninsula through a focus on reuniting families divided between North and South.\n\nThe Family Federation for World Peace and Unification was established in 1994 by Sun Myung Moon. Sun Myung Moon stated at the founding of the FFWPU that he never intended to create a new religion, but to open an age after religion where families would serve as the core of spiritual and character growth. Sun Myung Moon has even stated that the HSA-UWC, the predecessor to FFWPU which he established in 1954, was meant to foster ecumenical cooperation among Christian sects to promote families with deep spirituality and a commitment to serving their larger society.\n\nBy 1994, HSA-UWC had evolved into an entity that resembled a church for people who ascribed to shared beliefs and rituals. Therefore, in 1994, HSA-UWC was closed, and the FFWPU was launched as a new entity. The FFWPU was created as a broad-based social movement to promote healthy families and strong societies. According to a memo from the HSA-UWC North America Headquarters in 1997, from the beginning it was clear that the two entities, FFWPU and HSA-UWC, were separate entities, both in objectives and legally. \n\nHyun Jin Moon was appointed vice-president of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification in 1998. His leadership style and proposed reforms to dismantle the church structure and create a family-based peace movement were met with resistance and accusations of being unorthodox, eventually leading to his replacement in 2008 with his younger brother, Hyung Jin Sean Moon.\n\nThe Family Peace Association maintains that it was established to carry on the original mission of the FFWPU to expand certain universal principles and values related to God-centered families to a broader, non-sectarian audience.\n\n"}

His sister, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, is a writer. Marshall had one daughter, Sonya. He married Dr. Alexandra Eliot, who had two sons from a previous marriage, Frederick and Christopher Eliot. Marshall held a B.A. and M.A. in Anthropology from Harvard University. Marshall died of lung cancer in April, 2005.\n\nMarshall first traveled to the Kalahari Desert and met the Ju/'hoansi of the Nyae Nyae area in 1950 on a trip initiated by his father to search for the \"Lost World of the Kalahari.\" Before his second trip to the Kalahari, one year later, Marshall received a 16mm Kodak camera and advice from his father, \"Don't direct, John, don't try to be artistic, just film what you see people doing naturally.\" Marshall employed this advice during the 1950s, his films anticipated the cinema verite movement of the 1960s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s members of the Marshall family - John Marshall, his sister Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, Lorna Marshall, and Laurence Marshall - returned to the Kalahari Desert numerous times to conduct an ethnographic study of the Ju/'hoansi and document one of the last remaining hunter gatherer cultures. From 1950-1958 Marshall filmed the hunting and gathering life of the Ju/'hoansi. His first edited film, \"The Hunters\", was released in 1957. \"The Hunters\" told the story of a Ju/'hoansi giraffe hunt. Marshall later realized he had unintentionally romanticized Ju/'hoan life. \"The Hunters,\" portrayed the Ju/'hoansi as if they continued to live as they always had, where their main conflict was a struggle with nature. But when Marshall filmed them, they were actually suffering from having collided with the modern world and were subsisting primarily on gathered food and struggling to find enough to eat. Recognizing this discrepancy between reality and the portrayal of Ju/'hoansi life in \"The Hunters,\" Marshall was determined to produce more objective, and less mediated films about the Ju/'hoansi. He produced a series of short films designed to educate without exoticizing or \"imposing western narrative structures on the subjects.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s and most of the 1970s, Marshall, and nearly all anthropologists and filmmakers were banned from visiting the Ju/'hoansi by a government that saw them as \"a threat to the status quo.\" So during this period, Marshall produced many short films about the Ju/'hoansi of Nyae Nyae from the footage he had collected in the 1950s and pursued other film projects in the United States. He was the cinematographer for Fred Wiseman's first documentary film, Titicut Follies. Marshall also shot and produced a series of short films about police work in Pittsburgh, PA. In 1968, Marshall and Tim Asch founded Documentary Educational Resources, a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating the use of cross-cultural documentaries in the classroom.\n\nMarshall became involved in grassroots organizing and development in Nyae Nyae in the 1980s, forming a foundation that would become the Nyae Nyae Development Foundation of Namibia and devoting himself to advocating on behalf of the Ju/'hoansi. In 2003, the Society for Visual Anthropology bestowed on Marshall a lifetime achievement award for his 50 years of work among the hunter gatherer society.\n\nTwo million feet of Marshall's 16mm documentary footage along with thousands of hours of video footage as well as edited films and videos of Ju/'hoansi are held at the Human Studies Film Archives, Smithsonian Institution. Known officially as the John Marshall Ju/'hoan Bushman Film and Video Collection, 1950–2000, the collection was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register for documentary heritage of world importance in July 2009. Cynthia Close, former Executive Director of Documentary Educational Resources, called the collection, \"unparalleled in the history of film and in the history of documenting humanity\".\n\nJohn Marshall produced realistic films that combined documentary media and ethnographic film. His work offers an evolving, original and unique view on what was technically possible and stylistic in documentary through his more than fifty years as a filmmaker. Marshall was a pioneer in the cinema verite style. He is quoted as saying, \"I began shooting events from angles and distances that approximated the perspectives of the people I was filming, I tried to film as a member of the group rather than shoot standing outside as an observer.\" He began thinking about his position vis-à-vis the people he was filming, asking, \"Am I someone in the group? Who? Why am I looking at the other person? Am I an outside observer? If I am an observer who am I? Is there anyone else observing from this angle and distance? What are they seeing and thinking?\" Marshall’s shooting style evolved to reflect his position within the society he was filming, that of participant more than outside observer. As similar as this approach sounds to cinema verite, Marshall employed sit down interviews in many of his films such as \"N!ai, the Story of a !Kung Woman\" and cinema verite does not use sit down interviews.\n\nIn his early films, and indeed, most of his films about the Ju/'hoansi, Marshall presents realistic views of the changing life of the once hunter-gatherer culture, but he himself is never a central character in those films. However, in his 2002 6-episode film \"A Kalahari Family,\" the curtain is pulled and John Marshall, as well as his family, who have been involved in both ethnographic and then political efforts with the Ju/'hoansi since the early 1950s, are revealed. This may be the ultimate in reality filmmaking, as the Marshalls have been intimately involved in the Ju/'hoansi culture, making both positive and negative impacts, and finally in \"A Kalahari Family,\" their impact is explored.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hermann studied theology and medicine in Wittenberg and botany in Leipzig.\nAfter graduating from Europe's finest medical school, Padua in 1670, he was then engaged by the Dutch East India Company and went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) as a Ship's Medical Officer. He was in their employ from 1672 to 1677. During his stay there, he made a scientific collection of this island's plants and other organisms. He was then offered the job at Leiden and took up the Chair of Botany at the University of Leiden in 1679 and took up his residence in 1680 at Leiden where he spent the rest of his professional life. He immediately set to making it the finest botanical garden in Europe.\nHermann's \"Paradisus batavus\", a description of the plants of the Leyden university botanical garden, was published three years after his death in 1698 and edited by William Sherard. There was a second edition published in 1705. Sherard edited his notes and solicited patronage for the publication of this important book. They were students together of Tournefort in Paris in 1688. This is where Hermann perfected his botanical draughtsmanship. Later Sherard collected more of his notes and produced a catalog published as \"Musaeum Zeylanicum\" (1717, 2nd edn.: 1727). Hermann's original Ceylon collection was used by Carl Linnaeus when he wrote his \"Flora Zeylanica\" (1747) and \"Species plantarum\" (1753), using the abbreviation \"Hermann herb.\" in those publications. After Hermann's collections had passed through many hands, they were eventually purchased by Sir Joseph Banks. Now they are kept at the Natural History Museum in London. Hermann was a very good botanical illustrator and had an excellent botanical grasp as declared by Linnaeus himself.\n\n\n"}

This work was intended as a companion publication to his \"Stirpium adversaria nova\", and incorporates a revised version of the latter, as \"Nova stirpium adversaria\".\n\nL'Obel's first work was the \"Stirpium aduersaria noua\", published in London in 1571. The \"Plantarum seu stirpium historia\" of 1576 was intended as a companion piece, and was published in conjunction with a re-issue of \"Stirpium aduersaria noua\", as \"Nova stirpium adversaria\" In 1571 l'Obel published his Flemish translation of \"Plantarum\", as \"Kruydtboeck\" (Herb book), and in 1605 he reissued the \"Stirpium\".\n\nThe \"Plantarum\" deals with a number of subjects, including descriptions and illustrations (more than 2,000) of plants known to l'Obel, with plant names given in Latin, German, English, French, Flemish, Italian and Spanish. It also includes a history of botany and the use of plants in treating diseases. It was published by Christophe Plantin, whose workshop handled most of the major botanical works of the period and accumulated a large stock of woodcuts which were recycled between all these publications.

{"id": "55666665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55666665", "title": "Power Politics (Wight book)", "text": "Power Politics (Wight book)\n\nPower politics is a book by International Relations scholar Martin Wight, first published in 1946 as a 68-page essay. After 1959 Wight added twelve further chapters. Other works of Wight's were added by his former students, Hedley Bull and Carsten Holbraad, and a combined volume was published in 1978, six years after Wight's death. The book provides an overview of international politics featuring many elements of \"Realpolitik\" analysis.\n\nWight, a pacifist and devout Christian, was appalled by World War II. He favoured a revival of the biblical term Antichrist to describe recurrent warlike situations in history - Antichrist in this context meaning a \"demonic concentration of power\" rather than a person. In chapter one he observes that the modern state has become \"the ultimate loyalty for which men will fight. The mediaeval world of 'rights and wrongs' has been replaced by a modern one of 'powers, forces, dynasties and ideas\".\n\nWight begins: \"Power politics is a colloquial phrase for international politics.\" He explains that states exploit power to achieve expansion and dominance; \"every dominant power aspires... to become a universal empire.\" For diplomatic reasons, \"dominant powers\" are euphemized as \"Great Powers ... who wish to monopolise (sic) the right to create international conflict\". Great Powers win and lose their status through violence, and are defined by their ability to wage war; they are decreasing in number, but those remaining are increasing in size.\n\nHe argues that War and revolution go together: communism provoked fascist and Nazi responses; and both ideologies were led by \"gangsters\" seeking to rule the world. To suppose that revolutionary ideologies have now been discarded is to show ignorance of human nature, says Wight.\n\nAccording to Wight, though states are few in number, they are widely diverse and atypical in character. States are more or less immortal, and are therefore unindictable in law. International law is weak, unclear, decentralized, unpoliced, and therefore unenforceable; there is no sovereign power above states.\n\nTherefore, he concludes \"domestically, power is constrained by law; but internationally, law is governed and constrained by the struggle for power ... There is no international society, only \"international anarchy\". International politics is really \"power politics\", and the causes of war are inherent therein\". And, furthermore, '\"diplomacy is a 'European invention imposed on the world,'\" which \"consists in information, negotiation, and communication, but also, covertly, in espionage, subversion and propaganda\".\n\nLater chapters examine alliances, the \"balance of power\", arms races, disarmament, and the supra-national authority of the League of Nations and the United Nations. Wight concludes that \"security\" is inseparable from moral behavior and cites Gladstone and Franklin Roosevelt as examples of the latter.\n\nAccording to Charles Manning, Hedley Bull, Sir Michael Howard, and Hans Morgenthau Martin Wight is one of the finest international thinkers of the 20th century. M. Nicholson says: \"Within the 'English school' of International Relations, the work of Martin Wight is placed in particularly high esteem. More perhaps than anyone else, he is the scholar who did IR as it ought to be done.\" Reviewing \"Power Politic\", F.P. King calls it a delightful book \"to browse through, contemplate, refute and enjoy more than once ... Resplendent history, allusions, wit and reasoning.\" Ian Hall has written a detailed resumé of Wight's work: \"The International Thought of Martin Wight\", Palgrave Macmillan, 2006.\n\n"}

{"id": "5582851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5582851", "title": "Sales order", "text": "Sales order\n\nThe sales order, sometimes abbreviated as SO, is an order issued by a business or sole trader to a customer. A sales order may be for products and/or services. Given the wide variety of businesses, this means that the orders can be fulfilled in several ways. Broadly, the fulfillment modes, based on the relationship between the order receipt and production, are as follows:\n\n\nA sales order is an internal document of the company, meaning it is generated by the company itself. A sales order should record the customer's originating purchase order which is an external document. Rather than using the customer's purchase order document, an internal sales order form allows the internal audit control of completeness to be monitored. A sequential sales order number may be used by the company for its sales order documents. The customer's PO is the originating document which triggers the creation of the sales order. A sales order, being an internal document, can therefore contain many customer purchase orders under it. In a manufacturing environment, a sales order can be converted into a work order to show that work is about to begin to manufacture, build or engineer the products the customer wants.\n\nMany sales orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over a corporate Intranet. These sales orders may be communicated across different enterprise business applications. The automated sales and purchase order process enables customers to place orders 24/7, even when offices are closed.\n\n\nThe steps involved in fulfilling the demands made in a sales order make up the order fulfillment process.\n\n"}

Ashley. First published in 1944, it was the culmination of over 11 years of work. The book contains exactly 3854 numbered entries and an estimated 7000 illustrations. The entries include knot instructions, uses, and some histories, categorized by type or function. It remains one of the most important and comprehensive books on knots.\n\nDue to its scope and wide availability \"The Ashley Book of Knots\" has become a significant reference work in the field of knotting. The numbers Ashley assigned to each knot can be used to unambiguously identify them. This helps to identify knots despite local colloquialisms or identification changes. Citations to Ashley numbers are usually in the form: \"The Constrictor Knot (ABOK #1249)\", \"ABOK #1249\" or even simply \"#1249\" if the context of the reference is clear or already established.\n\nSome knots have more than one Ashley number due to having multiple uses or forms. For example, the main entry for #1249 is in the chapter on binding knots but it is also listed as #176 in a chapter on occupational knot usage.\n\n\"The Ashley Book of Knots\" was compiled and first published before the introduction of synthetic fiber ropes, during a time when natural fiber cordage - typically twisted, laid, or braided rope - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern synthetic fiber or kernmantle style ropes.\n\nAshley suffered a debilitating stroke the year after the book was published. He was not able to produce an erratum or oversee a corrected edition. Corrections submitted by the International Guild of Knot Tyers were incorporated in 1991. The original list of revisions submitted to the publisher is believed to have been lost, but many had been collected from a series of articles in \"Knotting Matters\", the Guild's quarterly publication. Additional errors have been identified since the 1991 corrections.\n\nAt least one knot, the Hunter's bend (#1425A), was added in 1979.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38013785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38013785", "title": "The Cleanest Race", "text": "The Cleanest Race\n\nThe Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why it Matters is a 2010 book by Brian Reynolds Myers. Based on a study of the propaganda produced in North Korea for internal consumption, Myers argues that the guiding ideology of North Korea is a race-based nationalism derived from Japanese fascism, rather than any form of Communism. The book is based on author's study of the material in the Information Center on North Korea.\n\nBrian Reynolds Myers was born in the U.S. and was educated on the graduate level in Germany. He is an editor of \"The Atlantic\" magazine and the author of \"A Reader's Manifesto\", as well as of \"Han Sorya and North Korea Literature\" (1994), which was the only book in English about North Korean literature until Tatiana Gabroussenko's literary history \"Soldiers on the Cultural Front\" (2010). Myers has studied North Korea for twenty years and is fluent in Korean. He holds an assistant professorship in international studies at Dongseo University in South Korea.\n\nFor the book, Myers studied North Korean mass culture with reference to domestically published novels, films, and serials available at the Ministry of Unification in Seoul. Myers claims his analysis differs from that of conventional North Korea watchers, because he focuses on internal Korean-language propaganda, rather than on Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) external broadcasts and English-language reports from South Korea.\n\n\"The Cleanest Race\" is divided into two sections: the first covers North Korean history through its propaganda, from Korea under Japanese rule to the 2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea. The second section analyzes themes in the propaganda, including chapters such as \"Mother Korea\", Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, perceptions of foreigners, and South Korea.\n\nTechniques of propaganda analysis by Myers include translation of poems, discussion of metaphors and monumental architecture, and description of racist tropes. The book also contains sixteen separate pages of color illustrations, including reprints of posters that ethnically caricature Japanese and Americans and which portray the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as paternal figures.\n\n\"The Cleanest Race\" argues that the overarching ideology of the North Korean government's is founded on far-right politics rather than far-left politics. It notes that the North Korean government is xenophobic and militaristic. It cites a report of a mob attack on Black Cuban diplomats and the forcing of female North Koreans to abort mixed-ethnicity children. It says that the 2009 North Korean constitution omits all mention of Communism. The author argues that \"Juche\" is not the leading ideology of North Korea. Rather, he surmises, it was designed in order to trick foreigners.\n\nMyers says North Korea's government does not base its ideology on Marxism–Leninism or Neo-Confucianism. He instead links it to Japanese fascism. He states that the government's racist criteria for national identity paints its genetically Korean citizens as innocent and morally virtuous (as opposed to foreigners) but militarily weak, requiring Kim Il Sung's charismatic guidance and protection. The author supposes that this may be a strategy by the government to decrease the amount of repression and surveillance needed to control that public.\n\nAccording to Myers, North Korean government propaganda portrays South Korea as a land polluted by foreign domination, particularly by the permanent presence of U.S. soldiers. Anti-Americanism is the cornerstone of North Korean foreign policy.\n\nSimilarly, internal propaganda within North Korea portrays U.S. humanitarian efforts such as food aid as signs of U.S. cowardice and make no distinction \"between 'good' American workers and 'bad' American capitalists\" as the Soviet Union's regime in the Cold War did. He laments that North Koreans openly flout the \"dictates of an impure world\" as inapplicable to the pure Korean race.\n\nUpon its release, \"The Cleanest Race\" received significant media attention and \"rave reviews\" in the United States press. The journalist Christopher Hitchens (who had visited North Korea at the beginning of the 21st century) recounted that after reading the book, he concluded that his earlier view of the country as Stalinist was simplistic and incorrect. Some reviewers confirmed anecdotal instances of North Korean xenophobia and alarm at the rate of interracial marriage in South Korea. Hitchens also notes some \"obscene corollaries\" from Myers' conclusions, including that many South Koreans feel the North Korean regime to be more \"'authentically' Korean\" than their own government.\n\n\"The New York Times\" characterized the book as \"often counterintuitive\" and its arguments as \"wily and complex\". Bradley K. Martin of \"The New Republic\", however, warned that the book could \"[play down] the Stalinist, Maoist, and traditional East Asian contributions\" to North Korean ideology. Martin argues that North Korean ideology can be understood in the terms of Japanese pre-fascist psychology, including \"amae\" (dependence on parents) and \"banzai\" (wishing long life for the ruler).\n\nCharles K. Armstrong in \"The Journal of Asian Studies\" states that the conclusions of the book are \"not news\". He explains that historian Bruce Cumings, whom Myers excoriates, addresses the influence of \"Japanese colonial militarism\" on North Korea. Armstrong faults Myers for exaggerating the Japanese angle and suggests that North Korea is \"actually \"closer\" to European fascism\" than to Imperial Japanese fascism, because Imperial Japan lacked a charismatic leader and a mass-mobilizing party.\n\nAlzo David-West in \"Journal of Contemporary Asia\" claims Myers writes \"in the tradition of 'axis of evil' cultural criticism\", obscures the differences between Nazism and Stalinism, and overlooks the historical influence of Maoism in North Korea. He also says Myers does not cite the relevant North Korean studies scholarship of Han S. Park, most notably \"North Korea: The Politics of Unconventional Wisdom\" (2002); makes scarce treatment of the \"Songun\" military-first ideology; and claims \"Juche\" ideology is universalist-humanist rather than ethnic nationalist.\n\nGerd Jendraschek in \"Studies on Asia\" says that Myers \"downplays synchronic and diachronic variation\"; he \"does not explain\"; he \"ignores counter-evidence ... while exaggerating\"; he \"contradicts himself\"; and he is \"anecdotal ... biased and speculative\".\n\nSuzy Kim in \"Critical Asian Studies\" explains that Myers reads North Korea through an “infantilizing Orientalist gaze”; he \"lack[s] ... understanding of ... Confucian relations\", \"denies Confucian influence\" and \"chooses to ignore North Korean kinship metaphors\"; he has \"his own preconceptions\"; he \"conflat[es] North Korean solipsism and nationalism with racism\" and \"whitewash[es] American racism and Orientalism\"; he \"never interrogates ... representations and lived realities\"; he \"never contextualizes the different kinds of sources he is using\" but \"lumps together\" a \"Text\" that \"becomes a straw man ... to serve his own arguments\"; and he \"takes at face value\" the \"simple dichotomy between 'Koreans' and 'foreigners'.'\"\n\nCraig MacKie in \"The Political Economy of Affect in East Asia\" says, \"Myers' formulation of the 'child race' is deeply problematic as a result of the instrumental way he uses it in his text\" even though the \"work does correctly register ... filial and familial themes and the fixation on the dead father that characterizes propaganda in North Korea.\"\n\nAndrei Lankov in \"Far Eastern Economic Review\" states Myers takes a \"fresh approach\" to North Korea.\n\nFelix Abt, a business affairs specialist who lived in North Korea for seven years, observes that Myers's book is \"flawed\"; makes \"shaky,\" \"absurd,\" and \"questionable\" claims; and takes North Korean \"propaganda more seriously than North Koreans do themselves.\"\n\n"}

The camp provides residential and educational programs for children and adults. These programs include space oriented camp programs, aircraft themed Aviation Challenge camps, and robotics themed programs, which are designed to promote science, engineering, aviation and technology. More than 750,000 campers have graduated since 1982.\n\nSpace Camp was founded in 1982 as an educational camp program for children using the United States space program as the basis to promote math and science to children. The idea for the camp came about as a result of a discussion between Wernher von Braun and Edward O. Buckbee. Von Braun was touring the U.S. Space & Rocket Center with Buckbee in 1977 when he noticed children studying rockets and making notes. According to Buckbee, von Braun commented, \"You know, we have all these camps for youngsters in this country - band camps and cheerleader camps and football camps. Why don't we have a science camp?\"\n\nSummer 2017 was the 35th anniversary of Space Camp and the related programs. The U.S. Space & Rocket Center added to the museum the Space Camp Hall of Fame, in which the first inductee was Wernher von Braun.\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center and Space Camp (formerly U.S. Space Camp) in Huntsville are operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission, which is a state agency whose members are appointed by the Governor of Alabama.\n\nThe non-profit U.S. Space & Rocket Center Foundation is a separate entity and members of its board are not appointed by the governor. It is responsible for scholarship fund-raising and the licensing of camps outside the United States. There are a number of internationally licensed Space Camps, including Space Camp Turkey, Space Camp Canada (known as \"Camp Spatial\" in French), and Space Camp Belgium.\n\nSpace Camp Florida opened in 1988 and shared facilities with the Astronaut Hall of Fame in Titusville, Florida, both of which were operated by the now defunct U.S. Space Camp Foundation. The Space Camp facility closed in 2002, due to low attendance leading to financial difficulties. About 50,000 children attended the camp during its run, but in its final year as few as 14 participants filled 276 slots. The Astronaut Hall of Fame was sold to Delaware North and currently remains open as added attraction to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex with several simulators previously used by the camp now available to all visitors.\n\nSpace Camp California, operated by the now defunct U.S. Space Camp Foundation was located at Mountain View, California and opened in 1996. Space Camp California closed its doors January 6, 2002, also due to financial difficulties.\n\nThe Space Camp Hall of Fame began in 2007 during the 25th-anniversary celebrations. According to the website, the hall was \"designed to honor graduates, former employees and supporters who have distinguished themselves in their respective careers or made considerable in-kind contributions in an effort to help further the goals of the Space Camp program.\"\n\nProgram names are used to define the age or focus group for which the specific program targets, with \"Space Camp\" referring to both a camp program and the parent organization. The camp offers programs for various ages and durations of visit. The majority of attendees visit during the summer, though spring and fall often see many school group visits, parent and child bonding camps, and adult or corporate programs.\n\nSpace Camp is a six day program offered for children between 9 and 11 years old. The curriculum is designed to balance education and entertainment. Children enrolling in Space Camp can choose from one of three \"tracks\" of activities and study: space, aviation and robotics. Space Camp was the first of the camp programs offered, and is used as the umbrella organization name.\n\nSpace Academy is a program intended for ages 12–14, offered in six-day sessions.\n\nAdvanced Space Academy is designed for 15- to 18-year-olds. The program was originally known as Space Academy Level II and was started in Fall of 1987. In 1987 the Space Academy Level II program was college accredited (1 hour) through the University of Alabama Huntsville. It also offered programs for adults as the first class to go through Level II were adults. The Family Camp program allows parents or guardians to attend Space Camp with their child aged 7–12 years. The program is run throughout the year, lasts three to four days, and includes activities in which the adult and child work together. Family Camp also has an Aviation Challenge option, designed for children and their accompanying adult, offered during the summer months.\n\nSpace Camp offers scholarships for kids with disabilities, academic greatness, excellence in leadership, and financial needs or disadvantaged.\n\nIn cooperation with teachers of visually impaired students, Space Camp operates a week-long \"Space Camp for Interested Visually Impaired Students\" by providing the same experience to visually impaired students as sighted students. Adaptations are made to the computer systems campers use in activities and simulations to provide speech and large print output. Adapted materials, including handbooks translated in Braille, and equipment are used during the camp.\n\nIn cooperation with teachers, Space Camp operates a week-long program for Deaf and hard of hearing students by providing the same experience to hearing-impaired students as hearing students. Communication is supported by a dedicated team of American Sign Language interpreters as well as through visual and written media. To allow equal access to the audio of films, most museum & camp movies have open or closed captions; the theater provides a rear-window captioning system. To augment or replace microphone/headset technology, students use live stream video between mission control and the shuttle simulator.\n\nIn addition to participating in typical camp activities and simulations, students often have the opportunity to meet and interact with deaf adults who work in science-related fields and learn about the many contributions deaf individuals such as Annie Jump Cannon (astronomer), Tsiolkovsky (considered of a \"father of Rocketry\"), and Dr. Thomas Wheeler (deaf NASA aerospace engineer) have made to astronomy, space exploration and science education.\n\nOther programs include corporate programs, programs for adults and educators and educational field-trip programs for school groups, and the X-Camp outdoor leadership camp. There were also special alumni sessions during the summer of the 25th anniversary.\n\nOccasionally themed camps have been offered, usually in conjunction with museum exhibits. During the summer of 2010 a Jedi Experience camp was offered in connection with the museum traveling exhibit .\n\nU.S. Cyber Camp announced in 2017, focuses on Cyber Security.\n\nAviation Challenge, or AC, is an umbrella branding for a set of aviation oriented camps at Space Camp, consisting of three main programs for children from ages 9–18. As an aviation oriented camp the fundamental teaching aids are computer based flight simulators, which are intended to train attendees to fly, act, and think like United States Air Force, Navy or Marine fighter pilots.\n\nThere are simulators at Space Camp, such as:\n\n\nSpace Camp additionally uses rides or attractions that are on site at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center as instructional tools. While these are not true simulators, the use of these rides is designed to allow the rider to better understand some aspect of space travel. The Space Shot simulates liftoff, and the G-Force Accelerator simulates the G-forces put on astronauts while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere or during launch.\n\nThe Spacedome IMAX Theater provides a venue for presenting some of the space and science oriented films produced through the IMAX camera/projection system. The theater is part of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center museum complex. As Space Camp is operated by the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, it makes regular use of the theater.\n\nIf a Space Camp program takes more than one day, \"campers\" stay at the space camp's Habitat 1 or Habitat 2. Habitat 1 is a large building designed to house young people. It is manned by staff and has full CCTV. Male and female campers are usually assigned to separate floors.\n\nAviation Challenge trainees stay in Habitat 3 where they are required to maintain military standards to their bays and racks. There are two floors to Hab 3. Males live on half of the ground floor and all of the second floor. Female trainees stay on the other half of the first floor. The bays are named after famous aircraft carriers. The camp has a cafeteria where campers receive meals.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
