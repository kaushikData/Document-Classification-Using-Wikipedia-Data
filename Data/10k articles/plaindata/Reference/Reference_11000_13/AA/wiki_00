First published in 1967 and edited by C. Sumner Spalding, a second edition (AACR2) edited by Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler was issued in 1978, with subsequent revisions (AACR2R) appearing in 1988 and 1998; all updates ceased in 2005.\n\nPublished jointly by the American Library Association, the Canadian Library Association, and the UK Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, the rules were designed for the construction of library catalogs and similar bibliographic tools. The rules cover the physical description of library resources, as well as the provision of name and title access points.\n\nAACR2 was issued in several print versions, including a concise edition, as well as an online version. Various translations were also available. Principles of AACR included cataloguing based on the item 'in hand' rather than inferring information from external sources and the concept of the 'chief source of information' which is preferred where conflicts exist.\n\nDespite the claim to be 'Anglo-American', the first edition of AACR was published in 1967 in somewhat distinct North American and British texts. The second edition of 1978 unified the two sets of rules (adopting the British spelling 'cataloguing') and brought them in line with the International Standard Bibliographic Description. Libraries wishing to migrate from the previous North American text were obliged to implement 'desuperimposition', a substantial change in the form of headings for corporate bodies.\n\nWhile the 2002 updates included substantial improvements to AACR's treatment of non-book materials, the proliferation of 21st century formats in a networked environment and the rise of electronic publishing signaled the necessity for significant change in the cataloging code. Plans for a third edition (AACR3) were abandoned in 2005. \n\nThe international cataloging community turned its attention to drafting a completely new standard to succeed AACR. Informed by the work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, the new framework was crafted to be more flexible and suitable for use in a digital environment: Resource Description and Access (RDA) was released in June 2010. The Library of Congress, National Library of Medicine, National Agricultural Library, and several national libraries of other English-speaking countries performed a formal test of RDA, resulting in a June 2011 report of findings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1775833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1775833", "title": "Anti-Mormonism", "text": "Anti-Mormonism\n\nAnti-Mormonism is discrimination, persecution, hostility or prejudice directed against the Latter Day Saint movement, particularly The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The term is often used to describe persons or literature that are critical of their adherents, institutions, or beliefs, or physical attacks against specific Mormons or the LDS Church as a whole.\n\nOpposition to Mormonism began before the first Latter Day Saint church was established in 1830 and continues to the present day. The most vocal and strident opposition occurred during the 19th century, particularly during the Utah War of the 1850s, and in the second half of the century when the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory was widely considered by the U.S. Republican Party as one of the \"twin relics of barbarism\" along with slavery.\n\nModern-day opposition generally takes the form of websites offering alternative views about Mormonism or non-violent protest at large Latter-day Saint gatherings such as the church's biannual General Conference, outside of Latter-day Saint pageants, or at events surrounding the construction of new LDS temples. Opponents generally believe that the church's claims to divine origin are false, that it is non-Christian, or that it is a religion based on fraud or deceit on the part of its past and present leaders.\n\nThe term, \"anti-Mormon\" first appears in the historical record in 1833 by the Louisville (Kentucky) \"Daily Herald\" in an article, \"The Mormons and the Anti-Mormons\" (the article was also the first known to label believers in the Book of Mormon as \"Mormons\"). In 1841, it was revealed that an \"Anti-Mormon Almanac\" would be published. On August 16 of that year, the Latter Day Saint \"Times and Seasons\" reported the Mormons' confidence that although the \"Anti-Mormon Almanac\" was designed by \"Satan and his emissaries\" to flood the world with \"lies and evil reports\", still \"we are assured that in the providence of God they will ultimately tend to the glory of God—the spread of truth and the good of the church\".\n\nThe anti-Mormon newspaper certainly was not the first of its kind; Mormonism had been criticized strongly by dozens of publications since its inception, most notably by Eber D. Howe's 1834 book \"Mormonism Unvailed\". The Latter Day Saints initially labeled such publications \"anti-Christian\", but the publication of the Almanac and the subsequent formation of an \"Anti-Mormon Party\" in Illinois heralded a shift in terminology. \"Anti-Mormon\" became, on the lips of the church's critics, a proud and politically charged self-designation.\n\nToday, the term is primarily used as a descriptor for persons and publications that oppose the LDS Church, although its precise scope has been the subject of some debate. It is used by some to describe anything perceived as critical of the LDS Church.\n\nSiding with the latter, less-inclusive understanding of the term, Latter-day Saint scholar William O. Nelson suggests in the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\" that the term includes \"any hostile or polemic opposition to Mormonism or to the Latter-day Saints, such as maligning Joseph Smith, his successors, or the doctrines or practices of the Church. Though sometimes well intended, anti-Mormon publications have often taken the form of invective, falsehood, demeaning caricature, prejudice, and legal harassment, leading to both verbal and physical assault.\"\n\nMany of those who have been labeled \"anti-Mormon\" object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that disagreement or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent \"anti-Mormon\" prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate. Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between \"personal animosity and intellectual dialogue\". Johnson insists that he is motivated by \"love and compassion for Mormons\", and that while he \"[might] plead guilty to being against Mormon\"ism\"\", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-\"Mormon\" \"both offensive and inaccurate.\" Stephen Cannon elaborates,\n\nIt is also helpful to know that Mormons are a group of people united around a belief system. Therefore, to be \"anti-Mormon\" is to be against people. Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a belief system and not a people. The LDS people are no better or no worse than any other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the \"ism\", not the \"Mormon\".\n\nJames White, meanwhile, rejects the term because of a lack of reciprocal terminology. He wrote to one LDS apologist, \"If you will identify yourself as an anti-Baptist, I'll let you call me an anti-Mormon.\"\n\nEven some members of the church who write negatively about it, especially those who call into question its divine nature, have had their writings labeled anti-Mormon. Ex-Mormons who write about the church are likewise frequently labeled anti-Mormon, even when their writings are not inflammatory in nature. The debate on who is \"anti-Mormon\" frequently arises in Mormon discussions of authors and sources.\n\nStephen Cannon has argued that use of the label is a \"campaign by Latter-day Saints to disavow the facts presented by simply labeling the source as 'anti-Mormon'\". Critics of the term also claim that the LDS Church frames the context of persecution in order to cultivate a persecution complex, or that Mormon authors promote the ideal of a promised heavenly reward for enduring persecution for one's beliefs.\n\nMormons often respond to these accusations by questioning whether critics like Johnson and Cannon really have Mormons' best interests at heart. For Brigham Young University's 100 Hour Board, the \"anti-Mormon\" label serves the purpose of warning Latter-day Saints away from individuals who espouse \"hatred and bigotry\". It is better, says the Board, for a confused Saint to \"talk to someone... that (1) has your best interests at heart, and (2) actually understands what the Church teaches.\"\n\nThose individuals and groups who challenge Mormonism, particularly those who approach the challenge from an evangelical Christian perspective, would generally sustain that they do, in fact, have the best interest of the Mormon at heart; and for the most part can legitimately claim to understand what the church teaches, since many challengers of Mormonism come from an LDS background. In addition, they often declare that highly charged words such as \"hatred\" and \"bigotry\" are employed to an excessive degree to describe any challenge to a truth claim, and often cite this reactionary response as part of a Mormon \"persecution complex.\"\n\nMormonism, or the Latter Day Saint movement, arose in western New York, the area where its founder, Joseph Smith, was raised, during a period of religious revival in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have several visions involving God, Jesus and angelic Native American prophets. These claims were often not received well by those in the community, as evident in the following excerpt from Smith's account of LDS Church history:\n\n... one of the Methodist preachers ... treated my communication ... with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them. I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects—all united to persecute me.\n\nWhile the claims of a divine call often received a cold shoulder, the eventual publication of the Book of Mormon, and the official organization of the Church of Christ in 1830 were met with increased opposition on various fronts.\nIn New York and Pennsylvania, anti-Mormonism dealt mainly with issues including whether or not Smith actually had the gold plates; whether those plates belonged to the people rather than Smith; whether or not Smith ever really had had visions (at least ones of theological import); Smith's treasure-digging episodes; and alleged occult practices by Smith.\n\nIn Ohio, anti-Mormons focused on the ill-fated banking efforts of the Kirtland Safety Society and other failed economic experiments including the United Order.\n\nIn Missouri, once the gathering place of the Latter Day Saints, Mormons tended to vote as a bloc, wielding \"considerable political and economic influence,\" often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the sometimes hard-drinking, hard-living frontier communities. These differences culminated in hostilities and the eventual issuing of an executive order (since called the Extermination Order) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs declaring \"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\" Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The Extermination Order was not formally rescinded until 1976.\n\nIn Nauvoo, Illinois, persecutions were often based on the tendency of Mormons to \"dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they resided.\" The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the Nauvoo Legion (the Mormon militia) had grown to a quarter of the size of the U.S. Army. Other issues of contention included polygamy, freedom of speech, anti-slavery views during Smith's presidential campaign, and the deification of man. After the destruction of the press of the \"Nauvoo Expositor\" and institution of martial law, Joseph Smith was arrested on charges of treason against the state of Illinois and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The persecution in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846.\n\nIn 1847 Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Beginning in 1849, every Federally appointed official left Utah under duress. In 1857 President Buchanan concluded that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the United States army to Utah in 1857 in what is known as the Utah War.\n\nMuch of this anti-Mormon sentiment was expressed in publications during the early part of LDS Church history. In his 2005 biography of Joseph Smith, Richard Lyman Bushman cites four 1838 pamphlets as anti-Mormon: \"Mormonism Exposed\" by Sunderland, \"Mormonism Exposed\" by Bacheler, \"Antidote to Mormonism\" by M'Chesney, and \"Exposure of Mormonism\" by Livesey.\n\nThe first was the work of Origen Bacheler, who had no direct contact with the body of Mormons, and contained the contents of a debate between the author and Parley Pratt, with Pratt's side omitted. Bushman describes the author's rhetoric as indistinguishable from that uttered by \"scores of other polemicists of his time,\" providing a glimpse into the kind of material considered anti-Mormon. The pamphlet described Joseph Smith as a \"blockhead,\" a \"juggling, money-digging, fortune-telling impostor\" and, along with the \"Book of Mormon\" witnesses, as \"perhaps the most infamous liars and impostors that ever breathed. ... By their deception and lies, they swindle them out of their property, disturb social order and the public peace, excite a spirit of ferocity and murder, and lead multitudes astray on the subject in which, of all others, they have the deepest interest.\" He voiced outrage at \"the miscreants who are battening on the ignorance and credulity of those upon whom they can successfully play off this imposture.\" He described the Book of Mormon as, \"the most gross, the most ridiculous, the most imbecile, the most contemptible concern, that was ever attempted to be palmed off upon society as a revelation.\" He believed the religion \"can be viewed in no other light than that of monstrous public nuisances, that ought forthwith to be abated\" and that the Mormons were \"the most vile, the most impudent, the most impious, knot of charlatans and cheat with which any community was ever disgraced and cursed.\" \"Antidote to Mormonism\" describes Mormons as \"miserable enemies of both God and man—engines of death and hell.\" He described combat with them as being \"desperate, the battle is one of extermination.\" Bushman describes the characteristics of these anti-Mormon materials as sensationalizing actuality:\n\nArthur Conan Doyle's \"A Study in Scarlet\" (1887), the novel in which the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance, includes a very negative depiction of the early Mormon community in Utah after its migration westwards and the foundation of Salt Lake City. Mormons are presented as violent, rigidly intolerant and corrupt, systematically terrorizing members of the church and forcing polygamous marriage on Mormon girls against their will (comparing Mormon practices to the well-known theme of European girls being forcibly taken to Muslim harems).\n\nLater in his career, Conan Doyle apologized to the Mormons for his lurid account of them as being steeped in kidnapping, murder and enslavement. During a 1923 tour of the United States, Doyle was invited to speak at the LDS Church's Salt Lake Tabernacle; while some individual Mormons expressed their bitterness, in general the atmosphere was warm and friendly far beyond the famous author's best expectations, and in later writings he presented Mormons in a very positive light.\n\nThe most vehement opposition to the LDS Church comes from individuals or groups associated with the Christian countercult movement, which is mostly an evangelical Christian phenomenon. Daniel C. Peterson and Massimo Introvigne have identified two major streams of modern anti-Mormon thought. The first is \"traditional anti-Mormonism\", typified by Rev. Wesley Walters, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, and (to a certain extent) self-proclaimed \"Bible Answer Man\" and \"cult expert\" Walter Martin. Anti-Mormons in this category, \"anxious to be taken seriously by at least a portion of the scholarly community,\" generally try to explain Mormonism in naturalistic terms. They appeal to \"Joseph Smith's environment and his (wicked or pathological) character, perhaps assisted by a co-conspirator or two\", as a sufficient explanation for Mormon origins. Of the second category Introvigne tells us,\n\nNew Age anti-Mormonism\", according to Peterson, \"is quite different. It admits the presence of supernatural events in the founding events of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is quite willing to acknowledge continuous supernatural influence in the life of the Church today.\" However, \"unlike faithful Latter-day Saints, New Age anti-Mormons see the supernatural agents involved in the founding and progress of the Church as demonic, occultic, diabolical, luciferian.\"\n\nThis \"New Age anti-Mormon\" grouping includes Ed Decker, Loftes Tryk, James R. Spencer and many others. According to Introvigne, New Age anti-Mormonism emerged in the 1980s largely as a result of the rise of Third-wave Pentecostalism and its emphasis on spiritual warfare.\n\nTraditional anti-Mormons, according to Peterson, are those who \"are content to argue that Mormonism is untrue\" and \"incompatible with the Bible.\" While some may believe that Satan was indirectly involved in the founding of the LDS Church, they place little emphasis on his role. For them, naturalistic and historical explanations are always preferable to supernatural ones.\n\nAmong the most prominent of the traditional anti-Mormons are Jerald and Sandra Tanner. Both former members of the LDS Church, the Tanners converted to evangelical Protestantism and in 1964 founded the Modern Microfilm Company to \"document problems with the claims of Mormonism and to compare LDS doctrines with Christianity.\" In 1983 they turned their company into a non-profit organization and renamed it the Utah Lighthouse Ministry. The Tanners' work has included \"publishing [reprints of] many hard-to-find Mormon historical documents\" and \"[debating] virtually every significant topic in Mormonism\". During their prolific career they have published more than two hundred items on a variety of social, doctrinal, and historical issues. Despite the high caliber of some of their work, the Tanners have been criticized on a number of points: notably for the vitriolic tone of some of their more polemical pieces, their resistance to change, and their unauthorized publication of several copyrighted documents. In recent years, the apologists' wrath toward the Tanners has somewhat subsided. In their study of anti-Mormon \"word games\", for example, Daniel C. Peterson and Stephen D. Ricks have nothing negative to say about them. Instead, they enlist them as allies against New Age anti-Mormons like Ed Decker, whose fabrications the Tanners have denounced on more than one occasion.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial of the traditional anti-Mormons, however, was Walter Martin. Martin saw Mormons as deceivers who \"pose as Christians\". He called them \"anti-Christian\" and \"a cult infiltration\" and said they secretly harbor a \"deep contempt for Christians\". He further accused them of being egomaniacs and \"cultists\". Martin left as his legacy the Christian Research Institute.\n\nNew Age anti-Mormons have generated considerably more controversy than the previous category. The most prominent of their number, Ed Decker, is the producer of \"The God Makers\" and \"The God Makers II\", as well as being the author of the books by the same name. \"The God Makers\" has attracted criticism not only from Latter-day Saints, but from traditional anti-Mormons as well. The film is generally considered acerbic and misleading, and has even provoked bomb threats against LDS meetinghouses and death threats against members. In other publications Decker has asserted that the source of Mormonism is Satan and that the spires on the LDS temple \"represent an upside down nail, pointing defiantly toward heaven—as if to impale the Lord Jesus anew when he comes in the clouds of glory!\" Furthermore, Decker sees Mormonism as a Satanic political conspiracy with roots in Hinduism and Baal worship.\n\nWhen Decker was denounced by Jerald and Sandra Tanner, he went so far as to accuse them of being in the pay of the LDS Church and even of being \"demonized\" themselves. Decker and his associates offered to exorcise the Tanners' demons, and expressed great sadness when they refused.\n\nThe Christian writer William Schnoebelen asserted that \"the marks on the Mormon Temple garments 'are held together by a subtle occult web of sexual energy which is activated by pressure from the two highest grips in the LDS Temple endowment.'\" Tom Kellie similarly insisted that \"the wives of Mormon apostles were compelled to submit to a special sexual type of operation.\" Other New Age anti-Mormons have called Mormons \"pagans\" and Mormonism \"a fountain of slime\".\n\nProtesters have been visible as \"street preachers\" at LDS General Conferences, outside of LDS pageants, and temples. At the recently constructed Sacramento temple, for example, protesters dispersed pamphlets to visitors who came to take a guided tour. They also held up signs directing people to websites critical of the LDS Church. Notably, protesters also made an appearance at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. One group that actively organizes peaceful protests, a non-profit organization called Mormonism Research Ministry, insists that its activities are not \"anti-Mormon\".\n\nOur goal at MRM is not to be antagonistic. In fact, whenever a representative of MRM speaks publicly on this subject, we often emphasize how Christians should reflect a Christ-like attitude when sharing their faith. We must be firm in our convictions but compassionate and patient as well. ... It is true that, just as some Mormons want nothing more than to ridicule and insult those with whom they disagree, some Christians have done the same. This is wrong and always will be wrong.\n\nSome other individuals have been seen throwing copies of the Book of Mormon on the ground, stepping on them, and portray using temple garments, which LDS hold sacred, as toilet tissue, and other similarly offensive actions. However, nearly every evangelical ministry, including those that actively challenge truth claims of Mormonism, vehemently condemns this sort of offensive and belligerent behavior, and further object to being placed in the same category as those few who engage in such behavior.\n\nAs a result of organized protests at Mormon events, a number of Latter-day Saints, and even non-Mormons, have begun to counter-demonstrate at events (by singing hymns, for example).\n\nIn March 2014, a court case was brought against LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson in the United Kingdom. Monson was accused by disaffected member Tom Phillips of breaching the Fraud Act 2006. The summons alleged that two men were induced to pay tithes to the LDS Church by church teachings which are objectively untrue. The alleged untrue teachings were:\n\n\nThe court case was tossed out before trial. The judges dismissed the case with stark language.\n\nTangible acts of violence against Latter-day Saints are considerably less common in the United States today than they were in the 19th century. The first significant violent persecution occurred in the early 1830s in Missouri. Mormons tended to vote as a bloc there, wielding \"considerable political and economic influence,\" often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities. These differences culminated in the Missouri Mormon War and the eventual issuing of an executive order (since called the extermination order within the LDS community) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs, which declared that \"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\" Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The extermination order was not formally rescinded until 1976.\n\nAfter the destruction of the press of the \"Nauvoo Expositor\" in Nauvoo, Illinois, Joseph Smith was arrested and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The persecution in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846.\n\nEven after Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in Utah Territory convinced U.S. President James Buchanan that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States; critics pointed to plural marriage as a sign of the rebellion. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the American standing army in 1857 to Utah in what is known as the Utah War.\n\nMore recent persecution against Mormons in the U.S. has occasionally taken the shape of acts of vandalism against church property (see Protests against Proposition 8 supporters). At an LDS Church building in Orangevale, Sacramento County, vandals spray painted \"No on 8\" and \"No on Prop 8\" on the front sign and sidewalk. An affiliate group of the radical Trans/Queer organization Bash Back!, claims credit for pouring glue into the locks of an LDS Church building and spray painting on its walls. An internet posting signed by Bash Back!'s Olympia chapter said: \"The Mormon church ... needs to be confronted, attacked, subverted and destroyed.\" According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", the acts of vandalism against the LDS Church appear to be in retaliation for support of Proposition 8. Police reported that nine church buildings were also damaged in Utah that month. The Anti-Defamation League released a statement condemning the \"defacement and destruction of property.\"\n\nIn November 2008, the United States Postal Service delivered envelopes containing white powder to two LDS Church temples—the Los Angeles California Temple and the Salt Lake Temple—and to the Knights of Columbus' national headquarters in New Haven, Connecticut, prompting a hazardous materials response and a federal domestic terrorism investigation. The LDS Church blamed opponents of the marriage ban for sending the hoax mailings, while a group that also supported the measure condemned \"acts of domestic terrorism against our supporters.\" LGBT rights groups, such as Equality Utah and Equality California, have spoken out against the use of violence in protests, and note that the source of the \"white powder\" mailings has not been determined.\n\nIn Latin America, however, hatred of Mormons has often taken on a much deadlier form. In May 1989, members of a terrorist organization called the Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation murdered two Mormon missionaries in La Paz, Bolivia. Another Bolivian terrorist group, the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, claimed responsibility for two attacks against Mormon chapels. The Latauro Youth Movement in Chile conducted 27 small-scale bombings against LDS meetinghouses in 1992. The MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base lists 149 individual attacks that have been carried out against Mormon targets in Latin America since 1983. It also lists a 2001 chapel-bombing in Croatia.\n\nAlthough a position on anti-Mormonism is not part of the official doctrine of the LDS Church, it has been mentioned specifically in a number of general conference talks made by church general authorities.\n\nMarvin J. Ashton, speaking as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, began a fall 1982 conference by relating an experience he had with a protester outside Temple Square. He went on to declare \"[t]o the world, and especially to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" that \"there is no time for contention.\" He then quoted Robert Frost in his prescribed response to anti-Mormonism:\nThe poet Robert Frost once defined education as \"the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence.\" Probably we will never be free of those who are openly anti-Mormon. Therefore, we encourage all our members to refuse to become anti-anti-Mormon. In the wise words of old, can we \"live and let live\"?\n\nCarlos E. Asay of the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy spoke in the fall 1981 conference concerning opposition to the LDS Church. He describes \"Lucifer\" as the source of at least some anti-Mormon and apostate groups, relates an experience of a Mormon convert being excommunicated and encourages the avoidance of \"those who would tear down your faith\":\nSince the spring of 1820, Lucifer has led a relentless attack against the Latter-day Saints and their leaders. A parade of anti-Christs, anti-Mormons, and apostate groups have appeared on the scene. Many are still among us and have released new floods of lies and false accusations. These faith-killers and testimony-thieves use personal contacts, the printed word, electronic media, and other means of communication to sow doubts and to disturb the peace of true believers.\n\nTwo months ago we received a tender letter from a bishop. He informed us that he had been involved in an excommunication of a recent convert. The new convert had fallen under the influence of a very dedicated apostate who was successful in destroying the convert's testimony. It seems that, to discredit Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, the apostate cited changes made in Church publications over the years.\n\nThe approach used by the apostate is common among those who are more interested in shadows than in light. Their logic, if followed, would have them burning the New Testament because Luke's account of the gospel is not exactly like Matthew's or because the book of Acts reports two differing versions of Paul's vision on the road to Damascus. (See Acts 9:1–9 and Acts 22:4–11.) Belief in modern prophets and continuous revelation is absent in the lives of many apostates. They would pin their hopes for salvation upon things other than those related to living prophets and living faith.\n\n... Avoid those who would tear down your faith. Faith-killers are to be shunned. The seeds which they plant in the minds and hearts of men grow like cancer and eat away the Spirit.\n\nGordon B. Hinckley, the president of the LDS Church, related a story in the fall 1997 conference in which he read from the letter of an ex-Mormon who left the church at the urging of his fiancée, whom the letter-writer indicates is anti-Mormon. Hinckley describes the situation in the letter as a \"terrible tragedy\" and states that he \"believe[s] the writer still has a testimony of this work. That testimony has been with him since the time he was baptized, but he has felt neglected and of no consequence to anyone.\"\n\nA passage from an early Mormon epistle addresses a claimed tendency of ex-Mormons to criticize the church of which they are no longer a part: \n[A]postates after turning from the faith of Christ ... have sooner or later fallen into the snares of the wicked one, and have been left destitute of the Spirit of God, to manifest their wickedness in the eyes of multitudes. From apostates the faithful have received the severest persecutions ... \"When once that light which was in them is taken from them, they become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against the truth,\" and they, Judas like, seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors.\n\nIn 1985, Vaughn J Featherstone, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy of the LDS Church, addressed students at the church-owned Brigham Young University, calling anti-Mormon material \"theological pornography that is damaging to the spirit,\" stating that \"none of it is worth casting an eye upon. Do not read the anti-Mormon materials. That is not the way you resolve questions about the truthfulness of the restored gospel.\"\n\nMormon apologetics and members vary both in their perception of criticism and opposition, as well as what they see as falling under the umbrella of anti-Mormonism. Hugh Nibley, the author of voluminous works in response to books deemed anti-Mormon, including a chapter on how to write an anti-Mormon book, explained why he thinks ex-Mormons criticize the church:\n\nApostates usually become sometimes feverishly active, determined to prove to the world and themselves that it is a fraud after all. What is that to them? Apparently it is everything—it will not let them alone. At the other end of the scale are those who hold no rancor and even retain a sentimental affection for the Church—they just don't believe the gospel. I know quite a few of them. But how many of \"them\" can leave it alone? It haunts them all the days of their life. No one who has ever had a testimony ever forgets or denies that he once \"did\" have it—that it was something that really happened to him. Even for such people who do not have it anymore, a testimony cannot be reduced to an illusion.\n\nDavis Bitton presented criteria on how to identify anti-Mormon material in a 2004 paper published for the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) entitled, \"Spotting an Anti-Mormon Book.\" He specifies inaccuracy, telling Mormons what they believe, strong preference for negative information, always showing \"the church, its leaders, its people, and its beliefs in the worst possible light,\" participating in anti-Mormon activities, denouncing the church, engaging in \"behavior defiantly contrary to church standards,\" unjustly claiming to be a Latter-day Saint, and indulging in \"snide, disrespectful, cruel comments about the Saints and those they sustain as prophets\" as characteristics of anti-Mormon books and authors. Additionally, he singles out publishers such as the Utah Gospel Mission and the Utah Lighthouse Ministry as being \"anti-Mormon, at least in intent.\"\n\nIn another FARMS review, this time of \"New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology\" by Brent Lee Metcalfe, Bitton reveals more of his thoughts on the subject:\n\nI am not entirely comfortable with labeling this an anti-Mormon work, for I don't see hatred of the Church and a determination to destroy as the prime motive behind it. On the other hand, whatever the intention of individual authors, the label is not entirely misapplied either. In any case, one thing is sure: the compilation will be exploited by the Mormon-haters.\n\nOthers consider the definition of anti-Mormonism rather fundamentally: those in opposition to or against the LDS Church. While not including those who simply believe differently, it includes those who are actively engaged in opposing the LDS Church. Thus, a person's intelligence, honesty, qualification or accreditation do not make them anti-Mormon. Anti-Mormon arguments are those in opposition to the claims and institutional aims of the LDS Church, and anti-Mormons are those who spend a significant amount of time opposing the church via such arguments or otherwise.\n\nMany members of the LDS Church believe that since the church is sanctioned by God, Satan and his followers will seek to destroy it, with some even seeing this opposition as evidence that the LDS Church has divine origins. Some avoid anti-Mormon material, while others analyze and criticize it, such as William J. Hamblin, who addresses anti-Mormon attacks on the geography and archeology of the Book of Mormon in \"Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon.\"\n\nOther prominent LDS Church members note that the opposition from anti-Mormonism can actually be beneficial. As Hugh Nibley expressed it, \"We need more anti-Mormon books. They keep us on our toes.\" Michael R. Ash of the Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research (FAIR) dissected this viewpoint in \"The Impact of Mormon Critics on LDS Scholarship,\" concluding that the accusations of critics are helpful in encouraging and stimulating further research. Orson Pratt also seemed to invite criticism when he said:\n\nConvince us of our errors of doctrine, if we have any, by reason, by logical arguments, or by the word of God, and we will be ever grateful for the information, and you will ever have the pleasing reflection that you have been instruments in the hands of God of redeeming your fellow beings from the darkness which you may see enveloping their minds.\n\nRegarding the subject of Christian anti-Mormonism, Richard Mouw (President of the Fuller Theological Seminary) stated in 2004 at the Salt Lake Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, \n\nI am now convinced that we ... have often seriously misrepresented the beliefs and practices of the Mormon community. Indeed, let me state it bluntly to the LDS folks here this evening: we have sinned against you. The God of the Scriptures makes it clear that it is a terrible thing to bear false witness against our neighbors, and we have been guilty of that sort of transgression in things we have said about you. We have told you what you believe without making a sincere effort first of all to ask you what you believe...Indeed, we have even on occasion demonized you, weaving conspiracy theories about what the LDS community is 'really' trying to accomplish in the world.\n\nMouw is not the only Christian calling for moderation. Similar pleas have been issued by David Rowe, Carl Mosser, Francis J. Beckwith, Paul Owen, Craig Blomberg, and others. Some church and parachurch groups have also made efforts to repair relations with the Mormons. In the 1980s, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority \"took some small steps toward Evangelical-Mormon cooperation for a shared social, political, and ethical agenda\". More recently, a Pentecostal congregation in Provo, Utah held a public ceremony of repentance for its negative attitudes and actions toward the Latter-day Saint community. In 2001, the organization Standing Together, based in Lehi, Utah, was founded by a Baptist minister for the purpose of \"building bridges of relationship and dialogue with ... The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" Standing Together hosts public seminars in which Evangelical scholar Greg Johnson and LDS scholar Robert Millet \"communicate how they have maintained their friendship and at the same time discussed candidly their theological differences and concerns for one another.\" However, Standing Together is most recognized for their activities at General Conference, where they literally stand together, taking up space to deny its use by those who come to be disruptive influences.\n\nSome traditional Christian churches and ministries, however, have expressed varying degrees of concern about the movement to abandon what they consider to be valid and cogent challenges to Mormon doctrine and teaching for the sake of \"peaceful co-existence,\" and yet at the same time do not wish to be categorized with the fringe Christian elements that seek to be openly disruptive and antagonistic toward the LDS community.\n\nRick Santorum was asked if Jon Huntsman and Mitt Romney will have problems in the race as Mormons. Santorum answered, \n\n\"I hope not.\" He continued, \"I hope that people will look at the qualities of candidates and look at what they believe and what they're for and look [at] their records and then make a decision.\"\n\nJoe Biden said, \n\nI find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision,\" Biden told an audience at the University of Pittsburgh. \"It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way,\" he said in a long response to a student's question about how his own religious faith affected his philosophy of government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22992426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22992426", "title": "Apache Wave", "text": "Apache Wave\n\nApache Wave was a software framework for real-time collaborative editing online. Google originally developed it as Google Wave.\nIt was announced at the Google I/O conference on May 27, 2009.\n\nWave is a web-based computing platform and communications protocol designed to merge key features of communications media such as email, instant messaging, wikis, and social networking. Communications using the system can be synchronous or asynchronous. Software extensions provide contextual spelling and grammar checking, automated language translation and other features.\n\nInitially released only to developers, a preview release of Google Wave was extended to 100,000 users in September 2009, each allowed to invite additional users. Google accepted most requests submitted starting November 29, 2009, soon after the September extended release of the technical preview. On May 19, 2010, it was released to the general public.\n\nOn August 4, 2010, Google announced the suspension of stand-alone Wave development and the intent of maintaining the web site at least for the remainder of the year, and on November 22, 2011, announced that existing Waves would become read-only in January 2012 and all Waves would be deleted in April 2012. Development was handed over to the Apache Software Foundation which started to develop a server-based product called Wave in a Box. It was retired in January 2018.\n\nThe science fiction television series \"Firefly\" provided the inspiration for the project's name. In the series, a \"wave\" is an electronic communication, often consisting of a video call or video message. During the developer preview, a number of references were made to the series, such as Lars Rasmussen replying to a message with \"shiny\", a word used in the series to mean \"cool\" or \"good\", and the crash message of Wave being a popular quotation from the series: \"Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!\" Another common error message, \"Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret!\" is a quote from Kaylee Frye in the 2005 motion-picture \"Firefly\" continuation, \"Serenity\", and it is matched with a sign declaring that \"This wave is experiencing some turbulence and might explode. If you don't want to explode...\" which is another reference to the opening of the film.\n\nDuring an event in Amsterdam, Netherlands, it became apparent that the 60-strong team that was then working on Wave in Sydney, Australia used Joss Whedon-related references to describe, among others, the sandbox version of Wave called \"Dollhouse\" after the TV-series by \"Firefly\" producer Joss Whedon, which was aired on Fox in the U.S. The development of external extensions was codenamed \"Serenity\", after the spaceship used in \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity\".\n\nGoogle released most of the source code as open source software, allowing the public to develop its features through extensions. Google allowed third parties to build their own Wave services (be it private or commercial) because it wanted the Wave protocol to replace the e-mail protocol. Initially, Google was the only Wave service provider, but it was hoped that other service providers would launch their own Wave services, possibly designing their own unique web-based clients as is common with many email service providers. The possibility also existed for native Wave clients to be made, as demonstrated with their CLI-based console client.\n\nGoogle released initial open-source components of Wave:\n\nIn addition, Google provided some detail about later phases of the open-source release:\n\nGoogle Wave was a new Internet communications platform. It was written in Java using OpenJDK and its web interface used the Google Web Toolkit. Google Wave worked like previous messaging systems such as email and Usenet, but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring all responses to be stored in each user's inbox for context, message documents (referred to as \"waves\") that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) were perpetually stored on a central server. Waves were shared with collaborators who could be added or removed from the wave at any point during a wave's existence.\n\nWaves, described by Google as \"equal parts conversation and document\", were hosted XML documents that allowed seamless and low latency concurrent modifications. Any participant of a wave could reply anywhere within the message, edit any part of the wave, and add participants at any point in the process. Each edit/reply was a blip and users can reply to individual blips within waves. Recipients were notified of changes/replies in all waves in which they were active and, upon opening a wave, could review those changes in chronological order. In addition, waves were live. All replies/edits were visible in real-time, letter-by-letter, as they were typed by the other collaborators. Multiple participants could edit a single wave simultaneously in Google Wave. Thus, waves could function not only as e-mails and threaded conversations but also as an instant messaging service when many participants were online at the same time. A wave could repeatedly shift roles between e-mail and instant messaging depending on the number of users editing it concurrently. The ability to show messages as they are typed could be disabled, similar to conventional instant messaging.\n\nThe ability to modify a wave at any location let users create collaborative documents, edited in a manner akin to wikis. Waves could easily link to other waves. In many respects, it was a more advanced forum. It could be read and known to exist by only one person, or by two or more and could also be public, available for reading and writing to everyone on the Wave.\n\nThe history of each wave was stored within it. Collaborators could use a playback feature to observe the order in which it was edited, blips that were added, and who was responsible for what in the wave. The history could also be searched by a user to view and/or modify specific changes, such as specific kinds of changes or messages from a single user.\n\nDuring the initial launch of Google Wave, invitations were widely sought by users and were sold on auction sites.\nThose who received invitations and decided to test Google Wave could not communicate with their contacts on their regular email accounts. The initial spread of Wave was very restricted.\n\nGoogle Wave initially received positive press coverage for its design and potential uses. On August 4, 2010, Google announced Wave would no longer be developed as a stand-alone product due to a lack of interest. Google's statement surprised many in the industry and user community.\n\nGoogle later clarified the Wave service would be available until Google Docs was capable of accessing saved waves.\n\nResponse to the news of the end of development came from Wave users in the form of a website. Since their announcement in early August, the website has recorded over 49,000 supporter registrations urging Google Wave's continuation.\n\nIn retrospect, the lack of success of Google Wave was attributed among other things to its complicated user interface resulting in a product that merged features of email, instant messengers and wikis but ultimately failed to do anything significantly better than the existing solutions.\n\nChris Dawson of online technology magazine Zdnet discussed inconsistencies in the reasoning of Google in deciding to end support for Wave, mentioning its \"deep involvement\" in developing social media networks, to which many of Wave's capabilities are ideally suited.\n\nGoogle Wave was accepted by the Apache Software Foundation's Incubator program under the project name Apache Wave. The Google Wave Developer blog was updated with news of the change on December 6, 2010. A Wave Proposal page with details on the project's goals was created on the Apache Foundation's Incubator Wiki.\n\nWave in a Box is the current server implementation of Apache Wave. Currently, there are not any demo servers available.\n\nIn 2016, several discussions took place within the Apache Wave community, aiming to tackle the stagnation and crisis state of the project. The Apache Software Foundation mentor of Apache Wave, Upayavira, was concerned on the project stagnation, but framed SwellRT (a fork which re-engineered Wave into a backend-as-a-service for building apps) as Wave's potential savior. Eventually, Wave was approved to continue within Apache incubator program, and a copy of SwellRT codebase was placed in the Apache Wave repository in order to grant the Wave community access to it. In this regard, Intellectual Property of SwellRT was transferred to the Apache Foundation in 2017. Still this was not sufficient to resurrect Wave's developer community, and SwellRT continued as independent project. \n\nThe Wave project retired on 2018-01-15, having never left incubator status.\n\nGoogle Wave is extensible through an application programming interface (API). It provides extensions in the form of \"Gadgets\" and \"Robots\", and is embeddable by dropping interactive windows into a given wave on external sites, such as blog sites.\n\nThe last version of robots API is 2.0.\n\nGoogle Wave also supports extension installers, which bundle back-end elements (robots and gadgets) and front-end user interface elements into an integrated package. Users may install extensions directly within the Wave client using an extension installer.\n\nGoogle Wave extensions are add-ins that may be installed on Google Wave to enhance its functionality. They may be Internet bots (robots) to automate common tasks, or gadgets to extend or change user interaction features, e.g., posting blips on microblog feeds or providing RSVP recording mechanisms.\n\nOver 150 Google Wave extensions have been developed either in the form of Gadgets or Robots.\n\nA robot is an automated participant on a wave. It can read the contents of a wave in which it participates, modify its contents, add or remove participants, and create new blips or new waves. Robots perform actions in response to events. For example, a robot might publish the contents of a wave to a public blog site and update the wave with user comments.\n\nRobots may be added as participants to the Wave itself. In theory, a robot can be added anywhere a human participant can be involved.\n\nGadget extensions are applications that run within the wave, and to which all participants have access. Robots and Gadgets can be used together, but they generally serve different purposes. A gadget is an application users could participate with, many of which are built on Google’s OpenSocial platform. A good comparison would be iGoogle gadgets or Facebook applications.\n\nThe gadget is triggered based on the user action. They can be best described as applications installed on a mobile phone. For example, a wave might include a sudoku gadget that lets the wave participants compete to see who can solve the puzzle first.\n\nGadgets may be added to individual waves and all the participants share and interact with the gadget.\n\nGoogle Wave provides federation using an extension of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), the open Wave Federation Protocol. Being an open protocol, anyone can use it to build a custom Wave system and become a wave provider. The use of an open protocol is intended to parallel the openness and ease of adoption of the e-mail protocol and, like e-mail, allow communication regardless of provider. Google hoped that waves would replace e-mail as the dominant form of Internet communication. In this way, Google intended to be only one of many wave providers and to also be used as a supplement to e-mail, instant messaging, FTP, etc.\n\nA key feature of the protocol is that waves are stored on the service provider's servers instead of being sent between users. Waves are federated; copies of waves and wavelets are distributed by the wave provider of the originating user to the providers of all other participants in a particular wave or wavelet so all participants have immediate access to up-to-date content. The originating wave server is responsible for hosting, processing, and concurrency control of waves. The protocol allows private reply wavelets within parent waves, where other participants have no access or knowledge of them.\n\nSecurity for the communications is provided via Transport Layer Security authentication, and encrypted connections and waves/wavelets are identified uniquely by a service provider's domain name and ID strings. User-data is not federated, that is, not shared with other wave providers.\n\nBesides Apache Wave itself, there are other open-source variants of servers and clients with different percentage of Wave Federation and Wave Protocol support. Wave was re-engineered into a backend-as-a-service solution by the SwellRT project. Wave has been adopted in different forms for corporate applications by Novell for Novell Pulse, or by SAP for Cloudave, and community projects such as PyOfWave or Kune.\n\nThe following servers are compatible with the Google Wave protocol:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "67161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67161", "title": "Apollonius of Tyana", "text": "Apollonius of Tyana\n\nApollonius of Tyana (; c. 15 – c. 100 AD), sometimes also called Apollonios of Tyana, was a Greek Neopythagorean philosopher from the town of Tyana in the Roman province of Cappadocia in Anatolia.\n\nApollonius was born into a respected and wealthy Greek family. Although the precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain, most scholars agree that he was a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (circa 170c. 247), places him circa 3 BCc. 97 AD.\n\nThe earliest and by far the most detailed source is the \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the sophist Philostratus at the request of empress Julia Domna. She died in 217 AD., and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s AD. Philostratus’s account shaped the image of Apollonius for posterity. To some extent it is a valuable source because it contains data from older writings which were available to Philostratus but disappeared later on. Among these works are an excerpt (preserved by Eusebius) from \"On Sacrifices\", and certain alleged letters of Apollonius. The sage may have actually written some of these works, along with the no-longer extant \"Biography of Pythagoras\". At least two biographical sources that Philostratus used are lost: a book by the imperial secretary Maximus describing Apollonius’s activities in Maximus's home city of Aegaeae in Aeolis, and a biography by a certain Moiragenes. There also survives, separately from the life by Philostratus, a collection of letters of Apollonius, but at least some of these seem to be spurious.\n\nOne of the essential sources Philostratus claimed to know are the “memoirs” (or “diary”) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think it could have been a real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero’s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption.\n\nHow much of this can be accepted as historical truth depends largely on the extent to which modern scholars trust Philostratus, and in particular on whether they believe in the reality of Damis. Some of these scholars contend that Apollonius never came to Western Europe and was virtually unknown there until the 3rd century AD, when Empress Julia Domna, who was herself from the province of Syria, decided to popularize him and his teachings in Rome. For that purpose, so these same scholars believe, she commissioned Philostratus to write the biography, in which Apollonius is exalted as a fearless sage with supernatural powers, even greater than Pythagoras. This view of Julia Domna's role in the making of the Apollonius legend gets some support from the fact that her son Caracalla worshipped him, and her grandnephew emperor Severus Alexander may have done so as well.\n\nApollonius was also a known figure in the Islamic world.\n\nWith the exception of the Adana Inscription, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus. As James Francis put it, \"the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius appears to have been a wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire.\" What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice, and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae, and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (\"On sacrifices\"), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving \"nous\" (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.\n\nPhilostratus implies on one occasion that Apollonius had extra-sensory perception (Book VIII, Chapter XXVI). When emperor Domitian was murdered on 18 September 96 AD, Apollonius was said to have witnessed the event in Ephesus \"about midday\" on the day it happened in Rome, and told those present \"Take heart, gentlemen, for the tyrant has been slain this day ...\". Both Philostratus and renowned historian Cassius Dio report this incident, probably on the basis of an oral tradition. Both state that the philosopher welcomed the deed as a praiseworthy tyrannicide.\n\nPhilostratus devoted two and a half of the eight books of his \"Life of Apollonius\" (1.19–3.58) to the description of a journey of his hero to India. According to Philostratus' \"Life\", en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria (not Nineveh, as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. Pythagoras, whom the Neo-Pythagoreans regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have travelled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look like a good Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus’ account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them rule out the possibility that the Tyanean actually did visit India.\n\nWhat seemed to be independent evidence showing that Apollonius was known in India has now been proved to be forged. In two Sanskrit texts quoted by Sanskritist Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya in 1943 he appears as \"Apalūnya\", in one of them together with Damis (called \"Damīśa\"), it is claimed that Apollonius and Damis were Western yogis, who later on were converted to the correct Advaita philosophy. Some have believed that these Indian sources derived their information from a Sanskrit translation of Philostratus’ work (which would have been a most uncommon and amazing occurrence), or even considered the possibility that it was really an independent confirmation of the historicity of the journey to India. Only in 1995 were the passages in the Sanskrit texts proven to be interpolations by a late 19th century forger.\n\nSeveral writings and many letters have been ascribed to Apollonius, but some of them are lost; others have only been preserved in parts or fragments of disputed authenticity. Porphyry and Iamblichus refer to a biography of Pythagoras by Apollonius, which has not survived; it is also mentioned in the \"Suda\". Apollonius wrote a treatise \"On sacrifices\", of which only a short, probably authentic fragment has come down to us.\n\nPhilostratus' \"Life\" and the anthology assembled by Joannes Stobaeus contain purported letters of Apollonius. Some of them are cited in full, others only partially. There is also an independently transmitted collection of letters preserved in medieval manuscripts. It is difficult to determine what is authentic and what not. Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.\n\nBiblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman relates that in the introduction to his textbook on the New Testament, he describes an important figure from the first century without first revealing he is writing about the stories attached to Apollonius of Tyana:\n\nEhrman goes on to say that Apollonius and Jesus were real persons and that Apollonius' followers believed Jesus to be a fraud in his book \"Did Jesus Exist\"?\n\nSossianus Hierocles argued in the 3rd century that the doctrines and the life of Apollonius were more valuable than those of Jesus', a viewpoint reportedly held by both Voltaire and Charles Blount during the Age of Enlightenment. In his 1909 book \"The Christ\", John Remsburg postulated that the religion of Apollonius disappeared because the proper conditions for its development did not exist. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam thrived however, because the existing conditions were favorable. In his 1949 book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", comparative mythology scholar Joseph Campbell lists both Apollonius and Jesus as examples of individuals who shared similar hero stories, along with Krishna, Buddha, and others. Similarly, Robert M. Price in his 2011 \"The Christ-Myth Theory and its Problems\", notes that the ancients often compared Jesus with Apollonius and that they both fit the mythic hero archetype. G. K. Chesterton (the writer and Christian apologist), however, noted that the unique trial, suffering and death of Christ stand in stark opposition to the stories about Apollonius which he felt were very likely spurious. While Jesus' encounter with the provincial Roman authorities in Judea ended fatally, Apollonius was said to have survived unscathed a face-to-face confrontation with Domitian, one of the most harsh of Roman Emperors; therefore, the myth of Apollonius lacked the element of martyrdom, central to that of Jesus.\n\nIn the 2nd century the satirist Lucian of Samosata was a sharp critic of Neo-Pythagoreanism. After 180 AD he wrote a pamphlet where he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius’ students, as a charlatan; and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized at the same time that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.\n\nWhen Emperor Aurelian conducted his military campaign against the Palmyrene Empire, he captured Tyana in 272 AD. According to the \"Historia Augusta\" he abstained from destroying the city after having a vision of Apollonius admonishing him to spare the innocent citizens.\n\nIn Philostratus’ description of Apollonius’ life and deeds there are a number of similarities with the life and especially the claimed miracles of Jesus. Perhaps this parallel was intentional, but the original aim was hardly to present Apollonius as a rival of Jesus. However, in the late 3rd century Porphyry, an anti-Christian Neoplatonic philosopher, claimed in his treatise \"Against the Christians\" that the miracles of Jesus were not unique, and mentioned Apollonius as a non-Christian who had accomplished similar achievements. Around 300 AD, Roman authorities used the fame of Apollonius in their struggle to wipe out Christianity. Hierocles, one of the main instigators of the persecution of Christians in 303 AD, wrote a pamphlet where he argued that Apollonius exceeded Christ as a wonder-worker and yet wasn’t worshipped as a god, and that the cultured biographers of Apollonius were more trustworthy than the uneducated apostles. This attempt to make Apollonius a hero of the anti-Christian movement provoked sharp replies from bishop Eusebius of Caesarea and from Lactantius. Eusebius wrote an extant reply to the pamphlet of Hierocles, where he claimed that Philostratus was a fabulist and that Apollonius was a sorcerer in league with demons. This started a debate on the relative merits of Jesus and Apollonius that has gone on in different forms into modern times.\n\nIn Late Antiquity talismans made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from afflictions. The great popularity of these talismans was a challenge to the Christians. Some Byzantine authors condemned them as sorcery and the work of demons, others admitted that such magic was beneficial; none of them claimed that it didn’t work.\n\nIn the Western Roman Empire, Sidonius Apollinaris was a Christian admirer of Apollonius in the 5th century. He produced a Latin translation of Philostratus’ \"Life\", which is lost.\n\nThe \"Tablet of Wisdom\" written by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, names \"Balinus\" (Apollonius) as a great philosopher, who \"surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication.\" The use of talismans is commonplace in Bábí and (to a lesser extent) Bahá'í writings.\n\nBeginning in the early 16th century, there was great interest in Apollonius in Europe, but the traditional ecclesiastical viewpoint prevailed, and until the Age of Enlightenment the Tyanean was usually treated as a demonic magician and a great enemy of the Church who collaborated with the devil and tried to overthrow Christianity.\n\nComparisons between Apollonius and Jesus became commonplace in the 17th and 18th centuries in the context of polemic about Christianity. Several advocates of Enlightenment, deism and anti-Church positions saw him as an early forerunner of their own ethical and religious ideas, a proponent of a universal, non-denominational religion compatible with Reason. These comparisons continued into the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It purportedly shows that at that point the Bush administration had already decided on the US invasion of Iraq.\nThe memo was written by Blair's chief foreign policy adviser at the time David Manning, who participated in the meeting.\n\nIt has become controversial for its content, which includes discussing ways to provoke Saddam Hussein into a confrontation, with Bush floating the idea of painting a U-2 spyplane in United Nations colors and letting it fly low over Iraq to provoke Iraq into shooting it down, thus providing a pretext for America and Britain's subsequent invasion. \n\nIt also shows George Bush and Tony Blair making a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by UN weapons inspectors, in direct contradiction to statements made by Blair to Parliament afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.\n\nIn the memo, Bush is paraphrased as saying:\nBush also said to Blair that he \"thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups\" in Iraq after the war.\nFive pages long, and classified as \"extremely sensitive\", the existence of the memo was first alleged by Philippe Sands in his book \"Lawless World\" (2005). It was then obtained by American newspaper \"The New York Times\", which confirmed its authenticity.\n\nUK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said, with regard to the memo: \"If these allegations are accurate, the Prime Minister and President Bush were determined to go to war with or without a second UN resolution, and Britain was signed up to do so by the end of January 2003.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2389388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2389388", "title": "Carta de Jamaica", "text": "Carta de Jamaica\n\nThe Carta de Jamaica (or Jamaica Letter) was a document written by Simón Bolívar in Jamaica in 1815. It was a response to a letter from Henry Cullen, in which Bolívar explained his thoughts about the social and political situation of the Spanish America at the time, the power of the Spanish Empire and the possible future of the new nations that would be created after its collapse.\n\nIn order to rebuild the Republic, the Admirable Campaign took Bolívar very rapidly in just a few months to Caracas on August 6, 1813. However, the whole enterprise came to an end in 1814, when the loyalist troops of José Tomás Boves finally defeated the patriot forces and forced Bolívar to retreat, with the additional consequence of being proscribed by José Félix Ribas and Manuel Piar. After this defeat in 1814, Bolívar fled Venezuela with his authority lost and disputed by his own officers. The Second Republic of Venezuela was finally abolished.\n\nBolívar departed to Cartagena on September 8, 1814. He was in New Granada in October 1814 and stayed until April 1815. Nevertheless, Bolívar did not repeat the victorious experience of 1813 because he was a subordinate of the New Granadian authorities, which requested him to fight against the federalist forces (who opposed the centralist dictatorship of Bernardo Álvarez) rather than the loyalist armies. Unable to deal with the civil war that confronted the patriot factions and having neither political power nor the acceptance of several New Granadians, Bolívar decided to resign his military investiture and to leave the Spanish American society.\n\nThe \"Libertador\" made his way to Jamaica on May 8, 1815, and he arrived there six days later. Bolívar aspired to get the attention of the British Empire in order to obtain its cooperation, in which the ideal of Latin American independence means economic profit for England. Therefore, Bolívar made efforts to convince the English gentlemen of his proposals, such as giving to England the Spanish American provinces of Panama and Nicaragua to build waterways. Bolívar lived in Kingston from May to December 1815 with no military activities, but he dedicated his time to think about the future of the American continent, given the situation of the world's politics.\n\nBolívar did not have in that year any resources to fulfill his projects of emancipation. In 1815, the \"Libertador\" gained the sympathy of the British, but he was close to poverty with few material possessions, little money and some slaves; Pío, one of them, tried to assassinate him under the orders given by Pablo Morillo, whose fleet began its voyage from Cádiz to the Spanish America months earlier. In October, Bolívar's economic situation worsened in a point in which he was in despair. According to a letter written to Maxwell Hyslop, Bolívar said that he would end his days \"in a violent manner\" and that \"it is preferable death than a less honourable existence\".\n\nPrior to those misfortuned words on October 1815, Bolívar wrote the \"Carta de Jamaica\". Months later, the \"Libertador\" was required by his New Granadian fellows to help their resistance against Morillo's troops, but it was too late because the loyalist \"Pacificador\" took the city of Cartagena. This event made Bolívar change his course to Haiti in order to get reinforcements from Alexandre Pétion. On December 24, Bolívar was no longer in Jamaica.\n\nThe \"Carta de Jamaica\" was finished on September 6, 1815, in Kingston. In it, Bolívar began by analyzing what until that time had been considered the historical successes in the struggle for liberty in the Americas. In general terms, it was a balance of force achieved by the patriots in the years from 1810 to 1815. In the middle part of the document are expounded the causes and reasons that justified the \"Spanish Americans\" in their decision for independence, followed by a call to Europe for it to co-operate in the work to liberate the Latin American peoples. In the third and final part, he speculated and debated on the destiny of Mexico, Central America, New Granada, Venezuela, Río de la Plata, Chile, and Peru.\n\nFinally, Bolívar ends his reflections with an imprecation that he would repeat until his death: the necessity for the union of the countries of the Americas. Even though the Carta de Jamaica was nominally addressed to Henry Cullen, it is clear that its fundamental objective was to gain the attention of the most powerful liberal nation of the 19th century, Britain, with the aim that it would decide to involve itself in American independence. However, when Britain finally responded to Bolívar's call, he preferred the help of Haiti.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8725303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8725303", "title": "Comparison of high definition optical disc formats", "text": "Comparison of high definition optical disc formats\n\nThis article compares the technical specifications of multiple high definition formats, including HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc; two mutually incompatible, high definition optical disc formats that, beginning in 2006, attempted to improve upon and eventually replace the DVD standard. The two formats remained in a format war until February 19, 2008 when Toshiba, HD DVD's creator, announced plans to cease development, manufacturing and marketing of HD DVD players and recorders.\n\nOther high-definition optical disc formats were attempted, including the multi-layered red-laser Versatile Multilayer Disc and a Chinese made format called EVD. Both appear to have been abandoned by their respective developers.\n\na These maximum storage capacities apply to currently released media as of January 2012. First two layers of Blu-ray have a 25 GB capacity, but the triple layer disc adds a further 50 GB making 100 GB total. The fourth layer adds a further 28 GB. <br>\nb All HD DVD players are required to decode the two primary channels (left and right) of any Dolby TrueHD track; however, every Toshiba made stand-alone HD DVD player released thus far decodes 5.1 channels of TrueHD.<br>\nc On November 1, 2007 Secondary video and audio decoder became mandatory for new Blu-ray Disc players when the Bonus View requirement came into effect. However, players introduced to the market before this date can continue to be sold without Bonus View.<br>\nd There are some differences in the implementation of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) on the two formats. On Blu-ray Disc, DD+ can only be used to extend a primary Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 audiotrack. In this method 640 kbit/s is allocated to the primary DD 5.1 audiotrack (which is independently playable on players that do not support DD+), and up to 1 Mbit/s is allocated for the DD+ extension. The DD+ extension is used to replace the rear channels of the DD track with higher fidelity versions, along with adding additional channels for 6.1/7.1 audiotracks. On HD DVD, DD+ is used to encode all channels (up to 7.1), and no legacy DD track is required since all HD DVD players are required to decode DD+.<br>\ne On PAL DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 50 interlaced frames per second and gets replayed 4% faster. This process can be reversed to retrieve the original 24 frame per second content. On NTSC DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 60 interlaced frames per second using a process called 3:2 pulldown, which if done properly can also be reversed.<br>\nf As of July 2008, about 66.7% of Blu-ray discs are region free and 33.3% use region codes.<br>\ng DVD supports any valid MPEG-2 refresh rate as long as it is packaged with metadata converting it to 576i50 or 480i60, This metadata takes the form of REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD instructions embedded in the MPEG-2 stream itself, and is a part of the MPEG-2 standard. HD DVD is the only high-def disc format that can decode 1080p25 while Blu-ray and HD DVD can both decode 1080p24 and 1080p30. 1080p25 content can only be presented on Blu-ray as 1080i50.<br>\nh Linear PCM is the only lossless audio codec that is mandatory for both HD DVD and Blu-ray disc players, only HD DVD players are required to decode two lossless sound formats and those are Linear PCM and Dolby TrueHD. Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio have become sound format of choice for many studios on their Blu-ray titles but ever since Blu-ray won the format war, it has not become clear if they are now Mandatory for all new Blu-ray disc players since the end of the format war.\n\nBlu-ray Disc has a higher maximum disc capacity than HD DVD (50 GB vs. 30 GB for a double layered disc). In September 2007 the DVD Forum approved a preliminary specification for the triple-layer 51GB HD DVD (ROM only) disc though Toshiba never stated whether it was compatible with existing HD DVD players. In September 2006 TDK announced a prototype Blu-ray Disc with a capacity of 200GB. TDK was also the first to develop a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB in May 2005. In October 2007 Hitachi developed a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB. Hitachi has stated that current Blu-ray drives would only require a few firmware updates in order to play the disc.\n\nThe first 50 GB dual-layer Blu-ray Disc release was the movie \"Click\", which was released on October 10, 2006. As of July 2008, over 95% of Blu-ray movies/games are published on 50 GB dual layer discs with the remainder on 25 GB discs. 85% of HD DVD movies are published on 30 GB dual layer discs, with the remainder on 15 GB discs.\n\nThe choice of video compression technology (codec) complicates any comparison of the formats. Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD both support the same three video compression standards: MPEG-2, VC-1 and AVC, each of which exhibits different bitrate/noise-ratio curves, visual impairments/artifacts, and encoder maturity. Initial Blu-ray Disc titles often used MPEG-2 video, which requires the highest average bitrate and thus the most space, to match the picture quality of the other two video codecs. As of July 2008 over 70% of Blu-ray Disc titles have been authored with the newer compression standards: AVC and VC-1. HD DVD titles have used VC-1 and AVC almost exclusively since the format's introduction. Warner Bros., which used to release movies in both formats prior to June 1, 2007, often used the same encode (with VC-1 codec) for both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, with identical results. In contrast, Paramount used different encodings: initially MPEG-2 for early Blu-ray Disc releases, VC-1 for early HD DVD releases, and eventually AVC for both formats.\n\nWhilst the two formats support similar audio codecs, their usage varies. Most titles released on the Blu-ray format include Dolby Digital tracks for each language in the region, a DTS-HD Master Audio track for all 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures and many upcoming Universal titles, Dolby TrueHD for Disney and Sony Pictures and some Paramount and Warner titles, and for many Blu-ray titles a Linear PCM track for the primary language. On the other hand, most titles released on the HD DVD format include Dolby Digital Plus tracks for each language in the region, and some also include a Dolby TrueHD track for the primary language.\n\nBoth Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD have two main options for interactivity (on-screen menus, bonus features, etc.).\n\nHD DVD's Standard Content is a minor change from standard DVD's subpicture technology, while Blu-ray's BDMV is completely new. This makes transitioning from standard DVD to Standard Content HD DVD relatively simple —for example, Apple's DVD Studio Pro has supported authoring Standard Content since version 4.0.3. For more advanced interactivity Blu-ray disc supports BD-J while HD DVD supports Advanced Content.\n\nBlu-ray Discs contain their data relatively close to the surface (less than 0.1 mm) which combined with the smaller spot size presents a problem when the surface is scratched as data would be destroyed. To overcome this, TDK, Sony, and Panasonic each have developed a proprietary scratch resistant surface coating. TDK trademarked theirs as Durabis, which has withstood direct abrasion by steel wool and marring with markers in tests.\n\nHD DVD uses traditional material and has the same scratch and surface characteristics of a regular DVD. The data is at the same depth (0.6 mm) as DVD as to minimize damage from scratching. As with DVD the construction of the HD DVD allows for a second side of either HD DVD or DVD.\n\nA study performed by Home Media Magazine (August 5, 2007) concluded that HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are essentially equal in production cost. Quotes from several disc manufacturers for 25,000 units of HD DVDs and Blu-rays revealed a price differential of only 5-10 cents. (Lowest price: 90 cents versus 100 cents. Highest price: $1.45 versus $1.50.) Another study performed by Wesley Tech (February 9, 2007) arrived at a similar conclusion. Quotes for 10,000 discs show that a 15 gigabyte HD DVD costs $11,500 total, and 25 gigabyte Blu-ray or a 30 gigabyte HD DVD costs $13,000 total. For larger quantities of 100,000 units, the 30 gigabyte HD DVD was more expensive than the 25 gigabyte Blu-ray ($1.55 versus $1.49).\n\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show, on , Warner Bros. introduced a hybrid technology, Total HD, which would reportedly support both formats on a single disc. The new discs were to overlay the Blu-ray and HD DVD layers, placing them respectively and beneath the surface. The Blu-ray top layer would act as a two-way mirror, reflecting just enough light for a Blu-ray reader to read and an HD DVD player to ignore.\n\nLater that year, however, in September 2007, Warner President Ron Sanders said that the technology was on hold due to Warner being the only company who would publish on it.\n\nOne year after the original announcement, on 4 January 2008, Warner Bros. stated that it would support the Blu-ray format exclusively beginning on 1 June 2008, which, along with the demise of HD DVD the following month, ended development of hybrid discs permanently.\n\nThe primary copy protection system used on both formats is the Advanced Access Content System (AACS). Other copy protection systems include:\n\nThe Blu-ray specification and all currently available players support region coding. As of July 2008 about 66.7% of Blu-ray Disc titles are region-free and 33.3% use region codes.\n\nThe HD DVD specification had no region coding, so a HD DVD from anywhere in the world will work in any player. The DVD Forum's steering committee discussed a request from Disney to add it, but many of the 20 companies on the committee actively opposed it.\n\nSome film titles that were exclusive to Blu-ray in the United States such as Sony's \"xXx\", Fox's \"\" and \"The Prestige\", were released on HD DVD in other countries due to different distribution agreements; for example, \"The Prestige\" was released outside the U.S. by once format-neutral studio Warner Bros. Pictures. Since HD DVDs had no region coding, there are no restrictions playing foreign-bought HD DVDs in an HD DVD player.\n"}
{"id": "1710426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1710426", "title": "Comparison of top chess players throughout history", "text": "Comparison of top chess players throughout history\n\nThis article presents a number of methodologies that have been suggested for the task of comparing the greatest chess players in history. Statistical methods offer objectivity but, while there is agreement on systems to rate the strengths of current players, there is disagreement on whether such techniques can be applied to players from different generations who never competed against each other.\n\nPerhaps the best-known statistical model is that devised by Arpad Elo in 1960 and further elaborated on in his 1978 book \"The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present\". He gave ratings to players corresponding to their performance over the best five-year span of their career. According to this system the highest ratings achieved were:\n\n\nIn 1970, FIDE adopted Elo's system for rating current players, so one way to compare players of different eras is to compare their Elo ratings. The best-ever Elo ratings are tabulated below.\n\nAs of December 2015, there were 101 chess players in history who broke 2700 and nine of them exceeded 2800. Particularly notable are the peak ratings of Fischer, Karpov and Kasparov, who achieved their peak ratings in earlier years (1972, 1994, and 1999 respectively).\n\nThe average Elo rating of top players has risen over time. For instance, the average of the top 10 active players rose from 2751 in July 2000 to 2794 in July 2014, a 43-point increase in 14 years. The average rating of the top 100 players, meanwhile, increased from 2644 to 2703, a 59-point increase. Many people believe that this rise is mostly due to a system artifact known as ratings inflation, making it impractical to compare players of different eras.\n\nArpad Elo was of the opinion that it was futile to attempt to use ratings to compare players from different eras; in his view, they could only possibly measure the strength of a player as compared to his or her contemporaries. He also stated that the process of rating players was in any case rather approximate; he compared it to \"the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind\".\n\nMany statisticians besides Elo have devised similar methods to retrospectively rate players. Jeff Sonas' rating system is called \"Chessmetrics\". This system takes account of many games played after the publication of Elo's book, and claims to take account of the rating inflation that the Elo system has allegedly suffered.\n\nOne caveat is that a Chessmetrics rating takes into account the frequency of play. According to Sonas, \"As soon as you go a month without playing, your Chessmetrics rating will start to drop.\"\n\nSonas, like Elo, claims that it is impossible to compare the strength of players from different eras, saying:\n\nNevertheless, Sonas' website does compare players from different eras. Including data until December 2004, the ratings were:\nIn 2005, Sonas used Chessmetrics to evaluate historical annual performance ratings and came to the conclusion that Kasparov was dominant for the most years, followed by Karpov and Lasker. He also published the following list of the highest ratings ever attained according to calculations done at the start of each month:\n\nIn contrast to Elo and Sonas's systems, Raymond Keene and Nathan Divinsky's book \"Warriors of the Mind\" attempts to establish a rating system claiming to compare directly the strength of players active in different eras, and so determine the strongest player of all time. Considering games played between sixty-four of the strongest players in history, they came up with the following top ten:\n\n\nThese \"Divinsky numbers\" are not on the same scale as Elo ratings (the last person on the list, Johannes Zukertort, has a Divinsky number of 873, which would be a beginner-level Elo rating). Keene and Divinsky's system has met with limited acceptance, and \"Warriors of the Mind\" has been accused of arbitrarily selecting players and bias towards modern players.\n\nA computer-based method of analyzing chess abilities across history came from Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko from the Department of Computer and Information Science of University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, in 2006. The basis for their evaluation was the difference between the position values resulting from the moves played by the human chess player and the moves chosen as best by the chess program Crafty. They compared the average number of errors in the player's game. Opening moves were excluded, in an attempt to negate the progress in chess opening theory.\n\nThe method received a number of criticisms, including: the study used a modified version of Crafty rather than the standard version; even the standard version of Crafty was not strong enough to evaluate the world champions' play; one of the modifications restricted the search depth to 12 half-moves, which is often insufficient. As of 2006 Crafty's Elo rating was 2657, below many historical top human players and several other computer programs.\n\nA study by online chess data provider Chess-DB, based on an analysis of over 50,000 chess games, claims that the \"strength\" of a player, as determined by the method of Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko, correlates with the Elo rating strength of modern players.\n\nA similar project was conducted for World Champions in 2007–08 using Rybka 2.3.2a (then-strongest chess program) and a modified version of Crafty 20.14. It arrived at the following results:\n\nA 2008 analysis, using Rybka 3, showed that Capablanca had the smallest average error factor (i.e. the most accurate play); but after adjusting for factors such as the complexity of positions, the best player came out as Fischer, followed by Capablanca, Karpov and Kramnik. The best players had an average error of about 0.07 pawns per move (after the opening). Capablanca was the most positional player, and Anand by far the most tactical. The most complex game tested was Fischer v Spassky (1972 game 6, Fischer won) while the most accurately played game was Tal v Benko (1958, Tal won).\n\nCAPS (Computer Aggregated Precision Score) is a system created by Chess.com that compares players from different eras by finding the percentage of moves that matches that of a chess engine. A score is then assigned based on percentage of matches and move value (for example, if the move was not the best, but still good, points are awarded). CAPS ignores both style and psychology. According to the system, Carlsen was the best player ever, with a CAPS score of 98.36 and a top engine match of 85.26%. He was followed closely by Kramnik, and then Kasparov.\n\nIn an article published by the ICGA Journal, Jean-Marc Alliot of the Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute (IRIT) presents a new method, based on a Markovian interpretation of a chess game. Starting with those of Wilhelm Steinitz, all 26,000 games played since then by chess world champions have been processed by a supercomputer using Stockfish (rated between 3310 ELO at the CCRL and 3337 at the SSDF as of 10/2015, but around 3150 under the test condition according to the authors) in 62000 CPU hours, in order to create a probabilistic model for each player. For each position, the model estimates the probability of making a mistake, and the magnitude of the mistake by comparing the two best moves calculated at an average of 2 minutes by move (26 plies on the average) with the move actually played, starting from move number 10. These models can then be used to compute the win/draw/lose probability for any given match between two players. The predictions have proven not only to be extremely close to the actual results when players have played concrete games against one another, they also fare better than those based on ELO scores. The results demonstrate that the level of chess players has been steadily increasing. Magnus Carlsen (in 2013), tops the list, while Vladimir Kramnik (in 1999) is second, Bobby Fischer (in 1971) is third, and Garry Kasparov (in 2001) is fourth. \n\nThe complete results are as follows (each player taken in his best year,\nCarlsen: 2013, Kramnik: 1999, Fischer: 1971, Kasparov: 2001, Anand: 2008, Khalifman: 2010, Smyslov: 1983, Petrosian: 1962, Karpov: 1988, Kasimdzhanov: 2011, Botvinnik: 1945, Ponomariov: 2011, Lasker: 1907, Spassky: 1970, Topalov: 2008, Capablanca: 1928, Euwe: 1941, Tal: 1981, Alekhine: 1922, Steinitz: 1894). The numbers represent the winning percentage of one player against his opponent. Tables are not symmetric as playing with white and with black is not the same.\n\nThe complete database of the chess games and their evaluations can be downloaded from the page presenting this work on the author's website.\n\nMany prominent players and chess writers have offered their own rankings of players.\n\nIn 1964, Bobby Fischer listed his top 10 in \"Chessworld\" magazine: Morphy, Staunton, Steinitz, Tarrasch, Chigorin, Alekhine, Capablanca, Spassky, Tal, Reshevsky. He considered Morphy to be \"perhaps the most accurate\", writing: \"In a set match he would beat anyone alive today.\"\n\nIn 1970, Fischer named Morphy, Steinitz, Capablanca, Botvinnik, Petrosian, Tal, Spassky, Reshevsky, Svetozar Gligorić and Bent Larsen the greatest chess players in history.\n\nIn 1974, popular chess author Irving Chernev published an article titled \"Who were the greatest?\" in the English magazine CHESS. He followed this up with his 1976 book \"The Golden Dozen\", in which he ranked his all-time top twelve: 1. Capablanca, 2. Alekhine, 3. Lasker, 4. Fischer, 5. Botvinnik, 6. Petrosian, 7. Tal, 8. Smyslov, 9. Spassky, 10. Bronstein, 11. Rubinstein, and 12. Nimzowitsch.\n\nIn a 1992 interview GM Miguel Quinteros gave the opinion: \"I think Fischer was and still is the greatest chess player of all time. [...] During his absence other good chess players have appeared. But no one equals Fischer's talent and perfection.\"\n\nIn 2000, when Karpov, Korchnoi and Kasparov were still active, Anand listed his top 10 as: Fischer, Morphy, Lasker, Capablanca, Steinitz, Tal, Korchnoi, Keres, Karpov and Kasparov.\n\nWhen interviewed in 2008 shortly after Fischer's death, he ranked Fischer and Kasparov as the greatest, with Kasparov a little ahead by virtue of being on top for so many years.\n\nIn 2012, Anand stated that he considered Fischer the best player and also the greatest, because of the hurdles he faced.\n\nSvetozar Gligorić reported in his book \"Shall We Play Fischerandom Chess?\"  (Batsford, 2002):At the beginning of 2001 a large poll for the \"Ten Greatest Chess Players of the 20th Century, selected by \"Chess Informant\" readers\" resulted in Fischer having the highest percentage of votes and finishing as No. 1, ahead of Kasparov, Alekhine, Capablanca, Botvinnik, Karpov, Tal, Lasker, Anand and Korchnoi.\n\nBBC award-winning journalists, from their book \"Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time\"  (HarperCollins, 2004): Fischer, some will maintain, was \"the\" outstanding player in chess history, though there are powerful advocates too for Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, and Kasparov. Many chess players will dismiss such comparisons as meaningless, akin to the futile attempt to grade the supreme musicians of all time. But the manner in which Fischer stormed his way to Reykjavik, his breathtaking dominance at the Palma de Majorca Interzonal, the trouncings of Taimanov, Larsen, and Petrosian—all this was unprecedented. There never has been an era in modern chess during which one player has so overshadowed all others.\n\nIn a 2005 interview, Vladimir Kramnik (World Champion from 2000 to 2007) did not name a greatest player, but stated, \"The other world champions had something 'missing'. I can't say the same about Kasparov: he can do everything.\"\n\nIn an interview in 2011, Vladimir Kramnik said about Anand: \"I always considered him to be a colossal talent, one of the greatest in the whole history of chess\", \"I think that in terms of play Anand is in no way weaker than Kasparov\", and \"In the last 5–6 years he's made a qualitative leap that's made it possible to consider him one of the great chess players\".\n\nIn his 2008 obituary of Bobby Fischer, Leonard Barden wrote that most experts ranked Kasparov as the best ever player, with probably Fischer second and Karpov third.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Levon Aronian stated that he considers Alexander Alekhine the best player of all time.\n\nIn a 2015 interview after the 8th round of the Sinquefield Cup, Levon Aronian stated that he considers Garry Kasparov the strongest player of all time.\n\nIn 2012, Magnus Carlsen said that Kasparov is the greatest player of all time, adding that while Fischer may have been better at his best, Kasparov remained at the top for much longer.\n\nIn December 2015, he repeated his great respect for both Fischer and Kasparov when he mentioned them several times in an interview, saying he would like to play against them at their peak performance. Also, he said he liked the style of play and games of Vladimir Kramnik. As the toughest opponent to beat at that time he named Levon Aronian.\n\nThe table below organises the world champions in order of championship wins. (For the purpose of this table, a successful defence counts as a win, even if the match was drawn.) The table is made more complicated by the split between the \"Classical\" and FIDE world titles between 1993 and 2006.\n"}
{"id": "1059728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1059728", "title": "Deathtrap (film)", "text": "Deathtrap (film)\n\nDeathtrap is a 1982 American thriller film based on Ira Levin's play of the same name, directed by Sidney Lumet from a screenplay by Levin and Jay Presson Allen, starring Michael Caine, Dyan Cannon and Christopher Reeve. Critics gave the film mostly favorable reviews while noting its plot similarities to Caine's 1972 film \"Sleuth\".\n\nFamed playwright Sidney Bruhl debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his opulent Long Island home and his wife Myra. Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is starving for a hit. He receives a manuscript of a play called \"Deathtrap\", written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers to be near-perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and is now asking for input on his play. Sidney tells Myra that the best idea he has had lately is to murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. Myra realizes that's he's not just talking idly.\n\nSidney invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from his plays, to discuss Clifford's play. Clifford arrives by train. Over the course of an evening, Myra tries desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners but to no avail. Sidney then attacks Clifford and strangles him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp, a minor celebrity staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house. Before she leaves, she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.\n\nAs Myra prepares for bed, she begins to come to terms with what Sidney has done. She heads downstairs for a drink but a sound spooks her and she flees back upstairs, suspecting an intruder. Sidney takes her back downstairs to prove that all is well and they return to the bedroom. The calm is broken when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out and she collapses and dies.\n\nSidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and joins Clifford. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. The previous few hours are revealed to be an elaborate ruse to kill Myra. Clifford moves in with Sidney and the two work together at a partner's desk. Sidney suffers from writer's block but Clifford busily types page after page of a new play that he suspiciously keeps under lock and key. While Clifford is out grocery shopping, Sidney tries to break into the drawer but fails to before Clifford returns home. He waits for Clifford to retrieve his play, then switches Clifford's manuscript with a fake.\n\nSidney is horrified to read that Clifford is using the true story of Myra's murder as the basis of a new play called \"Deathtrap\". He angrily confronts Clifford, who boasts about the play's potential and insists he will write it with or without Sidney's approval. Clifford offers to share the credit with Sidney, who comes to believe that Clifford is a sociopath. Sidney plays along with the collaboration on \"Deathtrap\" while he plots a solution. A few days later, Helga stops by, ostensibly for candles in anticipation of a predicted thunderstorm. Almost immediately after meeting Clifford, she warns Sidney that Clifford is the man in boots.\n\nSidney asks Clifford to arm himself with an axe to demonstrate a bit of stage business, then produces a gun. He intends to shoot Clifford, claim it was in self-defense and dispose of the \"Deathtrap\" manuscript. But Sidney finds his gun to be empty. Clifford had anticipated some such scheme from him and has loaded the bullets into a different gun. Clifford now intends to use Sidney's attempted betrayal-and-axe scheme in the play. He secures Sidney to a chair with manacles and tells him he is going to pack up and leave. He warns Sidney to not try to stop the production of the play.\n\nHowever, Clifford is unaware the manacles are trick shackles, once the property of Harry Houdini. Sidney easily releases himself, grabs a crossbow and incapacitates Clifford with a single shot. Before Sidney can dispose of the body, the storm hits with full force and plunges the scene into darkness. A flash of lightning illuminates the living room and a fleeting figure scurries through. It is Helga, thinking Sidney is in danger and coming to help.\n\nShe realizes that Sidney actually poses the threat and grabs a gun while Sidney finds a knife. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues. Clifford stumbles to his feet, grabs the axe and swings it at Sidney. In that moment, the scene transitions to a stage version of itself, with actors before a full house. The on-stage struggle culminates with \"Clifford\" stabbing \"Sidney\" and both dying, leaving \"Helga\" victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause, and at the back of the theatre stands an exultant Helga Ten Dorp, now the author of a hit Broadway play called \"Deathtrap\".\n\n\nReal-life film and theatre critics Stewart Klein, Jeffrey Lyons and Joel Siegel have cameo appearances as themselves.\n\n\"Deathtrap\" has an aggregate rating of 80% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews. Critic Roger Ebert gave it three stars, calling it \"a comic study of ancient and honorable human defects, including greed, envy, lust, pride, avarice, sloth, and falsehood.\" Ebert, along with Janet Maslin, and Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" noted the similarities to Caine's 1972 film \"Sleuth\", and similarities have subsequently been noted by film historians.\n\nCannon was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for \"Worst Supporting Actress\" for her performance. \"Mad Magazine\" parodied the film as \"Deathcrap\".\n\nThe kissing scene between Sidney and Clifford is not in the original play (although they are revealed to be lovers). In his book \"The Celluloid Closet\", gay film historian Vito Russo reports that Reeve said that the kiss was booed by preview audiences in Denver, Colorado, and estimated that a \"Time\" magazine report of the kiss spoiled a key plot element and cost the film $10 million in ticket sales. (The film earned more than $19 million at the box office.) In his book \"Murder Most Queer\" (2014), Jordan Schildcrout describes attending a screening at which an audience member screamed, \"No, Superman, don't do it!\" at the moment of the Caine-Reeve kiss. The controversy over the kiss inspired the Tom Smith song \"Two Guys Kissin' (Ruined My Life)\".\n\n\"Deathtrap\" was released on Region 1 DVD on July 27, 1999. It was re-released on November 8, 2003, as half of a two-pack with the Henry Winkler/Michael Keaton buddy film \"Night Shift\". Warner Home Video released \"Deathtrap\" on Blu-ray Disc on November 20, 2012, as part of the Warner Archive Collection.\n\n\n"}

It is located at the American Museum of Natural History, New York City. The equestrian statue depicts Theodore Roosevelt on horseback. Standing to either side of him are an American Indian and an African.\n\nIt was dedicated on October 27, 1940. Cast by Gorham Manufacturing Company, Providence, RI.\n\nThe inscription reads:<br>\n(On rear of sculpture:) <br>\nJ E FRASER SC 1939 <br>\n(On front of base:) <br>\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT<br>\n1858-1919<br> \n(On left side of base:)<br> \nGOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK<br>\n1899 1901 <br>\n(On right side of base:)<br> \nPRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES<br>\n1901 1909 signed\n\nThe sculpture was commissioned by the Roosevelt Memorial Association in the 1930s after Fraser had delivered his design for the Arts of Peace memorial in Washington D.C., which at the time was also in competition with this memorial as the chosen location. For \"Arts of Peace\", Fraser made a pair of statues of Pegasus depicting the themes \"Music and Harvest\", and \"Aspiration and Literature\". This equestrian monument should therefore be seen in that context, with Roosevelt mounted on Pegasus, though in fact he is \"in the garb of a hunter accompanied by two pedestrian guides representing America and Africa\". \n\nOddly that earlier design was executed more than a decade after this one was built in 1940, partly because of the failure of efforts to have a Roosevelt memorial placed in D.C. A compromise was reached in dedicating Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac river in 1932 \"within view of the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the Capitol and the White House\", and the memorial location was thereafter sought elsewhere.\n\nThe statue is placed at the entrance to the hall of dioramas dedicated to Carl Akeley who had accompanied Roosevelt on a year-long expedition to Africa. \n\nThe work was designed to fit in the neo-classical plans of Henry Bacon to house this hall. An earlier monument by Fraser dedicated to Roosevelt in Cuba in 1924 was also designed with Henry Bacon, and they both attended its dedication in Cuba.\n\nThe Akeley Hall of African Mammals features in the movie \"Night at the Museum\", with Robin Williams in the role of Teddy Roosevelt who comes alive from his perch atop a horse in one of the dioramas rather than from the statue outside.\n\nIn 1999 James Loewen argued in \"Lies Across America\" that the statue was erected when the museum was openly racist, and that the arrangement of the figures is meant to advocate white supremacy.\n\nDespite Loewen's and others' remarks about the statue, this equestrian statue was never the subject of public controversy in the 20th century. It was mentioned in the April 2017 TED talk \"Can Art Amend History?\" by artist and activist Titus Kaphar, discussing the choice of pose showing that \"Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there ...and on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking and on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking\" as a representation of white social hierarchy in America. After the Unite the Right rally due to the controversial removal of an equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee, this and many other equestrian statues across America also became the focus of attempts to clean up America's \"racist past\". This statue was defaced with red paint on the morning of October 26, 2017. A few hours later, a group claiming responsibility for the defilement stated that the statue embodied “patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler-colonialism.” In January 2018, \"The New York Times\" reported that despite the controversy, the government of New York City would not have the statue removed.\n"}
{"id": "286327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286327", "title": "Gutenberg Bible", "text": "Gutenberg Bible\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42) was the first major book printed using mass-produced movable metal type in Europe. It marked the start of the \"Gutenberg Revolution\" and the age of the printed book in the West. Widely praised for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities, the book has an iconic status. Written in Latin, the Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Vulgate, printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, in present-day Germany, in the 1450s. Since its publication, 49 copies (or substantial portions of copies) have survived, and they are considered to be among the most valuable books in the world, even though no complete copy has been sold since 1978.\n\nIn March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies.\n\nThe 36-line Bible, believed to be the second printed version of the Bible, is also sometimes referred to as a Gutenberg Bible, but is possibly the work of another printer.\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible, an edition of the Vulgate, contains the Latin version of both the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. It is mainly the work of Jerome who began his work on the translation in 380 AD, with emendations from the Parisian Bible tradition, and further divergences (the Paris Bible, one of many Bible translations in the Middle Ages, is also known as the \"Thirteenth-Century Bible\", \"Old French Bible\" or, in French, \"Bible du XIIIe siècle\").\n\nThe Bible was not Gutenberg's first work.\nPreparation of the Bible probably began soon after 1450, and the first finished copies were available in 1454 or 1455. It is not known exactly how long the Bible took to print. The first precisely datable printing is the Gutenberg's 31-line Indulgence which is known to already exist on 22 October 1454.\n\nGutenberg made three significant changes during the printing process. The first sheets were rubricated by being passed twice through the printing press, using black and then red ink. This was soon abandoned, with spaces being left for rubrication to be added by hand.\n\nSome time later, after more sheets had been printed, the number of lines per page was increased from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper. Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each. Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear. The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the interline spacing, rather than increasing the printed area of the page. Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed. The new sheets were all reset to 42 lines per page. Consequently, there are two distinct settings in folios 1-32 and 129-158 of volume I and folios 1-16 and 162 of volume II.\n\nThe most reliable information about the Bible's date comes from a letter. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on paper and the others on vellum. However, some books say that about 180 copies were printed and it took about three years to produce them.\n\nIn a legal paper, written after completion of the Bible, Johannes Gutenberg refers to the process as \"Das Werk der Bücher\" (“the work of the books”). He had copied the technology of the printing press and was the first European to print with movable type, but his greatest achievement was arguably demonstrating that the process of printing actually produced books.\n\nMany book-lovers have commented on the high standards achieved in the production of the Gutenberg Bible, some describing it as one of the most beautiful books ever printed. The quality of both the ink and other materials and the printing itself have been noted.\n\nThe paper size is 'double folio', with two pages printed on each side (four pages per sheet). After printing the paper was folded once to the size of a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (10 leaves, or 20 printed pages) were combined to a single physical section, called a quinternion, that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as 12 leaves. Some sections may have been printed in a larger number, especially those printed later in the publishing process, and sold unbound. The pages were not numbered. The technique was not new, since it had been used to make blank \"white-paper\" books to be written afterwards. What was new was determining \"beforehand\" the correct placement and orientation of each page on the five sheets to result in the correct sequence when bound. The technique for locating the printed area correctly on each page was also new.\n\nThe 42-line Bible was printed on the size of paper known as 'Royal'. A full sheet of Royal paper measures 42 x 60 centimetres and a single untrimmed folio leaf measures 42 x 30 cm. There have been attempts to claim that the book was printed on larger paper measuring 30.7 x 44.5 cm, but this assertion is contradicted by the dimensions of existing copies. For example, the leaves of the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, measure 40 × 28.6 cm. This is typical of other folio Bibles printed on Royal paper in the fifteenth century. Most fifteenth-century printing papers have a width-to-height ratio of 1:1.4 (e.g. 30:42 cm) which is mathematically a ratio of 1 to the square root of 2. Man suggests that this ratio was chosen to match the so-called Golden Ratio of 1:1.6; in fact the ratios are not at all similar (a difference of about 12%). The ratio of 1:1.4 was a long established one for medieval paper sizes.\nA single complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible has 1,286 pages (usually bound in two volumes); with four pages per folio-sheet, 322 sheets of paper are required per copy. The handmade paper used by Gutenberg was of fine quality and was imported from Italy. Each sheet contains a watermark left by the paper mold.\n\nIn Gutenberg's time, inks used by scribes to produce manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg developed an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but also had a high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating. Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: \"if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see this is a very shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, you put your pen into it and it runs off. Now if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface.\"\n\nThe first part of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved character to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.\n\nEach unique character requires a master piece of type in order to be replicated. Given that each letter has uppercase and lowercase forms, and the number of various punctuation marks and ligatures (e.g. the character 'ﬁ', commonly used in writing) the Gutenberg Bible needed a set of 290 master characters. It seems probable that six pages, containing 15600 characters altogether, would be set at any one moment.\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible is printed in the blackletter type styles that would become known as Textualis (Textura) and Schwabacher. The name texture refers to the texture of the printed page: straight vertical strokes combined with horizontal lines, giving the impression of a woven structure. Gutenberg already used the technique of justification, that is, creating a vertical, not indented, alignment at the left and right-hand sides of the column. To do this, he used various methods, including using characters of narrower widths, adding extra spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces around words. He also let the punctuation marks go beyond the vertical line using hanging punctuation, which was used to make the justification of the massive black characters stronger to the eye.\n\nInitially the rubrics — the headings before each book of the Bible — were printed, but this practice was quickly abandoned, and gaps were left for rubrication to be added by hand. A guide of the text to be added to each page, printed for use by rubricators, survives.\n\nThe spacious margin allowed illuminated decoration to be added by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on as far away as London. The vellum Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.\n\nThere has been speculation that the \"Master of the Playing Cards,\" an unidentified engraver who has been called \"the first personality in the history of engraving,\" was partly responsible for the illumination of the copy held by the Princeton University library. However, all that can be said for certain is that the same model book was used for some of the illustrations in this copy and for some of the Master's illustrated playing cards.\n\nAlthough many Gutenberg Bibles have been rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century bindings. Most of these copies were bound in either Mainz or Erfurt. Most copies were divided into two volumes, the first volume ending with The Book of Psalms. Copies on vellum were heavier and for this reason were sometimes bound in three or four volumes.\n\nThe Bible seems to have sold out immediately, with initial sales to owners as far away as England and possibly Sweden and Hungary. At least some copies are known to have sold for 30 florins – about three years' wages for a clerk. Although this made them significantly cheaper than manuscript Bibles, most students, priests or other people of ordinary income wouldn't have been able to afford them. It is assumed that most were sold to monasteries, universities and particularly wealthy individuals. At present only one copy is known to have been privately owned in the fifteenth century. Some are known to have been used for communal readings in monastery refectories; others may have been for display rather than use, and a few were certainly used for study. Kristian Jensen suggests that many copies were bought by wealthy and pious laypeople for donation to religious institutions.\n\nThe Gutenberg Bible had a profound effect on the history of the printed book. Textually, it also had an influence on future editions of the Bible. It provided the model for several later editions, including the 36 Line Bible, Mentelin's Latin Bible, and the first and third Eggestein Bibles. The third Eggestein Bible was set from the copy of the Gutenberg Bible now in Cambridge University Library. The Gutenberg Bible also had an influence on the Clementine edition of the Vulgate commissioned by the Papacy in the late sixteenth century.\n\nJoseph Martini, a New York book dealer, found that the Gutenberg Bible held by the library of the General Theological Seminary in New York had a forged leaf, carrying part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel. It was impossible to tell when the leaf had been inserted into the volume. It was replaced in the fall of 1953, when a patron donated the corresponding leaf from a defective Gutenberg second volume which was being broken up and sold in parts. This made it \"the first imperfect Gutenberg Bible ever restored to completeness.\" In 1978, this copy was sold for $2.2 million USD to the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nAs of 2009, 49 Gutenberg Bibles are known to exist, but of these only 21 are complete. Others have pages or even whole volumes missing. In addition, there are a substantial number of fragments, some as small as individual leaves, which are likely to represent about another 16 copies. Many of these fragments have survived because they were used as part of the binding of later books. There are 12 surviving copies on vellum, although only four of these are complete and one is of the New Testament only.\n\nCopy numbers listed below are as found in the Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, taken from a 1985 survey of existing copies by Ilona Hubay; the two copies in Russia were not known to exist in 1985, and therefore were not catalogued.\nToday, few copies remain in religious institutions, with most now owned by university libraries and other major scholarly institutions. After centuries in which all copies seem to have remained in Europe, the first Gutenberg Bible reached North America in 1847. It is now in the New York Public Library. In the last hundred years, several long-lost copies have come to light, considerably improving the understanding of how the Bible was produced and distributed.\n\nIn 1921 a New York rare book dealer, Gabriel Wells, bought a damaged paper copy, dismantled the book and sold sections and individual leaves to book collectors and libraries. The leaves were sold in a portfolio case with an essay written by A. Edward Newton, and were referred to as \"Noble Fragments\". In 1953 Charles Scribner's Sons, also book dealers in New York, dismembered a paper copy of volume II. The largest portion of this, the New Testament, is now owned by Indiana University. The matching first volume of this copy was subsequently discovered in Mons, Belgium.\n\nThe only copy held outside Europe or North America is the first volume of a Gutenberg Bible (Hubay 45) at Keio University in Tokyo. The Humanities Media Interface Project (HUMI) at Keio University is known for its high-quality digital images of Gutenberg Bibles and other rare books. Under the direction of Professor Toshiyuki Takamiya, the HUMI team has made digital reproductions of 11 sets of the bible in nine institutions, including both full-text facsimiles held in the collection of the British Library.\n\nThe last sale of a complete Gutenberg Bible took place in 1978, which sold for $2.2 million. This copy is now in Stuttgart. The price of a complete copy today is estimated at $25−35 million. Individual leaves now sell for $50,000–$150,000, depending upon condition and the desirability of the page. Eight leaves (Book of Esther) from the fragment owned by the Collection of the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York were sold in June 2015 by Sotheby's for $970,000.\n\nA two-volume paper edition of the Gutenberg Bible was stolen from Moscow State University in 2009 and subsequently recovered in a FSB sting operation in 2013. This particular copy had been looted by the Soviet Army after World War II from the Library of the University of Leipzig, Germany, and was estimated to be worth in excess of $20.4 million.\n\n\n\n"}

Responses to the \"Lineamenta\" are sent to the General Secretariat, who then organizes the submissions to determine the primary discussion points of the assembly. He then drafts the \"instrumentum laboris\" as a guide to the discussion, incorporating the input received from the \"Lineamenta\" along with the teachings of the Church on the subject and any other relevant material. The document is then approved by the Pope, translated as necessary, and sent to the bishops assembled for the Synod.

{"id": "23552323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23552323", "title": "International Cloud Atlas", "text": "International Cloud Atlas\n\nInternational Cloud Atlas (also Cloud Atlas) is a cloud atlas that was first published in 1896 and has remained in print since then. Its initial purposes included aiding the training of meteorologists and promoting more consistent use of vocabulary describing clouds, which were both important for early weather forecasting. The first edition featured color plates of color photographs, then still a very new technology, but noted for being inexpensive. Numerous later editions have been published.\n\nPublication of the first edition was arranged by Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, Albert Riggenbach, and Léon Teisserenc de Bort, members of the Clouds Commission of the International Meteorological Committee aka International Meteorological Organization (now the World Meteorological Organization). It consists of color plates of clouds, and text in English, French, and German. Consequently, it had separate title pages in each language and is known also by its alternate titles Atlas international des nuages and Internationaler Wolkenatlas. These were selected by the Clouds Commission, which also included Julius von Hann, Henrik Mohn, and Abbott Lawrence Rotch.\n\nThe first edition featured printed color plates, rather than hand-colored plates. Most of the plates were color photographs, but also some paintings. A cirrus cloud was the first type of cloud illustrated, from a color photograph. At the time, color photography was new, complicated, and expensive. Consequently, the Clouds Commission was unable to obtain suitable color photographs of all the cloud types, and they selected paintings to use as substitutes.\n\nThe first edition was inspired in part by the observation of the English meteorologist Ralph Abercromby that clouds were of the same general kinds everywhere in the world. Abercromby and Hildebrandsson developed a new classification of clouds that was published in an earlier atlas, the 1890 \"Cloud Atlas\" by Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, Wladimir Köppen, and Georg von Neumayer. Other, similar works published prior to this were M. Weilbach's \"Nordeuropas Sky-former\" (Copenhagen, 1881), M. Singer's \"Wolkentafeln\" (Munich, 1892), \"Classificazione delle nubi\" by the Specola Vaticana (Rome, 1893), and the Rev. W. Clement Ley's \"Cloudland\" (London, 1894).\n\n\"International Cloud Atlas\" has been published in multiple editions since 1896, including 1911, 1932, 1939, 1956, 1975, 1987 and 2017. The 1932 edition was titled \" International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky\". It was published in Catalan (\"Atles Internacional dels Núvols i dels Estats del cel\") besides the three International Meteorological Organization official languages (English, French and German) because Mr. Rafel Patxot\n\n, a member of the scientific committee that collaborated with the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, sponsored the whole publication.\nThe 1939 edition modified the title to \" International Atlas of Clouds and Types of Skies\". The 1956 edition was the first published in two volumes, separating text and plates. This lowered costs and facilitated the publication of translated editions. It was translated into Polish in 1959 (\"Międzynarodowy atlas chmur; atlas skrócony\") and Norwegian in 1958 (\"Internasjonalt skyatlas 1956\"). A Dutch translation was published in 1967 (\"Wolkenatlas. Bewerkt naar de Internationale verkorte wolkenatlas van de Meteorologische Wereldorganisatie\").\n\nThe 1975 edition was published in two volumes 12 years apart: Volume I (text) in 1975 and Volume II (plates) in 1987. Its innovations included a new chapter describing clouds from above, as from aircraft. Also, the former classification of hydrometeors was replaced by a classification of meteors, in which the hydrometeors are one group:\n\nThe 2017 edition of the International Cloud Atlas has added 12 new cloud formations - one new species, five new supplemental features, one new accessory cloud type, and five new special clouds. The 2017 edition of the atlas is available online. Its additions comprised the following:\nParticular phenomena were given official cloud names by the WMO in 2017:\n\nOne reviewer of the 1896 edition noted that \"The illustrations are beautifully colored, and quite apart from its great value to meteorology, the 'Cloud Atlas' is well worth owning for the beauty of the illustrations alone.\"\n\nThe following year, a derivative cloud atlas was published in the United States through the Government Printing Office, titled \"Illustrative cloud forms for the guidance of observers in the classification of clouds\". A reviewer noted \"We are not sure that it is desirable that there should be several cloud atlases in existence concurrently; but, probably, administrative difficulties would be raised if in any country copies of the \"International Cloud Atlas\" were purchased sufficient in number to supply an entire navy. This, probably, is the reason for the appearance of the present artistic little volume.\" It copied the \"International Cloud Atlas\", except that it substituted color lithographs.\n\nThe \"International Cloud Atlas\" was revised numerous times in response to requirements of its principal user community, meteorologists. Nonetheless, it was not sufficient for all users, and consequently a number of other cloud atlases and critiques have been published. A 1901 popular German book about the weather reproduced photographs from the \"International Cloud Atlas\", and one reviewer of the 1901 book judged these reproductions to be its best feature. \"Atlas photographique des Nuages\", a 1912 cloud atlas of grayscale photographs, was praised for its sharp photographs but criticized for not following the International Cloud Classification. The 1923 book, \"A Cloud Atlas\", despite its title is not a cloud atlas. The author, the American meteorologist Alexander George McAdie, then director of the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, advocated a classification of clouds that was not typological but rather predictive: a classification that did not merely describe what was before the observer. As McAdie put it, \"when we look at a cloud we want to know, not what it resembles, but whether it portends fair or foul weather.\" The book is a discussion of what characteristics of clouds such a classification might take into account.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1340538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1340538", "title": "Israel Museum", "text": "Israel Museum\n\nThe Israel Museum (, \"Muze'on Yisrael\") was established in 1965 as Israel's national museum. It is situated on a hill in the Givat Ram neighborhood of Jerusalem, adjacent to the Bible Lands Museum, the Knesset, the Israeli Supreme Court, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nAmong the unique objects on display are the Venus of Berekhat Ram; the interior of a 1736 Zedek ve Shalom synagogue from Suriname; necklaces worn by Jewish brides in Yemen; a mosaic Islamic prayer niche from 17th-century Persia; and a nail attesting to the practice of crucifixion in Jesus’ time. An urn-shaped building on the grounds of the museum, the Shrine of the Book, houses the Dead Sea Scrolls and artifacts discovered at Masada. It is one of the largest museums in the region.\n\nJerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek was the driving spirit behind the establishment of the Israel Museum, one of the leading art and archaeology museums in the world. The Museum houses works dating from prehistory to the present day in its Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Jewish Art and Life Wings, and features extensive holdings of biblical and Land of Israel archaeology. Since its establishment in 1965, the Museum has built up a collection of nearly 500,000 objects, representing a broad sample of world material culture.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, Prof. Ido Bruno was appointed Director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as the Anne and Jerome Fisher Director. Bruno served as a professor in the Industrial Design Department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts & Design, Jerusalem. He brings to the position decades of experience as a curator and designer of exhibitions presented in Israel and across the world with a focus on art, archeology, science, and history. He was unanimously elected by the Museum's Board of Directors, chaired by Isaac Molho, following an extensive search and review process of candidates from Israel and abroad. Bruno assumed his position at the Museum in November 2017.\n\nJames S. Snyder, former Deputy Director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was appointed director of the museum in 1997.\n\nFrom 1965, the museum was housed in a series of masonry buildings designed by the Russian-born Israeli architect Alfred Mansfeld. A $100-million campaign to renovate the museum and double its gallery space was completed by Israeli architects Efrat-Kowalsky Architects who renovated the existing buildings in July 2010. The wings for archaeology, the fine arts, and Jewish art and life were completely rebuilt and the original buildings were linked through a new entrance pavilion. The passageways that connect between the buildings and five new pavilions were designed by James Carpenter. \n\nThe museum covers nearly 50,000 sq. meters and attracts 800,000 visitors a year, including 100,000 children who visit and attend classes in its Youth Wing.\n\nThe Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Archaeology Wing tells the story of the ancient Land of Israel, home to peoples of different cultures and faiths, using unique examples from the Museum's collection of Holy Land archaeology, the foremost holding in the world. Organized chronologically, from prehistory through the Ottoman Empire, the transformed wing presents seven “chapters” of this archaeological narrative, weaving together momentous historical events, cultural achievements, and technological advances, while providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of the peoples of the region. This narrative is supplemented by thematic groupings highlighting aspects of ancient Israeli archaeology that are unique to the region's history, among them Hebrew writing, glass, and coins. Treasures from neighboring cultures that have had a decisive impact on the Land of Israel – such as Egypt, the Near East, Greece and Italy, and the Islamic world – are on view in adjacent and connecting galleries. A special gallery at the entrance to the wing showcases new findings and other temporary exhibition displays.\n\nHighlights on view include: Pilate Stone, \"House of David” inscription (9th century BCE), A comparative display of two shrines (8th–7th century BCE), The Heliodorus Stele (178 BCE), Royal Herodian bathhouse (1st century BCE), Hadrian’s Triumph: Inscription from a triumphal arch (136 CE), the Mosaic of Rehob (3rd century CE) and Gold-glass bases from the Roman Catacombs (4th century CE), the Ossuary of Jesus son of Joseph.\n\nThe Shrine of the Book houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest biblical manuscripts in the world, as well as rare early medieval biblical manuscripts. The scrolls were discovered in 1947–56 in 11 caves in and around the Wadi Qumran. An elaborate planning process of seven years led to the building's eventual construction in 1965 which was funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, the Hungarian émigré, the philanthropist who had purchased the scrolls as a gift to the State of Israel.\n\nThe building consists of a white dome over a building located two-thirds below the ground. The dome is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. The colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the \"War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness\", whereas the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness. The interior of the shrine was designed to depict the environment in which the scrolls were found. There is also a permanent display on life in the Qumran, where the scrolls were written. The entire structure was designed to resemble a pot in which the scrolls were found. The shrine was designed by Armand Bartos and Frederick Kiesler, and was opened in 1965.\n\nAs the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it \"rests\" from exposure. The museum also holds other rare ancient manuscripts and displays the Aleppo Codex, which is from the 10th-century and is believed to be the oldest Bible codex in Hebrew.\n\nAdjacent to the Shrine is the Model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, which reconstructs the topography and architectural character of the city as it was prior to its destruction by the Romans in 66 CE, and provides historical context to the Shrine's presentation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Originally constructed on the grounds of Jerusalem's Holyland Hotel, the model, which includes a replica of Herod's Temple, is now a permanent feature of the museum's campus.\n\nThe Edmond and Lily Safra Fine Arts Wing reflects the wide-ranging, interdisciplinary nature of the Museum's collections, encompassing works of art from across the ages in Western and non-Western cultures. The wing has been reorganized to highlight connections among works from its diverse curatorial collections, which include: European Art; Modern Art; Contemporary Art; Israeli Art; the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; Asian Art; Photography; Design and Architecture; and Prints and Drawings. Installations are organized to underscore visual affinities and shared themes and to inspire new insight into the arts of different times and places, as well as an appreciation of the common threads of human culture. The reconfigured wing includes the Museum's first permanent galleries for Israeli art; more than doubled gallery space for the Museum's extensive collections in modern art; providing meaningful connecting points between Western and non-Western holdings; and a full 2,200-square-meter (7,200-square-foot) gallery floor devoted to changing displays from the Museum's collection of contemporary art.\n\nHighlights newly on view include: The Noel and Harriette Levine Photography Collection, The Jacques Lipchitz Collection, Gustave Courbet, Jura Landscape with Shepherd and Donkey (ca. 1866), Alberto Giacometti, Alfred Barye, Diego in the Studio (1952), Ohad Meromi, The Boy from South Tel Aviv (2001).\n\nThe Israel Museum holds a large collection of paintings representing a wide range of periods, styles, subjects, and regions of origin. Painters in the collection include such international figures as Rembrandt and Camille Pissarro as well as such Israeli and Jewish artists as Marc Chagall, Abel Pann, and Reuven Rubin.\n\nThe Israel Museum's commitment to Israeli art is central to the Museum's mission. As Israel's national museum, it plays a major role in preserving Israel's artistic heritage by collecting works by Israeli artists - in Israel and abroad - and by encouraging Israel's artists to develop in their careers. The Museum's Israeli Art collection spans the late 19th century through today, and it reflects the evolution of Israel's cultural history in the visual arts. The Information Center for Israeli Art provides scholars and the public with comprehensive archival information on several thousand Israeli artists, including biographical notes, press materials, videos, photographs, and other forms of documentation.\n\nThe holdings of the \"Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life\" represent the religious and secular material culture of Jewish communities worldwide, spanning centuries from the Middle Ages to the present day. The collection reflects the depth and beauty of Jewish heritage and creativity as well as the aesthetic and stylistic influences of other cultures in places where Jews lived.\n\nThe origins of the collection can be traced to the early twentieth century with the establishment of the Bezalel National Museum under the directorship of Mordechai Narkiss, who expanded significantly the collection of ritual art objects through important treasures rescued between the two world wars and after the Holocaust. Later on, this treasure was integrated in the newly established Israel Museum in 1965 into the departments of Jewish Art and of Jewish Ethnography. In 1995 they were united into a new independent wing. \nOver the years the Wing's holdings have been strengthened through gifts and acquisitions of individual objects; gift of private collections; and fieldwork within communities in Israel and abroad. The Wing's prominent collections are the Stieglitz Collection and the Feuchtwanger Collection for Jewish ritual objects, Torah scroll ornaments, and life cycle objects, as well as the Schulmann Collection and Rathjens Collection for North African and Yemenite material culture, dress, jewelry and ritual objects.\n\nThe wing's collection contains many unique treasures, among them, are rare manuscripts, four reconstructed synagogue interiors, a wide variety of ceremonial and ritual objects, as well as diverse material culture including dress, jewelry, and everyday artifacts. \nIn the new permanent display, important objects drawn from this extensive collection from the public and the private realm, are integrated into a multifaceted narrative. This comparative display explores the objects’ history and the social context in which they were used while underscoring their aesthetic qualities and emotional resonance. It reflects a vivid cultural tapestry weaving together the individual and the communal, the sacred and the mundane, the heritage of the past and the creative innovations of the present.\n\nFive principal themes unfold as you walk through the galleries:\n\nThe Information Center has a research library and a unique archival collection, constantly growing, of some twenty thousand photographs. Many of them are extremely rare, documenting the daily life of Jewish communities around the world, some no longer exist, including images of synagogues, cemeteries, ceremonial objects and many other subjects.\n\nThe information center offers access to resources of the collections as well as virtual tours in former exhibitions in order to broaden and deepen knowledge behind the objects in the Wing's collections.\n\nThe Billy Rose Art Garden is a 20-dunam garden featuring modern and abstract sculptures. The Art Garden, designed for the original campus by Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, is counted among the finest outdoor sculpture settings of the 20th century. An Oriental landscape combined with an ancient Jerusalem hillside, the garden serves as the backdrop for the Israel Museum's display of the evolution of the modern western sculptural tradition. On view are works by modern masters including Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Moore, Claes Oldenburg, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, and David Smith, together with more recent site-specific commissions by such artists as Magdalena Abakanowicz, Mark Dion, James Turrell, and Micha Ullman.\n\nThe Ruth Youth Wing for Art Education was opened in 1966. It is unique in its size and scope of activities, presents a wide range of programming to more than 100,000 schoolchildren each year, and features exhibition galleries, art studios, classrooms, a library of illustrated children's books, and a recycling room. Special programs foster intercultural understanding between Arab and Jewish students and reach out to the wide spectrum of Israel's communities. The wing combines annual original artworks of Israeli and international artists, with educational activities. There are also a variety of workshops for children and adults.\n\nIn addition to the extensive programming offered on its main campus, the Israel Museum also operates two off-site locations: the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum that opened in 1938 for the display of artifacts unearthed mainly in the excavations conducted in Mandatory Palestine, in the 1920s and 1930s; and Ticho House, which offers an ongoing program of exhibitions by younger Israeli artists in a historic house and garden setting.\n\nThe Israel Museum receives only 10% to 12% of its operating budget from state and municipal sources. The Israeli government provides varying amounts of funds each year. The institution must raise 88% of its yearly operating budget, all of its $200 million endowment and $100 million for its recent capital project, while paying 17.5% VAT as well as real-estate taxes on the campus property.\n\nThe most active of the international support groups of the museum, the American Friends of the Israel Museum raised $270 million in cash, of which $47 million is in endowment funds, and donated $210 million in the art from 1972 to 2008. In 2009, the Israel Museum received $12 million from the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, towards the renovation, reinstallation, and endowment of its fine arts wing, which will be renamed after Edmond and Lily Safra.\n\nAs of 2012, attendance is about 827,000 per year.\n\nAmong the prizes awarded by the museum is the \"Jesselson Prize for Contemporary Judaica Design,\" which recognizes outstanding design of Jewish ritual objects. Winners include Moshe Zabari (1990).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2526110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2526110", "title": "John Ausonius", "text": "John Ausonius\n\nJohn Wolfgang Alexander Ausonius (born Wolfgang Alexander Zaugg, 12 July 1953), known in the media as Lasermannen (\"the Laser Man\"), is a Swedish convicted murderer, bank robber, and attempted serial killer. From August 1991 to January 1992 he shot eleven people in the Stockholm and Uppsala area, most of whom were immigrants, killing one and seriously injuring the others. He first used a rifle equipped with a laser sight (hence, his nickname), and later switched to a revolver. He was arrested in June 1992 and sentenced to life imprisonment in January 1994.\n\nAusonius was born Wolfgang Alexander Zaugg in Lidingö, northeast of Stockholm, Sweden. He is the son of a Swiss father and a German mother, both of whom had emigrated to Sweden. He grew up in Vällingby, a working class suburb of Stockholm. According to newspaper reports, he was bullied as a child because of his non-Swedish background, which manifested in him being teased for having very black hair and brown eyes. As an adult, he bleached his hair blonde, used blue contact lenses and legally changed his name. Initially, he changed his name to John Wolfgang Alexander Stannerman, and later to John Wolfgang Alexander Ausonius. He went to the German School in Stockholm, a private school, but dropped out before graduating. He later completed his secondary school education in an adult education programme. Ausonius was accepted into the Royal Institute of Technology, but dropped out after a couple of years of unsuccessful study.\n\nIn 1986, following the Olof Palme assassination, Ausonius, then named John Stannerman, was one of the police's initial suspects. However, Stannerman could not be linked to the murder as he was incarcerated at the time, serving a sentence for multiple counts of assault committed. In prison he became an acquaintance of Miro Barešić, a member of Croatian National Resistance, a Croatian émigré anti-communist organization created by members of the fascist Ustaše movement. Barešić was imprisoned for the 1971 murder of Vladimir Rolović, the Yugoslav ambassador to Sweden.\n\nAusonius developed a hatred for Communists, Social Democrats, and immigrants while fostering an ambition of gaining wealth. He worked a low-paying job as a taxi driver, but later started trading in stocks and bonds. His talent for the market quickly earned him a fairly large fortune resulting him adopting the yuppie lifestyle. By the late 1980s he owned a luxurious apartment, a Toyota Supra (rather than owning a Porsche, which many other yuppies drove at that time, as he despised the company), and a mobile phone (before the 1990s, such a device was a luxury item usually associated with a jet-set lifestyle). However, poorly chosen investments depleted his fortune. This was further aggravated by an addiction to gambling. As a result of the latter, during a trip to Germany he found himself in dire economic circumstances. With funds running out, Ausonius turned to bank robbing to maintain his lifestyle. He performed more than eighteen robberies, largely in identical fashion.\n\nIn 1979, Ausonius became a Swedish citizen. He had a strong hatred for immigrants and foreigners. These beliefs led him to start looking for immigrant criminals to kill. Eventually, he was tired of this and decided to simply kill any immigrant. He hoped that this way, he would scare all immigrants out of Sweden.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1982, Ausonius served in the Swedish army and thus learnt how to use weapons. However, his personal weapons were of poor quality, very likely because Ausonius had modified them. He sawed off the barrel and the stock of his first rifle to make it shorter, and he fitted the Smith & Wesson revolver with a silencer. This modification may have been the key to his failures in killing most of his victims as it deviated the bullet's trajectory and consequently caused him to miss his victims. It was amateurishly done and damaged the weapon's performance.\n\n\nBetween the first and second wave of shooting, Ausonius took a trip to the United States. He visited Las Vegas, to gamble and see the Grand Canyon. He then returned to Sweden.\n\n\nThe police started a massive manhunt (second in size only to the hunt for Olof Palme's killer). On 12 June 1992, during a bank robbery, Ausonius was arrested. He later assaulted his own lawyer in court and spent the rest of his trial in handcuffs. He was convicted of murder and robbery, but could not be linked to all of the shootings (although he confessed to all of them in 2000). He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was later incarcerated at the Kumla Prison. In June 2012, he was transferred to the Österåker Prison.\n\nAusonius has applied to have his life sentence commuted to a fixed term on three occasions, in 2008, 2010, and 2012. The court has rejected his application on all occasions. On 2 November 2012, his third appeal was rejected by the Örebro District Court. On all three occasions the National Board of Forensic Medicine determined that there was a risk that Ausonius would reoffend due to his autism and personality disorder, which the court took into consideration when making its decision.\n\nIn 2016 Ausonius was extradited to Germany to face trial for the 23 February 1992 murder in Frankfurt of Blanka Zmigrod, a 68-year-old Holocaust survivor. While investigating, German police looked into ties to far-right terror group National Socialist Underground. On 21 February 2018 he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany, also. Prosecutors had charged him with stealing her handbag after killing her because he thought she had taken an electronic device that he used to save his bank account numbers.\n\nThe journalist Gellert Tamas wrote a book about the case, \"Lasermannen - en berättelse om Sverige\" (2002), which became a bestseller. The book, which is very detailed, was published without consulting the victims first. The author's personal opinions not only deal with Ausonius and his life story, but also with Sweden in general, speculating that his actions were in part explained by a surge of xenophobic sentiments in the country in the early 1990s, including the success of the Ny Demokrati right-wing party in the election. According to Tamas, it could also be one of many attempts by Ausonius to prove his identity as a \"true Swedish man\" by separating himself from immigrants.\n\nIn 2005, the book was adapted into a play, and the same year SVT produced a three-part TV miniseries, which premiered on 23 November. Ausonius was played by David Dencik.\n\nIn late April 2006, the daily \"Aftonbladet\" revealed that John Ausonius had become engaged to an anonymous 23-year-old woman, who had fallen in love with him after having seen a recent television miniseries. According to the paper, a friend of the woman said the couple were planning to move abroad after Ausonius' putative release from prison by 2031. The couple is no longer together.\n\n"}

The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions are excluded from the rankings but their \"Interim\" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.\n\nIn addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the TBRB and \"The Ring\" each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and \"The Ring\" is to crown a single champion for each division.

{"id": "38232092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38232092", "title": "New exit for the Uffizi Gallery", "text": "New exit for the Uffizi Gallery\n\nThe New Exit for the Uffizi Gallery (), designed by architects Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei, was the project that won the closed international design competition launched in 1998 with the purpose of expanding the museum's exhibition space and creating a grand exit. Many world-renowned architects participated, among whom were: Mario Botta, Norman Foster, Gae Aulenti, Hans Hollein and Vittorio Gregotti. As part of the Grandi Uffizi initiative, a 60 million euro renovation and development project for the overall museum, the loggia's construction became a controversial subject for Florentines and thus has been at a standstill since its original scheduled completion date of 2003. The project was envisioned as a large steel and stone loggia that would echo its counterpart, the Loggia dei Lanzi on Piazza della Signoria. While at the same time, it would comment on the precarious balance that exists between tradition and modernity in a context that seldom sees large architectural change.\n\nLoggia are common and prominent public structures in Florence; to cite two examples, Loggia dei Lanzi, or the Loggia del Grano. For the final proposal at the competition, the architect Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei replicate this traditional form for both its historic but also functional aspects: providing cover and protection from the elements when necessary yet also establishing a new public reference point for Florentine people. The light trapezoidal cover of the loggia, narrows where it connects to the museum, and references, according to the architects, brunelleschian themes from Renaissance. The structure intended to allow the public to interact with the city by providing not only necessary programme and space for the museum's expansion, but to allow for a constant flow of people through a neglected space within the current fabric of the city. In 1990, a design for the exit had already been proposed before the competition. The project by Giovanni Michelucci consisted primarily of a glass prism that would lead people out; it would become a landmark to decorate the back of Giorgio Vasari's famous structure. Though never realized, this endeavor became a forerunner to the competition of 1998.\n\nThe proposal for the building was designed as a structure with limited connection to the ground. The use of a historic typology to define the form was an aesthetic choice the competition judges appreciated and awarded. A tall fan-shaped structure, large enough to span the entire slanted site, would be made principally of steel, pietra serena and glass. The new exit was created not to compete with the existing grand entrance, or to deviate visitors from the main promenade through the museum. Instead it was focused on revitalizing the area by Piazza Castellani, which had become an afterthought.\n\nThe loggia was designed as a piece that would settle amongst the existing buildings, yet stand in contrast as a modernist addition to the city. The simplicity allowed the architects to create a continuous space, one that would blur the interior with the exterior. Pietra serena was chosen to pave the ground of the exterior sloping plane and outdoor areas, visually merging the space. The canopy was composed of a series of horizontal beams, arranged in a radial manner within a trapezoidal frame. Covered with glass panels, the Tuscan sunlight would filter through the space creating interesting shadows as the sun traversed the sky. Four thick columns support the large horizontal plane, and serve to highlight the existing beauty of Giorgio Vasari's windows, which were not altered in the architect's proposition. The back columns are connected to a stone block that covers the exits, but manages at the same time, to highlight the back facade of the existing building. The areas below the ramp, of approximately 300 square meters, would be designated to the museum's extension, principally in the form of storage. The slope of the site, an important historic element was extended in order to connect the existing Vicolo dell'Oro street and the network of smaller passageways with Via dei Leoni. At the center of the space, the architects decided to place four of the Uffizi's sculptures on pedestals matching the exit sequence at the back.\n\nThe new intervention intended to create an interesting reciprocity between the new structure and that of the Loggia del Grano (its historic complement that dominates the corner across the street)and \"become an instrument for the museum to communicate with the city\".\n\nThe project for the new exit of the museum continues to be a sensitive subject for Florentines. The project has been at a stand-still since 2003 when it was originally intended to be unveiled. The debate over the loggia became both a political argument as well as an aesthetic one. Ruins below the Uffizi were discovered not long after excavations began which made the project even harder to realize due to strict preservation policies. Today, the debate continues to divide the city in two, those who support the project and those that stand against it. The new changes within the Uffizi building have made the realization of the modern loggia even less of a possibility; thus creating what the media has coined as a \"cultural wound\". However, even to this day appeals are continuously made by groups of architects, artists and art collectors to build the project. All in the hope of introducing a modern project amidst the grandiose historic buildings of Florence's core.\n\n"}

In Ireland and Scotland, \"the Feile na Marbh\", (the “festival of the dead”) took place on Samhain (Celtic New Year) The names Satia, NICNEVEN, Bensozie, Zobiana, Abundia, Herodiana, were all used to identify the Scottish Witch Goddess of Samhain. The use of the name for this meaning was first found in Montgomerie’s Flyting (c.1585) and was seemingly taken from a woman in Scotland condemned to death for witchcraft before being burnt at the stake as a witch. In the Borders the name for this archetype was Gyre-Carling whose name had variants such as Gyre-Carlin, Gy-Carling, Gay-Carlin amongst others. \"Gyre\" is possibly a cognate of the Norse word \"geri\" and thus having the meaning of \"greedy\" or it may be from the Norse \"gýgr\" meaning \"ogress\"; \"carling\" or \"carline\" is a Scots and Northern English word meaning \"old woman\" which is from, or related to, the Norse word \"kerling\" (of the same meaning).\n\nShe was sometimes thought of as the mother witch, Hecate, or Habundia figure of Scottish fairy mythology. This guise is frankly diabolical. Sir Walter Scott calls her:\n\nAlexander Montgomerie, in his \"Flyting\", described her as:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em\">\nNicnevin with her nymphes, in number anew\nWith charms from Caitness and Chanrie of Ross\nWhose cunning consists in casting a clew.</poem>\n\nEven so, the elder Nicnevin or Gyre-Carling retained the habit of night riding with an \"elrich\" entourage mounted on unlikely and supernatural steeds. Another, satirical popular depiction made her leave Scotland after a love-quarrel with her neighbour, to become wife of \"Mahomyte\" and queen of the \"Jowis\". She was an enemy of Christian people, and \"levit vpoun Christiane menis flesche\"; still, her absence caused dogs to stop barking and hens to stop laying. But in Fife, the Gyre-Carling was associated with spinning and knitting, like Habetrot; here it was believed to be unlucky to leave a piece of knitting unfinished at the New Year, lest the Gyre-Carling should steal it.\n\n"}

Erdrich, published by the MN Historical Society Press in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Heid E. Sherman is a member of the North Dakota Turtle Mountain Band of the Ojibwe people (and also half German) who is currently based in South Minneapolis. Her cookbook explores native american cuisine and indigenous ingredients, within a globally-aware framework that includes stories, recollections and anecdotes. \n\n\"Original Local\" grew out of the “locavore” movement—the push to buy and consume locally grown food. Heid noticed that, in all the enthusiasm in the Midwest within that movement, there was a complete lack of awareness about the foods' indigenous origins. She started working with the Minnesota Historical Society Press on a project to address that gap, and that grew into this complete work. Other work in this 'return to healthy indigenous eating' space includes \"Foods of the Americas: Native Recipes and Traditions\" written by husband/wife team Fernando Divina and Marlene Divina and published by Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian when it opened in 2004, and \"The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen\" by Sean Sherman and Beth Dooley in 2017, a 2006 Television Series called 'Seasoned With Spirit: A Native Cook’s Journey with Loretta Barrett Oden', organizations including Native Seeds/SEARCH and the International Institute of Indigenous Science-Indigenous Permaculture, and various groups focusing on sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe cookbook also takes some poetic license with the concepts of authentic traditions - Erdrich challenges limitations and incorporates dynamic, contemporary ingredients and cooking styles. The book showcases a spectrum of Ojibwe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Potawatomi and Mandan gardeners and harvesters; while also incorporating styles and ingredients from other continents. Among the heritage ingredients Erdrich explored are mandaamin (corn) and actual wild rice, which the Anishinaabe people call manoomin - a very different creature from the cultivated, hard black rice that bears the name in stores in the area. \"The tastes range from astringent and grassy to smoky and nutty,\" Erdrich explains. Another is Sumac, \"a great seasoning or you can make drinks from it – Indian Kool-Aid, they call it. I love it on popcorn. I say in the book to make a seasoning from sumac and maple sugar, put it in a shaker, and use it on everything.\" \n\nErdrich also looks at the geo-political context of the ingredients she includes when relevant. The topic of freshwater fish includes a discussion of \"shifts in climate and threats to water purity as it reveals the deep relationship between Ojibwe people and indigenous fish species such as Ginoozhii, the Muskie, Ogaa, the Walleye, and Adikamig, Whitefish.\"\n\nComing from a family of writers (including her sister, Louise Erdrich - renowned contemporary Native American writer) Heid is primarily a poet. \"Original Local\"'s chapters are structured by food groups, but within that structure the content is more of a collage. Each recipe's 'headnote' incorporates Heid's poetic writing style, and there are essays, interviews, cooking tips and notes throughout. “Writing about cooking is a lot like poetry to me – interesting and emotional and evocative and condensed. So is cooking itself … themes and carrying certain flavors and matching things together,\" says Erdrich \n\nFrom a Madison, Wisconsin publication, \"Poet Heid E. Erdrich does not consider herself a cook or even a foodie, but you wouldn’t know it by the appetizing recipes and edifying tales in her salute to the native foods of the Great Lakes and Great Plains.\" Oliver Pollack of \"Mid West Review\" describes Heid's creations as 'fusion recipes combining local sources and lore, and twenty-first-century palates..'.\n\nIn including \"Original Local\" in its 2014 \"10 Best Local Cookbooks and Food Guides\" list, Minneapolis City Pages called it, \"a soulful cookbook for the Midwestern heart.\"\n"}

Jones J said,\n\nThe accused is not a youngster who, for the first time, had too much to drink and dabbled with dagga. On the contrary, he has a criminal record for violent acts and for involvement with dagga. Through his counsel he admits to longstanding serious substance abuse. His character is malformed. He lacks discipline. This sort of thing could happen G to him again. In a case such as this the interests of society must prevail over the interests of the individual offender.\n\nAs to the question of capacity, Jones J said the following:\n\nIt is perhaps worthwhile therefore to speculate on the possible sentences which would have been imposed or considered if the accused had killed the deceased with full criminal capacity. If he had had less liquor to drink and if he had been sufficiently in command of his faculties to be convicted of murder, his intake of alcohol might have been a mitigating factor. He might also have been able to point to other mitigating factors in explaining what happened inside the flat. But the many aggravating factors, which are self-evident, would have made the death penalty one of the options to be given serious consideration. If the Court had come to the conclusion that the death sentence was not the only proper sentence, the other options of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a lengthy term of 20 or 25 years would have been considered. It is my view that it is extremely unlikely that a sentence of less than 20 years would have been imposed for this kind of murder.\n\n\n"}

It is the sixth Disney animated feature film and the first of the six package films produced by Walt Disney Productions in the 1940s. Set in Latin America, it is made up of four different segments; Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one. It also features the first appearance of José Carioca, the Brazilian cigar-smoking parrot. \"Saludos Amigos\" premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. \"Saludos Amigos\" was popular enough that Walt Disney decided to make another film about Latin America, \"The Three Caballeros\", to be produced two years later. At 42 minutes, it is Disney's shortest animated feature to date.\n\nIn early 1941, before U.S. entry into World War II, the United States Department of State commissioned a Disney goodwill tour of South America, intended to lead to a movie to be shown in the US, Central, and South America as part of the Good Neighbor Policy. This was being done because several Latin American governments had close ties with Nazi Germany, and the US government wanted to counteract those ties. Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters were popular in Latin America, and Walt Disney acted as ambassador. The tour, facilitated by Nelson Rockefeller, who had recently been appointed as Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA), took Disney and a group of roughly twenty composers, artists, technicians, etc. from his studio to South America, mainly to Brazil and Argentina, but also to Chile and Peru.\n\nThe film itself was given federal loan guarantees, because the Disney studio had over-expanded just before European markets were closed to them by the war, and because Disney was struggling with labor unrest at the time (including a strike that was underway at the time the goodwill journey began).\n\nThe film included live-action documentary sequences featuring footage of modern Latin American cities with skyscrapers and fashionably dressed residents. This surprised many contemporary US viewers, who associated such images only with US and European cities, and contributed to a changing impression of Latin America. Film historian Alfred Charles Richard Jr. has commented that \"Saludo Amigos\" \"did more to cement a community of interest between peoples of the Americas in a few months than the State Department had in fifty years\".\n\nThe film also inspired Chilean cartoonist René Ríos Boettiger to create Condorito, one of Latin America's most ubiquitous cartoon characters. Ríos perceived that the character \"Pedro\", a small, incapable airplane, was a slight to Chileans and created a comic that could supposedly rival Disney's comic characters.\n\nThis film features four different segments, each of which begin with various clips of the Disney artists roaming the country, drawing cartoons of some of the local cultures and scenery.\n\nIn this segment, American tourist Donald Duck visits Lake Titicaca and meets some of the locals, including an obstinate llama.\n\n\"Pedro\" involves the title character, a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near Santiago, Chile, engaging in his very first flight to pick up air mail from Mendoza, with disastrous results occurring when near Aconcagua, and again while chasing a vulture on the return journey. And to make matters worse, Pedro gets caught in a terrible storm! But, he makes it back to the airfield safe and sound with the mail, revealed to only be a single postcard. This segment was later released theatrically as an independent short, on May 13, 1955 by RKO Pictures.\n\nDisappointed with Pedro as the image that the outside world had of Chile, cartoonist René Ríos Boettiger (known popularly as \"Pepo\") started one of the most famous Latin American comic magazines: \"Condorito\".\n\nIn this segment, American cowboy Goofy gets taken mysteriously to the Argentinian pampas to learn the ways of the native gaucho. This segment was later edited for the film's Gold Classic Collection VHS/DVD release to remove one scene in which Goofy is shown smoking a cigarette. This edit appears again on the Classic Caballeros Collection DVD. This sequence has since been restored as many fans have asked for the unedited version. The fully unedited version is available as a bonus feature on the \"Walt & El Grupo\" DVD release.\n\n\"Aquarela do Brasil\" (Portuguese for \"Watercolor of Brazil\"), the finale of the film, involves a brand-new character, José Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showing Donald Duck around South America, having a drink of cachaça with him and introducing him to the samba (to the tunes of \"Brazil\" and \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\").\n\n\nThe film's original score was composed by Edward H. Plumb, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott. The title song, \"Saludos Amigos\", was written for the film by Charles Wolcott and Ned Washington. The film also featured the song \"Aquarela do Brasil\", written by the popular Brazilian songwriter Ary Barroso and performed by Aloísio de Oliveira, and an instrumental version of \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\", written by Zequinha de Abreu. \"Aquarela do Brasil\" was written and first performed in 1939, but did not achieve much initial success. However, after appearing in this film it became an international hit, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio.\n\nThe film's soundtrack was first released by Decca Records in 1944 as a collection of three 78rpm singles.\n\n\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1943.\n\n\"Saludos Amigos\" premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. It was theatrically reissued in 1949, when it was shown on a double bill with the first reissue of Dumbo.\n\nThe film returned rentals to RKO by 1951 of $1,135,000 with $515,000 being generated in the U.S. and Canada. \n\n\n\n"}

He works for a department of the Foreign Office, usually referred to in the novels as \"MI5\" (counter-intelligence), although in the earliest books he is clearly working for the active overseas department MI6, the British equivalent of the OSS/CIA.\n\nTommy was a teacher in a British boarding school in his first appearance in \"Drink to Yesterday\" and, during school vacations, a spy in Germany for the Foreign Office. At the end of this book, which takes place in World War I and in which he is known only as Tommy Hambledon, he disappears at sea and is presumed dead. He reappears as the hero of the next book, \"Pray Silence\" (known in the U.S. by the title \"Toast to Tomorrow\"), which begins in the 1920s. He is an amnesiac in Germany who gradually works his way up in the fledgling Nazi Party until, in 1933, he becomes Hitler's Chief of Police. He recovers his memory the night of the Reichstag fire, and thereafter battles to defeat Hitler and his plans. And his full name is revealed to be Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon. At the end of the book he fakes his own death in Danzig (Hitler himself reads the oration at his 'funeral') and stows away with his colleague, Alfred Reck, on a British cargo ship bound for Cardiff. On their return to Britain he and Reck are faced with the problem of a series of unexplained sinkings of ships not long out of harbour in Portsmouth in \"They Tell No Tales\".\n\nIn \"Green Hazard\" the Gestapo mistake him for Professor Ulseth, inventor of a new and extremely powerful high explosive, and kidnap him. He then finds himself once again in Berlin where he has to fool his 'hosts' into believing that he actually knows something about chemistry whilst praying that they will fail to recognise a former colleague. After World War II, he continued his career in the Foreign Office and helped defeat a number of Communist plots. In these later adventures, he was frequently aided by Forgan and Campbell, a semi-comic team of model-makers from the Clerkenwell Road in London, who first appear in \"A Brother for Hugh\". In this and some other of Manning Coles' subsequent novels Hambledon actually occupies quite a minor role - in \"The Man in the Green Hat\" he hardly appears at all in the first half of the book.\n\nCyril Coles himself was an avid model maker and was, at the time of his death, building a train set from scratch for his young grandson. Like so many other things in the background of Hambledon, the similarity with Cyril Coles's life is close.\n\nIn the season four premiere episode of \"Archer\", the titular secret agent character is similarly suffering from amnesia, believing himself to be the titular hamburger chef character of the animated series \"Bob's Burgers\". (Both titular characters are voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.) The \"daily special\" on the menu board is \"Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger with Manning Coleslaw\".\n\n"}

Simon give analogies in which \"tohu wa-bohu\" means \"bewildered and astonished\" (mentally formless and void), referring to the Earth's confusion after, having been created simultaneously with the Heavens in Genesis 1:1, it now immediately plays an inferior role.\n\nAbraham bar Hiyya (12th century) was the first to interpret the \"tohu\" and \"bohu\" of Gen. 1:2 as meaning \"matter\" and \"form\", and the same idea appears in Bahir 2.9–10. \n\nPossibly related is the \"Yesod hapashut\" (\"simple element\") in the Kabbalah, in which \"everything is united as one, without differentiation\".\n\n\n"}

The Tronoša manuscript is the oldest survived copy, of which there are several transcriptions, one of them transcribed by Serafim. A copy is held at the monastery, while the original manuscript by Josif is held in Vienna.\n\nThe chronicle includes hagiographies of Serbian rulers. The Battle of Kosovo (1389) is described in the chronicle, probably based on the story about the battle transferred to the region north of Sava and Danube in the first half of the 18th century. According to tradition, as included in the chronicle, Prince Lazar of Serbia and his army had a holy communion before the battle at the church in Samodreža.\n\n"}

A vision statement is not limited to business organizations and may also be used by non-profit or governmental entities.\n\nA vision statement is a company's road map, indicating what the company wants to become and guiding transformational initiatives by setting a defined direction for the company's growth. Vision statements undergo minimal revisions during the life of a business, unlike operational goals which may be updated from year-to-year. Vision statements can range in length from short sentences to multiple pages. Vision statements are also formally written and referenced in company documents rather than, for example, general principles informally articulated by senior management.\n\nA consensus does not exist on the characteristics of a \"good\" or \"bad\" vision statement. Commonly cited traits include:\n\nVision statements may fill the following functions for a company:\n\nWhile a consensus does not exist on the value of mission and vision statements, literature supporting the relevance of these documents to companies outweighs those opposed to them. This may be due to, among other reasons, the positive value of the tools in communicating to internal and external stakeholders or retrospective attempts to legitimize the use of these tools.\n\nCreating and implementing vision statements presents challenges to organizations. They can be challenging to write because they must balance being forward-looking and describing an ideal state without becoming so idealistic that the vision is unattainable. Vision statements can be an employee dissatisfier when staff feel the company's vision is filled with business buzzwords unrelated to the company's services or when the vision does not match day-to-day company policy; for example, a vision statement that includes root cause problem solving while managers are rewarded for fixing problems quickly rather than resolving systemic issues. A vision statement may need to be paired with company initiatives to communicate and reinforce the vision, ensure processes align with the vision, and empower and incentivize employees to take actions that support the company vision.\n\n"}

He and his twin brother Asher used to find ancient coins as they played around the city, which was in the process of being built up. The 14-year-old twins donated the coins they had found to the Israel Department of Antiquities in 1949. He joined the Israel Defense Forces in 1954. After completing his army service in 1956 he became a member of Kibbutz Hazerim, where he married Adaya Weiss in 1956. Meshorer established a museum on the kibbutz before moving to Jerusalem in 1960, where he was a student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1960 to 1966, receiving a BA in Archaeology and Jewish History and an MA in Classical Archaeology. He received his Ph.D in Numismatics in 1971 from the Hebrew University. Meshorer served as a reservist in the Jerusalem Reconnaissance Company and in 1967 was slightly wounded in the Six-Day War. He later served as an officer in the UN liaison unit.\n\nMeshorer was appointed Professor of Numismatics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983. He established the Numismatic Division at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1969, remaining at its head until 1993. He also served as the University's Chief Curator for Archaeology from 1975 to 1982 and from 1990 to 1996. He retired from the Israel Museum in 2000.\n\nMeshorer was a member of the Archaeological Council of the Israel Antiquities Authority and supervised the establishment of two museums devoted to Biblical Archaeology, the museum of the Cleveland Jewish Community Center in 1976, and The Hecht Museum at the University of Haifa in 1984. He was also a member of the Directorate of the Israel Society for Medals and Coins, serving on the committees that chose the design of the modern Israeli coins. He was instrumental in the decision to base the design of many of the modern coins on ancient Jewish coinage, in this way linking past and present in the State of Israel.\n\nHe published 19 books and more than 100 articles, almost all of them dealing with the coins of the Holy Land.\n\nMeshorer was invited to lecture and research at several major institutions, including the American Numismatic Society in New York City, Duke University, the British Museum, the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. Among the honors Meshorer received were the Huntington Medal of the American Numismatic Society in 2001, and in 2002 he was awarded the Irene Levi-sala Book Prize in Archaeology of Israel for his book ‘A Treasury of Jewish Coins From the Persian Period to Bar-Kochba’. He was elected an honorary member of the Council International Numismatic Commission at the opening of the 13th International Numismatic Congress of Madrid in 2003.\n\nIn 2002 a prize, the Ya'akov Meshorer Numismatic Prize, was established in memory of Meshorer at the Israel Museum; its first recipient was Dr. Andrew Burnett in 2002, and the second Michel Amandry in 2006.\n\nMeshorer died in Jerusalem aged 69 after a six-year battle against cancer.\n\n\n"}
