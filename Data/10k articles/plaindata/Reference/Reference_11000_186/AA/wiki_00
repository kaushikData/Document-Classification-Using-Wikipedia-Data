{"id": "19217643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19217643", "title": "A Frank Statement", "text": "A Frank Statement\n\nA Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers was a historic first advertisement in a campaign run by major American tobacco companies on January 4, 1954, to create doubt by disputing recent scientific studies linking smoking cigarettes to lung cancer and other dangerous health effects.\n\nReaching an estimated 43 million people through more than 400 newspapers throughout the United States, \"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\" and subsequent advertisements were designed by public relations firm Hill & Knowlton to socially engineer the public's perceptions of tobacco and to instill doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking. As a result of \"A Frank Statement\" and tobacco advertisements that still exist today, the tobacco industry continues to expand its markets by avoiding health concerns and portraying its products in a positive light.\n\nReports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer emerged as early as 1912, but until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial since smoking was so pervasive in society.\n\nIn 1950, hoping to find the cause of the significant surge in lung cancer incidence in the US and England, Dr. Richard Doll and Professor Bradford Hill conducted a case-control study in which lung cancer, other cancer, and non-cancer patients from twenty London-area hospitals were interviewed about their smoking habits. The study, published in the \"British Medical Journal\", found that the lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients. These results revealed to the medical community that a link between smoking and lung cancer may exist. Smoking was so prevalent that before these results were published, the increase in lung cancer incidence was attributed to the growing presence of automobiles, roads, and factories in cities.\n\nIn 1950, Dr. Ernst Wynder and Evarts Ambrose Graham published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which they interviewed 684 people with proven cases of lung cancer about their smoking habits. The study found that heavy and sustained usage of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, increased the likelihood of developing of lung cancer. In 1952, to study the biological likelihood of cancer being linked to smoking, Wynder published an animal study in the US journal \"Cancer Research\" that found that tobacco tar was carcinogenic when applied to the skin of mice.\n\nThe December 1952 issue of \"Reader's Digest\" featured an article, titled \"Cancer by the Carton,\" that discussed these recent studies on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The article presented to the public the studies' conclusion that tobacco causes lung cancer. As a result, the article provoked a health scare, which resulted in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices.\n\nIn 1954, Doll and Hill published another article in the \"British Medical Journal\" releasing the results of the British Doctors Study,which revealed a significant pattern of increased death from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased.\n\nIn the early 1950s, which were the immediate post-war years and the beginning of the nuclear age, science was very highly regarded by the public, so the accumulating scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer posed a major threat to the tobacco companies' public image.\n\nWith mounting evidence of a link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, tobacco companies faced a dilemma of whether to admit to or deny the health risks of smoking. In order to preserve their industry, the tobacco companies opted to completely deny health risks. Instead, the tobacco companies crafted a strategy that, through creative advertising and marketing, would manipulate the cultural context surrounding their product from one that regarded the product unfavorably to one that held the product in high esteem. This strategy is known as social engineering.\n\nOn December 15, 1953, led by Paul Hahn, the head of American Tobacco, the six major tobacco companies (American Tobacco Co., R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Benson & Hedges, U.S. Tobacco Co., and Brown & Williamson) met with public relations company Hill & Knowlton in New York City to create an advertisement that would assuage the public's fears and create a false sense of security in order to regain the public's confidence in the tobacco industry. Hill and Knowlton's president, John W. Hill, realized that simply denying the health risks would not be enough to convince the public. Instead, a more effective method would be to create a major scientific controversy in which the scientifically established link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer would appear not to be conclusively known.\n\nThe tobacco companies fought against the emerging science by producing their own science, which suggested that existing science was incomplete and that the industry was not motivated by self-interest. With the creation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, headed by accomplished scientist C.C. Little, the tobacco companies manufactured doubt and turned scientific findings into a topic of debate. The recruitment of credentialed scientists like Little who were skeptics was a crucial aspect of the tobacco companies' social engineering plan to establish credibility against anti-smoking reports. By amplifying the voices of a few skeptical scientists, the industry created an illusion that the larger scientific community had not reached a conclusive agreement on the link between smoking and cancer.\n\nInternal documents released through whistleblowers and litigation, such as the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, reveal that while advertisements like \"A Frank Statement\" made tobacco companies appear to be responsible and concerned for the health of their consumers, in reality, they were deceiving the public into believing that smoking did not have health risks. The whole project was aimed at protecting the tobacco companies' images of glamour and all-American individualism at the cost of the public's health.\n\n\"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\" claims:\nThe claims made in \"A Frank Statement\" were largely false as:\n\nThe advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. In \"A Frank Statement,\" the tobacco companies stated that they believed that their products were safe; however, in a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists believed that there was a causal relationship between tobacco and cancer. Research was undertaken to find a safer cigarette, but tobacco companies realized that they could not produce a safer cigarette because doing so would mean admitting that current cigarettes were not safe. Thus, the industry responded to the growing public concern by marketing their cigarettes as having filters, milder smoke, and lower tar and nicotine content; however, they did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999.\n\n\"A Frank Statement\" also pledged \"aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health,\" and announced the establishment of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC) to work towards that goal. Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking as it focused mainly on cancer basics, such as immunology, genetics, cell biology, pharmacology, and virology, rather than cancer's connection to smoking. Neither the TIRC nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and/or life-threatening illness. When research did find a link between smoking and cancer, however, the findings were rarely reported to the public. Despite the irrelevance of much of the TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, the tobacco industry continued to publicize its funding of the TIRC to reassure the public. In reality, the TIRC was created as a public relations measure for the purposes of discrediting independent science and portraying the tobacco companies as transparent and concerned for the well-being of their customers.\n\nFinally, the advertisement promised that the tobacco companies \"always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.\" According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, \"there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community.\" An example of this is a memo from the vice-president of the Tobacco Institute in which the industry's strategy was described as \"creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it\", and \"advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice.\" By proclaiming that the health risks were not conclusively linked to smoking, the tobacco companies manipulated the situation to place all liability on the consumer rather than on themselves.\n\nAlthough the tobacco industry claims that their advertising is only used to convince current smokers to switch between brands and that it does not increase total cigarette consumption, research into the effects of advertising shows that it plays an essential role in projecting positive connotations of smoking cigarettes onto potential new smokers. From 1954, when Hill & Knowlton first started working with the tobacco industry, to 1961, the number of cigarettes sold annually rose from 369 billion to 488 billion, and the annual per capita consumption rose from 3344 to 4025 cigarettes.\n\nThe first cigarette advertisements claimed that smoking cigarettes had a variety of health benefits, such as prolonged youth, thinness, and attractiveness. However, as more research revealed the deceptiveness of these claims, tobacco companies began to use advertisements, like \"A Frank Statement,\" to deny that their products caused cancer. Claiming that advertisement bans would infringe on \"commercial free speech,\" the tobacco industry has continually fought against them; however, the industry has never responded to criticism that much of its advertising, like the claims made in \"A Frank Statement,\" is deceptive. As a result, the tobacco industry's manipulation of science as a public relations tactic is still used today in debates on a wide variety of subjects including global warming, food, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nToday, tobacco companies continue to aggressively advertise cigarettes. As cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, tobacco companies have greatly increased their advertising expenditure. In 1991, the industry spent $4.6 billion on advertising and promoting cigarette consumption, and in 2015, tobacco companies spent $8.9 billion on advertising just in the United States. Tobacco companies continue to use this money to fund social engineering techniques, such as campaigns featuring themes of social desirability and specific cultural references, to target women, children, and specific racial/ethnic communities. For example, to make cigarettes appealing to African American communities, the industry has implemented campaigns that use urban culture and language while sponsoring Chinese and Vietnamese New Year festivals to target Asian Americans.\n\nWith declining levels of smoking in the West due to smoking bans and increased education on the health risks of smoking, tobacco companies have also expanded their market into developing countries to fulfill the industry's ever-present need for new smokers and more money. Using many of the same advertising techniques of glamour, sex, and independence, the industry has begun to target women and children in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where government bans and health education may not be as prevalent.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4473231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4473231", "title": "Alp (folklore)", "text": "Alp (folklore)\n\nAn Alp (plural \"Alpe\" or \"Alpen\") is a supernatural being in German folklore.\n\nNot to be confused with the similarly named Alp-luachra, the \"Alp\" is sometimes likened to a vampire, but its behavior is more akin to that of the incubus. It is distinct from both of these creatures in that it wears a magic hat called a \"Tarnkappe\", from which it draws its powers. The word \"Alp\" is the German form of the word that comes into English as \"elf\", both descended from Common Germanic. It is also known by the following names: \"trud\", \"mar\", \"mart\", \"mahr\", \"schrat\", and \"walrider\". Many variations of the creature exist in surrounding European areas, such as the Druden and Schratteli, or Old Hag in English-speaking countries.\n\nIn the period before about 1000, the Old High German word \"alp\" is attested only in a small number of glosses. It is defined by the \"Althochdeutsches Wörterbuch\" as a \"nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology ... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings ... As the mare he messes around with women\". Accordingly, the German word \"Alpdruck\" (literally 'elf-oppression') means 'nightmare'. There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.\n\nIn a similar vein, elves are in Middle High German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people \"in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: 'die elben/der alp trieget mich' (the elves/elf is/are deceiving me)\". The same pattern holds in Early Modern German. This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth-century Heinrich von Morungen's fifth \"Minnesang\" begins \"Von den elben virt entsehen vil manic man / Sô bin ich von grôzer lieber entsên\" (\"full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love\"). \"Elbe\" was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.\n\nIn later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. Evidence includes Latin prayers found inscribed in lead amulets from southern Scandinavia and Schleswig. The most famous is the fourteenth-century \"Münchener Nachtsegen\", a prayer to be said at night, which includes the lines:\n\nCorrespondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.\n\nAs in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. An elf does appear in an account of the parentage of the hero Hagen (ON Högni) which survives only in the Old Norse \"Þiðreks saga\" but which was translated from a German text (now lost). Here, Hagen is the product of his mother Oda being impregnated by an elf (ON \"álfr\") while she lies in bed. Otherwise, it seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves (). Thus some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves, especially when the dwarf's name is \"Alberich\", which etymologically means 'elf-powerful' (thus Jacob Grimm thought that the name echoed the notion of the king of the nation of elves or dwarves). The Alberich in the epic \"Ortnit\" is a dwarf of childlike-stature who turns out to be the real father of the titular hero, having raped his mother. The \"Alberich\" who aids Ortnit is paralleled by the French Auberon, who aids Huon de Bordeaux and whose name derives from \"Alberich\". Auberon entered English literature through Lord Berner's translation of the \"chanson de geste\" around 1540, then as \"Oberon\", the king of elves and fairies in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (see below).\n\nAs the apparent convergence with dwarves suggests, the word \"alp\" declined in use in German after the medieval period, though it still occurs in some fossilised uses, most prominently the word for \"nightmare\", \"Alptraum\" (\"elf dream\"). Variations of the German elf in later folklore include the moss people and the weisse frauen ('white women'). In Teutonic myth and folklore, \"Alpe\" were considered friendly elf-like beings which lived in the mountains, but eventually turned more negative and malevolent. The characteristic magic that the \"Alpe\" possess also bear the creature much resemblance to the Kobold, particularly Hodekin. As in English, however, twentieth-century fantasy fiction has helped to reinvigorate the term. J. R. R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form \"Elb\" in his \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967) and \"Elb, Elben\" was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", having a role in repopularising the form in German.\n\nAn \"Alp\" is typically male, while the \"mara\" and \"mart\" appear to be more feminine versions of the same creature. Its victims are often females, whom it attacks during the night, controlling their dreams and creating horrible nightmares (hence the German word \"Alptraum\" [\"elf dream\"], meaning a nightmare). An \"Alp\" attack is called an \"Alpdruck\", or often \"Alpdrücke\", which means \"elf pressure\". \"Alpdruck\" is when an \"Alp\" sits astride a sleeper's chest and becomes heavier until the crushing weight awakens the terrified and breathless dreamer. The victim awakes unable to move under the \"Alp\"'s weight. This may have been an early explanation for sleep apnea and sleep paralysis, as well as night terrors. It may also include lucid dreams. \nSexual attacks by the \"Alp\" are rare.\n\nThe \"Alp\" is often associated with vampires because it will drink blood from the nipples of men and young children, though women are the preferred victim of the invariably male \"Alp\", for it favors the taste of breast milk.\n\n\"Alpe\" also exhibit a tendency for mischief similar to elves, like souring milk and re-diapering a baby; a maid must sign a cross on the diaper or the \"Alp\" will put the soiled diaper back on her child. They also enjoy tangling hair into \"elfknots\" or chewing and twisting horse's tails. They will ride a horse to exhaustion during the night and may sometimes crush smaller farm animals such as geese to death during a pressing attack. \"Alpe\" are also similarly blamed for minor illnesses and milking cows dry, for they enjoy the taste of cow's milk as well.\n\nThe \"Alp\", in many cases, is considered a demon, but there have been some instances in which the \"Alp\" is created from the spirits of recently dead relatives, more akin to a spirit or ghost.\nChildren may become an \"Alp\" if a woman bites a horse collar to ease the pain during an extremely long and tortuous childbirth. Also, a child born with a caul or hair on the palms may become an \"Alp\". If a woman who is pregnant is frightened by an animal, the child may be born an \"Alp\". Stillborn infants are also suspected to return from the grave as \"Alpe\" and torment their family. People who have eyebrows that meet are suspected to be \"Alpe\".\nAs with the case of werewolves, sometimes a normal human or animal may become an \"Alp\" during the night. They are typically unaware of their nocturnal activities and are invariably in disguise while doing so. Finding an \"Alp\" while it is not active simply requires injuring or otherwise marking it during one of its attacks, and seeking out the being with a similar mark during the day. The person can then be cured if it is found out who sent them the curse, or how they became cursed to begin with. Witchcraft is often the prime suspect in this case.\n\nSometimes an \"Alp\" is a spirit summoned by a witch or an evil person wishing harm on another, and sent to torment them. Tricking an \"Alp\" may lead a person to its master.\n\nThe \"Alp\" is best known for its shapeshifting abilities, similar to the creatures from werewolf lore. It may change into a cat, pig, dog, snake or a small white butterfly. It has also been said that it can fly like a bird and ride a horse. The \"Alp\" always wears a hat, giving it an almost comical appearance. The hat is known as a \"Tarnkappe\" (the literal translation being \"camouflage cap\" or \"cap of concealment\") which is simply a hat (or less commonly a veil) that gives the \"Alp\" magic powers and the ability to turn invisible while worn (see also cloak of invisibility). The hat is visible no matter what shape the \"Alp\" takes. An \"Alp\" who has lost this hat will offer a great reward for its safe return. The \"Alp\" also possesses an \"evil eye\" whose gaze will inflict illness and misfortune. Removing or damaging this eye also removes the \"Alp\"'s malicious intentions.\n\nProtections against an \"Alp\" include laying a broomstick under a pillow, iron horseshoes hung from the bedpost, placing shoes against the bed with the toes pointing toward the door, or placing a mirror on the chest. Steel and crosses are also used. If awoken by the \"Alp\" and finding him still there, one can address him by asking him to return in the morning to borrow something or have coffee. The \"Alp\" will dash away at once, arriving in the morning either in his \"true\" form, or else in the form of a human with eyebrows that meet to receive his gifts. The creature can be convinced to leave the victim alone at this time, but the \"Alp\" will beg pitifully and at length not to be turned away. \nPlugging up any holes, specifically keyholes, before a visitation will keep the \"Alp\" out. Plugging them during a visitation will invariably seal it inside the room, as they can leave only through their original entrance. A light kept constantly on during the night will also effectively ward off an \"Alp\". A sentry may also be employed to wait and watch for the \"Alp\" to attack the helpless sleeper, the \"Alp\" may be driven away if caught by someone not under the \"Alp\"'s influence. Similar to the German Neuntoter, \"Alpe\" are weakened or immobilized by shoving a lemon in its mouth should it be caught resting during the day. The \"Alp\" appears all but impossible to kill, and sometimes even after being turned away it may reappear years later in a worse mood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25411184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25411184", "title": "Arkhangelsk Gospel", "text": "Arkhangelsk Gospel\n\nThe Archangelsk Gospel () is a lectionary in Old Church Slavonic dated to 1092. It is the fourth oldest Eastern Slavic manuscript. The book is stored in the collection of the Russian State Library. UNESCO added the Arkhangelsk Gospel to the international register Memory of the World Programme in 1997.\n\nThe Arkhangelsk Gospel has a modest design and is a cheap, mass-produced book. The story of its creation and provenance until 1876 is unknown. The book was brought to Moscow by a farmer from the Archangelsk region and is named after its place of discovery. The manuscript is in satisfactory condition - the ink and vermilion has crumbled in places, but the parchment does not have signs of contamination or moisture. The Archangel Gospel was reproduced in 1912 as a facsimile and in 1997 as a scientific publication.\n\nThe early history of the manuscript and place of its provenance are unknown before 1876. There are some suggestions that it came from the scriptorium of the Lazarevsky monastery near Great Novgorod, but there is no unambiguous evidence to support the hypothesis.\n\nIn early December 1876 the manuscript was brought to Moscow by a peasant from Arkhangelsk region and was acquired by a Rumyantsev Museum trustee, merchant, old believer S. T. Bolshakov. He showed it to other bibliophiles and then offered to sell it to the Rumyantsev Museum for 400 rubles. Several experts worked with the manuscript in the museum, including E. B. Autograph, P. A. Kulish and A. L. Duvernoy. They concluded that it was written in 1192 because of the date of the scribe ending work on the manuscript ( Cyrillic numerals \"from the creation of the world\" - ҂ ЅѰ). At the request of Danilov Monastery dean paleographer Amphilochius (Sergius-Kazantsev), who worked at the time on Old Slavonic-Greek-Russian Dictionary using 11th and 12th-century manuscripts, Bolshakov took the Archangelsk Gospel from the museum and lent it to Amphilochius for study.\nIn 1912, for the fiftieth anniversary of the Rumjancev Museum, the text of the codex was edited in 100 copies in a facsimile edition. The facsimile edition reproduces a natural colour of the manuscript (parchment, ink, pictures, and holes created by insects). The paper used for this edition has approximately the same thickness as the parchment of the original codex.\n\nThe manuscript consists of 178 pages of different sizes ranging from 20×16 centimetres to 20.5×16.8 cm. The tops of the leaves have been cut off with damage of numbering of the quires. The manuscript is written on parchment made from calf skins. Experts describe the quality of the material as low: rough manufacture of the leather, very economical open. Fifty-four pages have various defects: rough fields which have been not sewn up or have unfilled holes, the filed parts of the leaves. The Archangel Gospel is in a satisfactory condition; the parchment is not polluted, and traces of moisture are absent, but a number of sheets show traces of wormholes. It appears that some sheets had ink and cinnabar droplets fall on them, but this does not interfere with the text's legibility. As the restoration of the manuscript from the moment of its discovery was never successful, the manuscript needs a new binding of the book block and strengthening of reliure.\n\nThe manuscript lost six of the 8-folios quires (three in the beginning, two between leaves 84 and 85, one between leaves 100 and 101) and five separate leaves — together 53 leaves are lost. Separately last leaf of the manuscript is sewn to the book block with the text-palimpsest (presumably 12th century), written on the old washed off text.\n\nThe main text of the manuscript was written by two scribes. It is believed, that the work of these scribes was distributed before work was started. As it « was done, possibly, for acceleration it is difficult to assume an opportunity of using the general original ».\nThe first scribe copied the text of the Gospels lectionary (\"Evangelistarium\") which goes back to Cyril and Methodius translation of the Gospels. The professor A. Voskresensky considers, that this text concerns to the most ancient Slavic translations of the four Gospels and represents the so-called Yugoslavian edition closest to initial translation of Cyril and Methody. This part of the Archangel Gospel contains a number of readings has the order distinct from readings of the Ostromir Gospel, and also there are inserts absent in the Gospel (for example, addition of lessons in a weekday from Easter to Pentecost).\nThe second scribe copied the text of the full Gospel-lectionary which sample was not kept, but by its text from the Archangel Gospel, it has essential distinctions on structure and sequences of evangelical readings from the Mstislav Gospel (it is written till 1117), most ancient of kept full of lectionary markings.\n\nAlthough ink and cinnabar used for initial letters partially fell off some pages the general state of manuscript is acceptable because its calf parchment pages are clean and dry. It has never been restored. The manuscript is kept in the holdings of Russian State Library in Moscow.\n\nThe first facsimile reprint of the Archangel Gospel was published in 1912, in 1997 there was a second annotated reprint.\n\nThe Archangel Gospel was included into the UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register – Europe and North America Memory of the World Register – in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.\n\nThe manuscript was written by two scribes (according to the colophon, their names were — Michka and presbyter Peter), and also the third scribe (Jakim or Akim), who is responsible for the 175—177 sheets (with Sunday Gospel lessons) and the fourth, which name is unknown — who wrote only leaf 178 (Gospel lessons at date of Archangel Michael). The handwriting of the two last scribes is dated palaeographically to the 13th–14th centuries. According to N. N. Durnovo the fourth scribe was a contemporary for the first two scribes and dates its work to the end of the 11th century, or to the beginning of the 12th century.\n\nIn the end written the fourth scribe writing existed a certain text which at the moment of detection of the manuscript to disassemble it was inconvenient. The chemical way of restoration of the text had completely destroyed this text. The manuscript is written by the documentary hands, the letters have essential deviations from the classical style according to which other monuments of that period were written (e.g. Ostromir Gospel).\n\n\n"}

It is used in correspondence, as an enclosure for other material.\n\nCompliments slips, which are informal, can sometimes substitute for more formal letters of reply. For example, the response to a request for a product catalogue or a price list may simply be the price list or catalogue, with a compliments slip attached, rather than with a formal letter of reply. The inclusion of compliments slips in responses to such routine requests is often seen by businesses as a necessary step in maintaining good public relations.\n\nThere is no fixed size for compliments slips. They may vary in size from the size of a business or visiting card, from which compliments slips originally evolved, to the size of a whole sheet of letter writing paper. Eric Bain recommends that they be of a size suitable for placing inside an envelope without more than one fold, and large enough to be noticed when included in a parcel. (Standard letter stationery outside the U.S. often requires folding twice in order to be placed inside envelopes.) To this end he recommends that compliments slips be size A6 paper. Miller recommends size A5 for stationery that doubles up as both compliments slip and headed letter paper.\n\nSince they are informal, compliments slips are not substitutes in those cases where a formal letter is required for legal reasons. In building contract work, for example, a drawing or a copy letter sent to a contractor with a compliments slip attached is not a formal instruction to perform the work on the drawing or letter. It is at most an invitation to perform that work, at no charge to the employer. A valid instruction would be a formal letter of instruction, or an instruction provided on a printed \"Architect's Instruction\" form (signed by the architect).\n\nFalconer states that a compliments slip should never be sent instead of a personal letter, and that it is better to send a personal letter in response to a customer enquiry, because it provides a personal touch. Hailey recommends an alternative strategy for providing a personal touch: removing the salutation from compliments slips, thus forcing the entire note to be hand-written.\n"}
{"id": "34793176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34793176", "title": "Copyright transfer agreement", "text": "Copyright transfer agreement\n\nA copyright transfer agreement is a legal document containing provisions for the conveyance of full or partial copyright from the rights owner to another party. It is similar to contracts signed between authors and publishers but does not normally involve the payment of remuneration or royalties. Such agreements are a key element of subscription-based academic publishing, and have been said to facilitate the handling of copyright-based permissions in print-only publishing. In the age of electronic communication, the benefits of copyright transfer agreements have been questioned, and while they remain the norm, open licenses as used in open access publishing have been established as an alternative.\n\nCopyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the Copyright Act of 1976 in the United States and similar legislation in other countries redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work. This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the author in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.\n\nGranting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions. The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and \"[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them.\" This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.\n\nCopyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere, to limit the frequency of duplicate publication and plagiarism.\n\nCritics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is \"as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community\" because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the authors. Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with self-archiving practices or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.\n\nIn 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Johnson v. Storix upheld a copyright transfer involving no written assignment. In that case, the Author, Anthony Johnson sold software as a sole proprietor and incorporated his company in 2003 as Storix, Inc. Eight years later he gave 60% share of the corporation to his employees, who later removed him from the company and claimed ownership of the copyrights. The court upheld a jury decision that Johnson had made an oral agreement to transfer the copyright to the corporation upon its formation based on an annual report he wrote and signed a year later stating that he had transferred “all assets” from his sole proprietorship. The jury rejected Johnson's claim he intended only to transfer the license to sell the software, and further decided that Johnson became a work for hire upon forming the corporation, thereby also forfeiting all rights to his derivative works. This is the first case in which a document, not itself a contract or agreement and containing no reference to the copyrights, was considered a “note or memorandum” of copyright transfer, and the first time a sole owner of a company was designated a work for hire for copyright ownership purposes. This serves as a lesson that a “writing” required by the Copyright Act need not necessarily be “clear”, but may contain ambiguous language which can be interpreted by course of dealing by third parties to the alleged transaction. \n\nCopyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright, and publishers have started to implement it using license agreements, wherein the author of the work retains copyright and gives the publisher the permission (exclusive or not) to reproduce and distribute the work. A third model is the so-called \"browse-wrap\" or \"click-wrap\" license model that is becoming more and more popular in the form of the Creative Commons licenses: it allows anyone (including the publisher) to reproduce and distribute the work, with some possible restrictions. Creative Commons licenses are used by many open access journals.\n\nCopyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published. If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing – \"e.g.\", if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish – they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an addendum to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358226", "title": "Eid al-Adha", "text": "Eid al-Adha\n\nEid al-Adha (, ), also called the \"Festival of Sacrifice\", is the second of two Islamic holidays celebrated worldwide each year (the other being Eid al-Fitr), and considered the holier of the two. It honors the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God’s command. But, before Abraham could sacrifice his son, God provided a lamb to sacrifice instead. In commemoration of this, an animal is sacrificed and divided into three parts: one part of the share is given to the poor and needy; second part is for the home, third is given to relatives.\n\nIn the Islamic lunar calendar, \"Eid al-Adha\" falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah. In the international (Gregorian) calendar, the dates vary from year to year drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year.\n\nIn languages other than Arabic, the name is often simply translated into the local language, such as English \"Feast of the Sacrifice\", German \"Opferfest\", Dutch \"Offerfeest\", Romanian \"Sărbătoarea Sacrificiului\", and Hungarian \"Áldozati ünnep\". In Spanish it is known as \"Fiesta del Cordero\" or \"Fiesta del Borrego\" (both meaning \"festival of the lamb\"). It is also known as \"ʿĪd al-Baqarah\" in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and in the Middle East, as \"Id-e Qorbān\" in Iran, \"Kurban Bayramı\" (\"Holiday of Sacrifice\") in Turkey, \"Korbanir Id\" in Bangladesh, as \"ʿĪd el-Kebīr\" in the Maghreb, as \"Tfaska Tamoqqart\" in Jerba Berber, as \"Iduladha\", \"Hari Raya Aiduladha\", \"Hari Raya Haji\" or \"Qurban\" in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, as \"Bakrā Īd\" (\"Goat Eid\") or \"Baṛī Īd\" (\"Greater Eid\") in Pakistan and India, \"Bakara Eid\" in Trinidad and as \"Tabaski\" or \"Tobaski\" in Senegal and Odún Iléyá by Yorúbà People in Nigeria West Africa (most probably borrowed from the Serer language — an ancient Serer religious festival).\n\nThe following names are used as other names of Eid al-Adha:\n\nThe word عيد ʻīd means \"festival,\" \"celebration,\" \"feast day,\" or \"holiday.\" It comes from the triliteral root عين ʻayn واو wāw دال dāl, with associated root meanings of \"to go back, to rescind, to accrue, to be accustomed, habits, to repeat, to be experienced; appointed time or place, anniversary, feast day.\" Arthur Jeffery contests this etymology, and believes the term to have been borrowed into Arabic from Syriac, or less likely Targumic Aramaic.\n\nThe word ًأضحى 'aḍḥan means \"sacrificial animal.\" It comes from the triliteral root ضاد ḍād حاء ḥā' واو wāw, with associated meanings \"daylight… to appear, to appear conspicuously… sacrificial animal, to sacrifice.\" No occurrence of this root with a meaning related to sacrifice occurs in the Qur'ān. In modern Arabic, the verb ضحّى ḍaḥḥā means \"to sacrifice,\" and a ضحيّة ḍaḥiyyah is a sacrificial offering.\n\nThe first element in the Persian name عيدِ قربان Id-e Qorbān is identical to Arabic ʻīd, above. The second is from Arabic قربان qurbān, meaning \"offering, sacrifice.\" Christians use the term to mean eucharistic host. In the Islamic Arabic tradition, it is held to derive from the root قاف qāf راء rā' باء bā', with associated meanings of \"closeness, proximity… to moderate; kinship…; to hurry; …to seek, to seek water sources…; scabbard, sheath; small boat; sacrifice.\" Arthur Jeffery recognizes the same Semitic root, but believes the sense of the term to have entered Arabic through Aramaic.\n\nTurkish Kurban Bayramı uses the same first element as the Persian قربان qorbān. Bayram means \"holiday\" in Turkish, with close cognates in other Turkish languages. Its ultimate etymology is contested.\n\nOne of the main trials of Abraham’s life was to face the command of God to sacrifice his dearest possession, his son. The son is named in the Quran[4:163], Ishmael, whereas it is mentioned as Isaac in the Bible. Upon hearing this command, Abraham prepared to submit to will of God. During this preparation, Shaitan (the Devil) tempted Abraham and his family by trying to dissuade them from carrying out God's commandment, and Abraham drove Satan away by throwing pebbles at him. In commemoration of their rejection of Satan, stones are thrown at symbolic pillars during the Stoning of the Devil during Hajj rites.\n\nWhen Abraham attempted to cut his son's throat on mount Arafat, he was astonished to see that his son was unharmed and instead, he found a animal which was slaughtered. Abraham had passed the test by his willingness to carry out God's command.\n\nThis story is known as the Akedah in Judaism (Binding of Isaac) and originates in the Tora, the first book of Moses (Genesis, Ch. 22). The Quran refers to the Akedah as follows:\n\nAbraham had shown that his love for God superseded all others: that he would lay down his own life or the lives of those dearest to him in submission to God's command. Muslims commemorate this ultimate act of sacrifice every year during Eid al-Adha. While Abraham was prepared to make an ultimate sacrifice, God ultimately prevents the sacrifice, additionally signifying that one should never sacrifice a human life, especially not in the name of God. \n\nThe word \"Eid\" appears once in Al-Ma'ida, the fifth sura of the Quran, with the meaning \"solemn festival\".\n\nDevotees offer the Eid al-Adha prayers at the mosque. The Eid al-Adha prayer is performed any time after the sun completely rises up to just before the entering of \"Zuhr\" time, on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah. In the event of a \"force majeure\" (e.g. natural disaster), the prayer may be delayed to the 11th of Dhu al-Hijjah and then to the 12th of Dhu al-Hijjah.\n\nEid prayers must be offered in congregation. Participation of women in the prayer congregation varies from community to community. It consists of two \"rakats\" (units) with seven \"takbirs\" in the first Raka'ah and five Takbirs in the second Raka'ah. For Shia Muslims, Salat al-Eid differs from the five daily canonical prayers in that no \"adhan\" (call to prayer) or \"iqama\" (call) is pronounced for the two Eid prayers. The \"salat\" (prayer) is then followed by the khutbah, or sermon, by the Imam.\n\nAt the conclusion of the prayers and sermon, Muslims embrace and exchange greetings with one another (\"Eid Mubarak\"), give gifts and visit one another. Many Muslims also take this opportunity to invite their non-Muslim friends, neighbours, co-workers and classmates to their Eid festivities to better acquaint them about Islam and Muslim culture.\n\nDuring Eid al-Adha, distributing meat amongst the people, chanting the \"takbir\" out loud before the Eid prayers on the first day and after prayers throughout the three days of Eid, are considered essential parts of this important Islamic festival.\n\nThe \"takbir\" consists of:\nMen, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing to perform Eid prayer in a large congregation in an open \"waqf\" (\"stopping\") field called Eidgah or mosque. Affluent Muslims who can afford it sacrifice their best halal domestic animals (usually a cow, but can also be a camel, goat, sheep, or ram depending on the region) as a symbol of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son. The sacrificed animals, called (), known also by the Perso-Arabic term \"qurbāni\", have to meet certain age and quality standards or else the animal is considered an unacceptable sacrifice. In Pakistan alone nearly ten million animals are slaughtered on Eid days costing over US$2.0 billion.\n\nThe meat from the sacrificed animal is preferred to be divided into three parts. The family retains one-third of the share; another third is given to relatives, friends, and neighbors; and the remaining third is given to the poor and needy.\n\nMuslims wear their new or best clothes. Women cook special sweets, including ma'amoul (filled shortbread cookies). They gather with family and friends.\n\nWhile Eid al-Adha is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies from year to year since the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar. The lunar calendar is approximately eleven days shorter than the solar calendar. Each year, Eid al-Adha (like other Islamic holidays) falls on one of about two to four different Gregorian dates in different parts of the world, because the boundary of crescent visibility is different from the International Date Line.\n\nThe following list shows the official dates of Eid al-Adha for Saudi Arabia as announced by the Supreme Judicial Council. Future dates are estimated according to the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia. The Umm al-Qura is just a guide for planning purposes and not the absolute determinant or fixer of dates. Confirmations of actual dates by moon sighting are applied on the 29th day of the lunar month prior to Dhu al-Hijjah to announce the specific dates for both Hajj rituals and the subsequent Eid festival. The three days after the listed date are also part of the festival. The time before the listed date the pilgrims visit the Mount Arafat and descend from it after sunrise of the listed day.\n\nIn many countries, the start of any lunar Hijri month varies based on the observation of new moon by local religious authorities, so the exact day of celebration varies by locality.\n\n\n"}

As a mythological figure, Fangfeng is mostly known for arriving late for an assembly called by Yu the Great after the end of the Great Flood, and then being executed at the orders of Yu. Because Fangfeng was a giant (of nearly 10 meters/33 feet), the executioner had to build a big dike in order to reach his head. Modern myths and legends regarding Fangfeng in China tend to emphasize that Fangfeng was wrongly executed: that the reason Fangfeng was late for the assembly was that on his way there he encountered a local flood and his delay was caused by his efforts to end the flood and save the people. As a god, worship of Fangfeng was most prominent in the Six Dynasties regions of Wu and Yue (modern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai). A common depiction of Fangfeng was as one-eyed and browed, dragon-headed, and ox-eared.\n\n\n"}

As the bishops had jurisdiction over the missions to Scandinavia, it also gives a report of the Norse paganism of the period.\n\nThe existence of the work was forgotten in the later medieval period, until it was re-discovered in the late 16th century in the library of Sorø Abbey, Denmark.\n\nThe treatise consist of the following parts:\n\nThe text is one of the most important sources of Northern German and Scandinavian history and geography in the Viking Age and the beginning High Middle Ages. It covers the relations between Saxons, Wends (West Slavs) and Danes (Vikings). The third book is focused on the biography of archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg.\nAdam based his works in part on Einhard, Cassiodorus, and other earlier historians, consulting the library of the church of Bremen. The text as presented to bishop Liemar was completed in 1075/1076.\n\nAfter the death of Bishop Leuderich (838–45), the see was given to Ansgar, it lost its independence, and from that time on was permanently united with the Archdiocese of Hamburg.\nThe Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen was designated the \"Mission of the North\" and had jurisdiction over all missions in Scandinavia, and the entire scope of Viking expansion in the north (Russia, Iceland, Greenland), throughout the Viking Age, until the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen had a falling-out with the pope, and separate archbishopric for the North was established in Lund in 1105.\n\nAdam is also an important source of Viking Age Norse paganism, including the practice of human sacrifice:\nThe description of the temple at Uppsala is one of the most famous excerpts of the \"Gesta\":\n\nThe fourth book describes the geography of Scandinavia and the Baltic region.\nIt mentions numerous episcopal seats and churches, including Meldorf, Schenefeld, Verden (), Pahlen, Ratzeburg, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg in Holstein and Jumne.\nBeyond this, it gives a description of the coast of Scandinavia and of the \"northern isles\" including Iceland, Greenland and notably (in chapter 39) Vinland (North America), being the oldest extant written record of the Norse discovery of North America. Adam of Bremen had been at the court of Danish king Sven Estridson and was informed about the Viking discoveries in the North Atlantic there.\n\nAdam is believed to have come from Meissen (Latin \"Misnia\") in Saxony.\nHe was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (possibly 1081, at the latest 1085).\nFrom his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of \"Magister Adam\" shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the \"Magdeburger Domschule\".\n\nIn 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg to join the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen. Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school. Soon thereafter he began to write the history of Hamburg-Bremen and of the northern lands in his \"Gesta\".\nHis position and the missionary activity of the church of Hamburg-Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and the geography of Northern Germany. A stay at the court of Svend Estridson gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries.\n\nAccording to Schmeidler (1917), Adam created three versions of the text, in the convention of Schmeidler (1917) labelled\nNone of the three archetypes has been preserved.

The latest edition of the ICS can be downloaded free of charge from the ISO web site.\n\nAnyone may submit a proposal for modifications or additions to the ICS.\n\nThe ICS serves as a structure for catalogues and databases of technical standards and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems for international, regional and national standards.\n\nThe ICS uses an hierarchical classification, which consists of three nested levels called \"fields\" (Level 1), \"groups\" (Level 2) and \"sub-groups\" (Level 3). Each \"field\" is subdivided into \"groups\", which are further divided into \"sub-groups\".\n\nAll classification levels are designated by a classification code (called \"notation\") and a title. The notation is a set of Arabic numerals.\n\nTop-level items, which have no parent levels, use a two-digit notation, for example:\n\nThe notations for \"groups\" and \"sub-groups\" include the parent-level notations.

It supplies high quality art prints and products to museums, galleries and retail stores as well as art prints direct to consumers through its online retail site. Production is based in their factory in Newhaven, Sussex.\n\nThe company was set up in Sussex in 1982 by three brothers Gyr, Quentin and Perry King under the name King Publishing, as a silkscreen printing company. The company designed upmarket posters for art galleries and small boutique shops. The brothers negotiated the rights to works of art by new artists and photographers, as well as established artists such as Bridget Riley, Howard Hodgkin and Terry Frost.\n\nThe company rebranded to King Posters by the late 1980s with the business developing into other areas including framing and product development for museum shops such as the Tate, National Gallery, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn 1989 King Posters was making annual sales of £2 million but later that year a fire destroyed the warehouse and resulted in £3 million worth of stock being lost. The company's bank loaned an additional £5000 so the stock could be reprinted and an American supplier, Bruce McGaw, offered to replace some of the missing stock for free, which, in turn, triggered a business deal. As a result, the company was renamed in 1990 to King & McGaw.\n\nDuring the 1990s, King & McGaw's focused on turning to supplying department stores with pictures and posters as well as museums and galleries resulting in partnerships with John Lewis, Next and Debenhams. As a result, sales had reached $35 million a year by the end of 2000. Further developments occurred in 2007 when the company switched to digital printing, allowing them to print-to-order.\n\nBy 2011 the company decided to expand into retail by acquiring the online retailer Easyart.com. Easyart was set up by Simon Matthews in 1999 during the dot-com boom and in 2002 faced legal allegations from Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyJet, over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of \"passing off\" on easyGroup's good name. Easyart won the court battle when easyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had bigger targets to go after. In March 2015, the company, then under CEO and co-founder Marc Lickfett, discontinued the Easyart brand and merged the site within the King & McGaw brand.\n\nIn May 2015 King & McGaw used a pop-up shop to showcase lithographic posters from the Mourlot Studios archives on D'Arblay Street, Soho, London. Contributions from artists such as\nPicasso, Matisse, Masson,\nLeger, Miro, Le Corbusier, Yves Klein, Raoul Dufy and René Magritte were included in the exhibit. Classes in drawing with artist Anna-Louise Felstead and screen printing classes with Print Club London, a screen printing company based in Dalston\nwere also held at the shop.\n"}

{"id": "9704235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9704235", "title": "Llibre dels fets", "text": "Llibre dels fets\n\nThe Llibre dels fets (), originally spelled Libre dels feyts (literally in English: \"Book of Deeds\"), is the autobiographical chronicle of the reign of James I of Aragon (1213 – 1276). It is written in the Catalan language in the first person and is the first chronologically of the four works classified as the , all belonging to the early medieval Crown of Aragon (in the northeastern part of what is now Spain), and its first royal dynasty, the House of Barcelona. James I inherited as a child the titles of King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier, but also became by conquest King of Majorca and King of Valencia. James emphasises in his chronicles his conquest of Majorca (1229) and of Valencia (1238).\n\nJames I of Aragon dedicates a couple of chapters to his mother Maria of Montpellier and his father Peter II of Aragon (called \"Peter the Catholic\"), who had been given the title of \"Rex Catholicissimus\" by the Pope after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in which he helped Alfonso VIII of Castile fight against the Moors, one year before his death. Peter II of Aragon died defending his vassal lords of Occitania, who were accused of allowing the Cathar heresy to proliferate in their counties. He was killed in the Battle of Muret, fighting against the Crusader troops commanded by Simon de Montfort. Though the text of the \"Llibre dels fets\" was dictated and edited by James I, the actual writing was done by scribes, not James himself; it is written is colloquial language, representing the native tongue as spoken, and its style is direct.\n\nThe conquest by James I in 1229 of Majorca, one of the Balearic Islands held by the Muslim Almohads, and his consequent founding of the Kingdom of Majorca, probably inspired him to start the dictation of his chronicles, he having had an active part in the \"Reconquista\" of the Iberian Peninsula (in the context of Europe's medieval Christian Crusades). The \"Llibre dels fets\" narrative ends with James' death in 1276. Though the original is lost, many ancient copies of the codex have survived.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscript written in the original Catalan language, a copy dating to 1343, was commissioned by the abbot of the Poblet Monastery. An older manuscript dating to 1313, the \"Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum\", was the version translated into Latin from the Catalan original \"Llibre dels Feyts del Rei en Jacme\". The Latin translation is signed by the Dominican friar Pere Marsili, who was ordered by James II of Aragon (James I's grandson) to honour his grandfather's memory by promulgating his words in the internationally used Latin language.\n\nAs the title itself indicates, more than a bare chronicle, the \"Llibre dels fets\" is in fact a \"Book of Deeds\". Studies conducted in the 1980s concluded that this medieval manuscript is of an undefined literary style, since it was dictated entirely orally. James I of Aragon, a cultivated man, dictated the entire book to royal scribes, who at that point in history commonly performed the labour of actually writing the king's words with pen on paper. Its style is informal and colloquial.\n\nHere is an extract of the first lines:\n\n\"... Raconta Mon Senyor San Jaume que la fe sense obres, morta es. Aquesta paraula va voler complr Senyor en els nostres fets...\"\n\nThe principal characteristics of James' style are:\n\nIn the \"Llibre del Fets\", James I of Aragon describes his life and his most important actions, such as the conquest of the Muslim-held Valencia and Majorca. The narrative begins with his birth in 1203 and ends with his death in 1276. The prologue and epilogue are written in a different style, more erudite and perfectionist than the rest of the text, and presumably written after his death. James was generally very explicit in expressing himself, as shown in his recitation of his deeds:\n\n\"E per tal que los hòmens coneguessen, quan hauríem passada aquesta vida mortal, ço que nós hauríem fet [...] e per dar eximpli a tots los altres hòmes del món...\"\n\nIn the Latin translation of 1313 by Pere Marsili, the friar informs his readers that he has translated chapters from the manuscripts then kept in the royal archives, indicating that the texts of the chronicles already existed and that they were written in the vulgar language, i.e., not in Latin, but in Catalan.\n\nThe oldest preserved copy of the manuscript in the Catalan language is the copy ordered in 1343, more than 60 years after James' death, by the Abbot of the Poblet Monastery. The text of the Catalan manuscript is nearly identical to that of the Latin translation, but the Catalan version cannot be a copy of the Latin version, as the Catalan one is written in the first person, mainly using the majestic plural \"we\", and only a few times the singular \"I\", while the Latin version is written in the third person, using the first person in only a few quotes. This fact makes it improbable that the Catalan manuscript comes from the Latin version.\n\nThe internal structure of both versions seems to indicate two moments in time: the first part may have been dictated around 1240, shortly after James' conquest of Valencia. The facts before 1228 are explained in a brief, imprecise way even with significant errors, while from then on, the narrative shows greater detail and precision.\n\nThe supposed second part might have been dictated around 1274, and has a similar structure; the facts from 1242-1265 are condensed in a few pages, while the later years are again explicated in great detail. The prologue and the section that describes his illness and death were probably written or dictated by someone in James' trust. The Catalan copy of 1343 and the Latin translation of 1313 have left posterity the same content.\n\nThe content of the \"Llibre dels fets\", the chronicles of James I, can be divided into four parts:\n\nA didactic and justifying intention is largely reflected throughout the chronicle as a religious impulse, indicating that James I believed the execution of the work was guided by divine providence. The king, who normally desired to appear as an epic hero, not only recounts military and political history in the narrative, but also frequently mentions small details of his daily life, as well as some of his most intimate thoughts.\n\nA \"popular and vivid language\" full of proverbs and colloquial expressions is used in the chronicles, which also quote foreign personages speaking other languages such as Aragonese, Galician-Portuguese (used by the Crown of Castile), Arabic or Old French.\n\nChapter I: Prologue\n\nChapters 2–4: Ancestors\n\nChapter 5: The holiness of his conception and baptism\n\nChapters 6–7: Dedicated to his parents Peter II of Aragon \"the Catholic\" and Maria of Montpellier.\n\nChapter 8–9: Tragic death of his father King Peter II of Aragon \"the Catholic\" at the battle of Muret in 1213 defending his vassal lords, against the Frankish crusaders who were invading Occitania, in the context of the Albigensian Crusade (also called the Cathar Crusade). The Captivity of King James I of Aragon by Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, commander of the Frankish crusaders.\n\nChapter 10: Liberation of James I of Aragon, \"the Conqueror\" (he is 6 or 7 years old)\n\nChapter 11: \"Cortes de Lerida\" (Courts of Lerida)\n\nChapters 12–14: James' stay at Monzón Castle, where he was raised by the Templar Knights\n\nChapters 15–16: 1st Revolt of the Nobility\n\nChapters 17–19: Wedding with Eleanor of Castile\n\nChapters 20–25: 2nd Revolt of the Nobility\n\nChapters 26–34: 3rd Revolt of the Nobility\n\nChapters 35–46: War for the County of Urgell\n\nChapters 47–117: Conquest of Mallorca\n\nChapters 118–124: Submission of the island of Menorca (within the Balearic Islands, from the Muslim \"taifas\" by the Treaty of Capdepera\n\nChapters 125–126: Conquest of island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands, from the Muslim \"taifas\", all three islands forming the Christian Kingdom of Majorca)\n\nChapters 127–289: Southern Conquest of Valencia from the Moors' 'taifa' (formation of Kingdom of Valencia)\n\nFive codices of the text from the 14th century and two from the 15th are preserved, all based on a translation of the original Catalan text into Latin by the Dominican friar Pere Marsili at the order of King James' grandson (his namesake James II of Aragon). He intended to adapt the original text to contemporary manners and style, as can be read:\n\n[...] So that the deeds of His glorious grandfather (James I), collected in a truthful but vulgar style, shall be put to date and once translated to Latin, form a single History volume, a full chronicle in which all the actions of the king his grandfather (James I the Conqueror) will be woven together.\n\nFriar Pere Marsili finished this royal assignment on 2 April 1313, and then petitioned the king that a copy of the manuscript be made for the Friars Preachers of Majorca, his homeland, to be used on the day of the \"Feast of the Banner\":\n\n[...] with the purpose of the last day of the year, the annual feast which commemorates the conquest of the city of Majorca, for God's glory and the eternally worshiping memory of his Luckiest Prince (James I), and so the friars who preach on this significative solemn date in front of the whole clergy and people, could rely to this book, and more firmly be informed of the truth of the facts.\"\"\n\nThe official delivery of the \"Cronice Illustrissimi Regis Aragonum domini Jacobi victorissimi principis\" was made on 2 June 1314 at the Church of the Friars Preachers (\"església dels frares predicadors\") of Valencia.\n\nSix official copies of the Latin translation by Pere Marsili exist. Four dating from the 14th century (conserved respectively in the National Library of Catalonia, the Archives of the Kingdom of Majorca, the Archives of the Cathedral of Palma de Majorca and the University of Barcelona's Library). A copy from the 17th century is kept at the Archives of the Crown of Aragon and another from the 19th in the Real Academia de la Historia of Spain.\n\n\"Aquest libre féu escriure l'onrat en Ponç de Copons, per la gràcia de Déu, abbat de l'honrat monestir de Sancta Maria de Poblet, en lo qual monestir jau lo molt alt senyor En Jaume, aqueyl que aquest libre parla, dels feyts que féu ni li endevengueren en la sua vida\"\n\n(English: This book was ordered by the honorable Ponç de Copons, by God's grace, abbot of the St Maria Poblet Monastery, where there lies the most high Lord Sir James, the one about who the book tells, about the deeds and acts that he encountered in his lifetime). Friar Celestí des Torrents, who finished this manuscript on 17 September 1343.\n\nThis copy from the Poblet Monastery was made from an original manuscript owned by the Royal Chancellery. On 11 November 1343, King Peter IV of Aragon sent a letter to the abbot of the Poblet Monastery demanding the return of the original codex In 1585 King Philip II of Spain visited the Poblet Monastery and ordered a copy of the chronicle for the Royal Library of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Madrid.\nThe second Catalan codex manuscript source, dating to 1380, comes directly from the Royal Chancellery of King Peter IV of Aragon, and must be a direct copy of the original, as the king himself commanded Johan de Barbastro to make it. The text in Latin:\n\n\"Mandato serenissimi domini petri dei gratir regis Aragonum valentiae, Majoricarum, cardinieae et Corsicae, Comitisque Barchinonae, Rossilionis et Ceritaniae [...] Ego Iohannes de Barbastro de scribania predicti domini Regis Aragonum, oriundus Cesaraugustae scripsi Ciuitate Barchinonae Anno a Nativitate Dmi. Mo. CCCo. octuagesimo sripsi\"\n\nIts prologue, in Catalan, reads:\n\n\"Aquest es lo començament del prolech sobre el libre que feu el rey en Jacme per la gracia de Deu rey de Arago e de Mallorches e de Valencia, comte de Barchinona e d'Urgell e senyor de Muntpesler de tots los fets e de les gracies que Nostre Senyor li féu en la sua vida\"\n\nA relevant fact about this copy is that Johan de Barbastro used an official codex from the Royal Chancellerie (now disappeared). King Pere IV (\"the Ceremonious\") ordered three copies: one for Majorca, one for Barcelona and another for Valencia. Only the Majorcan copy has survived, and is now preserved in the National Library of Catalonia.\n\nThis first printed edition was ordered and paid for by the Jury of the city of Valencia in 1557. Made in a period of historical inquiries, once the print was finished, a copy was sent to Madrid to King Philip II of Spain (known by the Catalans as Philip II of Castile) from the House of Habsburg, who had also been very interested in the manuscript codex kept in the Poblet Monastery. \nOther manuscripts have survived, all copies of the one made for the Poblet Monastery in 1343. There is one relevant codex between them conserved in the library of the University of Barcelona made by student Jaume Ferrera by order of his master, Prior Jaume Ramon Vila, who added a prologue, which is its singular feature. The Prior explains the reason he ordered the present copy of the \"Llibre dels fets,\" was \"to deny the forgery issues that Castilian historians were throwing at Catalans\". He indicates as well that the illustrations are faithful copies of the manuscript dated 1343 from the Poblet Monastery. The other relevant feature of this codex is the second original illustration that did not survive from the Poblet manuscript. In this picture we can see the Mayor of the Palace, Hugh de Forcalquier, and Blasco de Alagón kneeling before James I.\n\n"}

{"id": "11888310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11888310", "title": "Mummia", "text": "Mummia\n\nMummia, mumia, or originally mummy referred to several different preparations in the history of medicine, from \"mineral pitch\" to \"powdered human mummies\". It originated from Arabic \"mūmiyā\" \"a type of resinous bitumen found in Western Asia and used curatively\" in traditional Islamic medicine, which was translated as \"pissasphaltus\" (from \"pitch\" and \"asphalt\") in ancient Greek medicine. In medieval European medicine, \"mūmiyā\" \"bitumen\" was transliterated into Latin as \"mumia\" meaning both \"a bituminous medicine from Persia\" and \"mummy\". Merchants in apothecaries dispensed expensive mummia bitumen, which was thought to be an effective cure-all for many ailments. Beginning around the 12th century when supplies of imported natural bitumen ran short, mummia was misinterpreted as \"mummy\", and the word's meaning expanded to \"a black resinous exudate scraped out from embalmed Egyptian mummies\". This began a period of lucrative trade between Egypt and Europe, and suppliers substituted rare mummia exudate with entire mummies, either embalmed or desiccated. After Egypt banned the shipment of mummia in the 16th century, unscrupulous European apothecaries began to sell fraudulent mummia prepared by embalming and desiccating fresh corpses. During the Renaissance, scholars proved that translating bituminous mummia as mummy was a mistake, and physicians stopped prescribing the ineffective drug. Lastly, artists in the 17-19th centuries used ground up mummies to tint a popular oil-paint called mummy brown.\n\nThe etymologies of both English \"mummia\" and \"mummy\" derive from Medieval Latin \"mumia\", which transcribes Arabic \"mūmiyā\" \"a kind of bitumen used medicinally; a bitumen-embalmed body\" from mūm \"wax (used in embalming)\", which descend from Persian \"mumiya\" and \"mum\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records the complex semantic history of \"mummy\" and \"mummia\". \"Mummy\" was first recorded meaning \"a medicinal preparation of the substance of mummies; hence, an unctuous liquid or gum used medicinally\" (c. 1400), which Shakespeare used jocularly for \"dead flesh; body in which life is extinct\" (1598), and later \"a pulpy substance or mass\" (1601). Second, it was semantically extended to mean \"a sovereign remedy\" (1598), \"a medicinal bituminous drug obtained from Arabia and the East\" (1601), \"a kind of wax used in the transplanting and grafting of trees\" (1721), and \"a rich brown bituminous pigment\" (1854). The third \"mummy\" meaning was \"the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial\" (1615), and \"a human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air\" (1727). \"Mummia\" was originally used in \"mummy\"'s first meaning \"a medicinal preparation…\" (1486), then in the second meaning \"a sovereign remedy\" (1741), and lastly to specify \"in mineralogy, a sort of bitumen, or mineral pitch, which is soft and tough, like shoemaker's wax, when the weather is warm, but brittle, like pitch, in cold weather. It is found in Persia, where it is highly valued\" (1841). In modern English usage, \"mummy\" commonly means \"embalmed body\" as distinguished from \"mummia\" \"a medicine\" in historical contexts.\n\n\"Mummia\" or \"mumia\" is defined by three English mineralogical terms. \"Bitumen\" (from Latin \"bitūmen\") originally meant \"a kind of mineral pitch found in Palestine and Babylon, used as mortar, etc. The same as asphalt, mineral pitch, Jew's pitch, \"Bitumen judaicum\"\", and in modern scientific use means \"the generic name of certain mineral inflammable substances, native hydrocarbons more or less oxygenated, liquid, semi-solid, and solid, including naphtha, petroleum, asphalt, etc.\" \"Asphalt\" (from Ancient Greek \"ásphaltos\" \"asphalt, bitumen”) first meant \"A bituminous substance, found in many parts of the world, a smooth, hard, brittle, black or brownish-black resinous mineral, consisting of a mixture of different hydrocarbons; called also mineral pitch, Jews' pitch, and in the [Old Testament] 'slime'\", and presently means \"A composition made by mixing bitumen, pitch, and sand, or manufactured from natural bituminous limestones, used to pave streets and walks, to line cisterns, etc.\", used as an abbreviation for asphalt concrete. Until the 20th century, the Latinate term \"asphaltum\" was also used. \"Pissasphalt\" (from Greek \"pissasphaltus\" \"pitch\" and \"asphalt\") names \"A semi-liquid variety of bitumen, mentioned by ancient writers\".\n\nThe medicinal use of bituminous mummia has a parallel in Ayurveda: \"shilajit\" or \"silajit\" (from Sanskrit \"shilajatu\" \"rock-conqueror\") or \"mumijo\" (from Persian \"mūmiyā\" \"wax\") is \"A name given to various solid or viscous substances found on rock in India and Nepal … esp. a usu. dark-brown odoriferous substance which is used in traditional Indian medicine and probably consists principally of dried animal urine\".\n\nThe chronicle of how mummia became \"a lengthy and unusual chapter in the history of medicine\" began with the famous Persian \"mumiya\" black pissasphalt remedy for wounds and fractures, which was confused with similarly appearing black bituminous materials used in Egyptian mummification, then was misinterpreted by Medieval Latin translators to mean whole mummies, and further complicated by greed for profitable fake mummy drugs.\n\nBitumen or asphalt had many uses in the ancient world such as glue, mortar, and waterproofing. The ancient Egyptians began to use bitumen for embalming mummies during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BCE).\n\nAccording to historians of pharmacy, mummia became part of the materia medica of the Arabs, discussed by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (845-925) and Ibn al-Baitar (1197-1248). Medieval Arab physicians used bitumen/asphalt both as a salve for cuts, bruises, and bone fractures, and as an internal medicine for stomach ulcers and tuberculosis. They achieved the best results with a black pissasphalt that seeped from a mountain in Darabgerd, Persia. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides' c. 50-70 \"De Materia Medica\" ranked bitumen from the Dead Sea as medicinally superior to the pissasphalt from Apollonia (Illyria), both of which were considered to be an equivalent substitute for the scarce and expensive Persian \"mumiya\".\n\nDuring the Crusades, European soldiers learned firsthand of the drug mummia, which was considered to have great healing powers in cases of fracture and rupture. The demand for mummia increased in Europe and since the supply of natural bitumen from Persia and the Dead Sea was limited, the search for a new source turned to the tombs of Egypt.\n\nMisinterpreting the Latin word \"mumia\" \"medicinal bitumen\" involved several steps. The first was to substitute substances exuded by Egyptian mummies for the natural product. The Arab physician Serapion the Younger (fl. 12th century) wrote about bituminous mumia and its many uses, but the Latin translation of Simon Geneunsis (d. 1303) said, \"Mumia, this is the mumia of the sepulchers with aloes and myrrh mixed with the liquid (humiditate) of the human body\". Two 12th century Italian examples: Gerard of Cremona, mistakenly translated Arabic \"mumiya\" as \"the substance found in the land where bodies are buried with aloes by which the liquid of the dead, mixed with the aloes, is transformed and it is similar to marine pitch\", and the physician Matthaeus Platearius said \"Mumia is a spice found in the sepulchers of the dead... That is best which is black, ill-smelling, shiny, and massive\".\n\nThe second step was to confuse and replace the rare black exudation from embalmed corpses with the black bitumen that Egyptians used as an embalming preservative. The Baghdad physician Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (1162–1231) described ancient Egyptian mummies, \"In the belly and skull of these corpses is also found in great abundance called mummy\", added that although the word properly denoted bitumen or asphalt, \"The mummy found in the hollows of the corpses in Egypt, differs but immaterially from the nature of mineral mummy; and where any difficulty arises in procuring the latter, may be substituted in its stead.\" \n\nThe third step in misinterpreting \"mummia\" was to substitute the blackened flesh of an entire mummy for the hardened bituminous materials from the interior cavities of the cadavers. The ancient tombs of Egypt and the deserts could not meet the European demand for the drug mumia, so a commerce developed in the manufacture and sale of fraudulent mummies, sometimes called \"mumia falsa\". The Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (1450-1525) defined mumia as \"The flesh of a dead body that is embalmed, and it is hot and dry in the second [grade], and therefore it has virtue to incarne [i.e., heal over] wounds and to staunch blood\", and included it in his list of essential drugs.\nThe Swiss-German polymath Paracelsus (1493-1541) gave mummia a new meaning of \"intrinsic spirit\" and said true pharmaceutical mummia must be \"the body of a man who did not die a natural death but rather died an unnatural death with a healthy body and without sickness\". The German physician Oswald Croll (1563-1609) said mumia was \"not the liquid matter which is found in the Egyptian sepulchers,\" but rather \"the flesh of a man that perishes a violent death, and kept for some time in the air\", and gave a detailed recipe for making tincture of mumia from the corpse of a young red-haired man, who had been hanged, bludgeoned on the breaking wheel, exposed to the air for days, then cut into small pieces, sprinkled with powdered myrrh and aloes, soaked in wine, and dried.\n\nRenaissance scholars and physicians first expressed opposition to using human mumia in the 16th century. The French naturalist Pierre Belon (1517-1564) concluded that the Arab physicians, from whom the western writers derived their knowledge of mumia, had actually referred to the pissasphalt of Dioscorides, which had been misconstrued by the translators. He said Europeans were importing both the \"falsely called\" mumia obtained from the scraping the bodies of cadavers, and \"artificial mumia\" made by exposing buried dead bodies to the heat of the sun before grinding them up. While he considered the available mumia to be a valueless and even dangerous drug, he noted that King Francis I always carried with him a mixture of mumia and rhubarb to use as an immediate remedy for any injury. The barber surgeon Ambroise Paré (d. 1590) revealed the manufacture of fake mummia both in France, where apothecaries would steal the bodies of executed criminals, dry them in an oven, and sell the flesh; and in Egypt, where a merchant, who admitted collecting dead bodies and preparing mummia, expressed surprise that the Christians, \"so dainty-mouthed, could eat the bodies of the dead\". Paré admitted to having personally administered mumia a hundred times, but condemned \"this wicked kinde of Drugge, doth nothing helpe the diseased,\" and so he stopped prescribing it and encouraged others not to use mumia. The English herbalist John Gerard's 1597 \"Herball\" described the ancient Egyptians using cedar pitch for embalming, and noted that the preserved bodies that shopkeepers falsely call \"mumia\" should be what the Greeks called \"pissasphalton\". Gerard blamed the error on the translator of Serapion who interpreted mumia \"according to his own fancie\" that it is the exudate from an embalmed human corpse.\n\nThe medical use of Egyptian mumia continued through the 17th century. The physicist Robert Boyle (1627-1691) praised it as \"one of the useful medicines commended and given by our physicians for falls and bruises, and in other cases too.\" The Dutch physician Steven Blankaart's 1754 \"Lexicon medicum renovatum\" listed four types of mumia: Arabian exudate from bodies embalmed with spices and asphalt, Egyptian bodies embalmed with pissasphalt, sun-dried bodies found in the desert, the natural pissasphalt. Mummia's familiarity as a remedy in Britain is demonstrated by passing references in Shakespeare, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, and John Donne, and also by more detailed remarks in the writings of Thomas Browne, Francis Bacon, and Robert Boyle.\n\nBy the 18th century, skepticism about the pharmaceutical value of mumia was increasing, and medical opinion was turning against its use. The English medical writer John Quincy wrote in 1718 that although mumia was still listed in medicinal catalogues, \"it is quite out of use in Prescription\". Mummia was offered for sale medicinally as late as 1924 in the price list of Merck & Co..\n\nBoth mummia and asphalt have long been used as pigments. The British chemist and painter Arthur Herbert Church described the use of mummia for making \"mummy brown\" oil paint:\n'Mummy,' as a pigment, is inferior to prepared, but superior to raw, asphalt, inasmuch as it has been submitted to a considerable degree of heat, and has thereby lost some of its volatile hydrocarbons. Moreover, it is usual to grind up the bones and other parts of the mummy together, so that the resulting powder has more solidity and is less fusible than the asphalt alone would be. A London colourman informs me that one Egyptian mummy furnishes sufficient material to satisfy the demands of his customers for twenty years. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that some samples of the pigment sold as 'mummy' are spurious. \nThe modern pigment sold as \"mummy brown\" is composed of a mixture of kaolin, quartz, goethite and hematite.\n\n\n"}

It was developed and employed after the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula by the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nBy law, the category of New Christian included not only recent converts, but also all their known baptized descendants with any fraction or quantum of New Christian blood up to the fourth generation, and then in Phillip II's reign it included any person with any fraction of New Christian blood \"from time immemorial\".\n\nIn Portugal, it was only in 1772 that Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal, finally decreed an end to the legal distinction between New Christians and Old Christians.\n\nAlthough the category of New Christian is meaningless in Christian theology, it was nevertheless introduced by the Old Christians who claimed \"pure unmixed\" Spanish European bloodlines.\n\nThe Old Christians wanted to legally and socially distinguish themselves from the New Christian conversos (converts to Christianity), who they considered to be tainted by virtue of their non-Spanish bloodlines, even though in the case of Muslims, the overwhelming majority of Spain's Muslims were also of indigenous Iberian stock, themselves the descendants of native Iberians who earlier converted to Islam under Muslim rule.\n\nIn practice, for New Christians of Jewish origin, the conception of New Christian was a legal mechanism and manifestation of racial antisemitism, being a prejudice against Jews as a racial/ethnic group, rather than Judaism as a religion. For those of Moorish origin, it was a manifestation of racial anti-Berberism and/or anti-Arabism.\n\nThe related Spanish development of an ideology of limpieza de sangre (cleanliness of blood) also excluded New Christians from society — universities, emigration to the New World, many professions — regardless of their sincerity as converts.\n\nOther derogatory terms applied to each of the converting groups included marranos (i.e. \"pigs\") for New Christians of Jewish origin, and moriscos (a term which carried pejorative connotations) for New Christians of Andalusian origin.\n\nAside from social stigma and ostracism, the consequences of legal or social categorization as a New Christian included restrictions of civil and political rights, abuses of those already-limited civil rights, social and sometimes legal restrictions on who one could marry (anti-miscegenation laws), social restrictions on where one could live, legal restrictions of entry into the professions and the clergy, legal restrictions and prohibition of immigration to and settlement in the newly colonized Spanish territories in the Americas, deportation from the colonies.\n\nIn addition to the above restrictions and discrimination endured by New Christians, the Spanish Crown and Church authorities also subjected New Christians to persecution, prosecution and capital punishment for actual or alleged practice of the family's former religion.\n\nAfter the Alhambra Decree of expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain in 1492 and a similar Portuguese decree in 1497, the remaining Jewish population in Iberia became officially Christian by default. The New Christians, especially those of Jewish origin, were always under suspicion of being \"judaizantes\" (\"judaizers\"), that is, apostizing from the Christian religion and being active crypto-Jews.\n\nDespite the discrimination and legal restrictions, many Jewish-origin New Christians found ways of circumventing these restrictions for emigration and settlement in the Iberian colonies of the New World, by falsifying or buying \"cleanliness of blood\" documentation, or attaining perjured affidavits attesting to untainted Old Christian pedigrees. The descendants of these, who could not return to Judaism, became the modern-day Christian-professing Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Latin America (it is only in the modern era that a nascent community, the Neo-Western Sephardim, is currently returning to Judaism from among this population).\n\nAlso as a result of the unceasing trials and persecutions by the Inquisition, other Jewish-origin New Christians opted to migrate out of the Iberian Peninsula in a continuous flow between the 1600s to 1800's towards Amsterdam, and also London, whereupon in their new tolerant environment of refuge outside the Iberian cultural sphere they eventually returned to Judaism. The descendants of these became the Spanish and Portuguese Jews (also known more ambiguously in the Netherlands as Spanish and Portuguese Jews, among other names elsewhere).\n\nAlthough Iberian Muslims were protected in the treaty signed at the fall of Granada, and the New Christian descendants of former Muslims weren't expelled until over a century later, even so, in the meantime, different waves of Iberian Muslims and New Christians of Moorish origin left and settled across North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, Sephardim (Iberian Jews) and Moros (Iberian Muslims) sometimes converted to Christianity, usually as the result of coercion: physical, economic, and social pressures.\n\nIn the 14th century there was increasing pressure, especially against the Jews, that culminated in the riots of 1391 in Seville and other cities in which many Jews were massacred. These riots caused the destruction of the Aljamas (Jewish quarters) of the cities and sparked many conversions, a trend that continued throughout the 15th century.\n\nUnlike the other Iberian kingdoms, Portugal was not much affected by the waves of riots. However, there, the Jews remaining on Portuguese soil were forcefully converted in 1497, after which New Christians became a numerous part of the population.\n\nThe governments of Spain and Portugal created the Spanish Inquisition in 1478 and the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536 as a way of dealing with social tensions, supposedly justified by the need to fight heresy. Communities believed correctly that many New Christians were secretly practicing their former religions to any extent possible, becoming crypto-Jews and crypto-Muslims.\n\nAfter conversion, New Christians of Jewish origin generally adopted Christian given names and Old Christian surnames. Eventually, all Old Christian given names and surnames were in use by New Christians of Jewish origin.\n\nAmong descendants of Sephardic Jews today, there are three categories of descendants:\nGenerally, it is only those who descend from group 1 who carry surnames which typically identify the surname-carrier as a person of Jewish origins. The other descendants of Sephardic Jews (those from group 2, and especially those from group 3) almost always carry \"Old Christian\" Spanish or Portuguese surnames because they became nominal Christians, whether intermittently or permanently.\n\nFor group 3 especially, only a very and extremely limited number of surnames carried by modern-day Spanish, Portuguese, Hispanics and Brazilians who descend from Jewish New Christians are surnames which are exclusively Jewish \"New Christian\" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the surname-carrier. The great majority of their surnames are, per se, Old Christian surnames, and these surnames alone cannot indicate a Jewish origin without accompanying genealogical documentation, family traditions and customs, and/or Genealogical DNA testing.\n\nAlthough it is true that a few surnames became popularly adopted by New Christians (including, for example the surname Pérez, because of its similarity to the Hebrew surname Peretz), such popularly adopted surnames by New Christians remain Old Christian surnames in origin, and carrying these surnames does not indicate Jewish ancestry by itself.\n\nThis phenomenon is much the same as is the situation with surnames which are typically considered to be Ashkenazi \"Jewish\" surnames. Most \"Jewish\" surnames among Ashkenazi Jews are not in fact \"Jewish\" per se, but are simply German or Slavic surnames (including so-called \"Jewish\" names like \"Goldberg\") which were adopted by Ashkenazi Jews, some of which became so overwhelmingly carried by Jews that they came to be seen as \"Jewish\", although there are gentile carriers of those same surnames, because it is with those gentile families that the surnames originated to begin with. Only some surnames found among Ashkenazi Jews today are surnames which are exclusively \"Jewish\" surnames being capable of, on their own, indicating Jewish origins of the carrier.\n\n\n"}

It supported Yugoslav nationalism, promoted the creation of a corporatist state, and attacked communism, democracy, Jews, separatists, Croatian nationalists, and Serbian nationalists. Its leader was Milan Pribićević. It is believed to have been influenced by fascism. It was created in Split, in 1921, in order to fight communist insurgency and Croat separatism.\n\nORJUNA was founded in March 1921 in Split by the royal administrator of Croatia and funded by the provincial government to secure Yugoslavia from threats posed by communists, separatists, and other persons deemed threatening to the state. The first president was Marko Nani and the first secretary Edo Bulat. The first actions organized by JNNO were demonstrations against communists because of the communist assassination of the Minister of Interior Milorad Drašković. JNNO organized demonstrations in Split, Zagreb and Osijek. In Zagreb, JNNO members even demolished offices of newspapers that blamed the government for assassination.\n\nIt was particularly influential in areas of Slovenia and Croatia that were of interest to Italian and Austrian irredentism as well as in areas where ethnic minorities where viewed to be powerful or separatist, such as Hungarians in Vojvodina. The membership of the movement was ethnically mixed of the various Yugoslav nationalities. However most of its members were Croats from Dalmatia. It ran its own newspapers, had an academic club, a labour organization, a high school students wing \"Young Yugoslavia\", and a paramilitary organization, the Action Section.\n\nAfter 1922 people of all age groups started to join the organization, which changed its name in May 1922 to ORJUNA. ORJUNA's main political goal was maintaining a unitary Yugoslav state. Its members clashed with Austrian and Italian border patrols. ORJUNA never participated directly in elections but its supporters voted for Yugoslav oriented parties. In 1929, when the King proclaimed his personal dictatorship and disbanded the parliament, ORJUNA supported the King's action, but because the King outlawed all political parties and organizations ORJUNA ceased to exist.\n\nBy 1925, ORJUNA's Action Groups accounted for 10,000 people.\n\nThe primary ideological component of ORJUNA was Yugoslav nationalism, as opposed to particularist/chauvinist tendencies.\nORJUNA is believed to have been influenced by fascism in that like the original Italian Fascism had a similar organizational structure including a Yugoslav version of the \"Duce\" (\"Leader\"), titled \"Vođa\" and like Italian Fascism it glorified violence, including in its mottoes \"Victory or Death\" and \"Whoever is not with us, is against us!\".\n\n\n"}

He was found guilty and sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nBy the 1950s, Rastafari's message of pride and unity had unnerved the ruling class of Jamaica. In 1954, the Pinnacle commune was destroyed by Jamaican authorities.\n\nAttitudes began to change when Haile Selassie I visited Jamaica in April 1966.\n\nAccording to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. They contrast it to alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.\n\nIn 1998, Attorney General of the United States Janet Reno gave a legal opinion that Rastafari do not have the religious right to smoke marijuana in violation of the United States' drug laws. The position is the same in the United Kingdom, where, in the Court of Appeal case of R. v. Taylor [2002] 10 million. App. R. 37, it was held that the UK's prohibition on cannabis use did not contravene the right to freedom of religion conferred under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nOn January 2, 1991, at an international airport in his homeland of Guam, Ras Iyah Ben Makahna (Benny Guerrero) was arrested for possession and importation of marijuana and seeds. He was charged with importation of a controlled substance. The case was heard by the US 9th Circuit Court November 2001, and in May 2002 the court had decided that the practice of Rastafari sanctions the smoking of marijuana, but nowhere does the religion sanction the importation of marijuana. Guerrero's lawyer Graham Boyd pointed out that the court's ruling was \"equivalent to saying wine is a necessary sacrament for some Christians but you have to grow your own grapes.\"\n\nIn July 2008, however, the Italian Supreme Court ruled that Rastafari may be allowed to possess greater amounts of cannabis legally, owing to its use by them as a sacrament.\n\nIn 2009, Rasta Doug Darrell was arrested after a National Guard helicopter flying over his New Hampshire home found he was growing 15 marijuana plants in his backyard. In a subsequent trial in September 2012, Darrell was found \"not guilty\" by twelve jurors exercising the right of jury nullification.\n\nSacramental use of Cannabis in celebration of the Rastafari faith became legal in Jamaica on April 15, 2015.\n\n"}

It is a humoristic adventure strip about two friends, Piet Pienter and Bert Bibber and their female friend Susan.\n\nIt was published in the Flemish dialect and notable for being one of the few comics series to never fully adapt the standard Dutch language and, apart from the final album, remained published in black-and-white. Creator Pom also enjoyed making puns and drawing funny signs in the background, often spoofing well known advertisements. For instance: \"Oma wast beter\" (literally: \"Grandma does the laundry better\", a pun on the detergent brand \"Omo\"). He was particularly notorious for adding ironic commentary about his own stories while narrating the story.\n\n\"Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber\" 's popularity was considerable, but proved to be mostly a local Flemish phenomenon; being published in Antwerp newspapers, it was above all popular in that area. Over the years Pom started to dislike his profession, causing new albums to appear less and less frequent. In 1995 the series was terminated, because a certain type of paper that he used for all his stories wasn't produced anymore. Since Pom strongly disliked giving interviews or providing any sort of media attention to himself or his characters \"Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber\", the series faded somewhat out of public view over the decades, despite being fondly remembered by many comics fans.\n\nThe first story was published in 1950, in the Antwerp newspaper \"Het Handelsblad\". From the tenth album on, in 1955, all stories were pre-published in the daily \"Gazet van Antwerpen\". The albums were published by Uitgeverij De Vlijt, who also published that newspaper. In 1995 the final story was published by Standaard Uitgeverij, who took over the reprints of all the previous albums too.\n\nIn 2010 comics artist Tom Bouden drew a homage album about \"Piet Pienter en Bert Bibber\". He received official permission to use the characters, provided that it remained a one-shot album.

The message of declaration was sent by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman just before his incarceration by the Pakistani Army and later on March 27, it was broadcast by Major Ziaur Rahman on behalf of Sheikh Mujib. The declaration was widely circulated in the international press in late March 1971. On 17 April, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh issued a proclamation on the basis of the previous declaration and established an interim constitution for the independence movement.\n\nOn 25 March 1971, negotiations between Pakistani President Yahya Khan and Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman broke down after Khan refused to accept Rahman's plan for a new federal constitution in Pakistan. Rahman's party won an absolute majority in the National Assembly during Pakistan's first free election in 1970. However, the newly elected parliament was barred from taking power due to objections from the Pakistani military and the West Pakistan establishment. The Awami League's 6 points proposal for a Pakistani federation was strongly opposed by bureaucrats and senior politicians like Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in West Pakistan. The League initiated a civil disobedience campaign in East Pakistan to press for convening the parliament, amid rising Bengali aspirations for self-determination and independence. On 7 March 1971, Rahman addressed a huge pro-independence rally in Dhaka. Yahya Khan and Bhutto were in the city throughout March for negotiations. The political process was abruptly ended by President Khan, who faced pressure from the military for a crackdown.\n\nIn the evening of 25 March, Mujib convened a meeting of senior Bengali nationalist leaders, including Tajuddin Ahmad and Colonel M A G Osmani, at his residence in Dhanmondi. They were briefed by Bengali insiders within the military of an impending crackdown. The nationalist leaders decided to form a provisional government in exile in India and launch an armed struggle for independence. However, Mujib decided to remain in Dhaka and brave the looming crackdown, despite pleas by the others to join them in India. Bidding farewell to the leaders, Mujib said \"I have given you independence. Now go and preserve it \".\n\nOn the night of 25 March, the Pakistan Armed Forces launched Operation Searchlight in the capital of East Pakistan. Tanks rolled out on the streets of Dhaka. The troops were said to have massacred students and intellectuals in Dhaka University, as well as many civilians in other parts of the city. It set Hindu neighbourhoods ablaze and crushed resistance from the police and the East Pakistan Rifles. At midnight, Mujib sent a wireless telegram to Chittagong instructing Awami League leaders to declare independence. The text of his telegram read:-\n\nThe Pakistani military proceeded to arrest Mujib from his residence around 1 am.. Just before his arrest, Mujib sent his telegraph-message for 'Declaration of Bangladeshi Independence'. \nAt 2.30 pm on 26 March 1971, Awami League leader M A Hannan began broadcasting Mujib's declaration of independence over the Independent Bangladesh Radio Station in Chittagong, which was widely reported in the international press. The text of the declaration read:-\n\nOn 27 March, Major Ziaur Rahman, the commander of the East Bengal Regiment in Chittagong, broadcast two declarations on behalf of Sheikh Mujib.

It read the following:-\n\nZia's broadcasts were picked by a Japanese ship anchored in Chittagong Port and transmitted to Radio Australia.\n\nOn 17 April 1971, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh was formed in Mujibnagar.

The case was an application for a ruling in terms of section 58 of the Criminal and Magistrates' Courts Procedure (Amendment) Act, in respect of a decision by the Magistrate of Eshowe.\n\nAn accused person drove his cattle to be dipped in a township dip, but was prevented from dipping them by the township foreman, because he had not complied with a by-law which provided that no person should use the dipping tank except upon production of coupons previously purchased entitling him to do so.

The exact date of its writing is not known, but it is estimated the text was written in the 11th or 12th century. It is speculated that \"Ratirahasya\" was written to please a king by the name Venudutta. Kokkoka describes himself in the book as \"siddha patiya pandita\", i.e. \"an ingenious man among learned men\". The manual was written in Sanskrit.\n\nUnlike the \"Kama Sutra\", which is an ancient sex manual related to Hindu literature, \"Ratirahasya\" deals with medieval Indian society. During the medieval age, India became more conservative compared to ancient India, freedom of women decreased, and premarital and extramarital sex were frowned upon. A sex manual was needed that would be suitable for the medieval cultural climate, and \"Ratirahasya\" was written, quite different from the ancient text \"Kama Sutra\".\n\nThere are fifteen \"pachivedes\" (chapters) and 800 verses in \"Ratirahasya\" which deal with various topics such as different physiques, lunar calendar, different types of genitals, characteristics of women of various ages, hugs, kisses, sexual intercourse and sex positions, sex with a strange woman, etc. Kokokka describes various stages of love in \"Ratirahasya\", the fifth stage being weight loss, the ninth is fainting, and the tenth and last stage is death. \"Ratirahasya\" makes classifications of women, and describes erogenous zones and days that lead to women's easy arousal.\n\n\"Ratirahasya\" is the first book to describe in detail Indian feminine beauty. The book classified women into four psycho-physical types, according to their appearance and physical features.\n\nOn the basis of the size of the genitals, the text classifies sexual intercourse into nine different types. Aphrodisiacs are also described in the book.\n\nAccording to W.G. Archer, Kokkoka \"is concerned with how to make the most of sex, how to enjoy it and how to keep a woman happy.\" In writing this text, Kokokka depended on a number of other authors including, among others Nandikeshvara, Gonikaputra, and Vatsyayana.\n\nArabic, Persian and Turkish translations of the book are entitled \"Lizzat-al-Nissa\". Alex Comfort, author of \"The Joy of Sex\", made an English translation of \"Ratirahasya\" in 1964 titled \"The Koka Shashtra, Being the Ratirahasya of Kokkoka, and Other Medieval Indian Writings on Love\" (London: George Allen and Unwin). Another English translation was made by S. C. Upadhyaya, entitled \"Kokashastra (Rati Rahasya) of Pundit Kokkoka\". Some commentaries have been written on this text by Avana Rama Chandra, Kavi Prabhu, and Harihara. It is a popular text in India, second only to the \"Kama Sutra\" among sex manuals.\n"}

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year at the 73rd Academy Awards, and received 27 awards from film festivals around the world.\n\n\"Rejected\" is now considered a cult classic and one of the most influential animated films ever made, especially after it found its way onto the internet in the early 2000s and became a viral sensation. In 2009, it was the only short film named as one of the \"Films of the Decade\" by \"Salon\". In 2010, it was noted as one of the five \"most innovative animated films of the past ten years\" by \"The Huffington Post\". \"Indiewire\" film critic Eric Kohn named \"Rejected\" one of the \"10 best films of the 21st century\" on his list for the BBC Culture poll in 2016.\n\nA fictional frame story explains that Hertzfeldt was commissioned to do animated segments for commercials and television network interstitials, but they were all rejected upon receipt. This is followed by a collection of short, surreal vignettes, presented as a reel of rejected corporate advertising work. According to the frame story, Hertzfeldt was assigned to do commercial segments for the Family Learning Channel, which were rejected after review. He would later do commercials for the Johnson & Mills Corporation, which were rejected outright. After the Johnson & Mills Corporation advertisements, the frame story states that Hertzfeldt began finishing commercials and shorts with his left hand. After the short segments, the story says that the rejected cartoons were running out of control, and later on fell apart. The animator begins to break down mentally and the animated world he created literally begins to (like the frame story said) fall apart, brutally killing all of his characters in the process.\n\nHertzfeldt's first film after graduating from college, \"Rejected\" was photographed on a 35mm rostrum camera he purchased in 1999.\n\n\"Rejected\" features simple hand-drawn artwork, featuring mostly black pen animation on a white background with occasional use of color. As the film progresses and the fictionalized animator begins to fall apart, the drawings become more crude and the animation becomes more erratic. As the film concludes, the paper that the animation is drawn on begins to crumple and tear, and the characters are seen struggling to evade the destruction.\n\nBesides the iconic \"Allegro ma non troppo\" from Beethoven's 9th that plays in the text introductions to each segment, a particular segment with the \"Fluffy Guys\" uses background music from the Swedish Christmas song \"Nu är det jul igen\".\n\nAlthough the film is fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done any advertising work, he did receive many offers to do television commercials after \"Billy's Balloon\" received international attention and acclaim. In appearances he would often tell the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he could come up with for the companies, run off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually this became the germ for \"Rejected\"'s theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator's breakdown.\n\nHertzfeldt has never accepted \"real\" advertising work and has stated numerous times on his website and in public appearances that he never will, as he feels advertisements are \"lies\" and he does not want to lie to his audience.\n\n\"Rejected\" world-premiered at the San Diego Comic Convention in 2000. Between hundreds of film festival appearances since then, \"Rejected\" also toured North American theaters in 2000, 2001, and 2002 with Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation; in 2001 and 2002 again with a retrospective touring program of Hertzfeldt's and animator Bill Plympton's films called \"The Don and Bill Show\"; and returned to theaters once again in 2003 and 2004 with Hertzfeldt's own the Animation Show tour.\n\nIn 2003, two of the \"Fluffy Guy\" characters reappeared in three Hertzfeldt cartoons created to introduce and book-end the first year of the Animation Show: \"Welcome to the Show\", \"Intermission in the Third Dimension\", and \"the End of the Show\".\n\n\"Rejected\" was scheduled to air on Adult Swim in 2001 but was delayed for unknown reasons—it was rescheduled to air in November 2002 \"uncut and commercial free\", and was heavily promoted on the network that week. However, the short was pulled from the schedule at the last minute, for unknown reasons. Rumors about the reasons behind this highly unusual action have included: the film's brief use of the phrase \"Sweet Jesus\" (\"Jesus\" being a word allegedly not allowed on a Turner Network back then), and an anonymous high-ranking network executive simply not finding the short to be funny. \"Rejected\" has since aired without incident on the Cartoon Network in other countries as well as on other international television networks, but has to date never been broadcast on American television. However, a brief clip from the film has since aired on the Adult Swim anthology series \"Off the Air\", 14 years later, in the episode Holes. The scene mentioned in the episode is the scene with the \"fluffy guys\" in which one announces that his \"anus is bleeding.\"\n\n\"Rejected\" returned to movie theaters in 2006 as part of the Sundance Institute's 25th anniversary \"Art House Project\", a special screening series of Sundance films for local audiences nationwide. \"Rejected\" was one of 5 shorts and 25 features from Sundance's history selected as \"essential\" and representative of the spirit of the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nMost recently, the film returned to theaters in 20082009 as part of the \"Evening with Don Hertzfeldt\" screening series.\n\nEver since its original theatrical run, the film has been a very popular target for Internet bootlegs, and in 2001 Bitter Films released a limited edition DVD \"single\" to give fans a proper alternative. Hertzfeldt has stated on the Bitter Films website that his concern with bootlegs has always been over quality control issues, and never a financial one. The DVD \"single\" featured a deleted scene as well as an audio commentary, and is now out of print.\n\nIn 2006, \"Rejected\" was remastered and restored in high definition for inclusion on the DVD, \"Bitter Films Volume 1\", a compilation of Don Hertzfeldt's short films from 1995–2005. Special features on this DVD relating to \"Rejected\" include a new text commentary by Hertzfeldt (via closed-caption boxes), footage from the abandoned cartoon \"the Spanky the Bear Show\" that later evolved into a central scene in the film, original pencil tests, the 2001 audio commentary, and dozens of pages devoted to Hertzfeldt's original sketches, storyboards, notes, and deleted ideas from the film. The DVD is available exclusively from the Bitter Films website.\n\nA 35-second deleted scene from \"Rejected\" was only released on the 2001 DVD \"single\". In it, a father inquires into his son's desire to drink goat's blood. The scene appears to fit in with the \"Johnson & Mills\" portion of the original film, and is revealed to be an advertisement for cotton-swabs at the end.\n\n\n"}

Representation class is sometimes used as a synonym for representation term.\n\nIn ISO/IEC 11179, a \"representation class\" provides a way to classify or group data elements. A \"representation class\" is effectively a specialized classification scheme. Hence, there is currently some discussion in ISO over the merits of keeping representation class as a separate entity in 11179, versus collapsing it into the general classification scheme facility. A clear distinction between the two mechanisms, however, is that 11179 allows a data element to be classified by only one representation class, whereas there is no such restriction on other classification schemes.\n\nISO/IEC 11179 does not specify that \"representation terms\" should be drawn from the values of \"representation class\", though it would make sense to do so, nor does it provide any mechanism to ensure any sort of consistency (whatever that might mean) between the representation terms used to name a data element, and the representation class used to classify it.\n\nThe term \"representation class\" has been used in metadata registry standards for many years. Today it has a combination of meanings and now goes well beyond how a data element is represented in a computer system. In practice this term is used to shed light on the semantics or meaning of the data element.\n\nThere are several alternate definitions for \"representation class\". Some of these are taken from the ISO documents. Note that these documents are copyrighted and extracts can only be taken under the fair use rules.\n\nB.2.3 Representation class\n\nRepresentation class is the value domain for representation.

{"id": "17148852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17148852", "title": "Schlesinger Report", "text": "Schlesinger Report\n\nThe Schlesinger Report, originally titled A Review of the Intelligence Community, was the product of a survey authorized by U.S. President Richard Nixon late in 1970. The objective of the survey was to identify and alleviate factors of ineffectiveness within the United States Intelligence Community (IC) organization, planning, and preparedness for future growth. The report, prepared by James Schlesinger, Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was submitted to Nixon on 10 March 1971.\n\nThe survey was the first of the IC reform attempts to specifically address the growing technological capabilities of the IC and their impact on the collection process. The report highlighted two “disturbing phenomena” within the IC: an “impressive rise in…size and cost” and the “apparent inability to achieve a commensurate improvement in the scope and overall quality of intelligence products.” The report analyzed issues pertaining to organizational fragmentation, lack of interagency centralization, costly emerging technologies, duplication of collection and analysis, and institutional disorganization, and offered the administration several practical options for improving IC functions. Major recommendations included: creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI), strengthening the role of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and establishing an interagency coordinator for national intelligence functions.\n\nFollowing the 1968 presidential election, the newly elected Nixon administration immediately focused its attention on the IC. Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger initially viewed the IC, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with condescension, believing it was not sharing important information with the administration. Additionally, Nixon felt that steadily increasing capabilities and costs directed toward IC functions should naturally be yielding a better intelligence product. Nixon also lost faith with the analytical arm of the IC when the Cambodian coup of 1970 took the administration by surprise.\nSince little evidence indicated a direct correlation between intelligence expenditures and quality outputs, Nixon commissioned James Schlesinger to conduct a survey of the IC. Schlesinger’s goal was to identify problems within the IC and recommend ideas for improvement. While Schlesinger is credited as chief preparer of the document, it was drafted by Arnold Donohue of the OMB.\n\nWhile the entire original document is still classified, the 47-page report, with redactions, has been made available through Freedom of Information Act requests. Redacted sections include classified data, primarily regarding budgetary figures and national security issues, with the exception of Vietnam.\n\nThe report is divided into 10 sections:\n\nThe report began by providing an overview of the need for “constructive change” within the IC. The aim was to achieve a “closer relationship between cost and effectiveness” by seeking “fundamental reform of the community’s decisionmaking bodies and procedures.” Schlesinger warned that in the “absence of reorganization…the habits of intelligence community will remain as difficult to control as was the performance of the Department of Defense prior to the Defense Reorganization Act of 1958.”\n\nThis section of the report provided an historical background of the development of intelligence functions and role distinctions. \"The National Security Act of 1947 and the National Security Council Intelligence Directives (NSCIDs) of the late 1940s and early 1950s established the basic division of responsibilities among agencies and departments.\" These basic divisions granted the roles of \"non-military\" and \"national intelligence\" to CIA, particularly to employ human intelligence (HUMINT) and clandestine collection operations. The State Department was tasked with the \"overt collection of 'non-military' intelligence\", while the National Security Agency (NSA) was given the responsibility of collecting communications and signals intelligence (COMINT and SIGINT). The responsibilities of \"military\" and tactical \"wartime\" intelligence were given to the Military Services. All intelligence agencies and services were permitted to produce \"departmental intelligence\" for individual and institutional needs.\n\nSchlesinger pointed out that these role distinctions \"worked reasonably well into the mid-1950s\", but went on to say:\n\nThe line between \"military\" and \"non-military\" has faded; scientific and technical intelligence with both civilian and military applications has become a principal area of endeavor for almost all intelligence organizations. Similarly, under the old distinctions, the national leadership--namely the President and the NSC--concerned itself with \"national\" intelligence, while presumably only battlefield commanders cared about tactical intelligence. But a rapidly advancing technology which has revolutionized the collection, processing, and communication of intelligence data casts doubt on the validity of the distinctions.\n\nThis \"faded\" distinction had resulted in four fundamental problems that contributed to the increasing cost of IC activities:\n\nAs the IC was increasingly shifting resources towards collection, there emerged a \"presumption in today's intelligence set-up that additional data collection rather than improved analysis, will provide the answer to particular intelligence problems\". Increased collection led to an overabundance of \"imperfect\" information that began to inundate analysts. This led to a trend in which collectors began to direct production, resulting a process of collection relevant to the collectors' own interests. Schlesinger referred to the production phase of intelligence as the \"stepchild of the community\", in which analysts \"with a heavy burden of responsibility, find themselves swamped with data\" at a time when new hypotheses needed to be tested, particularly regarding the USSR.\n\nThis section of the report outlined one of the primary shortcomings of the IC—the lack of authoritative and directive leadership between IC agencies. The lack of solid leadership stemmed from \"the failure of the National Security Act of 1947 to anticipate the 'constitutional' needs of a modern and technologically complex intelligence community\". Schlesinger's cited the relatively small size and scope of intelligence programs in 1947. Additionally, in 1947, the Military Services dominated the intelligence community, naturally opposing centralization among non-military services. Schlesinger did, however, point out in this section of the report that the National Security Act of 1947 did say that CIA would \"coordinate 'the intelligence activities' of the Government under the direction of the National Security Council\". Nevertheless, previous DCIs did not fully capitalize on this ascribed authority to coordinate the IC to interact efficiently without major compromises. The office of DCI could not realize its full potential because:\nBased on his analysis, Schlesinger points out that that effective reform must address:\n\nSchlesinger described several key specific organizational issues that new policies should address:\n\nSchlesinger recommended three options for the new role of community leader:\n\nAnother critical change recommended by Schlesinger was the need for a single office in charge of all DoD intelligence functions. He pointed out that, while the Deputy Secretary of Defense had historically been given this responsibility, the lack of staff and resources drastically limited the position's effectiveness. Schlesinger recommended that it would be necessary to either create a Director of Defense Intelligence in charge of DoD's collection responsibilities, or beef up the existing office of Deputy Secretary of Defense to efficiently handle the Department's intelligence assets and duties.\n\nSchlesinger pointed out that the IC budget had been reduced in the last two years (exact figures are classified). In this section, he made several observations regarding the difficulties of budget cuts and restructuring:\n\nSchlesinger concluded that, while cutbacks should be pursued, significant budgetary reductions should not be endeavored until reorganization has proven successful.\n\nThe report ended with an assessment for improved intelligence production. Schlesinger pointed out that, while the acquisition of new technologies and collection capabilities was important, the best way to improve the quality of IC output was to focus on making improvements in analysis:\n\nBut preliminary investigation suggests that higher quality is much more likely to come about within the framework of a coherently organized community which is focused on improving output rather than input. Indeed, it seems a fair assumption that the President would be willing to rebate some of the potential savings from the community if he had any hope of improved performance as a consequence.\n\nThe report listed several general steps that may be taken to improve analysis and production:\n\nHis conclusion, however, conceded that it was difficult at present time to determine the specific changes to be made regarding improved analysis, but reiterated that this should be the top priority of the new leadership once reorganization has been conducted.\n\n\n"}

W. F. Kirby included it in \"The Hero of Esthonia\", and Andrew Lang, under the title The Water-lily. The Gold Spinners, in \"The Blue Fairy Book\".\n\nIn a hut hidden deep in a forest, three beautiful maidens spend each waking moment weaving gold flax into yarn. A cruel older woman supervises them, collecting every finished thread. She leaves them only for short journeys - always leaving a full slate of work along with the warning to keep their eyes on their work, and to speak to no man; otherwise the gold will lose its shine and great misfortunes will follow.\n\nDuring one of her absences, a Prince is separated from his hunting party, and wandering in the forest, comes across the hut. The elder maidens hide from him, but the youngest seeks out his company. Days later, when the King's search party finds the hut, the Prince and maiden sit before it lost in conversation. The Prince promises to return for the maiden, who sits to work her neglected wheel. Sure enough, the bright thread is dull now, just as the woman had predicted. Terrified, she is convinced that misfortunes will now come. Soon enough, the woman comes and with one glance at the tarnished thread knows everything. The youngest maiden manages to send a message to her Prince through a raven. The Prince comes to her and carries her off.\n\nThe woman is enraged and, as she is a wicked witch, promptly casts a spell. She conjures a magic ball, which flies by the maiden as she is held by the mounted Prince crossing a bridge. Whirlwinds cast her from the Prince's arms and into the river. Though he tries to dive in after her, he is restrained by his men. A year later, visiting the spot, he sees a yellow water lily in the river and hears a voice sing a forlorn song about being bewitched and forsaken. He goes on through the forest to the hut and consults the gold-spinners, who insist that the flower must be their sister. He sleeps the night in the hut, having a magic cake for his dinner secretly prepared by the eldest sister. In the morning, as he rides off, he understands the language of the birds. In this way he learns that the Wizard of Finland can help him, and through the birds, contacts him. The wizard, in the form of an eagle, instructs him to stand on the river bank, smeared with mud, and say \"From a man into a crab\". Once he becomes a crab, he is to swim to the flower, cut its roots, and rise with the lily to the surface. Drifting with the current, he is to ascend a large stone, say \"From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden\" and so save the maiden.\n\nHe does all of these things and the maiden is restored, more beautiful than ever and dressed in magnificent robes and jewels. Now, although to the Prince only hours had passed in fulfilling his mission, actually 10 days had gone by and the King and Queen were at church, weeping for their dead son. The Prince and maiden arrive and are married on the spot. In their happiness, the Prince forgets his promise to the Wizard, to free the two maidens. A crow berates them, how could they forget the sisters. Chagrined, the Prince rescues the pair. The eldest makes up a poisoned cake, which the witch eats on her return and dies. The Prince and his bride and her sisters live quite happily, recovering 50 wagonloads of the gold thread that had been hidden away by the witch.\n\n"}

Widely considered to be one of the greatest films in cinema history, it is the best-known and most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\" It was directed primarily by Victor Fleming (who left production to take over direction on the troubled \"Gone with the Wind\" production). It stars Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale, alongside Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton, with Charley Grapewin, Pat Walshe, and Clara Blandick, Terry (billed as Toto), and Singer's Midgets as the Munchkins.\n\nLegendary for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and memorable characters, the film has become an icon of American popular culture. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but lost to \"Gone with the Wind\". It did win in two other categories: Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\" and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart. While the film was considered a critical success upon release in August 1939, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGM's most expensive production at that time.\n\nThe 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on the CBS network reintroduced the film to the public; watching it became an annual tradition and, according to the Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. It was among the first 25 films that inaugurated the National Film Registry list in 1989. It is also one of the few films on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The film is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.\n\n\"The Wizard of Oz\" is the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but uncredited contributions were made by others. The songs were written by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg (lyrics) and Harold Arlen (music). The musical score and the incidental music were composed by Stothart.\n\nDorothy Gale lives with her Cairn Terrier dog Toto on the Kansas farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Toto bites witchy neighbor Miss Almira Gulch, who then obtains an order for Toto to be euthanized. She takes Toto away on her bicycle, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who decides to run away from home to save her dog.\n\nThey meet Professor Marvel, a kindly fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart. Dorothy races home, arriving just as a powerful tornado strikes. Locked out of the farm's storm cellar, she seeks shelter in her bedroom. Wind-blown debris knocks her unconscious and the house is sent spinning in the air. She awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch, who transforms into a witch on a broomstick.\n\nThe house lands in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz. Glinda the Good Witch of the North and the Munchkins welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East; only the witch's legs and the ruby slippers on her feet are visible. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, arrives to claim the slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet first. The Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy for her sister's death, then vanishes. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where she can ask the Wizard of Oz to help her get back home.\n\nOn her journey Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Woodman, who desires a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who needs courage. Dorothy invites them to accompany her to the Emerald City, where they can ask the Wizard to help them too. Despite harassment from the Witch they reach the Emerald City and are eventually permitted to see the Wizard, who appears as a large ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke. He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.\n\nAs the four (plus Toto) make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch sends her winged monkeys to capture Dorothy and Toto. At the castle, the Witch realizes that Dorothy must be dead before the ruby slippers can be removed. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don the guards' uniforms, and march inside to locate Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase them through the castle and surround them. When the Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, Dorothy tosses a bucket of water at him; water also splashes the Witch, who melts away. The guards rejoice and give Dorothy the broomstick.\n\nBack in the Emerald City, as the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the \"Wizard\" as a middle-aged man speaking through a microphone. He denies Dorothy's accusation that he is a bad man, but admits to being a humbug. He then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought (brains, heart, courage) were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his hot air balloon.\n\nAs Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes to catch him, so the balloon leaves with only the Wizard. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the Ruby Slippers will take her home. Following Glinda's instructions, Dorothy taps her heels together three times and repeats, \"There's no place like home\".\n\nDorothy wakes up in Kansas surrounded by her family and friends. Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real, and says she has learned there is no place like home.\n\nDevelopment began when Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children's stories and fairytale folklore could be successful. In January 1938, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to L. Frank Baum’s hugely popular novel from Samuel Goldwyn, who had toyed with the idea of making the film as a vehicle for Eddie Cantor, who was under contract to the Goldwyn studios and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.\n\nThe script went through a number of writers and revisions before the final shooting. Mervyn LeRoy's assistant William H. Cannon had submitted a brief four-page outline. Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended that the magical elements of the story be toned down or eliminated. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was literally scaring crows from cornfields, and the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity; this torture softened him into someone gentle and kind. His vision was similar to Larry Semon's 1925 film adaptation of the story, in which the magical element is absent.\n\nAfter that, LeRoy hired screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who soon delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes, and a few weeks later, a further 56 pages. Noel Langley and poet Ogden Nash were also hired to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline, Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. He turned in three more, this time incorporating the songs that had been written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They would be responsible for making sure the story stayed true to the Baum book. However, producer Arthur Freed was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley. During filming, Victor Fleming and John Lee Mahin revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes. In addition, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are known to have written some of their own dialogue for the Kansas sequence.\n\nThe final draft of the script was completed on October 8, 1938, following numerous rewrites. All in all, it was a mish-mash of many creative minds, but Langley, Ryerson, and Woolf got the film credits. Along with the contributors already mentioned, others who assisted with the adaptation without receiving credit include: Irving Brecher, Herbert Fields, Arthur Freed, Yip Harburg, Samuel Hoffenstein, Jack Mintz, Sid Silvers, Richard Thorpe, Cukor and Vidor.\n\nIn addition, songwriter Harburg's son (and biographer) Ernie Harburg reported:\n\nThe original producers thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight-ahead fantasy; therefore, it was reconceived as a lengthy, elaborate dream sequence. Because of a perceived need to attract a youthful audience through appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical and operetta, and went up against Dorothy in a singing contest in which her swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for Betty Jaynes. The plan was later dropped.\n\nAnother scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was a concluding scene back in Kansas after Dorothy's return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for agricultural college and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The implication of the scene is that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy's partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, but is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I'll miss you most of all.\"\n\nIn his book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", Baum describes Kansas as being \"in shades of gray\". Further, Dorothy lived inside a farmhouse which had its paint blistered and washed away by the weather, giving it an air of grayness. The house and property were situated in the middle of a sweeping prairie where the grass was burnt gray by harsh sun. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry were \"gray with age\". Effectively, the use of monochrome sepia tones for the Kansas sequences was a stylistic choice that evoked the dull and gray countryside. Much attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. Consequently, it took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the final shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road.\n\nLeRoy had always insisted that he wanted to cast Judy Garland to play Dorothy from the start; however, evidence suggests that negotiations occurred early in pre-production for Shirley Temple to be cast as Dorothy, on loan from 20th Century Fox. A persistent rumor also existed that Fox, in turn, was promised Clark Gable and Jean Harlow as a loan from MGM. The tale is almost certainly untrue, as Harlow died in 1937, before MGM had even purchased the rights to the story. Despite this, the story appears in many film biographies (including Temple's own autobiography). The documentary \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic\" states that Mervyn LeRoy was under pressure to cast Temple, then the most popular child star, but at an unofficial audition, MGM musical mainstay Roger Edens listened to her sing and felt that an actress with a different style was needed; a 50th anniversary documentary for the film suggested that Temple, then 10-years-old, was slightly too young for the part. Newsreel footage is included in which Temple wisecracks, \"There's no place like home\", suggesting that she was being considered for the part at that time. A possibility is that this consideration did indeed take place, but that Gable and Harlow were not part of the proposed deal.\n\nActress Deanna Durbin, who was under contract to Universal Studios, was also considered for the part of Dorothy. Durbin, at the time, far exceeded Garland in film experience and fan base and both had co-starred in a 1936 two-reeler titled \"Every Sunday\". The film was most notable for exhibiting Durbin's operatic style of singing against Garland's jazzier style. Durbin was possibly passed over once it was decided to bring on Jaynes, also an operatic singer, to rival Garland's jazz in the aforementioned discarded subplot of the film.\nRay Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow. Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol Fred Stone had done on stage in 1902; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I'm not a tin performer; I'm fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired. Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow's distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone's Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.\n\nBert Lahr was signed for the Cowardly Lion on July 25, 1938; the next month, Charles Grapewin was cast as Uncle Henry on August 12.\n\nW. C. Fields was originally chosen for the role of the Wizard, a role turned down by Ed Wynn as he thought the part was too small, but the studio ran out of patience after protracted haggling over Fields' fee; instead, another contract player, Frank Morgan, was cast on September 22.\n\nAn extensive talent search produced over a hundred little people to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film's Oz sequences would have to already be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor Jerry Maren, the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to $ today). Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary \"The Making of the Wizard of Oz\" that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer Adrian, had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They then had to photograph and catalog each Munchkin in his or her costume so that they could correctly apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\n\nGale Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch. She became unhappy when the witch's persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the wicked queen in Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\") into the familiar \"ugly hag\". She turned down the role and was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player Margaret Hamilton. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD that she had no regrets about turning down the part, and would go on to play a glamorous villain in Fox's version of Maurice Maeterlinck's \"The Blue Bird\" in 1940; Margaret Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film \"Babes in Arms\" (1939).\n\nAccording to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum's widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer Michael Patrick Hearn says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a concocted studio rumor.\n\nFilming commenced October 13, 1938, on the MGM lot in Culver City, California, under the direction of Richard Thorpe (replacing original director Norman Taurog, who filmed only a few early Technicolor tests and was then reassigned). Thorpe initially shot about two weeks of footage (nine days in total) involving Dorothy's first encounter with the Scarecrow, as well as a number of sequences in the Wicked Witch's castle, such as Dorothy's rescue (which, though unreleased, comprises the only footage of Ebsen's Tin Man).\n\nAccording to most sources, ten days into the shoot, Ebsen suffered a reaction to the aluminum powder makeup he wore. He was hospitalized in critical condition, and subsequently was forced to leave the project; in a later interview (included on the 2005 DVD release of \"The Wizard of Oz\"), he recalled the studio heads appreciated the seriousness of his illness only after seeing him in the hospital. Filming halted while a replacement for him was found. No full footage of him as the Tin Man has ever been releasedonly photographs taken during filming and makeup test photos. His replacement, Jack Haley, simply assumed he had been fired. Author and screen-writer George MacDonald Fraser offers an alternative story, told to him by Burt Lancaster's producing partner, Jim Hill, that Ebsen had refused to be painted silver and was fired.\n\nLeRoy, after reviewing the footage and feeling Thorpe was rushing the production, adversely affecting the actors' performances, had Thorpe replaced. During reorganization on the production, George Cukor temporarily took over, under LeRoy's guidance. Initially, the studio had made Garland wear a blond wig and heavy \"baby-doll\" makeup, and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion; now, Cukor changed Garland's and Hamilton's makeup and costumes, and told Garland to \"be herself\". This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be discarded and reshot. Cukor also suggested that the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from Fox, as the Tin Man. To keep down on production costs, Haley only rerecorded \"If I Only Had a Heart\" and solo lines during \"The Jitterbug\" and \"If I Only Had the Nerve\"; as such, Ebsen's voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals. The makeup used for Haley was quietly changed to an aluminum paste, with a layer of clown white greasepaint underneath to protect his skin; although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley, he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it.\n\nIn addition, Bolger's original recording of \"If I Only Had a Brain\" had been far more sedate compared to the version heard in the film; during this time, Cukor and LeRoy decided that a more energetic rendition would better suit Dorothy's initial meeting with the Scarecrow (initially, it was to contrast with his lively manner in Thorpe's footage), and was rerecorded as such. At first thought to be lost for over seven decades, a recording of this original version was rediscovered in 2009.\n\nCukor did not actually shoot any scenes for the film, merely acting as something of a \"creative advisor\" to the troubled production, and, because of his prior commitment to direct \"Gone with the Wind\", he left on November 3, 1938, when Victor Fleming assumed directorial responsibility. As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor's creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already pronounced his satisfaction with the new course the film was taking.\n\nProduction on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4:00 a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100 °F (38 °C). Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary; the toxicity of Hamilton's copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days. It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the yellow brick road.\n\nAll of the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor. The opening and closing credits, as well as the Kansas sequences, were filmed in black and white and colored in a sepia-tone process. Sepia-toned film was also used in the scene where Aunt Em appears in the Wicked Witch's crystal ball.\n\nIn Hamilton's exit from Munchkinland, a concealed elevator was arranged to lower her below stage as fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran well but in the second take the flames did not go out in time. The flames set fire to her green, copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns on her hands and face. She spent three months healing before returning to work.\n\nOn February 12, 1939, Fleming hastily replaced Cukor in directing \"Gone with the Wind\"; the next day, King Vidor was assigned as director by the studio to finish the filming of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (mainly the sepia-toned Kansas sequences, including Garland's singing of \"Over the Rainbow\" and the tornado). In later years, when the film became firmly established as a classic, Vidor chose not to take public credit for his contribution until after the death of his friend Fleming in 1949.\n\nPrincipal photography concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939; nonetheless, reshoots and pick-up shots were filmed throughout April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. After the deletion of the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise during subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back one more time to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song; the footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was simply reused.\n\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pick-ups for the scene in which she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy chose to have stand-in Betty Danko perform the scene, instead; as a result, Danko was severely injured doing the scene due to a malfunction in the smoke mechanism.\n\nAt this point, the film began a long arduous post-production. Herbert Stothart had to compose the film's background score, while A. Arnold Gillespie had to perfect the various special effects that the film required, including many of the rear projection shots. The MGM art department also had to create the various matte paintings for the background of many of the scenes.\n\nOne significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\n\nTest screenings of the film began on June 5, 1939. \"Oz\" initially ran nearly two hours long. LeRoy and Fleming knew that at least 15 minutes needed to be deleted to get the film down to a manageable running time; the average film in 1939 ran for just about 90 minutes. Three sneak previews in Santa Barbara, Pomona and San Luis Obispo, California, helped guide LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\nOne song that was almost deleted was \"Over the Rainbow\". MGM had felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they all eventually won. The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Song of the Year, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her theme song.\n\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\n\nArnold Gillespie was the special effects director for the film. The tornado scene was especially costly. Gillespie used muslin cloth to make the tornado flexible after a previous attempt with rubber failed. He hung the 35 feet of muslin to a steel gantry and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. Fuller's Earth was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect.\n\nThe Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of foam latex makeup made by makeup artist Jack Dawn, who was one of the first makeup artists to use this technique. The actor who played Scarecrow was left with permanent lines around his mouth and chin from his mask. It took an hour each day to slowly peel the glued-on mask from Bolger's face. Margaret Hamilton received severe burns on her hands and face when there was an accident with the fire while filming her exit from Munchkinland. Hamilton was wearing her green makeup at the time, which was usually removed with acetone due to the toxicity of its copper content. In this case, due to Hamilton's burns, makeup artist Jack Young removed the makeup with alcohol instead to prevent infection. The Tin Man's costume was made of leather-covered buckram and the oil used to grease his joints was made from chocolate syrup. The Cowardly Lion's costume was made from real lion skin and fur. For the \"horse of a different color\" scene, Jell-O powder was used to color the white horses. Asbestos was used to achieve some of the special effects like the witch's burning broomstick and the fake snow that covers Dorothy as she sleeps in the field of poppies.\n\nThe film is widely noted for its musical selections and soundtrack. The music was composed by Harold Arlen, and the lyrics were written by Yip Harburg, both of whom won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song was ranked first in two lists: the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America's \"365 Songs of the Century\".\n\nMGM composer Herbert Stothart, a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score in recognition of his original score.\n\nGeorgie Stoll was associate conductor and screen credit was given to George Bassman, Murray Cutter, Ken Darby and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements (as usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)\n\nThe songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Therefore, while he had to be dropped from the cast due to illness from the aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained in the soundtrack (as noted in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). In the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\", his voice can be heard. Haley spoke with a distinct Boston accent, thus did not pronounce the \"r\" in \"wizard\". By contrast, Ebsen was a Midwesterner, like Garland, and pronounced it. Haley rerecorded Ebsen's solo parts later.\n\nSome musical pieces filmed were deleted in the editing process.\n\nThe song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for the sequence in which the group is journeying to the Witch's castle. Due to time constraints, the song was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage for the song has been lost, although silent home film footage of rehearsals for the number has survived. The sound recording for the song, however, is intact and was included in the two-CD Rhino Records deluxe edition of the film soundtrack, as well as on the VHS and DVD editions of the film. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: the Witch remarks to her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"\n\nAnother musical number cut before release occurred right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"We're Off to See the Wizard\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The Witch is Dead!\" This started with the Witch's guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration of the citizens of the Emerald City singing the song as they accompany Dorothy and her friends to see the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio still exists and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record deluxe edition of the film soundtrack.\n\nIn addition, a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" was intended to be sung by Garland while Dorothy is trapped in the Witch's castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. The original soundtrack recording still exists, however, and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993-onwards.\n\n\nExtensive edits in the film's final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully underscored, with instrumental snippets from the film's various leitmotifs throughout. There was also some recognizable popular music, including:\n\nThe film's first sneak preview was held in San Bernardino, California.\nThe film was previewed in three test markets: on August 11, 1939, at Kenosha, Wisconsin and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and at the Strand Theatre in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, on August 12.\n\nThe Hollywood premiere was on August 15, 1939, at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. The New York City premiere, held at Loew's Capitol Theatre on August 17, 1939, was followed by a live performance with Garland and her frequent film co-star Mickey Rooney. They continued to perform there after each screening for a week, extended in Rooney's case for a second week and in Garland's to three (with \"Oz\" co-stars Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr replacing Rooney for the third and final week). The film opened nationwide on August 25, 1939.\n\nAccording to MGM records, during the film's initial release, it earned $2,048,000 in the US and Canada and $969,000 in other countries throughout the world, resulting in total earnings of $3,017,000. While these were considerable earnings, the high production cost, in association with various distribution and other costs, meant the movie initially recorded a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio. It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5 million (about $ million today). However, for all the risks and cost that MGM undertook to produce the film, it was considered at least more successful than anyone thought it would be. According to Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography \"Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland\", \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" Finch also writes that after the success of the film, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top-ten box office stars in the United States.\n\nThe film received much acclaim upon its release. Frank Nugent considered the film a \"delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters. Not since Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" has anything quite so fantastic succeeded half so well.\" Nugent had issues with some of the film's special effects, writing, \"with the best of will and ingenuity, they cannot make a Munchkin or a Flying Monkey that will not still suggest, however vaguely, a Singer's Midget in a Jack Dawn masquerade. Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place.\" According to Nugent, \"Judy Garland's Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move.\"\n\nWriting in \"Variety\", John C. Flinn predicted that the film was \"likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic,\" noting, \"Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment.\" He also called Garland \"an appealing figure\" and the musical numbers \"gay and bright.\"\n\n\"Harrison's Reports\" wrote, \"Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment. The performances are good, and the incidental music is of considerable aid. Pictures of this caliber bring credit to the industry.\"\n\nFilm Daily wrote: \n\nNot all reviews were positive. Some moviegoers felt that the 16-year-old Garland was slightly too old to play the little girl who Baum originally intended his Dorothy to be. Russell Maloney of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that the film displayed \"no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity\" and declared it \"a stinkeroo,\" while Otis Ferguson of \"The New Republic\" wrote, \"It has dwarfs, music, Technicolor, freak characters, and Judy Garland. It can't be expected to have a sense of humor, as well – and as for the light touch of fantasy, it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet.\" Still, the film placed seventh on \"Film Daily\"'s year-end nationwide poll of 542 critics naming the best films of 1939.\n\nRoger Ebert chose it as one of his Great Films, writing that \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.\"\nWriter Salman Rushdie acknowledged \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" was my very first literary influence\" in his 2002 musings about the film. He has written: \"When I first saw \"The Wizard of Oz\", it made a writer of me.\" His first short story, written at the age of 10, was titled \"Over the Rainbow\".\n\nIn a 2009 retrospective article about the film, \"San Francisco Chronicle\" film critic and author Mick LaSalle declared that the film's \"entire Munchkinland sequence, from Dorothy's arrival in Oz to her departure on the yellow brick road, has to be one of the greatest in cinema history – a masterpiece of set design, costuming, choreography, music, lyrics, storytelling, and sheer imagination.\"\n\nOn the film critic aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 111 reviews, with an average score of 9.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant, \"The Wizard of Oz\" is a must-see film for young and old.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film received the maximum score of 100 out of 100, based on 4 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\", which, as of August 2017, is matched only by five other films.\n\nAlthough the 1949 reissue used sepia tone, as in the original release, beginning with the 1955 re-issue, and continuing until the film's 50th anniversary VHS release in 1989, the opening Kansas sequences were shown in black and white instead of the sepia tone as originally printed. (This includes television showings.)\n\nThe MGM \"Children's Matinees\" series rereleased the film twice, in both 1970 and 1971. It was for this release that the film received a G rating from the MPAA.\n\nFor the film's then-upcoming 60th anniversary, Warner Bros. Pictures released a \"Special Edition\" on November 6, 1998, digitally restored with remastered audio.\n\nIn 2002, the film had a very limited re-release in U.S. theaters, earning only $139,905.\n\nOn September 23, 2009, the film was rereleased in select theaters for a one-night-only event in honor of its 70th anniversary and as a promotion for various new disc releases later in the month. An encore of this event was released in theaters on November 17, 2009.\n\nAn IMAX 3D theatrical re-release played at 300 theaters in North America for one week only beginning September 20, 2013, as part of the film's 75th anniversary. Warner Bros. spent $25 million on advertising. The studio hosted a premiere of the film's first IMAX 3D release on September 15, 2013, from the newly remodeled TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the site of the film's Hollywood premiere) in Hollywood. It was the first to play at the new theater and served as the grand opening of Hollywood's first 3D IMAX screen. It was also shown as a special presentation at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. This re-release grossed $5.6 million at the North American box office.\n\nIn 2013, in preparation for its IMAX 3D release, the film was submitted again to the MPAA for re-classification. According to MPAA rules, a film that has been altered in any way from its original version must be submitted for re-classification, as the 3-D conversion fell within that guideline. Surprisingly, the 3D version received a PG rating for \"Some scary moments\", although no change was made to the film's original story content. The 2D version still retains its G rating.\n\nThe film was rereleased on January 11 and 14, 2015, as part of the \"TCM Presents\" series by Turner Classic Movies.\n\nThe film was first shown on television on November 3, 1956, by CBS, as the last installment of the \"Ford Star Jubilee\".\n\nThe film was released multiple times for the home-video commercial market (on a limited scale) on Super 8 film (8 mm format) during the 1970s. These releases include an edited English version (roughly 10 minutes, and roughly 20 minutes), as well as edited Spanish versions of the classic. Also, a full commercial release of it was made on Super 8 (on multiple reels) that came out in the 1970s, as well, for the commercial market.\n\nThe film was among the first videocassettes (on both VHS and Betamax format for the 1980 release) by MGM/CBS Home Video in 1980; all current home video releases are by Warner Home Video (via current rights holder Turner Entertainment). The first LaserDisc release of it was in 1982, with two versions of a second (one from Turner and one from The Criterion Collection with a commentary track) for the 50th anniversary release in 1989, a third in 1991, a fourth in 1993, a fifth in 1995 and a sixth and final LaserDisc release on September 11, 1996.\n\nIn addition to VHS (and later, LaserDisc), the film has been released multiple times during the 1980s on the Betamax format, beginning in 1980 simultaneously with the VHS release.\nThe film was released for the first and only time on the CED format in 1982 by MGM/UA Home Video.\n\nOutside of the North American and European markets, the film has also been released multiple times on the Video CD format since the 1990s in Asia.\n\nThe first DVD release was on March 26, 1997, by MGM/Turner and contained no special features or supplements. It was re-released by Warner Bros. for its 60th anniversary on October 19, 1999, with its soundtrack presented in a new 5.1 surround sound mix. The DVD also contained a behind-the-scenes documentary, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic\", produced in 1990 and hosted by Angela Lansbury, which was originally shown on television immediately following the 1990 telecast of the film; it had been featured in the 1993 \"Ultimate Oz\" LaserDisc release. Outtakes, the deleted \"Jitterbug\" musical number, clips of pre-1939 \"Oz\" adaptations, trailers, newsreels, and a portrait gallery were also included, as well as two radio programs of the era publicizing the film.\n\nIn 2005, two DVD editions were released, both featuring a newly restored version of the film with an audio commentary and an isolated music and effects track. One of the two DVD releases was a \"Two-Disc Special Edition\", featuring production documentaries, trailers, various outtakes, newsreels, radio shows and still galleries. The other set, a \"Three-Disc Collector's Edition\", included these features, as well as the digitally restored 80th-anniversary edition of the 1925 feature-length silent film version of \"The Wizard of Oz\", other silent \"Oz\" adaptations and a 1933 animated short version.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray on September 29, 2009, for its 70th anniversary in a four-disc \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\", including all the bonus features from the 2005 Collector's Edition DVD, new bonus features about Victor Fleming and the surviving Munchkins, the telefilm \"\", and the miniseries \"MGM: When the Lion Roars\". For this edition, Warner Bros. commissioned a new transfer at 8K resolution from the original negatives. The restoration job was given to Prime Focus World. This restored version also features a lossless 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track.\n\nOn December 1, 2009, three Blu-ray discs of the Ultimate Collector's Edition were repackaged as a less expensive \"Emerald Edition\", with an Emerald Edition four-disc DVD arriving the following week. A single-disc Blu-ray, containing the restored movie and all the extra features of the two-disc Special Edition DVD, also became available on March 16, 2010.\n\nIn 2013, the film was re-released on DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and UltraViolet for the 90th anniversary of Warner Bros. and as part of its 75th anniversary.\n\nAlso, multiple special editions were released in celebration of the film's the 75th anniversary in 2013, exclusively by both Best Buy (a SteelBook of the 3D Blu-ray) and another version that came with a keepsake lunch bag released by Target stores.\n\nThe American Film Institute (AFI) has compiled various lists which include this film or elements thereof.\n\n\n\nRoughly 40 identifiable major differences exist between the original book and the MGM interpretation.\n\nThe film was dramatized as a one-hour radio play on \"Lux Radio Theatre\", which was broadcast on December 25, 1950, with Garland reprising her earlier role. In 1964, a one-hour animated cartoon called \"Return to Oz\" was shown as an afternoon weekend special on NBC. An official 1972 sequel, the animated \"Journey Back to Oz\" starring Liza Minnelli, daughter of Garland, was produced to commemorate the original film's 35th anniversary.\n\nIn 1975, the stage show \"The Wiz\" premiered on Broadway. It was an African American version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" reworked for the stage. It starred Stephanie Mills and other Broadway stars and earned a number of Tony Awards. Its financing was handled by actor Geoffrey Holder. Its inspired revivals after it left the stage and an unsuccessful motion picture made in 1978, starring Diana Ross as Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow.\n\nIn 1985, Walt Disney Productions released the live-action fantasy film \"Return to Oz\", which starred (and introduced) Fairuza Balk as a young Dorothy Gale. Based loosely on \"The Marvelous Land of Oz\" (1904) and \"Ozma of Oz\" (1907), it fared rather poorly with critics who were unfamiliar with the \"Oz\" books and was not successful at the box office, although it has since become a popular cult film, with many considering it a more loyal and faithful adaptation of what L. Frank Baum envisioned.\n\nIn 1995, Gregory Maguire published the novel \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\", which was adapted into the wildly successful Broadway musical \"Wicked\". The story describes the life of the Wicked Witch of the West and other events prior to Dorothy's arrival.\n\nFor the film's 56th anniversary, a 1995 stage show also titled \"The Wizard of Oz\" was based upon it and the book by L. Frank Baum. It toured from 1995 to 2012, except for 2004.\n\nIn 2005, The Muppets Studio produced \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz,\" a television film for ABC, starring Ashanti as Dorothy, Jeffrey Tambor as the Wizard, David Alan Grier as Uncle Henry, and Queen Latifah as Aunt Em. Kermit the Frog portrayed the Scarecrow, Gonzo portrayed the Tin Thing (Tin Man), Fozzie Bear portrayed the Lion and Miss Piggy portrayed all the Witches of the West, East, North and South.\n\nIn 2007, The Sci-Fi Channel released the three-part miniseries \"Tin Man\", a science fiction continuation starring Zooey Deschanel as DG.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice wrote a stage musical of the same name, which opened in 2011 at the West Ends London Palladium. It features all of the songs from the film plus new songs written by Lloyd Webber and Rice. Lloyd Webber also found Danielle Hope to play Dorothy on the reality show, \"Over the Rainbow\". Another production opened in December 2012 at the Ed Mirvish Theatre in Toronto. A reality TV show, also titled \"Over the Rainbow\", found a Canadian girl, Danielle Wade, to play Dorothy. The Canadian production then began a North American tour in September 2013. An Australian tour will begin at the Lyric Theatre, Queensland Performing Arts Centre in November 2017, followed by a season at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney beginning December 2017.\n\nAn animated film called \"Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz\" was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video, incorporating Tom and Jerry into the story as Dorothy's \"protectors\". A sequel titled \"\" was released on DVD on June 21, 2016.\n\nIn 2013, Walt Disney Pictures released a spiritual prequel titled \"Oz the Great and Powerful\". It was directed by Sam Raimi, and starred James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. It was the second film based on Baum's \"Oz\" series to be produced by Disney, after \"Return to Oz\". It was a commercial success and received a mixed critical reception.\n\nIn 2014, now-defunct independent film company Clarius Entertainment released a big-budget animated musical film, \"\", which follows Dorothy's second trip to Oz. The film was a box office bomb and was received negatively by critics largely for its plot and unmemorable musical numbers.\n\nRegarding the original Baum storybook, it has been said that \"\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" is America's greatest and best-loved home grown fairytale. The first totally American fantasy for children, it is one of the most-read children's books ... and despite its many particularly American attributes, including a wizard from Omaha, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" has universal appeal.\"\n\nThe film was one inductee of a group of 25 films that inaugurated in 1989 the National Film Registry list, based on at least it being declared by the Library of Congress as the most viewed film on television syndication. In June 2007, the film was listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The film placed at number 86 on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\". In 1977, Aljean Harmetz wrote \"The Making of The Wizard of Oz\", a detailed description of the creation of the film based on interviews and research; it was updated in 1989.\n\nBecause of their iconic stature, the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among the most treasured and valuable film memorabilia in movie history. The silver slippers that Dorothy wore in the book series were changed to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor process. Adrian, MGM's chief costume designer, was responsible for the final design. There are five known pairs of the ruby slippers in existence.\n\nAfter filming, the slippers were stored among the studio's extensive collection of costumes and faded from attention. They were found in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department during preparations for a mammoth auction in 1970. One pair was the highlight of the auction, going for a then unheard of $15,000 to an anonymous buyer, who apparently donated them to the Smithsonian Institution in 1979. Of the four other pairs, one sold for $666,000 at auction in 2000, and another pair was stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. On September 4, 2018, the FBI announced that the slippers have been found in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nAnother, differently styled pair unused in the film was sold at auction with the rest of her collections by owner actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium) in June 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "347235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347235", "title": "Wes Craven's New Nightmare", "text": "Wes Craven's New Nightmare\n\nWes Craven's New Nightmare is a 1994 American slasher film written and directed by Wes Craven, the original creator of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\". Although it is the seventh film in the franchise, it is not part of the series continuity, instead portraying Freddy Krueger as a fictional movie villain who invades the real world, and haunts the cast and crew responsible for his films. In the film, Freddy is depicted as closer to what Craven originally intended, being much more menacing and much less comical, with an updated attire and appearance.\n\nThe film features various people involved in the motion picture industry playing themselves, including actress Heather Langenkamp, who is compelled by events in the narrative to reprise her role as Nancy Thompson. \"New Nightmare\" features several homages to the original film such as quotes and recreations of the most famous scenes. The film received generally positive reviews.\n\nHeather Langenkamp lives in Los Angeles, California, with her husband Chase and their young son Dylan. She has become popular thanks to her role as Nancy Thompson from the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" film series. One night she has a nightmare that her family is attacked by a set of animated Krueger claws from an upcoming \"Nightmare\" film, where two workers are brutally killed on set. Waking up to an earthquake, she spies a cut on Chase's finger exactly like the one he had received in her dream, but she quickly dismisses the notion that it was caused by the claws.\n\nHeather receives a call from an obsessed fan who quotes Freddy Krueger's nursery rhyme in an eerie, Freddy-like voice. This coincides with a meeting she has with New Line Cinema where she is pitched the idea to reprise her role as Nancy in a new \"Nightmare\" film despite her character being killed on \"\" which, unbeknownst to her, Chase has been working on. When she returns home, she sees Dylan watching her original film. When she interrupts him, he has a severely traumatizing episode where he screams at her. The frequent calls and Dylan's strange behavior cause her to call Chase. He agrees to rush home from his workplace as the two men from the opening dream did not report in for work. Chase falls asleep while driving and is slashed by Freddy's claw and dies. His death seems to affect Dylan even further, which causes concern for Heather's long-time friend and former co-star John Saxon. He suggests she seek medical attention for Dylan and herself after she has a nightmare at Chase's funeral in which Freddy tries to take Dylan away.\n\nDylan's health continues to deteriorate. He becomes increasingly paranoid about going to sleep, and fears Freddy Krueger, even though Heather has never shown Dylan her films. She visits \"Nightmare\" creator Wes Craven, who suggests that Freddy is a supernatural entity drawn to his films, freed after the film series ended with the release of \"\". It now focuses on Heather, as Nancy, its primary foe. Freddy actor Robert Englund also has a strange knowledge of it, describing the new Freddy to Heather, and then disappearing from all contact shortly after. Following another earthquake, Heather takes a traumatized Dylan to the hospital, where Dr. Heffner, suspecting abuse, suggests he remain under observation. Heather returns home for Dylan's stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter Julie tries unsuccessfully to keep the nurses from sedating the sleep-deprived boy. Dylan falls asleep from the sedative. Freddy brutally kills Julie in Dylan's dream. Capable of sleepwalking, Dylan leaves the hospital of his own accord while Heather chases him home across the interstate as Freddy taunts him and dangles him before traffic. On returning home, Heather realizes that Saxon has established his persona as Don Thompson, and her street and the exterior of her house have transformed into Nancy's. When Heather embraces Nancy's role, Freddy emerges completely into reality and takes Dylan to his world. Heather finds a trail of Dylan's sleeping pills and follows him to a dark underworld. Freddy fights off Heather and chases Dylan into an oven. Dylan escapes the oven, doubles back to Heather, and together they push Freddy into the oven and light it. This destroys both the monster and his reality.\n\nDylan and Heather emerge from under his blankets, and Heather finds a copy of the film's events in a screenplay at the foot of the bed. Inside is written thanks from Wes for defeating Freddy and playing Nancy one last time. Her victory helps to imprison the entity of the film franchise's fictitious world once more. Dylan asks if it is a story, and Heather agrees that it is before opening the script and reading from its pages to her son.\n\nWritten under the working title \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 7: The Ascension\", Wes Craven set out to make a deliberately more cerebral film than recent entries to the franchise—which he regarded as being cartoonish, and not faithful to his original themes. The basic premise originated when Craven first signed on to co-write \"\", but New Line Cinema rejected it then.\n\nIn \"New Nightmare\", Krueger was portrayed closer to what Craven had imagined: darker and less comical. To reinforce this, the character's make-up and outfit were enhanced, with one of the most prominent differences being that he now wears a long blue/black trenchcoat. In addition, the signature glove was redesigned for a more organic look, with the fingers resembling bones and having muscle textures in between. While Robert Englund again plays the character, \"Freddy Krueger\" is credited as \"Himself\" in the end credits.\n\nWhile earthquake scenes were already written into the film from the beginning, production of the film happened to take place concurrently with the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles. As such, the production team decided to incorporate real footage of the earthquake's structural damage into the film.\n\nCraven had intended to ask Johnny Depp, whose feature film debut was in the first film, to make an appearance as himself, but was too timid to ask him. Upon running into each other after the film's release, Depp said he would have been happy to do it.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, 78% of 37 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\" adds an unexpectedly satisfying - not to mention intelligent - meta layer to a horror franchise that had long since lost its way.\" Several critics have subsequently said that \"New Nightmare\" could be regarded as a prelude to the \"Scream\" series—both sets of films deal with the idea of bringing horror films to \"real life\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave \"New Nightmare\" three stars out of four and said, \"I haven't been exactly a fan of the \"Nightmare\" series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing.\" Kevin Sommerfield from the horror website Slasher Studios gave it four out of four stars and said, \"\"New Nightmare\" is that rare horror film in which everything works. The performances are pitch perfect, led by a tour-de-force performance by the amazing Langenkamp. The script has many twists and turns and the movie is quite possibly the best looking of the entire series.\"\n\nHowever, \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Owen Gleiberman gave \"New Nightmare\" a negative review, stating:After a good, gory opening, in which Freddy's glove—newly designed with sinews and muscles—slashes the throat of the special-effects guy who's been working on it, the movie succumbs to a kind of sterile inertia. \"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\" isn't about Freddy haunting a film set, which actually might have been fun. It's about Heather Langenkamp, star of the original \"Nightmare on Elm Street\", being menaced for two long, slow hours by earthquakes, cracks in the wall, and other weary portents of doom. Gleiberman described the film as \"just an empty hall of mirrors\" that \"lacks the trancelike dread of the original\" and the \"ingeniously demented special effects\" of \"\".\n\n\"New Nightmare\" happens to be Robert Englund's favorite \"Nightmare\" movie: \"I think it stands the test of time, a fun reunion with original cast members like Heather and John Saxon. Wes’s script is clever and original, the self-referencial horror story.\" Heather Langenkamp is also very supportive of the movie, saying, \"I was just really shocked that I was in the movie so much, I had totally forgotten I was the star of that movie. It was interesting because all my scenes are kind of alone, and I was acting against this tension and this idea of Freddy that we all had at that time. We all knew what I was afraid of and that Freddy might be back, but you never really saw Freddy that much, and I was really amazed that the movie was about Wes [Craven] creating this relationship with that idea that Freddy is here, and the audience has it too. It’s a really interesting concept, and it’s one of the only horror movies where the monster’s really in the background, at least until the end. But it’s all about our mentality about fear.\"\n\n\n"}
