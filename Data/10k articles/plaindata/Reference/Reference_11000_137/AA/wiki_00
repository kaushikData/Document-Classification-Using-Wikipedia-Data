Furthermore, a sale of such share does not free it from the \"fideicommissum\". A clause disqualifying any son who became insolvent from obtaining a right under the will did not operate to disqualify an insolvent who was a fideicommissary under the will but who was rehabilitated before the right of succession accrued to him. Thus a condition that the bequest will lapse if the beneficiary becomes insolvent is not \"contra bonos mores\".\n\n"}
{"id": "7545639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7545639", "title": "Anima Sola", "text": "Anima Sola\n\nBased on Roman Catholic tradition, the Anima Sola or Lonely Soul is an image depicting a soul in purgatory, popular in Latin America, as well as much of Andalusia, Naples and Palermo.\n\nWhile scholars have thus far not provided a history of the Anima Sola (or \"Ánimas del purgatorio\" in Spanish), the practice of praying for the souls in Purgatory extends at least as far back as the Council of Trent in which the following was determined:\n\n\"Whereas the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Ghost, has from the Sacred Scriptures and the ancient tradition of the Fathers taught in Councils and very recently in this Ecumenical synod (Sess. VI, cap. XXX; Sess. XXII cap.ii, iii) that there is a purgatory, and that the souls therein are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable Sacrifice of the Altar; the Holy Synod enjoins on the Bishops that they diligently endeavor to have the sound doctrine of the Fathers in Councils regarding purgatory everywhere taught and preached, held and believed by the faithful\" (Denzinger, \"Enchiridon\", 983).\n\nThe Anima Sola is taken to represent a soul suffering in purgatory. While in many cases chromolithographs depict a female soul, many other figures such as popes and other men are commonly depicted in chromolithographs, sculptures and paintings. In the most commonly known image of the Anima Sola, a woman is depicted as breaking free from her chains in a dungeon setting surrounded by flames, representing purgatory. She appears penitent and reverent, and her chains have been broken, an indication that, after her temporary suffering, she is destined for heaven.\n\nPraying to the Anima Sola is a tradition in many ways unlike that of the more widespread cult of saints. In lieu of praying to a saint who then appeals to God, the Anima Sola represents souls in purgatory who require the assistance both of the living and the divine to ameliorate their sufferings in the afterlife.\n\nThe Anima Sola is common throughout much of the Catholic world, though is perhaps strongest in Naples, where it is referred to as \"the cult of the souls in Purgatory.\" In Latin America, one source reports, the Anima Sola is \"a belief still deeply rooted in the mass of the campesinos. The devotion dates from the first colonizers, who probably brought the image in which the soul is represented as a woman suffering torments in purgatory with chains binding her hands. A legend concerning the 'thirst of Christ', about which Scripture seems to say nothing, passes from mouth to mouth: They say that in Jerusalem, there were women who gave drink to those who were being crucified. On the afternoon of Good Friday it fell to a young woman, Celestina Abdenago, to go up Calvary. From a jar she gave a drink to Dismas and Gestas, yet she despised the Saviour; and for that reason, he condemned her to suffer thirst and the constant heat of purgatory.\"\n\nAs with many Catholic symbols, the image is also appears in spiritist traditions. As described in \"The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells\" by Judika Illes:\n\nAnother interpretation is that the sacred figures most frequently invoked include the \"Lonely Soul\" [Anima Sola], who requires prayers because of her predicament; San Silvestre, magical because of the date of his feast day; and Santa Elena and San Onofre.\n\nIn Santería or Lukumi, the Afro-Caribbean religion of Cuba, there is a syncretization of the Anima Sola with the Eshu Alleguana. The Eshus are the Divine Messengers, the Tricksters, The Masters of the Roads and the Doors that are necessary for all prayers to reach their intended point. Eshu Allegwanna, one Eshu among hundreds, is thought to be the oldest of the Eshus, and to have existed on the Earth since a primordial time long before not only people, but before many of the gods of the religion, existed in the world. Therefore, he is synchronized with The Lonely Spirit, as many of the African Gods were synchronized with Catholic saints, or hidden behind them, in the first centuries of slavery, when the practice of the African religions were oppressed. Anima Sola is grouped in a triad in some traditions with The Intranquil Spirit and the Dominant Spirit.\n"}

According to this concept, a person who perceives him- or herself as stigmatized can attribute negative feedback to prejudice. This can lead stigmatized group members to feel uncertainty about whether negative outcomes are due to discrimination against them or their own behavior. In comparison, they might discredit positive feedback as a form of sympathy rather than seeing it as the result of their ability and achievement. The term was coined by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and their colleagues.\n\nAttributional ambiguity can have unfortunate repercussions for members of stigmatized groups. Members of groups that are ‘stereotype-vulnerable’ or are often stereotyped are at greater risk of having less self-worth through the lens of attributional ambiguity. With this concept, when people of an often stigmatized group receive feedback, they are unsure what the basis is for that feedback and believe it could have been attributed to things other than performance alone. Whether it is positive or negative feedback they face uncertainty about how accurate that feedback was and thus feeling uncertain about how to interpret the responses.\n\nIn the absence of true feedback one cannot totally rely on that evaluation and thus cannot adjust their behavior or performance accordingly. Attributional ambiguity can be applied in a very broad sense, considering how often people seek feedback. In academics, athletics, relationships, etc. are all areas in which feedback can be pivotal. For example, if it is known that a manager is very sensitive to his/her subordinates’ feelings, and he/she gives positive feedback, it is unclear if that feedback was true or simply an action of sensitivity.\n\nIn an experiment conducted by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and colleagues, women who were evaluated unfavorably by a blatantly prejudiced evaluator experienced less negative affect than women who were rated unfavorably by an unbiased evaluator. With African American participants, it was found that when reviewed negatively African Americans were more likely to attribute the evaluator's negativity to prejudice than were white participants. Furthermore, African Americans were likely to attribute both negative and positive reviews to prejudice if they could be seen by the evaluator. Being visible (and thus vulnerable to being stereotyped based on race) helped African Americans cope with negative reviews, but also made them more likely to discredit positive reviews.\n\nThe same concept can be applied not only to race, ethnicity, gender, etc., but appearance as well. The extent to which one views his/herself as attractive can affect how they perceive feedback. A study by Major, Carrington & Carnevale (1984) found that, as described above, the attractive participants were less likely to believe positive feedback given to them, believing that the observer had an ulterior motive. When the observer could see the attractive participant, they doubted the true motive behind their positive feedback. Unattractive participants were more likely to believe positive feedback than were attractive participants. When an ulterior motive is possible, it is easier to discount the feedback whether it is positive or negative. (See also Lookism.)\n\nC. L. Hoyt and colleagues examined attributional ambiguity in Latino subjects as compared to white subjects. They found that when given a negative review Latino subjects were more likely to attribute this negativity to the prejudice of the examiner than white subjects. They also found that when given a positive review, Latino subjects were more likely to discredit the positivity of the reviewer and experience a lower sense of well being than their white counterparts. This research suggests that while attributional ambiguity can be used as a buffer to protect the self from negative reviews and biased thoughts, it can also prevent stigmatized groups from embracing reviews.\n\n"}
{"id": "1967468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967468", "title": "Bomoh", "text": "Bomoh\n\nA bomoh is a Malay shaman and traditional medicine practitioner. The term is used mainly in Malaysia and parts of Sumatra, whereas most Indonesians use the word \"dukun\". It is often mistranslated into English as medicine man or witch doctor. In colloquial usage, the term \"bomoh\" is often interchangeable with another type of shaman, the pawang, but they generally serve different functions. The \"bomoh\" is primarily a healer, herbalist, geomancer, and sorcerer. The \"pawang\" on the other hand usually specialises in rituals involving weather, nature, animals, and a good harvest. Their roles do overlap however, and both act as an intermediary for the spirits and gods.\n\nThe word \"bomoh\" (at times spelled \"bomo\" or \"bomor\") has been in common usage since at least classical times. It is a cognate of the Thai term \"maw\" or \"mohr\". This word can mean either doctor or a sorcerer, as in terms like \"mawpii\" (spirit doctor) and \"mawduu\" (fortune-teller). Prior to the later introduction of the English-derived \"doktor\" or the Arabic word \"tabib\", the \"bomoh\" served as healers and physicians in Malay society. Thai shamans or \"bomoh Siam\" are traditionally held in high regard in Malaysia. Malay texts such as the Hikayat Aceh (1600-1625) record the word \"bomoh\" simply as \"mo\" or \"moh\".\n\nShamanism in Southeast Asia can be traced to the region's prehistoric tribal people. The \"bomoh's\" original role was that of a healer and their expertise was first and foremost an in-depth knowledge of medicinal herbs and tajul muluk or Malay geomancy. This was supplemented by Sanskrit \"mantera\" (mantra) owing to the ancient Hindu-Buddhist influence in the region. Before European colonisation, \"bomoh\" - along with Buddhist monks and Hindu holymen - were often exempt from paying taxes, due to the fact that many of them had few material belongings.\n\nThe \"bomoh's\" craft remained largely unchanged even after Islam became dominant until the Islamic revival in the 1970s and 80s. \"Bomoh\" were then seen as deviant from the Muslim faith because of their invocation of spirits and the potentially harmful black magic they were accused of practicing. This period saw a drastic decline in traditional herbalism and many fraudulent practitioners filled the void. As a result, \"bomoh\" are today looked at with suspicion even though they are still commonly consulted for personal reasons. Many \"bomoh\" today have tried to adapt their practice in the context of modern Islam, such as reciting verses of the Quran or invoking the names of Allah, but this is viewed as shallow by conservative shamans.\n\nMalay metaphysical theory holds that the body, and in fact the universe itself, is made up of the four classical elements of fire, water, earth, and wind. Illnesses are often said to be caused by an imbalance of these elements. To restore this balance, patients are advised to bathe in cool water to which lime juice is added. The \"bomoh\" also works with rituals and incantations, called \"jampi\".\n\nSome \"bomoh\" use cemeteries to summon spirits to fulfill requests by supplicants, while others only deal with a single spirit. It is said that sometimes the \"bomoh\" selects the spirit, while other times, it is the spirit who selects the \"bomoh\". Spirits are said to be able to heal the sick, seek missing persons or even investigate reasons for bad luck. Spirits can also be used to attack people, cause sickness and misery and many other bad things. \"Bomo\"h who have a particular religion may incorporate their religious practices into their craft.\n\nTraditionally, healing rituals of some \"bomoh\" involved music and dance, such as the \"main puteri\" or \"main peteri\" (a trance-dance from Kelantan and Terengganu often connected to mak yong), the \"main lukah\" (a fisherman's dance from Pahang), and the \"main saba\" (which re-enacts the heavenly princesses [\"puteri kayangan\"] dancing around a saba tree). The music is played by an assistant called the \"tuk minduk\".\n\nIn 2014, shortly after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Dato Mahaguru Ibrahim Mat Zin, who proclaimed himself as the \"Raja Bomoh\" (King of \"Bomoh\") with his male assistant, appeared in public offering to locate the missing plane by conducting a series of rituals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The ritual involved using a pair of bamboo binoculars to view the inside of a traditional fish trap. Ibrahim claimed that the plane was suspended in the air amongst three locations which were the Philippines, South China Sea and on an unidentified country and it was hidden by the \"orang-orang bunian\" (\"the Bunian\", a supernatural race resembling humans, akin to elves in Malay legend). Beside the ritual, Ibrahim Mat Zin also stated that 100,000 seni gayong martial artists had performed prayers for the missing plane and its passengers.\n\nA few days later he and his four assistants, three males and one female came to KLIA, bringing along a water gourd, holy Zamzam water from Mecca, a small surat Ya Sin book and several other items to conduct another ritual. This time, Ibrahim Mat Zin used two coconuts and knocked them against each other with his two bare hands while shouting takbir. Then, his three male assistants sat on the \"magic carpet\" and using a number of \"magical artifacts\" such as a walking stick, a basket and two coconuts, and thus started the infamous scene, while local and international photographers took a few shots. Ibrahim Mat Zin claimed that the purpose of the ritual is to weaken the spirits' hold on the plane.\n\nThe incidents drew international ridicule until it became a subject of an online game application called \"Bomoh: Rescue Run\" developed by a company named Triapps, which has surpassed more than 100,000 downloads in Google Play. Minister for Youth and Sports Khairy Jamaluddin, who was not amused by the antics of the \"bomoh\", tweeted in regards to the incident: \"Somebody should arrest those magic carpet bomohs. Memalukan (humiliating)\". He even resorted to contacting Jamil Khir, The Minister for Islamic Affairs, to deal with the bomoh. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Department of Islamic Advancement had issued a fatwa that Ibrahim Mat Zin's methods contradict Islamic teachings. Some netizens had also pointed out the similarities of the antics of the \"bomoh\" with a scene in the P. Ramlee movie \"Laksamana Do Re Mi\" where the main characters ride on a flying mat, while the bamboo binoculars session once held by Ibrahim Mat Zin to locate the missing plane mimic Re's magic single vision binocular in the movie.\n\nIn 2017, the very same \"Bomoh\" from the flight MH370 ritual conducted a ritual in what he perceived to protect Malaysia from North Korea in wake of the strained tensions between the two nations.\n\n"}

The bull ended the claim of the Archbishop of York to metropolitan jurisdiction in Scotland and established an independent national church, albeit one with no figurehead.\n\nBefore the bull's publication, the church in Scotland had no metropolitan authority by way of an archbishop. Attempts had been made by Pope Paschal II in 1100 to attach the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop of York to Scotland in his letter \"Noscat dilectio\", which he addresses \"to the suffragans of the metropolis of York \"per Scotiam\"\".\n\n\"Noscat dilectio\" was written on the promotion of Gerard, Bishop of Hereford to the archbishopric of York, commanding the Scottish bishops to obey Gerard and accept his authority, which the Scottish bishops refused to do.\n\nOn the consecration of Archbishop Thurstan of York by Pope Calixtus II, a more vigorous campaign was mounted insisting York’s authority be recognised in Scotland. Although both Calixtus and successive popes commanded the obedience of the Scottish bishops to York, the bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow refused, abetted by both King Alexander and King David.\n\nIn April 1125, Pope Honorius II wrote to King David commanding him to receive Cardinal John of Crema as papal legate to investigate the matter of the continued controversy with the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop Thurstan and the Scottish bishops. The inquiry was fruitless and in 1126, the pope summoned the Scottish bishops to Rome during Lent 1127 for an inquiry on their relationship with York. The meeting was, however, aborted.\n\nDuring the controversy, when a Scottish bishop required consecration it should have been performed by the Archbishop of York. Due to vacancies arising in both sees concurrently, however, Bishop John and his successor Herbert were consecrated by the pope himself. The pattern then continued even when the See of York was not vacant, when Hubert’s successor, Engelram, was consecrated by Pope Alexander III. Engelram’s successor, Jocelyn was consecrated at Clairvaux by a papal legate.\n\nThe bull arose as a result of the controversy, and for the first time in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland, the church is referred to an entity (\"Scotticana ecclesia\"), comprising the dioceses of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Dunblane, Brechin, Aberdeen, Moray, Ross and Caithness.

He married Bernice Dobkin on June 8, 1940. Their children are Marion Hall Hunt, Jonathan Hall, Peter Dobkin Hall, and Susannah Hall.\n\nAfter graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, Hall received a B.A. from Yale University in 1939. He was a postgraduate student at Columbia University from 1940-41.\n\nAt the urging of family friend, \"Saturday Review of Literature\" Editor Norman Cousins, Hall abandoned his graduate studies to write an annotated discography of recorded sound. The book instructed record collectors on \"how to lay a solid foundation for a record library, what pitfalls to avoid in the buying of records, whether or not it is advisable to specialize, and how to distinguish between fair and excellent recordings of the same composition\" (Hall 1940). The book also provided tips on playback equipment and offered detailed commentary on the whole range of recorded music, from classical through experimental music, jazz, folk, and spoken word. \"The Record Book\" appeared in 1940 and was followed by a series of supplements, and international edition (1948). The last supplement appeared in 1950. The series was an immediate hit, selling more than 100,000 copies.\n\nIn 1940, Hall began a lifelong involvement with the record business, taking a job as an advertising copywriter with Columbia Records, then located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1942, he became music program annotator for the NBC Symphony Orchestra -- the all-star orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In 1948, Hall joined forces with fellow Yale graduate John Hammond on a quest to post-war Europe on behalf of Mercury Records, then a Chicago-based produced of \"pop\" material. \n\nWishing to enter the growing classical music market, Mercury executives realized that radio stations and governments in formerly Nazi-occupied countries held a gold mine in superb performances by Europe's top musicians. Hammond's and Hall's objective was to acquire these assets for Mercury. Hammond had hired Hall, \"a well-known authority on classical recording, to handle the considerable job of cataloging Czech and German material. He was known and respected by the Czechs, who were interested in establishing an international records archive. David would be an asset in delicate negotiations\" (Hammond 1977, 282). Hall and Hammond left Prague one step ahead of Soviet forces as they crushed Czechoslovakia's democratic government.\n\nHall remained at Mercury Records until 1956 as classic music director. Under his leadership, Mercury began releasing its notable \"Living Presence\" series of classical recordings. Hall worked closely with sound engineering pioneer, C. Robert Fine. Fine's mobile sound studio toured the midwest, recording performances by the Detroit, Louisville, and Minneapolis symphonies and musical groups at the Eastman School at the University of Rochester. A 1955 recording of the Minneapolis Symphony performing Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\" under the baton of Antal Doráti became the best selling classical record of the decade. \n\nIn 1956, Hall was awarded a Fulbright Teaching Fellowship, which enabled him to spend a year at the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) teaching advanced recording techniques to Danish engineers and musicians. Hall had long been interested in Scandinavian music, having directed the music center at New York's American Scandinavian Foundation from 1950 to 1957. \n\nOn returning to the United States in the fall of 1957, Hall became music editor of \"Hi-Fi/Stereo Review\" (later \"Stereo Review\"). Hall contributed reviews of classic music and articles to the magazine until it folded in 1998. In his writings, Hall championed contemporary music. His 1964 article on Charles Ives included the first full discography of Ives's recordings.\n\nIn 1963, Hall became president of Composers' Recordings, Inc., a nonprofit record label devoted to recording and distributing the work of contemporary composers. Among the notable recordings produced under his leadership were a series of performances by avant garde composer Harry Partch. \n\nIn 1967, Hall was appointed curator of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound, one of the units of the New York Public Library's performing arts collections at Lincoln Center. There he pioneered new techniques of cataloging recorded material as one of the initiatives of the Research Libraries Group, a consortium of the nation's leading research libraries. Hall and his associates also released an important collection of historic sound recordings, \"The Mapleson Cylinders\", which captured the singing of Metropolitan Opera stars of the early twentieth century. This recording was given a Grammy Award by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences in 1986. \n\nDuring this period, Hall helped to found the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) in 1966. He served as the group's president, 1980-1982. In 2002, he received the ARSC Award for Distinguished Service to Historical Recordings. \n\nIn 1986, Hall retired to the seaside village of Castine, Maine, where he continued to write record reviews and consult on recording projects. Through the 1990s, he chaired the classical records awards committee for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. Late in life, Hall was at work on a biography of the twentieth century American composer, Roy Harris.\n\nIn addition to introducing American audiences to the remarkable riches of recorded music in the years following the second World War, Hall played an especially important role as a champion of contemporary music. At least half the composers listed in the 1940 Record Book were still living. They included such notables as Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Charles Ives, Harry Partch, William Schuman, and others. His writings also helped garner attention for jazz and folk musicians.\n\n"}

The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.\n\nIraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C.

Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion. Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.\n\nThe world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the \"treasure hunting\" of old transformed into the beginnings of the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.\n\nIn a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed \"idolatrous\". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.\n\nA translation from the video is as follows: \"These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries.\" \n\nNot all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.\n\nBefore the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.\n\nThe Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute. The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a \"'major' find from a 'minor'\" site. Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a \"hollow-way\" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.\n\nThe displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market. The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.\n\nHatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works. \nThe Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.\n\nAccording to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.\n\nThe 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.\n\nThe Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"dispute resolution\" may also be used interchangeably with \"conflict resolution\", where conflict styles can be used for different scenarios. \n\nMethods of dispute resolution include:\nOne could theoretically include violence or even war as part of this spectrum, but dispute resolution practitioners do not usually do so; violence rarely ends disputes effectively, and indeed, often only escalates them. \n\nDispute resolution processes fall into two major types:\n\nNot all disputes, even those in which skilled intervention occurs, end in resolution. Such intractable disputes form a special area in dispute resolution studies.\n\nDispute resolution is an important requirement in international trade, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation.\n\nThe legal system provides resolutions for many different types of disputes. Some disputants will not reach agreement through a collaborative process. Some disputes need the coercive power of the state to enforce a resolution. Perhaps more importantly, many people want a professional advocate when they become involved in a dispute, particularly if the dispute involves perceived legal rights, legal wrongdoing, or threat of legal action against them.\n\nThe most common form of judicial dispute resolution is litigation. Litigation is initiated when one party files suit against another. In the United States, litigation is facilitated by the government within federal, state, and municipal courts. The proceedings are very formal and are governed by rules, such as rules of evidence and procedure, which are established by the legislature. Outcomes are decided by an impartial judge and/or jury, based on the factual questions of the case and the application law. The verdict of the court is binding, not advisory; however, both parties have the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court. Judicial dispute resolution is typically adversarial in nature, for example, involving antagonistic parties or opposing interests seeking an outcome most favorable to their position. \n\nRetired judges or private lawyers often become arbitrators or mediators; however, trained and qualified non-legal dispute resolution specialists form a growing body within the field of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). In the United States, many states now have mediation or other ADR programs annexed to the courts, to facilitate settlement of lawsuits.\n\nSome use the term \"dispute resolution\" to refer only to alternative dispute resolution (ADR), that is, extrajudicial processes such as arbitration, collaborative law, and mediation used to resolve conflict and potential conflict between and among individuals, business entities, governmental agencies, and (in the public international law context) states. ADR generally depends on agreement by the parties to use ADR processes, either before or after a dispute has arisen. ADR has experienced steadily increasing acceptance and utilization because of a perception of greater flexibility, costs below those of traditional litigation, and speedy resolution of disputes, among other perceived advantages. However, some have criticized these methods as taking away the right to seek redress of grievances in the courts, suggesting that extrajudicial dispute resolution may not offer the fairest way for parties not in an equal bargaining relationship, for example in a dispute between a consumer and a large corporation. In addition, in some circumstances, arbitration and other ADR processes may become as expensive as litigation or more so.\n\nAlés, Javier y Mata, Juan Diego \" manual práctico para mediadores: el misterio de la mediacion\" éxito Atelier.

Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated. The name 'ditloid' was given by the \"Daily Express\" newspaper, originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ \"1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\".\n\nWill Shortz originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of \"Games\" magazine, calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of \"What's hot and what's not,\" \"Us\" magazine named the Equation Analysis Test in the \"what's hot\" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:\nSome anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from \"Games\" (word for word, except for my byline),\nphotocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,\nand circulated around the country. \"Games\" readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending\nit back to \"Games\" as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!\nShortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in Morgan Worthy's 1975 book \"AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking\" (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:\n\nWorthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity\nof this puzzle:\nI got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had\nwritten in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the\nUniversity of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized\nthe format was a good one for eliciting the \"aha effect\". After that I\nused such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on\ncreative thinking.\nMy guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is\nthat the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in\nan incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly\nsee an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral\nrather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had\nthe answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously\nthinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about\nto fall asleep.\nAnother factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge\non obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, \"I\ncould never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it.\"\nThere is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer\ninside and just need to find it.\n"}

In casu, the defendant had employed an independent contractor to demolish certain buildings. In a claim for damages arising from the negligent performance of the work, Stratford ACJ said the following after considering various cases in South Africa and in England:\n\nThe English law on the subject as I have stated it to be is in complete accord with our own, both systems rest the rule as to the liability of an employer for any damage caused by work he authorises another to do upon the law of negligence.

She is Chairperson Emerita and one of the founders of the International Game Developers Association's Online Games group, has contributed or been editor in chief on multiple IGDA State of the Industry white papers, and was one of the Directors of the Global Game Jam from 2011–2014.\n\nDunin has published a book of exercises on classical cryptography, and maintains cryptography-related websites about topics such as \"Kryptos\", a sculpture at the Central Intelligence Agency containing an encrypted message, and another on the world's most famous unsolved codes. She has given several lectures on the subject of cryptography, and according to the PBS series \"NOVA scienceNOW\" she is \"generally considered the leading \"Kryptos\" expert in the world.\" In 2010, bestselling author Dan Brown named a character, Nola Kaye, in his novel \"The Lost Symbol\" after her, in an anagram pattern.\n\nDunin was born in Santa Monica, California, the older of two children to Stanley Dunin, a Polish-American mathematician, and Elsie Ivancich, a Croatian-American dance ethnologist at UCLA.\n\nDunin graduated in 1976 from University High School, and then enrolled as an undergraduate at UCLA, but dropped out near the end of her freshman year. \n\nDunin joined the United States Air Force, working as an avionics technician at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom and Beale Air Force Base in California. After choosing not to re-enlist, she studied digital electronics at Yuba College—a two-year community college—but did not obtain a degree.\n\nIn the 1980s, she became involved with the growing BBS culture. In 1989, while she was working as a temporary legal secretary in Los Angeles, this interest overlapped into the early multiplayer games, such as \"British Legends\" on CompuServe and Simutronics' \"GemStone II\" on GEnie.\n\nIn 1990, Dunin moved to St. Louis and began working for the online game company Simutronics. Simutronics launched its own website, play.net, in 1997 with Dunin as General Manager of Online Games, managing Simutronics' online community. Dunin was the product manager for \"GemStone III\", executive producer for the \"Hercules\" and \"\"-based multiplayer game \"Alliance of Heroes\", and worked in a variety of production and development roles on most of Simutronics' other products, including \"CyberStrike\", \"Modus Operandi\", \"DragonRealms\", HeroEngine, \"Fantasy University\", and \"Tiny Heroes\". She is a founding member of the International Game Developers Association's Online Games SIG and edited four of their annual White Papers on various aspects of the online game industry, such as \"Web and Downloadable Games\" and \"Persistent Worlds.\"\n\nDunin held a variety of production and development roles during her 24 years at Simutronics. Games that she worked on include:\n\nDunin has written books and articles about cryptography, and been interviewed on radio and television about related subjects such as \"Kryptos\", the Smithy Code, and Ricky McCormick's encrypted notes. In an interview with GIGnews.com, Dunin said that in the year 2000 she cracked the PhreakNIC v3.0 Code, an amateur cryptographic puzzle created by a hacker group, and that this launched her public interest in high-profile ciphers. Because of the location of \"Kryptos\" on CIA grounds, physical access to the sculpture is restricted. According to \"Wired News\", in 2002, Dunin gave a presentation to CIA analysts about steganography and Al-Qaeda, and \"[i]n 2002, Dunin was one of the lucky few who saw [Kryptos] in person\", and \"she also made rubbings of the text\". Based on her visit, she launched the beginnings of what became a comprehensive website about the sculpture, and also became co-moderator of a Yahoo Group that is attempting to decipher the encrypted messages on the sculpture.\nIn 2003, Dunin organized a team which solved the ciphers on \"Kryptos\"'s sister sculpture, the \"Cyrillic Projector\".\n\nWhen \"Kryptos\" sculptor Jim Sanborn chose to release information about an error on the sculpture in 2006, he contacted Dunin to make the announcement. In July 2007, Dunin appeared on the PBS program \"NOVA scienceNOW\", as an expert on \"Kryptos\", and in 2009, contributed two articles about the sculpture for the book \"Secrets of The Lost Symbol: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci Code Sequel\", a companion book to author Dan Brown's novel \"The Lost Symbol\". Dunin had assisted Brown with the research for the novel, and Brown named a character in the novel after her. The character \"Nola Kaye\" is an anagrammed form of \"Elonka\".\n\nIn 2006, Dunin compiled a book of several hundred exercises in classical cryptography, which was published in the United States as \"The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms\", and in the UK as \"The Mammoth Book of Secret Code Puzzles\". The book also includes a few details about several unsolved codes, such as \"Kryptos\".\n\nIn 2013, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Dunin, the NSA released documents which show the NSA became involved in attempts to solve the \"Kryptos\" puzzle in 1992, following a challenge by Bill Studeman, Deputy Director of the CIA. The documents show that by June 1993, a small group of NSA cryptanalysts had succeeded in solving the first three parts of the sculpture.\n\nDunin has given talks on \"Kryptos\" and the \"Cyrillic Projector\" at the National Security Agency's NSA Cryptologic History Symposium, Def Con, Shmoocon, Notacon, PhreakNIC, and Dragon*Con, and has also given lectures at the International Game Developers Conference. She has been invited to be a co-host on the Binary Revolution webcast three times. In October 2012, she was the guest of honor at Archon.\n\n\n"}

Frankweiler\n\nFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler is a novel by E. L. Konigsburg. It was published by Atheneum in 1967, the second book published from two manuscripts the new writer had submitted to editor Jean E. Karl.\n\n\"Mixed-Up Files\" won the annual Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1968, and Konigsburg's first-published book \"Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth\" was one of the runners-up in the same year, the only double honor in Newbery history (from 1922).\nAnita Silvey covered \"Mixed‑Up Files\" as one of the \"100 Best Books for Children\" in 2005. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association named it one of \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number seven among all-time children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\".\n\nThe prologue is a letter from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, addressed \"To my lawyer, Saxonberg\", accompanied by a drawing of her writing at her office desk. It serves as the cover letter for the 162-page narrative, and provides background for changes to her last will and testament.\nTwelve-year-old Claudia Kincaid decides to run away from her home in suburban Connecticut, because she thinks her parents do not appreciate her and she doesn't like it. She takes refuge in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in New York City, with her brother Jamie. She chooses Jamie as her companion partly because he has saved all his money. With the help of an unused adult train fare card that she found in a wastebasket, Claudia finds a way to get to the museum for free using the commuter train and a very long walk.\n\nEarly chapters depict Claudia and Jamie settling in at the Met: hiding in the bathroom at closing time, as security staff check to see that all the patrons have departed; blending in with school groups on tour; bathing in the fountain, and using \"wishing coins\" for money; and sleeping in Irwin Untermyer's antique bed.\n\nA new exhibit draws sensational crowds and fascinates the children: the marble statue of an angel, the sculptor unknown but suspected to be Michelangelo. It was purchased at auction, for only a few hundred dollars, from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, a collector who recently closed her showcase Manhattan residence. The children research it on site and at the Donnell Library, and give their conclusion to the museum staff anonymously.\n\nAfter learning they have been naive, the children spend the last of their money on travel to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler's home in Connecticut. She recognizes them as runaways but sets them briefly to the task of researching the angel from files in her long bank of cabinets. Despite the idiosyncratic organization of her files, they do discover the angel's secret—Mrs. Frankweiler has purposefully \"given away\" a virtually priceless Michelangelo to the Met. In exchange for a full account of their adventure, she will leave the crucial file to them in her will, and send them home in her Rolls-Royce. \nClaudia learns her deep motive for persisting in the crazy search: she wanted a secret of her own to treasure and keep. Mrs. Frankweiler may get \"grandchildren\" who delight her. Her lawyer gets a luncheon date at the Met, to revise her will.\n\nThe Kincaids live in Greenwich, Connecticut. Mrs. Frankweiler lives on a \"country estate\" in Farmington, Connecticut, closer to Hartford.\n\n\nWhen Konigsburg submitted \"Mixed‑Up Files\" to Jean Karl at Atheneum in 1966, she was an unpublished mother of three children living in the suburbs of New York City.\n\nOne inspiration for the novel was a page-one story in the \"New York Times\" on October 26, 1965. Konigsburg recalled years later that the Metropolitan Museum had purchased for only $225 a plaster and stucco statue from the time of the Italian Renaissance. \"They knew they had an enormous bargain.\"\n\nAnother inspiration was complaints by Konigsburg's children in Yellowstone National Park, about a picnic with many amenities of home. She inferred that if they ever ran away \"[t]hey would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art\".\n\nThe author's two younger children Laurie and Ross (who turned eleven and nine in 1967) posed for the illustrations of Claudia and Jamie. Anita Brigham, a neighbor in their Port Chester, New York, apartment house posed as Mrs. Frankweiler.\n\nThe character of Mrs. Frankweiler was based on Headmistress Olga Pratt at Bartram's School for Girls in Jacksonville, Florida, where Konigsburg once taught chemistry. \"Miss Pratt was not wealthy, but she was a matter-of-fact person. Kind, but firm.\"\n\nOn February 21, 2014, family and friends of E.L. Konigsburg gathered in a private space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to pay tribute to the author, who died on April 19, 2013 at age 83. One of the speakers was Paul Konigsburg, the author's son. He told a story.\n\nThere were three adaptations before 1998, all under the original title.\n\n\n"}

It is preceded by Richard Banckes's unillustrated \"Herball\" (1525), which was the first printed English herbal ever produced. The \"Grete Herball\" is a single volume compendium which details the medicinal properties (or virtues) of plants and some non-botanical items according to the system of humoralism. Confirmed editions were printed between 1526 and 1561, with many still in existence today. Its full title is \"The grete herball : whiche geueth parfyt knowlege and under standyng of all maner of herbes & there gracyous vertues whiche god hath ordeyned for our prosperous welfare and helth : for they hele & cure all maner of dyseases and sekenesses that fall or mysfortune to all maner of creatoures of god created : practysed by many expert and wyse maysters, as Aucienna & other &c.\"\n\nLike most medieval and early modern herbals, the \"Grete Herball\" is made up of information taken from earlier works. This literary tradition can be traced back to the second millennium b.c.e., but the number of herbals grew most in the thirteenth century. De Materia Medica is considered one of the most important encyclopedias of plant knowledge from the time, but herbals became numerous and wholesale lifting of information common and expected. Authors and printers borrowed freely, often without the addition of any original content. Instead, the \"Grete Herball\" is considered the only known translation from French of \"Le Grant Herbier\" (1498). Like contemporary herbals, \"Le Grant Herbier\" exhibits heavy borrowing. Over half of its chapters are lifted from \"Circa instans\", a Salernitan work created between approximately 1130 and 1150. Later botanists, such as William Turner and Nicholas Culpeper, would begin to break this tradition and put their own observations, research, and theories into their herbals alongside older knowledge. Turner was disdainful of previous efforts, it is believed he is referring to the \"Grete Herball\" when he states \"...as yet there was no English Herbal but one, all full of unlearned cacographees (bad spelling) and falsely naming of herbs...\" in the preface to his own \"Herbal\" (1568).\n\nSimilarly, the \"Grete Herball\"'s numerous woodcuts are taken from \"Le Grant Herbier\", but like the text these images are not original to the French \"Herbier\". They are in fact copies of a series of woodcuts which first appeared in the German \"Herbarius zu Teutsch\" (also known as \"Der Gart\"). In the \"Grete Herball\" the same woodcut image is often reused for multiple entries. By most accounts, these images became much degraded between their original use in \"Herbarius\" and their subsequent recycling in the \"Grete Herball\". Woodcuts were expensive to acquire, and like other printers of his time Peter Treveris would reuse them in later books. One such book is \"\"The vertuose boke of Distillacyon of the waters of all maner of Herbes\" (1527), translated by Laurence Andrew from the \"Liber de arte distillandi\" by Hieronymus Braunschweig, [which] is illustrated with cuts from the same wood-blocks as the \"Grete Herball\".\"\n\nThe book is printed in a double column format with black letter typeface and contains a variety of woodcuts depicting plants, animals, people, and garden scenes. Though the order varies by edition, many feature a list of chapters at the beginning and an index at the end. The \"Grete Herball\" contains extensive information on plant life as well as entries on animals, comestibles, and minerals. Each entry features an image of the plant or item, its Latin name, any known alternate names, its humoral categorization, any associated folklore, a list of its medical and practical applications, and instructions for use. Editions and surviving copies vary in length. Botanist Richard Pulteney's description of a 1526 copy states that \"...if printed with numbered pages, [it] would make three hundred and fifty, exclusive of the Preface and Index.\"\n\nPeter Treveris, printer, is widely believed to be responsible for the first productions of the \"Grete Herball\". His dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is estimated that he died in the mid-1530s. Though there is some evidence suggesting Treveris first printed the \"Grete Herball\" in 1516, the earliest verifiable edition dates to July 27, 1526. This edition was printed at Southwark, as was the second edition in 1529. Treveris was active as a printer between approximately 1525 and 1532, during which time he printed such works as Hieronymus Braunschweig's \"Noble Handiwork of Surgery\" (1525), the \"Grete Herball\" (1526, 1529), and the \"Polychronicon\" (1527). The \"Grete Herball\"'s translation from French may have been performed by his associate Lawrence Andrewe, a fellow printer and bookseller, but this is as yet unconfirmed. Some copies of the \"Herball\" contain an image of Treveris's personal device, a shield bearing his initials held up by a wild man and woman. Some copies also contain Andrewe's device, confirming their collaboration.\n\nThe Grete Herball proved popular enough to be reprinted several times after Treveris's death. Thome Gybson printed an updated edition \"The grete herbal newly corrected\" in 1539, and printer John Kyng produced the final Early Modern edition in 1561. Both Gybson and Kyng use fewer images and different frontispieces than Treveris's editions.\n\n\nThe first and second editions of the \"Grete Herball\" are extremely rare. Only three \"complete and perfect\" copies of the 1529 edition are known to exist, though fragments of other copies have been found. Those that do exist usually show signs of repair, such as being rebound or having replaced spines and added pages. One such copy, a 1529 edition transferred to Cambridge University in 2013, exhibits repair work done over many centuries.\nChristie's auction listing of a 1526 \"Grete Herball\" claims there are only three complete copies of the first edition as well, with incomplete copies held by Yale and in the Marshall Collection. Provenance of these books can be difficult to trace, and records of ownership often reach only to the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries.\n\nGiven their scarcity, copies of the \"Grete Herball\" are of interest to rare book collectors. Early editions have been valued in the thousands at auction. Sotheby's auction house valued one 1526 copy (bound together with Treveris's printing of the \"Noble Handiwork of Surgery\" (1525)) between £50,000 and £70,000 GBP. The 1526 copy sold by Christie's fetched $5,625 USD on June 24, 2009, and was valued between $4000 – $6000 USD.\n\nAs an herbal text, the book's content is primarily on the medicinal uses and properties of the materials described. Exceptions to this rule are suggestions for cosmetic use or folklore associated with the item. One well-known entry concerns the Mandrake, an herb with the mythical human form of a man and a woman. Accompanying woodcuts demonstrate this belief, but the \"Grete Herball\"'s entry text dismisses the myth outright: \"Some say that the male hath figure or shape of a man. And the female of a woman, but that is false. For nature never gave forme or shape of mankynde to an herbe. But it is of trough (truth) that some hath shaped such figures by craft.\" Entries can also hold warnings for those seeking to use the items, such as the entry for Spodium (elephant ivory), which describes dog bones sometimes being passed off as ipodium (elephant bones) by unscrupulous physicians. Each plant and non-botanical is also described as being either hot or cold, dry or wet, and the \"degree\" of each. This categorization allowed doctors to prescribe a corresponding medicine for diseases, which were defined by the same system in a separate section of the book.\n\nCopies of this herbal are not consistent in their current form, many having been rebound or bound with other books. The following arrangement is taken from the 1526 edition of the Grete Herball at Special Collections, The Claremont Colleges Library, Claremont, California.\n\nThe title page is dominated by the printed full title of the Grete Herball, with a large frontispiece depicting a man and woman working in a garden. In each corner a mandrake root of each gender is depicted. The title is printed in both red and black ink.\n\nThis full-page image is a frontal view of a human skeleton, with labels describing the major bones of the body.mohanty bira kishore\n\nThere are approximately 400 entries for plants and non-botanical items. Of these, 150 plants are English natives. Some plant entries are mugwort, cypress, mandrake root, grapes, chamomile, muscat, and marrubium (horehound). Animals recommended for their medicinal value include hare, fox (fox grease is recommended for muscle cramps), goat, ox, elephant ivory, and beaver. Some of the minerals and liquids listed are lyme, glass, magnets, pearls, amber, sulpher, water, and vinegar. Foods that double as remedies are also present, with cheese prescribed for purgation, butter, honey, and zipules (a type of heavy fritter) recommended for toothaches. Some of the entries feature truly unusual remedies, such as a lengthy section on the use of mummy (spelled as mommie), the powdered version of which is described as a remedy for stopping nosebleeds. Besides medical uses, these entries also provide information on cosmetic applications of items, such as the bones of sepia (cuttlefish) for whitening the teeth and complexion.\n\nAn addendum to the previous section, with the same style and format.\n\nThis section contains information on physician's classifications of the humors and types of illness. This is according to the Galenic system of humors, with the four temperaments described according to the state of their \"bryne\" or humors. This is followed by instructions for diagnosis of illnesses, again by referencing the state of a person's \"bryne\".\n\nA catalogue of illnesses and their symptoms. Some examples are alopecia, asthma, worms, cramps, flesh wounds, fluxes, and gout.\n\nThe final index is an alphabetically organized list of various maladies, with reference to the entry number and first letter of appropriate medicines for each. The headings are often specific, such as \"For wormes in the bely of chyldren\" or \"For broken synews.\"\n\nUsually, the \"Grete Herball\" is not the sole focus of scholarly work itself, but is mentioned in larger examinations of the history of herbals and botany. One exception is \"The English Plant Names in The Grete Herball (1526) A contribution to the Historical Study of English Plant-Name Usage\" by Swedish author Mats Rydén. It is a philological study focused on the herbal's English plant names, \"...their frequency of use, provenance, typology, and synonymy (i.e. identity)...and changes in groups of names.\" It has been praised as filling a \"shocking gap in English-language scholarship\", but its potential use as a historical work has been questioned.\n"}

One of the few female archaeologists of her time, she was the first female employee of the Vatican Museums and one of the first professional women to be employed by the Vatican. She was a pioneering contributor to the collections of archaeological photographs and is often credited as being the first archaeological photo-archivist.\n\nHermine Speier was born on 28 May, 1898, in Frankfurt am Main into a wealthy Jewish family. She attended Frankfurt's Viktoriaschule, passing her matriculation examination in Wiesbaden after attending a private school. In the winter semester of 1918/19 she enrolled at the University of Frankfurt, studying history, German literature and philosophy. In the summer semester of 1919 she transferred to the University of Giessen, and in the winter semester 1919/20 continued at the University of Heidelberg. In Giessen, she also attended a teachers' training course and was introduced to classical archaeology at the college run by Gerhart Rodenwaldt. In Heidelberg she changed her major to archaeology. She studied under teachers such as Eberhard Gothein, Friedrich Gundolf, Karl Jaspers, Hermann Oncken, Hans Driesch and Karl Ludwig Hampe. After 1920, when Ludwig Curtius was appointed to the university, he became her most important teacher and patron, helping her to focus on archaeology. Besides Curtius, teachers such as Franz Boll, Alfred von Domaszewski, Karl Meister and especially Bernhard Schweitzer gave her a broad-based knowledge of antiquity.\n\nSpeier graduated with a doctorate in archaeology and a double minor in ancient history and classical philology in 1925 under Curtius with a dissertation titled \"Die Gruppen angelehnter Figuren im V. und IV. Jahrhundert\". The work was published seven years later in Rome under the title \"Two figure groups in the fifth and fourth century BC\". The work contrasts differences in images between the Archaic and Hellenistic periods of Greek art. Working in the tradition of Johann Joachim Winckelmann's methodology, she used scientific analysis to show that art reflected the historical development of culture and government. Curtius was so impressed with her work, that he stated: \"If it were possible, I would give her the best mark for this excellent performance, but it is reserved for those of the male nature\". She was the only woman to achieve a doctorate under Curtius. After graduating she began working as an assistant to Bernhard Schweitzer in Königsberg until 1928, when Curtius recruited her to help with the photographic archive at the German Archaeological Institute () (DAI) in Rome. \n\nCurtius was at that time the Director of the Institute and was still in the process of constructing the photographic archive. Speier was entrusted with organizing the photographic archive (\"Fotothek\"), with her assistant Adolf Greifenhagen. The initial collection was based on a gift of photographs by Walther Amelung. Her work, which systematically ordered the photos, has earned her the distinction as the first archaeological photo-archivist and earned her wide professional recognition at the time from other libraries. When Hitler came to power, he removed all Jews from civil service positions with the passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, and precipitously she was offered the chance to build a photographic archive at the Vatican by the Director-General of the Vatican Museums, Bartolomeo Nogara. She left the DAI in 1934, joining the staff at the Vatican and becoming the first woman employed by the Holy See. Pope Pius XI signed her contract, though initially it was for no fixed term and at a daily rate, as both a statement against Nazi antisemitism and the taboo of employing women. The timing of her hiring coincided with the first administration of the Museum's collections by a scientist. Prior to Nogaras, the collections were jointly managed by Guido Galli, who was a sculptor and the painter Biagio Biagetti.\n\nThe first task was to divide the 20,000 photographic negatives into three separate collections named Classical Archaeology, Medieval and Modern Times, and Ethnographic Missions. Then she and her colleagues, archaeologist Filippo Magi and the art historian Deoclecio Redig de Campos, began to classify the images, and deal with the constant flow of incoming new photographs. In 1935, the Marchese Benedetto Guglielmo donated a private Etruscan art collection to Pope Pius XI. Speier was assigned to organize the collection. Of particular importance, she established two halls with 17 original Greek sculptures from the collection and worked on the Roman refurbishment of the Greek vase collection and the Antiquarium. During the mid-1930s, Speier spent considerable time in Germany traveling annually to visit her family. In 1937, her letters to her lover, Italian General, airship pioneer and Arctic explorer Umberto Nobile, indicated that she was in Frankfurt for an extended period, and then in 1938, she spent time in Basel and Geneva before returning to Frankfurt. Hitler's first meeting with Mussolini took place in Rome in May 1938, but Speier was not back in Rome until July. Then in September, she was in the Tuscan town of Chianciano Terme. Pope Pius XI died on 10 February, 1939 and Speier converted to Catholicism later that year with Pope Pius XII immediately renewing her employment. Although she was intensely occupied with her work at the Vatican, she often considered emigrating to the United States, where her mother and sister lived, or to Brazil. During this early period of his papacy, Pius XII granted 3,000 visas to Jews, if they had been baptized, to emigrate to Brazil, though the only evidence found linking Speier and Pius XII at this time was, in her correspondence, his congratulatory telegram on her conversion. Throughout 1939 and 1940, Nobile was in the United States and Speier remained in Rome until the summer of 1940, when she took a retreat to Chianciano. After 1940, correspondence between the two was sparse as they feared censors and writing had become increasingly impractical. \n\nNobile returned to Rome in May 1942 and her family severed communication with Speier after learning of her Catholic baptism, effectively ending her reasons for emigration. During the German occupation of Rome 1943/1944 Pope Pius XII made arrangements for Giulio Belvederi, nephew of the former Pontifical Master of Ceremonies Pietro Respighi, to hide Speier in the Catacombs of St. Priscilla, under the nunnery. Hiding in the catacombs saved Speier from the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943 in which more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and all save 16 were killed. During this part of the war, the Museum was closed, until the end of September 1944, and many artworks from war-torn areas were shipped to the Vatican for storage. When it reopened, she continued with her work creating a detailed monuments inventory of the Vatican holdings, which resulted in several important finds. In 1946, in an antiquities storage facility, she found a horse head sculpted by Phidias which was originally from one of the pediments of the Parthenon. On further examination, it was established from its weathering that it was in fact the second horse of Athena's chariot on the western gable, where the dispute between Athena and Poseidon over the land of Attica is depicted. Speier also discovered the two so-called ancient Aurai statues that decorated the exterior of the Sala Rotonda when it was built in the 18th century. She published \"Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums\" (The Sculptures of the Vatican Museums) in 1956 about the find of the Parthenon horse's head, and earlier in 1950 had published a distinguished report concerning the excavations of St. Peter's Basilica in Herbig's \"Vermächtnis der Antiken Kunst\" (Legacy of Ancient Art) entitled \"Die neuen Ausgrabungen unter der Peterskirche in Rom\".\n\nSpeier was solely responsible for the collection of antiquities in the Vatican Museums, from 1961, and all of the photo-archives before 1966 were under her direction. With her appointment, a tradition was established of including one member from Germany in the central administration. She retired as archivist and director in 1967, being succeeded by Francesco Roncalli and Georg Daltrop. As a result of her immense knowledge of ancient monuments, from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s Speier was entrusted by the German Archaeological Institute with the publication of the fourth edition of Wolfgang Helbig's guide to the public collections of classical antiquities in Rome (\"Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom\"), which had not been updated in half a century. She expanded the guide's coverage, classifying the works into various groupings. She brought in several young experts to assist her, in particular Helga von Heintze, Klaus Parlasca, Erika Simon, Hans von Steuben, Dietrich Willers and Paul Zanker. She also translated the guide from Italian into German.\n\nSpeier was never married despite several betrothals. She lived near the Vatican on the Janiculum in a comfortable apartment with a roof terrace which had been put at her disposal by her lifelong patron Erich Boehringer. She held a cultural salon there, inviting guests such as Marie Luise Kaschnitz, who dedicated a poem to Speier; , a noted archaeology professor; Paul Augustin Mayer, a German Cardinal and Oriol Schädel, head of the Library of the Piazza di Monte Citorio, among others of the German and Italian intelligentsia. Speier was an active member of the German Archaeological Institute and the Pontifical Academy of Archaeology. In 1973, she was awarded the Cross of Merit of Germany. She received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal from the Vatican.\n\nSpeier died on 12 January 1989 in Montreux, Switzerland, and was buried in the Campo Santo Teutonico, the Vatican's Teutonic Cemetery. Her grave bears a piece of a Tarentum clay relief which she had wanted to publish about as early as 1937 in the \"Festschrift Corolla Ludwig Curtius\". She had been unable to do so as Jews were excluded from the publication. Finally in 1955 she exhibited the piece from her private collection and published \"Fragment eines tarentinischen Tonreliefs in römischem Privatbesitz\" (Fragment of a Roman Tarentum clay relief in private property). Her gravestone also bears the inscription \"Leben ist Liebe\" (Life is Love).\n\n\n"}

After a rebrand of Kingston Communications to KC in 2010 the \"Hull Colour Pages\" was renamed \"KC Colour Pages\".\n\nIn 1999 \"Hull Colour Pages\" launched its Online Directory which, whilst not the UK's first online directory, set the scene for further innovation when, in 2004, \"Hull Colour Pages\" launched the UK's first online directory advertising proofing system, enabling its advertisers to review and either accept or amend their advertisements via a web interface.

Essentially, an LSID is a unique identifier for some data, and the LSID protocol specifies a standard way to locate the data (as well as a standard way of describing that data). They are a little like DOIs used by many publishers. \n\nAn LSID is represented as a uniform resource name (URN) with the following format:\nThe \"lsid:\" namespace, however, is not registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and so these are not strictly URNs or URIs.\n\nLSIDs may be resolved in URLs, e.g. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CDC8D258-8F57-41DC-B560-247E17D3DC8C \nThere has been a lot of interest in LSIDs in both the bioinformatics and the biodiversity communities, with the latter continuing to use them as a way of identifying species in global catalogues. However, more recently, as understanding has increased of how HTTP URIs can perform a similar naming task, the use of LSIDs as identifiers has been criticized as violating the Web Architecture good practice of reusing existing URI schemes. Nevertheless, the explicit separation of data from metadata; specification of a method for discovering multiple locations for data-retrieval; and the ability to discover multiple independent sources of metadata for any identified thing were crucial parts of the LSID and its resolution specification that have not successfully been mimicked by an HTTP-only approach.\n\nThe World Wide Web provides a globally distributed communication framework that is essential for almost all scientific collaboration, including bioinformatics. However, several limits and inadequacies were thought to exist, one of which was the inability to programmatically identify locally named objects that may be widely distributed over the network. This perceived shortcoming would have limited our ability to integrate multiple knowledgebases, each of which gives partial information of a shared domain, as is commonly seen in bioinformatics. The Life Science Identifier (LSID) and LSID Resolution System (LSRS) were designed to provide simple and elegant solutions to this problem, consistent with next-generation Semantic Web and semantic grid, based on the extension of existing internet technologies. However, it has more recently been pointed out that some of these perceived shortcomings are not intrinsic to HTTP URIs, and much (though not all) of the functionality that LSIDs provide can be obtained using properly crafted HTTP URIs.\n\n\n"}

Even where an oral notice would be effective, the effective date or time of termination may be directly or indirectly fixed on delivery of a written letter or email, for the sake of clarity and record. In response, different arrangements may be made or agreed, such as an earlier effective date, or improved terms and conditions of appointment upon withdrawal of the letter.\n\nIt should normally be delivered in advance to the appropriate supervisor or superior, and contain such information as the intended last day at work. A period of notice may be required expressly by contract, impliedly by the pay interval, or otherwise. Nevertheless, in practice, some resignations can be effective immediately.\n\nFor courtesy's sake, a letter of resignation may thank the employer for the pleasure of working under them and the opportunities and experience gained thereby, and also offer to assist with the transition by, for example, training the replacement. A more hostile letter may assert other sentiments or claims, particularly that the contract or terms of employment have been broken. In any case, the terms of the letter and its consequences may often be negotiated, either before or after delivery.\n\nA formal letter with minimal expression of courtesy is then-President of the United States Richard Nixon's letter of resignation, under the terms of a relatively unknown law passed by Congress March 1, 1792, likely drafted as the Constitution spelled out no direct procedure for how a president might resign. Delivered to then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on 9 August 1974, it read simply, \"I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.\" It was simply dated, but the recipient also recorded upon it the time of receipt, at which it took effect with important consequences under the Constitution.\n\nIt is advisable to write a resignation letter in order to leave a good impression on one's employer or boss. The reason must be mentioned in a concise manner so that it catches the hiring managers attention. Such a resignation letter paves way for a smooth exit interview later.\n"}

These materials range from synthetic DNA oligonucleotides or patient-derived genomic DNA, to actual patient tissue biopsies with known mutation status.\n\nProficiency schemes involve the distribution of blinded reference materials to subscription laboratories, and the subsequent scoring and assessment of the proficiency of those labs in their molecular diagnostic testing.\n\nProficiency schemes are usually organized by not-for-profit organizations, usually government affiliated, to which hundreds of laboratories may subscribe. These schemes are funded with the subscription fees paid by each member laboratory.\n\nProficiency schemes have historically relied upon patient biopsies with known mutation status for distribution to member laboratories. However, due to the significant rise in the number of labs performing molecular testing (in turn caused by the increase in the number of available targeted drugs whose prescription is linked to the presence or absence of a particular biomarker), patient samples are becoming an unsustainable source of reference material. Increasingly, proficiency scheme organizers are turning to genetically modified cell lines as a sustainable and well defined source of reference material.\n\nSome of the largest proficiency scheme organizers in the world include:\n\nSources of Certified Reference Materials (CRM) include:\n\nMore Information can be found on the CDC and Eurogentest webpages.\nCell Line Repositories\n"}

Previously owned by Novell, the product has also been known as Novell Directory Services (NDS) and sometimes referred to as \"NetWare Directory Services\". NDS was initially released by Novell in 1993 for Netware 4, replacing the Netware bindery mechanism used in previous versions, for centrally managing access to resources on multiple servers and computers within a given network. eDirectory is a hierarchical, object oriented database used to represent certain assets in an organization in a logical tree, including organizations, organizational units, people, positions, servers, volumes, workstations, applications, printers, services, and groups to name just a few.\n\neDirectory uses dynamic rights inheritance, which allows both global and specific access controls. Access rights to objects in the tree are determined at the time of the request and are determined by the rights assigned to the objects by virtue of their location in the tree, any security equivalences, and individual assignments. The software supports partitioning at any point in the tree, as well as replication of any partition to any number of servers. Replication between servers occurs periodically using deltas of the objects. Each server can act as a master of the information it holds (provided the replica is not read only). Additionally, replicas may be filtered to only include defined attributes to increase speed (for example, a replica may be configured to only include a name and phone number for use in a corporate address book, as opposed to the entire directory user profile).\n\nThe software supports referential integrity, multi-master replication, and has a modular authentication architecture. It can be accessed via LDAP, DSML, SOAP, ODBC, JDBC, JNDI, and ADSI.\n\n\nWhen Novell first designed their directory, they decided to store large amounts of their operational server data within the directory in addition to just user account information. As a result, a typical Novell directory contains a large pool of additional objects representing the servers themselves and any software services running on those servers, such as LDAP or email software.\n\nMicrosoft's Active Directory is fairly simple by comparison, typically storing only user and machine objects in their directory. Other Windows network configuration information is scattered across other databases such as the Windows registry, the domain name server, and specialized services such as the global catalog. NetWare integrated all these functions into eDirectory. Even file system information is stored in the directory as \"volume objects\".\n\nVersions of eDirectory prior to version 8 (then called Novell Directory Services) used a record-based database management engine called Recman, which relied on the Transaction Tracking System built into the NetWare operating system. Since version 8, eDirectory (along with the GroupWise collaboration suite, starting with version 5) uses the FLAIM (FLexible Adaptable Information Management) database engine. FLAIM is an open source embeddable database engine developed by Novell and released under the GPL license in 2006. This change allowed for it to be ported to other platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Unix.\n\n\n\n"}

The tablet has two columns per side and is in poor condition, with the surface severely abraded and most of the left-hand side (columns I and IV) gone. It may have been part of a series as there is part of a catch-line evident on line 8 of column IV. It is designated BM 35968 (Sp III, 504) and is held in the British Museum. Written during the Seleucid era, it was acquired by the Museum from Spartali & Co, sponsors of much of the unofficial tablet gathering in Iraq under Ottoman jurisdiction, in 1880, and consequently its find spot is uncertain.\n\nThe earliest king to appear in the text is Nabû-šumu-libūr (ca. 1033 – 1026 BC) on line 16 of the first column and the work also name-drops Nabû-mukin-apli (ca. 978 – 943 BC).

It was the first full-scale Saturn V completed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Though SA-500D never flew, it was instrumental in the development of the Saturn V rocket which propelled the first men to the Moon as part of the Apollo program. Built under the direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun, it served as the test vehicle for all of the Saturn support facilities at MSFC.\n\nSA-500D is the only Saturn V on display that was used for its intended purpose, and the only one to have been assembled prior to museum display. It is on permanent display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nBefore a Saturn V could launch, engineers needed to verify that their design had accounted for everything the rocket would encounter on its journey, from assembly to the launchpad and from Earth to the Moon. To validate the Saturn V design and procedures, they created five pre-flight configurations for testing. These configurations were subjected to tests simulating all aspects of flight preparations and flight itself, and all the tests needed to demonstrate satisfactory results before MSFC would certify the Saturn V to fly.\n\nSA-500D was one of the five pre-flight configurations of the Saturn V. This configuration showed the Saturn V's \"bending and vibration characteristics\" and verified \"the adequacy of guidance and control systems' design.\" The rocket's of thrust would generate vigorous shaking and it was important to see that the rocket would not shake apart or vibrate itself off-course.\n\nOther pre-flight configurations were:\n\nThe vehicle designated SA-500D did not include an Apollo spacecraft, but boilerplate parts were used during testing to verify the entire system.\n\nThe Saturn V consisted of three stages and an Instrument Unit (IU). The first stage, S-IC, delivered thrust and delivered the other stages to . Afterwards, it was jettisoned to fall into the Atlantic Ocean and the second stage continued acceleration. The second stage, S-II, was responsible for lifting the remaining parts nearly to Earth orbit. The third stage, S-IVB provided the final push to orbit and the trans-lunar injection burn to set the Apollo spacecraft on a course to the Moon. The IU was the guidance and control computer. SA-500D was the assembly of these components for dynamic testing.\n\nThe Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand with \"electrodynamic shakers\" provided a table capable not only of holding the Saturn V fully assembled and fueled, but also able to simulate the vibrations that would be generated by rocket engines.\n\nThe components used for testing were developed from 1964–66, and the tests conducted in 1966-67. Because the Saturn V shared some components with the Saturn IB, some of the components for SA-500D were initially used for dynamic testing with the Saturn IB stack.\n\nIn naming the individual stages, MSFC used the stage designation with a suffix indicating its purpose. For example, S-IC-D was the first stage, S-IC, for dynamic testing, and S-IC-1 was the first flight model of the first stage. Suffixes used were S, for structural, F for facilities, T for all-systems test, and D for dynamic testing.\n\nFollowing is a history of each component of the dynamic test article in order of appearance.\n\nDevelopment of the test article started from the top. A boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, BP-27 together with LTA-2, was used for all configurations of dynamic testing. The boilerplate took the place of actual flight hardware. Boilerplate size, shape, mass and center of gravity were the same, but it was not necessary for the entire Apollo spacecraft to be complete to commence dynamic testing. The boilerplate was outfitted with instrumentation to record data for engineering study and evaluation.\n\nBP-27 consisted of hardware specifically built for that configuration and some hardware reassigned from other designations. The Command Module and Launch Escape System were unique to BP-27. The Service Module SM-010 (formerly SM-006) and the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapters SLA #1 were also assigned to BP-27.\n\nBP-27 was accepted at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in late September, 1964.\n\nShortly thereafter, MSFC took delivery of the boilerplate Lunar Module, called a Lunar Test Article and designated LTA-2. LTA-2 is the only part of SA-500D to fly in space. It was refurbished, designated LTA-2R, and flew on Apollo 6.\n\nBP-27 was used for Saturn IB dynamic testing, shipped to Kennedy Space Center to be a component of SA-500F, and shipped back to MSFC for full-stack testing with SA-500D.\n\nThe third stage, S-IVB-D arrived at MSFC before any other Saturn V stages because it was destined for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB first. It was assembled by Douglas near Los Angeles. With ceremony and dignitaries for the first Douglas-built S-IVB stage, it set out by barge December 8, 1964, and made its way to New Orleans via the Panama Canal, the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers to MSFC, where it arrived on January 4, 1965. The same day, MSFC took delivery of the first stage of the Saturn IB for dynamic and facilities checkout testing, S-IB-D/F. The parts were assembled together with the instrument unit designated S-IU-200D/500D (see below) and BP-27 for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB configuration from February to September 1965 before it was allocated to the Saturn V configuration.\n\nThe Saturn V Instrument Unit served as the electronics hub for the first three stages of the rocket, controlling engine firing, guidance, stage separation, and climate for the three stages below. It consisted of two main parts, a rigid ring for structure, and within that, electronics.\n\nInstrument units had a slightly different numbering scheme than the other parts. S-IU-200D/500D was for use with the SA-200D dynamic test article - a Saturn IB, and also for use with SA-500D, the Saturn V.\n\nIBM won the contract to build electronics for the IU, and so, by 1964, constructed a $14 million four-building complex including a manufacturing facility with clean room in Huntsville.\n\nThe IU's structural ring had two responsibilities: provide a mounting location for IBM's electronics and hold everything on top of it. It needed to be structurally sound enough to hold the weight of the Lunar Module, Service Module, Command Module and the three astronauts during the acceleration provided by three mighty stages of rocket beneath. The rings were all fabricated at MSFC.\n\nThe IU for SA-500D was not the first built. MSFC built S-IU-200V/500V for vibration testing from September to November 1964. Wyle Labs tested it as part of the Saturn I-B program.\n\nS-IU-200D/500D was the second IU to be built, with the ring completed in January 1965 and electronic components from IBM installed by February 1. It was the last piece necessary for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB program. It was stacked together with S-IVB-D, S-IB-D, and BP-27 for Saturn IB testing through much of 1965. On October 8, 1965, it began dynamic testing for the Saturn V program as part of SA-500D.\n\nMSFC built the first three S-IC test first stages for the Saturn V: S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F. They also built the first two flight stages, S-IC-1 and S-IC-2. S-IC-D was the first to be built by Boeing at the Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans using the tooling that had been developed in Huntsville.\n\nS-IC-D, was under construction on September 9, 1965 when Hurricane Betsy struck the Michoud Assembly Facility. The building housing the stage sustained severe damage, but the stage itself was repaired promptly.\n\nS-IC-D set out on the maiden voyage of NASA barge \"Poseidon\" to Marshall Space Flight Center on October 6, 1965 and arrived at MSFC October 13. The first stage was lifted into place in the Dynamic Test Stand January 13, 1966 in the picture top right. Said one observer, \"Fog and clouds hovered around the top of the tall test stand most of the day while the stage was being lifted from its transporter into place inside the stand, said to be the tallest building in Alabama.\"\n\nThe second stage of SA-500D had a complex history. The second stage, S-II-D had been on order, but that part was cancelled February 19, 1965. The plan was to use another test article for dynamic testing as well as its other purpose. Two such test articles were destroyed during testing after having been designated for the dynamic test phase. The actual article used in SA-500D was named in the third re-allocation, when S-II-F, the facilities checkout article, was designated S-II-F/D.\n\nS-II-S, which North American Aviation's Space and Information Systems Division (S&ID) at Seal Beach had completed by January 31, was re-designated as S-II-S/D to be used for dynamic testing. S-II-S/D would not survive its final structural test on September 29, 1965, but the test was exercising considerable margin above the structural integrity required for flight.\n\nIn January 1966, the all-systems test S-II-T was re-designated S-II-T/D, so that it might be used for dynamic testing as well as engine firing. S-II-T/D completed integrated checkout of ground support facilities at MTF on February 3, 1966. S-II-T/D's engines were fired five times at MTF from April to May, including a full-duration test. On May 28, 1966, S-II-T/D was undergoing a pressure test to find a hydrogen leak, but the hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected unbeknownst to the second-shift crew when they tried to pressurize the tank. Five technicians sustained minor injuries. MSFC convened an investigation that night, and the team completed the report in two days.\n\nAfter the S-II-T/D destruction, a third article was assigned to dynamic test duties. Facilities checkout article S-II-F became the dynamic test article designated S-II-F/D. S-II-F was shipped from S&ID, Seal Beach, California on February 20, 1966, to Kennedy Space Center where it arrived March 4. It filled in the final part of SA-500F to check out facilities for processing the Saturn V, replacing a dumbbell-shaped temporary stage of the same length and weight as an S-II stage. SA-500F was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building where it was mated to S-IC-F on March 28 and S-IVB-F the next day.\n\nSA-500F was completed in the VAB, tested for stability against swaying in the wind, and rolled out to the launch pad May 25, 1966, on Mobile Launcher 1.\nHurricane Alma interrupted exercises as SA-500F was rolled back to the VAB on June 8, though the ground crew supposed the rollback was more of an exercise than necessity because winds remained below critical for the entire storm. It was returned to pad 39-A two days later and finally returned to the VAB October 14, 1966 for disassembly.\n\nAfter facilities checkout at KSC was completed, the remaining components of SA-500F were then transferred to MSFC for inclusion in SA-500D: the Apollo boilerplate BP-27 and S-II-F/D. The second stage was modified for dynamic testing, and shipped by \"Posideon\" from KSC on October 29 to arrive at MSFC November 10, 1966.\n\nEngineers needed a detailed knowledge of the space vehicle's dynamic flight characteristics to design structural, guidance, and flight control systems. They initially used analytical data that had not been substantiated by test for design criteria. The Dynamic Test Vehicle test project determined the dynamic characteristics of the space vehicle and verified earlier analyses.\n\nThe objectives of the dynamic tests were to:\n\nDynamic tests came in three configurations, one for each phase of Saturn V-powered flight. Configuration I focused on testing the entire stack, as if the vehicle had just launched. Configuration II exercised the stack as if the first stage had jettisoned and the second stage were firing, and configuration III tested just the third stage and Apollo spacecraft. Tests began with Configuration III in the Saturn IB Dynamic Test Facility, while the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand, first, and second stages were still under construction. Configuration I testing followed in the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand, then Configuration II in the same place.\n\nConfiguration III testing took place in late 1965.\nConfiguration I dynamic tests required the first stage of the Saturn V, which was loaded into the test stand January 13, 1966. Testing would have to wait for the last piece, the second stage, to arrive.\n\nWith all the components at MSFC as of November 10, 1966, the second stage was stacked atop the first inside the Dynamic Test Stand on November 23. The third stage was added to the stack November 30, and the Instrument Unit and boilerplate Apollo were installed in December. The rocket was stacked and ready for \"Configuration One\" testing.\n\nConfiguration One Testing ran from January through March. Testing produced \"several minor irregularities indicating the need for possible engineering changes\" which were addressed during March, 1967.\n\nConfiguration Two testing followed, in which the first stage was removed from the stack to simulate conditions after the first stage had jettisoned.\n\nDynamic testing examined \"the vehicle's response to lateral, longitudinal, and torsional excitation, simulating those that would be experienced in flight. The vehicle was \"mounted on a hydrodynamic support system made up of four hydraulic/pneumatic pedestals to permit a simulated unrestrained reaction.\" Engineers tested vibrations in one plane at a time with different amounts of ballast simulating \"fuel load at critical time points in the flight trajectory.\" \n\nNASA historian Mike Wright summarizes the testing:\n\nOn August 3, 1967, MSFC announced the successful completion of the dynamic test program, thereby declaring dynamics and structures of the Saturn V ready for its first launch later in the year. The dynamic testing resulted in \"several slight modifications\" to the final flight vehicle.\n\nThe first Saturn V launch came three months later, with Apollo 4. The dynamic test article LTA-2 was refurbished and flown on the next Saturn V launch, Apollo 6.\n\nAfter dynamic testing, the second stage returned to KSC for a time for launchpad B checkout.\n\nAfter all tests were complete, the SA-500D was reassembled in Huntsville, this time for public exhibition at the Alabama Space Science Center, on land carved out of the north edge of Marshall Space Flight Center. Transport of the rocket, along with the Saturn I which would be erected vertically, to the museum, took place June 28, 1969. The rocket would be displayed lying down on the southern edge of a rocket park with its predecessor rockets, near a Saturn 1 standing erect and a moonscape complete with model Lunar Module and a flag. SA-500D was installed in 1969, and the (renamed) Alabama Space and Rocket Center opened in 1970 showcasing articles that could otherwise only be seen by NASA and Army workers at Redstone Arsenal. The first stage sat on a low-boy trailer and the others in cradles. The instrument unit was put on display inside the museum, and connector rings were given roofs and converted to educational rides for the museum.\n\nSA-500D was added to the List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1980 and declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1987.\n\nIn 1989, the museum assumed its current name, U.S. Space & Rocket Center.\n\nAfter decades of the vehicle resting unprotected outdoors, the U.S. Space & Rocket Center commissioned the restoration of the vehicle in 2005. Analysis by Conservation Solutions, Incorporated determined significant damage from both weather and pest infestations. Various materials comprising the vehicle, including metal alloys and non-metal materials such as polyurethane foam and fiberglass, exhibited significant deterioration. After conducting the analysis, full restoration of the Saturn V vehicle began in June 2005.\nRestoration culminated in July 2007 when the Saturn V was moved into a building designed as protection for the artifact and to provide additional museum facilities. The move took place from July 10 to approximately July 17, starting with the first stage. The Davidson Center for Space Exploration opened in January 2008.\n\nOn May 3, 2012, an unknown person fired three .308 caliber bullets from Interstate 565 at the Davidson Center, breaking three windows. Two bullets struck SA-500D's third stage marring paint and leaving dents. No people were harmed. The damage was repaired within two months.\n\nThis display consists of S-IC-D, S-II-F/D, and S-IVB-D, S-IU-200D/500D, CSM-010, an SLA, and BP-23A.\n\nBP-23 launched for A-002 to test the Launch Escape System and recovery parachutes on December 8, 1964. It was refurbished, designated BP-23A, and exercised the Launch Escape System again in Launch Pad Abort Test 2, June 29, 1965.\n\nBP-27, the dynamic test boilerplate article, is on display at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center atop the vertical Saturn I.\n\nOther Apollo and Saturn artifacts on display include the Apollo 16 Command Module, the Apollo 12 Mobile Quarantine Facility, a Lunar Lander with a test article landing stage (MSFC 76545) and a replica ascent stage, and another Instrument Unit.\n\n"}

{"id": "956480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=956480", "title": "She-Hulk", "text": "She-Hulk\n\nShe-Hulk (Jennifer Walters) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema, she first appeared in \"Savage She-Hulk\" #1 (cover-dated February 1980). Following an injury, Walters received an emergency blood transfusion from her cousin, Bruce Banner, and acquired a milder version of his Hulk condition. As such, Walters becomes a large, powerful green-hued version of herself while still largely retaining her personality. In particular, she retains her intelligence and emotional control, although like Hulk, she still becomes stronger if enraged. In later issues of the comics, her transformation is permanent.\n\nShe-Hulk has been a member of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, Heroes for Hire, the Defenders, Fantastic Force, and S.H.I.E.L.D. As a highly skilled lawyer, she has served as legal counsel to various superheroes on numerous occasions.\n\nShe-Hulk was created by Stan Lee, who wrote only the first issue, and was the last character he created for Marvel Comics until his return to comics with \"Ravage 2099\" in 1992. The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of \"The Incredible Hulk\" (1977–82) and \"The Bionic Woman\" TV series. Marvel was afraid that the show's executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, as had been done with \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", so Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the TV series, Marvel would own the rights.\n\nAll but the first issue of \"The Savage She-Hulk\" were written by David Anthony Kraft and penciled by Mike Vosburg, and most issues were inked by Frank Springer. Vosburg later remarked, \"The oddest thing about that book was that Frank drew really beautiful women, I drew really beautiful women, and yet, the She-Hulk was never overly attractive.\" The \"Savage She-Hulk\" series lasted until 1982 where it ended with #25 (March 1982). She-Hulk then made guest appearances in other characters' books. Her earliest guest-starring adventures followed no specific story line, besides her recurring bad luck with automobiles. She-Hulk also appeared in the limited series, \"Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions\" (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes are kidnapped from Earth to fight in space.\n\nShe-Hulk becomes a member of the Avengers in \"Avengers\" #221 (July 1982). Her early Avengers appearances continued the running gag about her car troubles. She-Hulk also made occasional guest appearances in \"The Incredible Hulk\". Her appearance in \"Avengers\" #233 (July 1983) was drawn by John Byrne, who would later become strongly associated with the character. \n\nAt the conclusion of the first \"Secret Wars\" miniseries, She-Hulk joins the Fantastic Four (\"Fantastic Four\" #265, April 1984). During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in \"Marvel Graphic Novel\" #16: \"The Aladdin Effect\", \"Marvel Graphic Novel\" #17: \"Revenge of the Living Monolith\", and \"Marvel Graphic Novel\" #18: \"The Sensational She-Hulk\". All three graphic novels appeared in 1985. The last, #18, appearing in November 1985, was written and illustrated by then-Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne.\n\nShe-Hulk regained a solo series in 1989, \"The Sensational She-Hulk\" (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel's title). \"The Sensational She-Hulk\" ran for sixty issues. Issues #1 to #8, #31 to #46, and #48 to 50 were written and drawn by Byrne. Byrne's She-Hulk stories satirized comic books and introduced She-Hulk's awareness that she is a comic book character. Two issues tested the limits of the comics code: #34 makes reference to the 1991 \"Vanity Fair\" cover in which actress Demi Moore appeared nude (and pregnant); in issue #40 She-Hulk is entirely naked with her breasts and genital area covered by blur lines as she is depicted jumping rope in the nude. Other writers to contribute to this series include Steve Gerber (#10, 11, 13–23), Simon Furman, and Peter David.\n\nDuring \"Sensational She-Hulk\", the character continued making numerous guest appearances. In 1990, She-Hulk appeared in the two-issue limited series \"She-Hulk: Ceremony\".\n\n\"The Sensational She-Hulk\" ran until issue #60 (February 1994), making it the longest-running solo title of any Marvel superheroine up to that point. After the cancellation of She-Hulk's second solo series, she continued making backup, one-shot, and team appearances in \"Fantastic Force\" (starting with issue #13 in November 1995), the 1996 miniseries \"Doc Samson\" #1–4 (January–April 1996), \"Heroes for Hire\" #8 to #19 (February 1998 through the series finale in January 1999), and \"The Avengers\". Her next major appearance was in the May 2002 one-shot titled \"Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night\".\nIn May 2004, \"She-Hulk\" was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that the titles received from their initial cluster-style launch. Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a re-launch of the title (as a \"second season\") eight months later. The eight-month gap is alluded to in the body of the story itself.\n\nWith the original creative team (Dan Slott and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series, the book returned eight months later as promised in October 2005. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and had story art by numerous artists, including Vosburg. There was no new artwork by Buscema or Byrne, who were represented by reprints of \"Sensational She-Hulk\" #1 and \"Savage She-Hulk\" #1.\n\nDan Slott's last issue is #21; with 33 issues, Slott has written the most solo issues of She-Hulk. Peter David became the new writer with \"She-Hulk\" #22. Marvel Comics announced that \"She-Hulk\" #38 (February 2009) would be the final issue of the series. Peter David commented on his blog that sales of the book were hurt due to discrepancies between his book and Jeph Loeb's \"Hulk\" series, caused by editorial error:\n\nThe mantle of She-Hulk is challenged by Lyra, the daughter of Hulk and Thundra, who is the lead character in \"All-New Savage She-Hulk\", a miniseries written by Fred Van Lente.\n\nShe-Hulk appeared in \"FF\" by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred, which debuted in November 2012.\n\nAn ongoing \"She-Hulk\" series, written by Charles Soule and drawn by Javier Pulido, debuted in 2014. It was revealed in October 2014 that the current run of \"She-Hulk\", which had the character facing off against Matt Murdock in court, would end with issue 12.\n\nSince May 2015, She-Hulk has appeared as one of the main characters in \"A-Force\", an all-female Avengers spin-off being launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel's \"Secret Wars\" crossover.\n\nShe-Hulk starred in the comic titled \"Hulk\" beginning December 2016. The series showed how she dealt with the trauma stemming from her cousin's death, and the injuries sustained at the hands of Thanos, as fallout from the \"Civil War II\" event. She appeared colored grey, similar to Hulk's \"Joe Fixit\" persona, and there were great difference in tone from her previous lighthearted adventures. The title was cancelled with issue #163 in March 2018.\n\nJennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner (Hulk), is the small and somewhat shy daughter of Los Angeles County Sheriff William Morris Walters and Elaine (née Banner) Walters (who died in a car crash when Jennifer was seventeen). Operatives of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day that Bruce Banner happened to be in town for a visit. Since no other donors with her blood type were available, Banner provided his own blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and DNA, his radioactive blood, combined with her anger transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital.\n\nAs She-Hulk, Jennifer possessed powers similar to those of her cousin, though at a reduced level. She also possessed a less monstrous, more amazonian appearance. Initially, the transformation to her She-Hulk form was triggered (as with Bruce Banner's) by anger. Like her cousin Bruce, his counterpart, the Leader, Doc Samson, and most other persons mutated by exposure to gamma radiation over the years, her mutated form was originally explained as being molded by her subconscious desire to look like the ideal woman. She eventually gains control of her transformations when Michael Morbius cures her of a lethal blood disease. As a criminal defense lawyer, she defended Dr. Michael Morbius in his trial for his vampiric killings.\n\nEventually, Jennifer decides that she is going to retain her She-Hulk form permanently—preferring the freedom, confidence, and assertiveness that it gave her compared to her more timorous and fragile \"normal\" form. After her brief solo career, she joined the Avengers. This led to her being transported to Battleworld by the Beyonder and her participation in the Secret Wars, most notable for sparking her long-standing rivalry with the newly empowered Titania. After the heroes returned to Earth, she temporarily replaced the Thing as a member of the Fantastic Four.\n\nDuring her tenure with the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. This radiation exposure had a drastic effect on Jennifer: she could no longer transform back into her original human form. However, this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred being She-Hulk, and it was revealed much later that the block was purely psychological.\n\nShortly after that, she appeared before the Supreme Court, where she battled Titania again.\n\nAfter her Fantastic Four years, She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers for a while. She became hypnotized by the Ringmaster into becoming a performer in his circus, and battled the Headmen. With Spider-Man, she defeated the Headmen and became an assistant District Attorney and began working for New York City district attorney Blake Tower. Here she met Louise \"Weezie\" Grant Mason, formerly the Golden Age superheroine the Blonde Phantom. She had a long series of unusual encounters including when she battled Doctor Bong, first contended against Xemnu the Titan, encountered \"Nick St. Christopher\", and encountered \"Spragg the Living Hill/Comet\". \"Sensational She-Hulk #15\" introduced a grey version of She-Hulk that appeared at night only and shared a lot in common with the Hulk, such as having a childlike mind, speaking in third person and divorcing from her Jennifer Walters identity, referering to Jennifer as \"puny Jennifer\", She-Hulk returned to normal in the following issue, with her green coloration returning in \"Sensational She-Hulk #17\". She-Hulk later discovered that Louise Mason had manipulated Tower into hiring her, so that Mason might again star in a comic book (and thus avoid dying of old age). Later, while doing legal work for Heroes for Hire, She-Hulk spent some time dating Luke Cage.\n\nAfter a time, She-Hulk returns to the Avengers. Repeated exposure to the presence of her teammate Jack of Hearts, who has the innate ability to absorb radiation that is around him, leads to She-Hulk being unable to control her changes, which resulted in her tearing the Vision in half. It is then revealed that all of the events were caused by the Scarlet Witch. Now, when she is afraid, she not only turns into She-Hulk but her mind became maddened by paranoia and rage. Jennifer flees, fearing that she will endanger her friends and others, leading to the \"Search for She-Hulk\" storyline.\n\nThe other Avengers track her to the town of Bone, Idaho, where Jennifer is lying low but the anxiety of being found prompts her to change, causing her to damage much of the town. Her cousin shows up but fails to reason with her; he \"hulks out\" and the two fight—the devastation to the town subsequently being blamed on the Hulk.\n\nPsychological limitations inhibit her transformation between her two forms. For a time, as detailed in \"She-Hulk\" #4, March 2006, Jennifer works as a relief volunteer helping to repair Bone. She gains confidence after solving a murder mystery, reveals her green alter-ego to the entire town, and then uses her strength to make many more repairs. This, combined with Leonard Samson's new 'gamma-charger', gives her full control over her transformations for, as she said, 'the time being'.\n\nIn the DC/Marvel crossover \"JLA/Avengers\", She-Hulk first appears being brainwashed by Starro when the Avengers battle her, grabbing a startled Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) by her leg, before the latter blasts her away with her powers. She later assists the Avengers in the subsequent hunt for the twelve artifacts needed to trap the DC villain Krona, first battling Aquaman in Asgard, and later in the Savage Land with the rest of the heroes. During the final battle against Krona and his forces, she assists Wonder Woman in her battle against Surtur, and eventually appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.\n\nThe events of \"The Search for She-Hulk\", combined with her own lack of personal responsibility and the potential legal ramifications of her saving the world swaying juries leads Jennifer back to the legal profession in a more full-time capacity, when she was asked to practice law in the Superhuman Law division of the New York firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (GLK&H). This offer is dependent upon Jennifer remaining human while she worked for the firm.\n\nWhile practicing at GLK&H, Jennifer gradually becomes comfortable as both She-Hulk and Jennifer Walters, realizing that she has much to offer the world in both forms. During one of these adventures she realizes her strength as She-Hulk is dependent on her strength as Walters and works out in her human form. Thus, she exponentially increases her powers as She-Hulk.\n\nShe-Hulk registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, and is a supporter of Tony Stark (Iron Man). However, as an attorney, she advised individuals on both sides of the Civil War. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, \"Daily Bugle\" publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Her intention is to keep the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely. She is also the lawyer for Speedball in \"\".\n\nIn \"She-Hulk\" #14 (2006), Clay Quartermain of S.H.I.E.L.D. informs Jennifer that she has been drafted into the organization as a result of her registration. Her mission is to fight various foes of the Hulk while training heroes under the Initiative. She serves with the Hulkbusters: Clay Quartermain, Agent Crimson, Agent Cheesecake and Agent Beefcake.\n\nDue to her involvement in S.H.I.E.L.D., She-Hulk derives a bit of information suggesting that the organization knows of her cousin's whereabouts. Anticipating a problem, Tony Stark has She-Hulk secretly injected with S.P.I.N. Tech that transforms her to human form. Enraged, she tells Stark that, although he may have taken She-Hulk out of the equation, he still has to face Jennifer Walters, one of the best lawyers in the country. Jennifer informs Stark that he's miscalculated: She-Hulk would have just pummeled him, but Jennifer Walters has the ability to destroy him.\n\nOn her way home, Jennifer runs into Amadeus Cho, a young genius out looking for friends of the Hulk. Cho, whom the Hulk once saved, discovered what the Illuminati had done to the Hulk, and he wants help in finding him. Cho temporarily restores Jennifer's powers so that she can take out Doc Samson, who came to apprehend Cho for Reed Richards and Tony Stark. Cho says he can permanently restore Jennifer's powers if she'll join him, but she politely refuses, instead directing him to Hercules and Angel.\n\nIn \"World War Hulk\" #1, a re-powered She-Hulk assists in the evacuation of Manhattan; in #2, she tries to reason with her cousin, who has just destroyed Stark Tower during his battle with Iron Man. The Hulk warns her to leave, but she stands her ground. After she lands a punch squarely to his face, the Hulk smashes her into the ground, creating a crater around her body. As he moves on to his next confrontation, all Jennifer can say is: \"God help us all.\"\n\nJennifer is held captive with the other defeated heroes at Madison Square Garden, which the Hulk has converted into a gladiatorial arena. The heroes have been implanted with the same obedience discs that compelled the Hulk and his allies to fight one another during their time on the planet Sakaar.\n\nIn \"She-Hulk\" #19, Jennifer returns to the law firm to work on suing Tony Stark for stealing her powers. She is subpoenaed to give a testimony in a case in which Mallory Book is trying to prove that the Leader's criminal acts are the result of a shift of personality induced by his mutation, and an addiction to his gamma irradiated powers, and that he thus can't be held accountable for his actions. During her testimony, Jennifer realizes that she herself is \"addicted\" to being She-Hulk; Mallory forces her to admit that she's had a long list of sexual partners as She-Hulk. After the testimony, Pug appears and the two spend an evening together as friends, which cheers her up. She confronts Mallory the next day and tells her that she'll put a stop to her Leader case. However, in \"She-Hulk\" #20, it is revealed that the Leader has been acquitted of his crimes.\n\nThere is an apparent inconsistency between the \"She-Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\" comics: in \"She-Hulk\" #19, the Leader is on trial in New York City, which is being cleaned up after the Hulk's recent attack. The action in the issue takes place during or after the events of World War Hulk. However, Jennifer appears as She-Hulk in the first and second issues of \"World War Hulk,\" during which the Hulk is destroying New York City. The discrepancy is resolved in \"She-Hulk\" #20: Jennifer explains that Tony Stark temporarily disabled the nanobots to allow her to assist in the battle against her cousin, only to reactivate them when the battle was over. She amends her suit against Stark to demand the permanent deactivation of the nanobots.\n\nAt some point after \"World War Hulk\", Jennifer was brought before the Living Tribunal and asked to weigh her universe against a newer, better \"cosmic trophy wife\" version, described by Walters as \"an ultimate universe.\" Her universe wins, and she resigns from the Magistrati.\n\nAfter the Leader's trial, Artie Zix reveals himself as RT-Z9 and holds the main staff of GLK&H hostage while asking them questions at the behest of a group of aliens from a corner of the galaxy recently discovered by the Watcher Qyre. The aliens, called The Recluses, wish to keep their existence a secret. She-Hulk earlier decreed that Qyre not reveal knowledge of the Recluses' existence at the meetings of the Watchers. This had serious repercussions: it is revealed at the close of \"She-Hulk\" #20 that an evil being has conquered that portion of the galaxy, and is preparing an assault on all of creation. Qyre, who holds knowledge of the plan, is unable to speak of it to anyone else. At She-Hulk's time trial, it was revealed that her actions made a destructive event called the Reckoning War possible. However, comments made by the future Southpaw, divulge that the war, though a terrible and dark time, will be favorably resolved.\n\nA permanently depowered Jennifer Walters finds that tourists from an alternate universe – designated the Alpha universe – are crossing into her universe – which they call Beta – to gain access to superpowers and comes face to face with her own powered up doppelganger. Jennifer confirms that her Alpha counterpart slept with Juggernaut but her anger quickly turns to sorrow as she realizes that without her abilities, the Alpha Jennifer Walters – while unfamiliar with superhuman law – is far better suited to life in the Beta universe. Realizing this, she decides that she will go to the Alpha universe and let the other Jennifer Walters take over for her.\n\nAs she steps through the portal, Reed Richards realizes he can use the previously stored configuration of the Alpha She-Hulk to restore Jennifer's powers. Having regained her abilities, Jennifer remains in her home reality, while the Alpha Jen Walters returns to her own universe and reconciles with her boyfriend, the Alpha Augustus \"Pug\" Pugliese.\n\nAt an unspecified time after World War Hulk, She-Hulk assists Tony Stark with Emil Blonsky's murder investigation. While in Stark's Helicarrier she is attacked and beaten by the Red Hulk, but vows to get even for the deliberate humiliation. She later helps to prevent casualties in San Francisco after the Red Hulk caused an earthquake in the area, and assembles Thundra and Valkyrie together to capture him.\n\nSome months after regaining her abilities, Jennifer was tasked to defend an accused killer named Arthur Moore. While she was successful in defending him, immediately after his freedom was secured he claimed to be guilty and showed her images of the crimes he had been accused of. Jennifer's horror at what she was being shown, combined with Moore's gloating, was enough to push her rage so far that she became The Savage She-Hulk once again. She attacked him and threatened to kill him if he wasn't given the death penalty. She also told everybody within earshot that he was guilty and backed up her accusation by revealing privileged information. This resulted in her being disbarred. Jennifer later found out that Moore really was innocent; the images he had shown her had been false. It was also revealed, albeit not to Jennifer, that Moore had hoped to get her to react exactly the way she did since his employers wanted She-Hulk disbarred for purposes as yet unknown. Unable to practice law any more, Jennifer began working for Freeman Bonds Inc. – a subsidiary of GLK&B – as a bounty hunter with her Skrull partner Jazinda.\n\nShe was later recruited by Stark as a member of an Initiative-sponsored incarnation of the Defenders for a short while until Tony Stark disbanded the team. Afterwards, she continued to aid team leader Nighthawk for a brief time. That was until she was fully able to join the team on Nighthawk's request and that it would be away from the Initiative.\n\nTogether they have several adventures, even encountering Hercules, but they soon ended up involved in the midst of Secret Invasion.\n\nDuring the Skrull takeover of Earth during Secret Invasion, She-Hulk and Jazinda hunt down a member of the Skrulls who functions as their religious leader. X-Factor initially impedes her progress, but they part ways on uncertain terms. She-Hulk and Jazinda capture the Skrull and the two heroines take the Skrull to New York, where they encounter the Super-Skrull, Kl'rt. Kl'rt came to kill his daughter, Jazinda, going so far as to shoot her in the head. Due to her regenerative properties, Jazinda was still not fully dead. The Skrull religious leader wants to completely remove her regenerative ability but Kl'rt stops him after She-Hulk pleads to his fatherly nature, tapping into his guilt for not being able to save his son who had died in a previous war.\n\nSome time after the Skrull invasion is defeated the country of Marinmer suffers a devastating earthquake. Because the victims of the earthquake are members of a minority religious group the Marinmer government has confiscated all humanitarian aid packages, and because of Marinmer's strong ties to powerful countries such as China and Russia other nations refuse to intervene for fear of sparking a war. She-Hulk and several members of the Lady Liberators secretly enter Marinmer intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims. The Winter Guard attempts to stop them but gives up after seeing the plight of the earthquake victims. Afterwards the US government attempts to arrest She-Hulk for her actions in Marinmer but drops the charges to avoid political embarrassment. With public opinion overwhelmingly in her favor She-Hulk seems poised to get her legal license back when Jazinda is captured by the Behemoth after he mistakenly attacks her, thinking she is the real She-Hulk. Jazinda is then taken to a government lab and brutally experimented on when her ability to resurrect herself from the dead is discovered. Jazinda contacts She-Hulk telepathically through a secretly implanted mind reading device and warns her that the government will be coming to question her about their relationship. Jazinda tells She-Hulk to say she didn't know Jazinda was a Skrull and just before going dead/unconscious tells She-Hulk \"I've always l...\". She-Hulk tries to keep up the denial but when she sees Jazinda about to be vivisected she loses control and breaks Jazinda out. The Behemoth tries to stop her but She-Hulk defeats him with the help of the Lady Liberators. Later it is revealed that Mallory Book, her former boss, was behind all the bad things happening to She-Hulk along with a group called \"Fourth Wall\". Yet when she saw She-Hulk risk herself to save her Skrull friend Book \"canceled\" the plan.\n\nIn the 4-Part issue \"All-New Savage She-Hulk\", Jennifer fights Lyra, the alternate reality daughter of Hulk and Thundra after she comes to the Earth-616 reality for the DNA of the strongest man. While Jennifer and Lyra were fighting, Sentry tosses her away believing the man Lyra is referring to is him. She-Hulk later returns, enraged, and pummels the Sentry into the ground. She then helps Lyra escape from the Avengers Tower.\n\nIn \"Incredible Hulk\" #600, Jennifer tasks Ben Urich to discover the identity of Rulk. She informs him that she is unable to as she has asked too many questions to the wrong people. She has Urich bring a photographer (Peter Parker), and meets him along with her insider, Doc Samson, and they venture into a S.H.I.E.L.D. Base that is actually a front for A.I.M. and General Ross's Gamma Power Super Soldier Program. Leonard Samson then appears to have a breakdown but in reality he is changing into Samson. Samson claims to be stronger and faster (and is larger in size, has longer hair and a lightning-bolt scar) than Jennifer. The clashing duo are subdued by MODOK and the facility explodes in the aftermath of a fight between Rulk and Hulk; Jennifer, Samson (who has reverted to Leonard) and Rulk are caught in the explosion.\n\nJennifer's status is unknown and Rulk does not reveal anything to Urich when the two meet a second time.\n\nWhile She-Hulk is M.I.A., the Red She-Hulk makes her first appearance where she claims Jennifer Walters to be dead.\nIt was later shown in a flashback that Red She-Hulk prevented Jennifer Walters from escaping from AIM custody. During this battle, Red She-Hulk brutally beat Jennifer and snapped her neck with a cable. In the last panel Jennifer Walters appeared to be dead with the Red She-Hulk standing over her body. Though the Red She-Hulk claims she didn't know her own strength then questions Doc Samson whether it was the real She-Hulk or a Life-Model Decoy to which Samson answers \"You're here to follow orders, not to ask questions\". Lyra later infiltrates the Intelligencia, where she finds Jennifer in stasis. Following a brief fight with the Red She-Hulk, the three decide to team up to take down Intelligencia's forces.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Intelligencia, Jennifer begins travelling with her cousin Bruce, Skaar, Korg, Rick Jones, and Betty Ross. Shortly after the events of World War Hulks, Skaar becomes aware that his brother Hiro-Kala is approaching and that he intends to crash the planet K'ai into the Earth. She-Hulk is on the team as they manage to successfully avert disaster. Upon returning to Earth, they find the world in flames as it is in the grasp of the Chaos War. They journey to Hell, where they fight and defeat the Chaos King. Returning to a restored Earth, they are greeted as monsters.\n\nAt some point before or after these events, Jennifer and Lyra settle in New York, where Lyra begins to attend high school in an attempt to gain an understanding of humanity as it occurs in this timeline. As well as helping to integrate Lyra into society, they are also involved in trying to round up the remaining members of the Intelligencia.\n\nThey manage to round up the Intelligencia but the Wizard is able to escape imprisonment and goes after Lyra at her high school prom, almost killing her before She-Hulk intervenes, knocking out Wizard but not before Lyra's secret identity has been compromised. The rest of the pupils turn on Lyra as a result of her prom date being injured and the endangerment of everyone at the dance. She-Hulk explains to her afterwards that they have to leave and that despite being heroes, the life of a Hulk is often lonely.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, She-Hulk joins with Howard the Duck, Nighthawk, and Frankenstein's Monster to form a four-person team called the Fearsome Four to stop the Man-Thing from its destructive path. They later discover a plot by Psycho-Man to use Man-Thing's volatile empathy to create a weapon.\n\nPrior to a time- and multiverse-spanning trip by the Fantastic Four and family, Thing asks She-Hulk to be a member of the Future Foundation.\n\nWhen the Hulk is elevated into \"Doc Green\" – a version of the Hulk possessing Bruce Banner's intellect – after he is treated for a shot to the head as Bruce Banner by use of the Extremis virus, he sets out to attack and cure other gamma-based mutations. Steve Rogers attempts to order the Hulk to stop before he goes after She-Hulk, but when Doc Green finally confronts her, he instead admits that he has come to recognize that he is coming dangerously close to the Maestro, as part of him enjoyed eliminating his 'rivals,' having decided instead to accept the eventual loss of his intellect as Extremis wore off rather than risk that persona emerging. Informing She-Hulk that she is the only gamma mutation whose life he felt had been legitimately enhanced by her condition, Doc Green provides her with the last injection of his cure, asking her to use it on him if he goes too far in his efforts to stop an A.I. version of himself that he created and unleashed.\n\nDuring the 2016 \"Civil War II\" storyline, after the Inhuman Ulysses predicts Thanos' arrival on Earth, She-Hulk was mortally wounded by a direct attack from the villain in question. When Iron Man learns that they used Ulysses' precognitive power to ambush Thanos, he vows to make sure that no one uses it again. Before She-Hulk goes into cardiac arrest she tells Captain Marvel to fight for the future. After Hawkeye was acquitted for shooting Bruce Banner, Captain Marvel visited She-Hulk who came out of her coma. When She-Hulk angrily demanded to know the verdict of Hawkeye's trial, Captain Marvel remained silent.\n\nFollowing Bruce Banner's funeral, Jennifer Walters left the superhero business and continued to work as a lawyer where she gained her first client Maise Brewn who was an Inhuman descendant. Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals where this form is larger and stronger. Jennifer helped Maise when she was recovering from the trauma and being evicted by her landlord Mr. Tick. When Maise got impatient with Jennifer and summoned a Fear Golem that killed Mr. Tick and some police officers, Jennifer is nearly killed by it and transforms into the Grey She-Hulk. She defeated the Fear Golem and prevented Maise from committing suicide where Maise was arrested for reckless endangerment afterwards.\n\nAfterwards, Jennifer transformed into the Grey She-Hulk inside a construction, where she found Hellcat. After changing back, Jennifer told to Hellcat that she is worried over the fact that her grey color could mean that she is like Bruce (since Bruce also had a grey incarnation). Later, Jennifer was watching a live baking video on internet when a baker named Oliver turned into a Hulk-like creature on-camera.\n\nIn Gwenpool's first Christmas special Howard the Duck invited her to She-Hulk's Christmas party on the provision that she has not killed any good guys recently. She shows up and karaokes with Ms. Marvel. Also there was a one shot image of her holding mistletoe over her head and inviting She-hulk to kiss her while Ms. Marvel looked on in girlish glee. There were dozens of super humans in attendance proving that whether she is acting as a hero or not She-hulk keeps strong ties to the super community.\n\nThe character's personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance: originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, kind, empathetic, yet still feisty woman who frequently uses humor when fighting. She has stated that she does not want to kill her foes, especially ones which she has already subdued.\n\nShe has also started and led her own disaster relief organization, and felt great remorse for almost destroying a small town (due to her transformed state briefly turning uncontrollable from radiation), whereupon she helped construction workers to rebuild it.\n\nAs a highly idealistic lawyer, the character has a history of defending the rights of minorities, the mentally ill, civil liberties, including the right for criminals to not be unduly mistreated and get a proper defense, or individuals to not be victimised by certain less ethical corporations, but also a belief in the necessity of law and order. These priorities have sometimes made her personally conflicted, such as reversing her stance regarding the Superhuman Registration Act; and being disillusioned when her more famous cousin (whom she considers as a brother) was shot into space without due process, or when what she thought to be a torturer and murderer of children was cleared from all charges.\n\nIn an interview, former \"She-Hulk\" writer Peter David describes her as follows: \n\nA transfusion of gamma-irradiated blood from her cousin Bruce Banner (the Hulk) granted Jennifer Walters superhuman powers. In her She-Hulk form, she possesses enormous superhuman strength, that potentially makes her, by far, the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high.\n\nAlthough She-Hulk's strength originally remained at a set level and did not increase, later in her history her strength has sporadically been stated to increase further from fear, or anger, similar to her cousin. In addition the character possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and reflexes.\n\nAs She-Hulk, Walters is exponentially stronger than she is in her Jennifer Walters form; therefore any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form even stronger. After being defeated by the Champion of the Universe, She-Hulk exercised for several months in her Jennifer Walters form, resulting in a significant gain in strength and muscular mass in her She-Hulk form and allowing her to soundly defeat the Champion in a rematch. At this time she was able to effortlessly sustain the Thing's maximum weight with a single arm, while her strength was greatly restrained by a \"Jupiter suit,\" and she was shown as considerably stronger than Hercules. Her calm strength level has since receded, but remains somewhat higher than, for example, Wonder Man. Similarly to her cousin, her powers can also greatly increase by absorbing radiation.\n\nShe-Hulk's body is superhumanly durable and nearly impervious to force, pain, and disease: her skin can withstand extremes of temperature, as well as tremendous stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations. Her enhanced physiology renders her immune to all terrestrial diseases. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor, which enabled her to completely recover, within minutes, from a skewering by the Wendigo.\n\nUnlike Hulk, Jennifer's personality and intelligence are less affected when she transforms into She-Hulk, although she becomes more self-confident and assertive. In court it was proven that her Gamma Mutant form also has fewer inhibitions as proven during a trial for The Leader; for example, while Jennifer Walters has only had a few sexual partners, reading back a list of She-Hulk's conquests took considerable time. For a long time, She-Hulk could not revert to her original human form, but that turned out to be psychosomatic due to her not actually wanting to.\n\nDue to training from the alien Ovoids, She-Hulk is able to swap powers and physiques with other human women, but retains her green skin pigmentation, and only used it once.\n\nDue to the Hulk's wish, Jennifer can now switch between her human and Hulk forms at will.\n\nFor a time, thanks to a hex cast by the Scarlet Witch, anyone who wished She-Hulk harm could not recognize her as Jennifer, but harmful side effects forced Jennifer to seek the assistance of Doctor Strange to remove the hex.\n\nShe-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America and Gamora. Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the martial arts to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is. She once displayed sufficient knowledge of acupressure to render the Abomination insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him.\n\nThe character is also a skilled and experienced attorney who attended UCLA School of Law, where she was a member of the Order of the Coif, a national merit society for top legal scholars. She-Hulk had performed legal work as a member of the Magistrati, who had the power to compel her to adjudicate cases anywhere in creation. She ceased to operate in this function after successfully adjudicating the merits of her own Universe to continue existing (opposed by the Ultimate Marvel Universe) before the Living Tribunal.\n\nShe is a skilled pilot and has previously used a modified 1995 Dodge automobile equipped with technology enabling flight in Earth's atmosphere and in outer space for limited distances, although it is incapable of interstellar flight.\n\nFor a time, starting with the \"Sensational She-Hulk\" series by John Byrne in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of \"cross-dimensional\" or metafictional awareness, to break the fourth wall. In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her \"tearing the page\" or \"walking through a page of advertisements\" to reach an enemy's control centre. She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer (John Byrne), or appealed to the comic's editor, Renée Witterstaetter. \"Sensational She-Hulk\" #50 (Byrne's last issue) involved Renée locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book's new writer. This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the Heroes for Hire, when she \"spoke\" to the book's narrator and \"fired\" him for losing the plot. Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly \"address\" the audience include She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason, Uatu the Watcher (who narrates a majority of the issues of \"What If\" by speaking directly to the reader) and Deadpool. On occasion, this practice has also been used for Loki, Rick Jones, Wyatt Wingfoot, and Howard the Duck. The latest series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk's, save for a coda in Volume 2, #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm \"researcher\" asks Jen if she can \"really do stuff like that.\" She somewhat wistfully replies \"No. I can't\" – however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking \"out\" of the comic, at the reader. She-Hulk's most recent profile in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe continues to list this \"ability\" of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her.\n\nThe Dan Slott series took a different approach to the metafiction angle, making use of a concept dating back to Lee and Kirby's early \"Fantastic Four\" – that the heroes of the Marvel Universe permit licensed comic-book adaptations of their adventures to be published. Since all comics published before 2001 bear the seal of the Comics Code Authority of America (a federal agency in the Marvel Universe), they are considered legal documents admissible as evidence in the superhuman law cases on which She-Hulk works.\n\nIf She-Hulk defeats Deadpool as the final opponent in \"\", she will say \"You know, if this game were made in 1991, I'd be the one whacking YOU with a health bar.\" This references Deadpool's Fourth Wall-breaking hyper move, where he attacks the opponent with his own life bar, as well as the character's rise in popularity in recent years. In the game's update \"Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3\", if Deadpool is her first opponent, before the match starts she will claim that she can break the fourth wall as well. If she defeats him as her last opponent She-Hulk will threaten to beat him in \"Marvel vs Capcom 4\" if the game is ever made.\n\nShe-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.\n\nSheriff Walters felt that the best way for Jennifer to live was for her to follow his values. However, Jennifer grew up perceiving the gray areas of law enforcement (for example, she interpreted the events leading up to riots which occurred during her childhood differently from her father). Although Jennifer saw her decision to become a criminal defense attorney as a kind of homage to her father, Sheriff Walters instead interpreted her choice (to defend criminals) as a rejection of his values.\n\nJennifer worked at nurturing a supportive relationship with her father, and remained close to a childhood friend, Zapper, with whom she ultimately became romantically involved. Being She-Hulk allowed Jennifer to express emotions which she was not otherwise comfortable revealing. For example, although Jennifer Walters was restrained from dating a younger man, as She-Hulk she felt free to express her affection for Zapper. During that same time, Jennifer pursued a problematic relationship with the affable ne'er-do-well Richard Rory (a supporting character created by Steve Gerber for Man-Thing stories), who actually valued her for who she really was.\n\nUltimately, She-Hulk's relationship with Zapper fell apart, primarily due to her insistence on permanently remaining in her She-Hulk form, eschewing the Jennifer Walters persona that Zapper had grown up with. Zapper believed that Jennifer's preference represented a rejection of the character's true self. Although in actuality She-Hulk liberated much of Jennifer Walters' repressed personality, the She-Hulk persona also repressed certain aspects of Jennifer Walters' personality which She-Hulk found distasteful.\n\nDuring her time as an Avenger, She-Hulk engaged in a relationship with Starfox. However, this encounter was later retold in flashback, and in that storyline, Starfox was on trial, charged with sexually assaulting a married woman. The alleged victim testified that Starfox's euphoria power had forced her to be sexually forward, similarly to She-Hulk's own encounter with Starfox. Jennifer assumed that her interaction with Starfox had not been consensual after hearing this testimony, but she later discovered that he had not used his powers on her.\n\nShe-Hulk was briefly engaged to the younger Wyatt Wingfoot, whom she first met during her tenure with the Fantastic Four. She let her guard down with Wyatt, expressing her vulnerabilities as Wyatt supported her during a series of traumatic events. A paparazzo took photos of her sunbathing topless (but nobody ultimately knew it was She-Hulk due to an unwitting editor 'correcting' her green skin). Later, corrupt agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. forced her to strip naked and be medically examined as a \"potential threat like her cousin\". This was all filmed for personal arousal purposes, before Dum Dum Dugan put a stop to the harassment. Although She-Hulk put forward a brave exterior during those incidents, she was actually quite shaken and appreciated Wyatt's support.\n\nAlthough She-Hulk deeply values close emotional ties with family, friends, and lovers, she seldom admits the depth of her need for these attachments. For example, years after her mother died, Jennifer could not move on from the family home. Even when her father moved out, Jennifer would not leave her family memories behind. The Avengers and Fantastic Four became surrogate families for her; she forged strong bonds with them.\n\nShe-Hulk was married to John Jameson, whom she first met while he was the Man-Wolf in a Microverse adventure in \"Savage She-Hulk\". The two precipitously eloped in Las Vegas. The two shared an apartment with She-Hulk's colleague, Augustus \"Pug\" Pugliese, who holds an unspoken (but obvious) crush on her. Pug correctly deduced that both the suddenness of She-Hulk's strengthened feelings for Jameson as well as the pair's marriage were the result of manipulation by Starfox. Due to his efforts to prove this, She-Hulk and John became aware of Pug's crush just as John was forced to become the Man-Wolf once more.\n\nShe-Hulk's passion for John has cooled since Starfox's \"love zap\" was removed. However, John was never zapped, and his deep love for Jennifer Walters has been confirmed (John has stated a preference for She-Hulk in her human form). She-Hulk's reaction to John as the Man-Wolf/Stargod has not been positive. The marriage has been annulled.\n\nShe-Hulk had a date with Power Man while both were on the Heroes for Hire team. She resisted dating an \"ex-con\" but after a scuffle with Titania and Absorbing Man where Cage aided her she reconsidered. The relationship never developed but a friendship between them was formed.\n\nAfter Jennifer broke up with John Jameson (but before he signed the annulment) she had flings with Clay Quartermain and Tony Stark, and even made a pass at Wolverine. Wolverine rebuffs her, saying he has no wish to \"chase after Juggernaut's sloppy seconds.\" She-Hulk repeatedly vehemently denies sleeping with the Juggernaut (as a wanted criminal who has attempted to murder her cousin), despite the two previously being shown in bed together. It is revealed that Juggernaut had, in fact, bedded a She-Hulk from an alternate universe. An out of continuity tongue-in-cheek mini-chapter later spoofs this, by jokingly showing the two characters as passionately in love.\n\nPerhaps her longest crush is on Hercules, about whom she has repeatedly dreamt. However, after fighting demons together, she rebuffs Hercules' advances, seeing him as a muscle-bound oaf. After Hercules jovially smacks her bottom, She-Hulk sends him through a brick wall, and says she will relegate the idea of a relationship with him to fantasy, as she finds the reality disappointing. Despite this, years afterwards they eventually sleep together.\n\nShe-Hulk has many friends in the superhuman community. Most of whom showed up for her Christmas party in \"The Unbelievable Gwenpool\". Gwen used mistletoe to invite She-hulk to kiss her, much to Ms. Marvel's delight, but it is unknown if She-Hulk did so.\n\nDue to her affiliation with different supergroups over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous costumes. She-Hulk's personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.\n\nBecause of her various outfit changes, no single costume can be considered iconic (compared to Superman's blue and red tights, or Spider-Man's red and blue costume and mask). However, She-Hulk is immediately recognizable due to her size, green skin, and long, dark green, almost-black hair.\n\nIn her first appearance, She-Hulk was a massive, towering figure, with wild, untamed, waist-length hair. She wore a ragged white dress or blouse (the dress ripping and tearing as Walters turned into her giant alter ego). That white garment, which was often only the blouse that Walters had on before her transformation, always covered her upper body and midsection (in the same way that enough of the Incredible Hulk's pants survived to cover him after his transformations). When she was asked about this in an early issue of the second series, Jennifer responded that her clothes carry the label of the Comics Code.\n\nAfter her \"Savage\" era, She-Hulk wore appropriately sized clothes. For instance, she joined the Avengers and began dressing in a one-piece aerobics outfit. During the Avengers era, she wore a purple, one-piece swimsuit with a white belt.\n\nAfter the first of the Secret Wars, She-Hulk took the place of the Thing and became a full-fledged member of the Fantastic Four. Her costume kept the sleeveless/legless leotard design, incorporating the colors and style of the team's costumes, with a \"4\" prominently displayed across her chest and white gloves and boots. After leaving the Fantastic Four, she rejoined the Avengers, donning a white one-piece costume with the blue Avengers insignia emblazoned on it.\n\nShe-Hulk has then worn a purple and white one-piece leotard, complemented by fingerless gloves. Her hair is long and straight, as opposed to the thick, curly tresses she sported in the past. After the events of World War Hulk, she has added baggy low-rise jeans to this look.\n\nShe-Hulk was ranked as the 18th greatest Marvel Comics character by Comic Book Resources, and as the 104th greatest comic book character of all time by \"Wizard\" magazine. IGN also placed her as the 88th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that \"plenty of heroes have gained female sidekicks over the years, but few of these ladies have so capably managed to escape the shadow of their namesakes as She-Hulk,\" and 18th in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers.\" UGO Networks also placed her as one of the top heroes of entertainment stating that \"If nothing else, she has proven to have a longer shelf life than Spider-Woman (who is also in no way a cheap marketing ploy).\" She-Hulk was ranked 11th in \"Comics Buyer's Guide's\" \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list.\n\nShe-Hulk is seen as one of the last few Avengers fighting the entity called Charnel. It had been tormenting her 2020 earth for decades; she had spent two of those years partnered with Rhino. She is killed in action during the defeat of Charnel.\n\nIn the \"Earth X\" series, Jennifer Walters is killed while being possessed by the Hydra; the resultant being becomes a Hydra Queen.\n\nIn Maestro's alternate future, Jennifer is called Shulk and her partner is Emil; the two combine forces to fight Maestro, but are continuously defeated.\n\nA teenaged version of She-Hulk appears as one of the main protagonists of \"Marvel Her-oes\", an all-ages series written by Grace Randolph. In this continuity, she is the best friend of Janet van Dyne, and is unaware that she possesses superpowers.\n\nIn the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe, She-Hulk is seen exiting Avengers Mansion already zombified. She is later seen being restrained by the Thing after eating Franklin and Valeria Richards. The Invisible Woman then proceeds to create a force field inside She-Hulk's head, effectively killing her and also obliterating her zombified body.\n\nWalters works for S.H.I.E.L.D. performing Super-Soldier research and development. It has not been explicitly stated if Dr. Walters is related to Banner but it has been established that he has a cousin named Jennifer.\n\nIn the \"Old Man Logan\" reality, She-Hulk and a gamma-overloaded Hulk had an incestuous relationship and gave birth to a \"hillbilly\" clan of super-strong but dimwitted Hulks called the Hulk Gang.\n\nIt was also revealed that She-Hulk assisted Daredevil and Moon Knight in fighting Enchantress and Electro in Manhattan and died in battle.\n\nIn the \"Spider-Gwen\" continuity, She-Hulk is a famous wrestler who came to Gwen's high school and challenged audience members to a wrestling match similar to Crusher Hogan of the main continuity. Unlike Crusher, she offered to donate the money to charity if she lost. Gwen was prepared to fight She-Hulk in her first week as Spider-Woman, but got distracted when a robber threatened Ben Parker. While Ben and Gwen dealt with the robber, She-Hulk lets the Mary Janes defeat her so she could donate to the charity.\n\n\n\n\nThe stories have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks:\n\n"}

Gordy is best known for his appearances in the United States with promotions such as World Class Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling and the Universal Wrestling Federation as a member of The Fabulous Freebirds, as well as his appearances in Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling as one-half of The Miracle Violence Connection.\n\nChampionships held by Gordy over the course of his career include the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, AJPW World Tag Team Championship, WCW World Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, UWF Heavyweight Championship and SMW Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHe has been posthumously inducted into the Wrestling Observer, Professional Wrestling, and WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nGordy started wrestling in 1975 at the age of 14 as Terry Mecca for the International Wrestling Association. In early 1979, he began wrestling under his real name and formed The Fabulous Freebirds with Michael Hayes. Buddy Roberts was later added to the group.\n\nThe Freebirds came to Memphis the first time in 1979 and feuded mainly with Jerry Lawler & Bill Dundee. When in mid South Wrestling, he formed The Fabulous Freebirds as the suggestion by Bill Watts with Michael Hayes and Buddy Roberts. They returned in 1984 to feud with Lawler & Austin Idol and later with Lawler & Phil Hickerson.\n\nIn 1986, when the Freebirds were in the Universal Wrestling Federation, the former Mid South Wrestling, Gordy won the UWF Heavyweight Championship \ntitle and held it for six months, before losing it via forfeit to The One Man Gang, after an angle the same night in which Gordy was injured by \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams. During this time, Gordy and the Freebirds had an ongoing feud with the UWF fan favorite Hacksaw Jim Duggan, in which Duggan and Gordy frequently squared off, usually ending in a disqualification because of outside interference.\n\nIn 1982, the Freebirds went to World Class Championship Wrestling and had a heated and memorable feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry and Mike) that was famously kicked off when Gordy slammed the Cage door on Kerry during his Cage Match at WCCW Star Wars (1982) against Ric Flair where Michael Hayes was the special guest Referee inciting a riot among fans attending. They traded the six man title back and forth a few times over the years. Gordy was also at one time one half of the WCCW American Tag Team champions.\n\nGordy teamed with Stan Hansen beginning in 1987 in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Gordy later teamed with Steve Williams as The Miracle Violence Connection. During his time there, he also held the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship on two occasions.\n\nThe Freebirds spent a very brief time in the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, but left after management suggested splitting them up.\n\nThe Freebirds spent some time in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions where they split to feud briefly, but later reunited.\n\nIn 1989, Gordy helped Hayes to reform the Freebirds, with Jimmy Garvin, in Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which became World Championship Wrestling in 1991. Later he alongside of Dr. Death Steve Williams defeated the Steiners to become World Tag Team Champions.\n\nGordy and Williams returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992 and won the WCW World Tag Team titles. They also won the NWA World Tag Team titles in a tournament at the Great American Bash card in Albany, Georgia, one week later, and unified the titles. Their feud with Rick and Scott Steiner; in Japan, this was hyped as a feud between the best foreign teams of the two top Japanese promotions (the Steiners were competing for rival New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time). Despite advances by New Japan, Gordy and Williams, out of loyalty to the AJPW founder and promoter, Giant Baba, refused to compete for the promotion (which had business ties with WCW at the time), leading to Gordy's departure from WCW before Halloween Havoc and Williams' departure after Starrcade.\n\nIn 1993 Gordy, while traveling from the United States to Japan for a tour, took an overdose of pain medication and slipped into a coma, ultimately suffering permanent brain damage. He returned to action later that year, but never received a shot at the Triple Crown again. In 1994, Gordy had a small reunion with Hayes and Garvin as the Freebirds in the Global Wrestling Federation where he and Garvin won the GWF Tag Team titles.\n\nIn 1996, Gordy showed up in Extreme Championship Wrestling to challenge Raven for the ECW World Heavyweight title, as the \"internationally recognized #1 contender\". He had been working for the International Wrestling Association of Japan promotion in Japan, wrestling deathmatches. He lost, but went on to team up with Tommy Dreamer and later to reunite with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams to wrestle The Eliminators. He also wrestled Bam Bam Bigelow in what was the second ever \"Battle Of The Bam Bams\"(The first one happened on a Windy City Wrestling show). Gordy lost the match because of outside interference from The Eliminators.\n\nGordy had a brief run in the WWF as The Executioner in 1996 and 1997. He teamed up with Mankind, both managed by Paul Bearer, and feuded with The Undertaker. The Executioner came to the ring under a mask and carrying an axe. He made his TV debut at the In Your House pay-per-view, \"\", where he interfered in The Undertaker's Buried Alive match with Mankind, hitting him with a shovel and burying him with the help of several other wrestlers. However, at \"\", The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match, and Gordy left the promotion shortly afterwards. His final televised appearance was on the January 12, 1997 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", where he lost to Goldust, after which Paul Bearer turned on him by hitting him with his urn.\n\nAccording to Bruce Prichard on Something to Wrestle With (ep 41) The Executioner gimmick was because McMahon was not high on Gordy at the time and there were doubts that he could still compete. The Executioner's use of a mask was intended to protect Gordy so that if he could not prove himself then audiences would not know it was Gordy, and thus his legacy would not be tainted. Had Gordy been able to compete at a high level then there would have been the opportunity later for Gordy to unmask. It was mentioned that the hiring was mostly done as a favor for Michael Hayes. As part of the story, Mankind and Paul Bearer were traveling to Japan in the month of September to locate The Executioner in the Rainforest as their \"hitman\" to take out The Undertaker\n\nGordy left behind 2 young daughters, Amber and Miranda Gordy, and a son, Ray Gordy. Ray Gordy wrestled for WWE as \"Jesse\" and \"Slam Master J\" before being released in 2010. His nephew is Richard Acelinger, who competed for All Japan Pro Wrestling as Richard Slinger.\n\nGordy died of a heart attack caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001. He was 40.\n\nIn 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame. A year later, he was also posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Gordy was posthumously inducted by his son into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\n\n\n"}
