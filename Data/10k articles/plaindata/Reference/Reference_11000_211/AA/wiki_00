As a wrestler, he helped innovate the \"brawling\" style and was infamous for his wild and legitimately uncooperative demeanor.\n\nGoodish was an All-State football and basketball player at Warren High School, Michigan, and played football at West Texas A&M University (then known as West Texas State) and with the Washington Redskins in the NFL.\n\nAfter attending West Texas A&M and working as a sportswriter Goodish was trained to wrestle by Fritz Von Erich ( Jack Adkisson ). He first wrestled in Dallas - Fort Worth and later Louisiana. As Bruiser Brody and King Kong Brody, Goodish competed as a freelancer in several companies including the Central States Wrestling (CSW), World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW), Windy City Wrestling, World Wrestling Council (WWC), Deep South Wrestling (DSW), Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). In the States, he had numerous feuds with the likes of Kamala the Ugandan Giant, Abdullah the Butcher, and \"Crusher\" Jerry Blackwell. In Japan, he was in a tag team with Stan Hansen. Brody had a reputation for refusing to job to other wrestlers. He also competed under the moniker of Red River Jack in Texas, during an angle against Gary Hart's men and Skandor Akbar's Army in World Class Championship Wrestling. Brody also competed as the Masked Marauder at one time in the AWA. In 1976, he went to Vince J. McMahon's WWWF where he challenged WWWF Champion Bruno Sammartino but was unsuccessful in winning the championship. Brody also teamed with Big John Studd. It was also in the WWWF where he wrestled Invader 1 (Jose Gonzales), whom he refused to sell for.\n\nIn 1985, he had a very short stint with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) in a feud with Antonio Inoki and many of their matches ended in no contests or disqualifications. In 1987, Brody began working primarily for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico after getting fired from New Japan. Brody continued his feud with Abdullah the Butcher, as well as engaging in a feud with Carlos Colon. He briefly returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling to win his last NWA International Heavyweight Championship. On April 15, 1988, the first attempt to form what became the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship was done when Brody faced off against NWA United National and PWF champion Genichiro Tenryu; the result was a double countout. Brody lost the title to Jumbo Tsuruta four days later. In WCCW in Texas he was actually a babyface, most often against Abdullah The Butcher. However against Abdullah in Montreal he was a heel managed by Floyd Creatchman. While there Tim \"Killer\" Brooks acted as his brother Buster Brody. In St. Louis for a short time he was popular in a NWA world title match against Ric Flair, which went to a one-hour draw. Brody was in an ongoing feud with The Russian Brute who later went on to AWA fame with Manager Ox Baker. Due to his huge reputation in Japan promoter Shohei Baba had the match taped and later aired on Japanese TV.\n\nIn Florida he beat B. Brian Blair for the Florida State championship. Brody had an infamous cage match with Lex Luger in Florida in January 1986. In the middle of the match, Brody stopped \"working\" and stood around. Luger and Bill Alfonso, the referee of the match, were puzzled and attempted to speak to Brody who did not respond. Luger and Alfonso decided to forgo the planned finish of the match and Alfonso disqualified Luger in a spot where Luger continually punched Brody in a corner and did not back off. After the match, Luger recalls asking Brody if he did anything wrong to upset him, to which Brody responded \"no\", and Brody's reasons for not working were not very clear, stating that \"the match just wasn't working\". In Larry Matysik's book, \"Wrestling at the Chase\", Matysik states that before the match Brody told him \"I'm not putting up with any of his bullshit\" and that Brody was upset that Luger would not sell for him. However, when watching the match, it is clear that Luger did sell for Brody. In a later shoot interview, Bill Alfonso said that there was a miscommunication issue on who would lead the match and there was no ill will ever between the two. Another scenario was that Brody was upset with the promoters over his paychecks (Brody had a contentious history with wrestling promoters for much of his career) and decided to embarrass the promotion by being uncooperative in the match. In 1987 he returned to the AWA where he fought Greg Gagne and Jerry Blackwell. Despite his reputation as being disagreeable with promotors he would aid any who needed a boost in ticket sales as he was guaranteed to bring in crowds. While working for WCCW in Texas he was the booker and produced their TV program.\n\nPrior to his wrestling career, Goodish worked as a sportswriter in San Antonio, Texas. Goodish was married on June 4, 1968, to Nola Marie Neece; the marriage ended in divorce on October 12, 1970. Goodish's second wife, New Zealand born Barbara Smith remained with him until his death in 1988. They lived in Texas. Together they had a son named Geoffrey Dean, born November 7, 1980.\n\nOn July 16, 1988, Brody was in the locker room before his scheduled match with Dan Spivey in Bayamón (a city near San Juan, Puerto Rico), when José Huertas González, a fellow wrestler and booker, allegedly asked him to step into the shower area to discuss business. There was an argument between the two wrestlers and a scuffle ensued, and the way the dressing room was designed, nobody saw what actually happened, followed by two screams, loud enough for the entire locker room to hear. Tony Atlas ran to the shower and saw Brody bent over and holding his stomach. Atlas then looked up at González and saw him holding a knife. Due to the heavy traffic outdoors and large crowd in the stadium it took paramedics close to an hour to reach Brody. When the paramedics arrived, Atlas helped carry Brody downstairs to the waiting ambulance as, due to Brody's enormous stature, paramedics were unable to lift him. He later died from his stab wounds. González (a US citizen) claimed self-defense and testified on his own defense. He was acquitted of murder in 1989, because the prosecution witnesses who did not live in Puerto Rico didn't show up, claiming that they did not receive their summons until after the trial had ended.\n\n\n\n"}

Dale earned large sums from working for the New York Stock Exchange, allowing him to collect 19th and 20th-century French paintings. Although he considered establishing a private museum, he donated a part of his collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1941. The rest of his collection was bequeathed to the National Gallery upon his death.\n\nDale was born in 1883, and started his financial career at the age of fifteen, as a runner for the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn time, he acquired assets that included utilities, railroads, and municipal bonds in the USA and Canada. When the National Gallery of Art opened, Dale lent the gallery 22 American pictures, and within a few months, two rooms of French Impressionist paintings were established. Upon the request of painter George Bellows, Dale agreed to sit for an oil on canvas painting in 1922, depicting Dale holding a golf club. Both Dale and Bellows were semi-professional athletes in their younger years.\n\nIn 1962, the long term loans of major artists who worked in Paris from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century were left to the gallery at the bequest of Dale. Included in the works that Dale bequeathed to the gallery were works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Salvador Dalí, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.\n\nAt the age of 27, he married Maud Murray, a painter and critic, who introduced him to the idea of collecting modern art.\n\nThe National Gallery of Art obtained 88 paintings from Dale's personal residence, an apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York, upon his death. The paintings were added to his 152 items already on loan to the National Gallery of Art. There were 6 new galleries established on the main floor to house the additional acquisitions. The bequest included 240 paintings, 7 sculptures, 22 graphics, over 1200 sales catalogs, and more than 1500 books. Additionally as part of the bequest, there were 3 fellowships established with a $500,000 endowment. \n"}

Gaster stated in his extensive preface his view (p. xx) that the \"Chronicles\" were compiled from several Hebrew sources, some quite ancient and others more recent. \n\nThe actual compiler of the chronicles identifies himself as \"Eleasar ben Asher the Levite' who, according to Gaster, lived in the Rhineland in the 14th century. The most recent events depicted in the \"Chronicles\" refer to the time of the Crusades, but the entire rest of it pertains to the period before AD 70. Among the early sources quoted in the work is the 1st century Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus.\n\nGaster explained that he chose to title it \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel\" instead of \"Chronicles of Eleasar\" because of his analysis that Eleasar was merely a compiler, while the enigmatic \"Jeraḥmeel\" is the source most extensively reproduced, following the \"Yosippon\" which is otherwise extant. This 'Jerahmeel' has since been identified as Jerahmeel ben Solomon, thought to have flourished in Italy around 1150. After a thorough discussion of all the textual evidence, Gaster further concluded that, like the closely related \"Sefer haYashar\", it relies on sources ultimately dependent on Isidore of Seville, particularly evident in its mention of \"Franks\" and \"Lombards\" among the Sons of Noah. \n\n\n"}

When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of plastic material whether they are synthetic or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future. Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too. Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.\n\nRecent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards biodegradable plastics, have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.\n\nAll plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.\n\nIdentification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.\n\nPlastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.\n\nIf there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using spectroscopic technology like, Optical Spectroscopy, Raman and near-infared spectroscopy along with mass spectrometry. Other forms of identification include elemental analysis, thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics. Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.\n\nMoDiP, the Museum of Design in plastics, has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects manufacturing date, manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell. This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.\n\nThese are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:\n\nThese are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects. To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary. \n\nBiodegradable plastics have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste. It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way. Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.\n\nThe cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:\n\n\nUnderstanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.\n\n\nAdditional effects of deterioration\n\nFor plastics composed of Cellulose Acetate the most common sign of deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar (Vinegar syndrome), its surface will have a white powder residue and it will begin to shrink.\n\nCellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce butyric acid which has a \"vomit odor\".\n\nPoly(Vinyl Chloride) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.\n\nSafety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects. As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.\n\nProper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects. Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels. Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.\n\nMonitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.\n\nAdsorbents such as \"activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites\" are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process. These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and vinegar syndrome which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated. Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.\n\nOxygen Impermeable bags are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag. With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.\n\nThe process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.\n\nThe process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however, solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object. A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.\n\nLight cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.\n\nWithin the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.\n\nFillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.\n\n\n\n"}

This union was usually between male vampires and female humans, with stories of female vampires mating with male humans being rare.\n\nThe word \"dhampir\" derives from the words \"dham\", albanian Gheg variant of dhëmb (“tooth”) + pir, participle of pi (“to drink”), literally meaning 'that who drinks through his/her teeth'. It is also thought that word for vampire descends from Slavic \"упирь\" or \"ǫpyrь\". \n\nThe word \"dhampir\" may also have arisen from folk etymology due to the resemblance between the words \"vampir\" and \"dhampir\".\n\nThe word \"dhampir\" is associated with Balkan folklore, as described by T. P. Vukanović. In the rest of the region, terms such as Serbian \"vampirović\", \"vampijerović\", \"vampirić\" (thus, Bosnian \"lampijerović\", etc.) literally meaning \"vampire's son\", are used.\n\nIn other regions the child is named \"Vampir\" if a boy and \"Vampirica\" if a girl, or \"Dhampir\" if a boy and \"Dhampirica\" if a girl. In Bulgarian folklore, numerous terms such as \"glog\" (lit. \"hawthorn\"), \"vampirdzhiya\" (\"vampire\" + \"nomen agentis\" suffix), \"vampirar\" (\"vampire\" + \"nomen agentis\" suffix), \"dzhadadzhiya\" and \"svetocher\" are used to refer to vampire children and descendants, as well as to other specialized vampire hunters. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.\n\nIn the Balkans it was believed that male vampires have a great desire for women, so a vampire will return to have intercourse with his wife or with a woman he was attracted to in life. Indeed, in one recorded case, a Serbian widow tried to blame her pregnancy on her late husband, who had supposedly become a vampire, and there were cases of Serbian men pretending to be vampires in order to reach the women they desired. In Bulgarian folklore, vampires were sometimes said to deflower virgins as well. The sexual activity of the vampire seems to be a peculiarity of South Slavic vampire belief as opposed to other Slavs, although a similar motif also occurs in Belarusian legends.\n\nLegends state that Dhampirs were normal members of the community. But male Dhampirs of paternal vampire descent could see invisible vampires and practice sorcery, often starting careers as vampire hunters, which would be practiced for generations from father to son.\n\nSome traditions specify signs by which the children of a vampire can be recognized. Albanian legends state they have untamed dark or black hair and lack a shadow. In Bulgarian folklore, possible indications include being \"very dirty\", having a soft body, no nails and bones (the latter physical peculiarity is also ascribed to the vampire itself), and \"a deep mark on the back, like a tail.\" In contrast, a pronounced nose was often a sign, as were larger than normal ears, teeth or eyes. According to J. Gordon Melton, from his book, \"The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead\", in some areas, a true dhampir possessed a \"slippery, jelly-like body and lived only a short life—a belief ... that vampires have no bones.\"\n\n"}

Besides the Lord's Prayer, Morning devotion, the widely practiced Christian ritual of praying before class starts in the morning is now been contested by Muslim parents and students.\n\nMuslim women are banned from wearing a headscarf to work not only in private spaces but also in government offices.

It however confirmed among other cases accounts of instructors at some public schools openly discriminating against students based on their Islamic faith. Following statements made by Bishop Charles Agyin-Asare at a Sunrise service in 2015 that there was \"a religious cleansing campaign aimed at exterminating all Christians from the face of the earth and that \"the world's 1.2 billion Muslim population were targeting Christians to harm them for being Christians\", various calls have been made by the government and stakeholders for religious leaders to moderate their speech and avoid cultivating fertile ground that can yield tension between the two faiths in Ghana. Agyen Asare at the service stated that \"We won't keep quiet anymore, some people believe that they should kill others so that they are the only people who can worship their 'whoever'\". He further stated that \"It's unfortunate; and we are going to do something about it\". The Chief Imam has consistently dismissed claims of an existing Muslim-Christian tensions in the country stating that \"we are living in harmony and would continue to do so\". In a 2015 press release, he reiterated the need for Muslims and Christians to engage in dialogue to resolve problems.\n\n"}

It depicts a girl who, as originally installed, faced the \"Charging Bull\" (or \"Wall Street Bull\") statue, It was removed in November 2018 in preparation for relocation to in front of the New York Stock Exchange. A plaque with footprints was placed on the original site of \"Fearless Girl\". \n\n\"Fearless Girl\" was commissioned to advertise for an index fund that comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership. The plaque below the statue states: \"Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,\" with \"SHE\" being both a descriptive pronoun and the fund's NASDAQ ticker symbol. The statue was originally installed on March 7, 2017, at Bowling Green in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City.\n\n\"Fearless Girl\", which measures approximately tall and weighs about , faced \"Charging Bull\", a much larger and heavier bronze statue that is tall and weighs . Both are located in Manhattan's Bowling Green, at the intersection of Broadway and Whitehall Street.\n\n\"Fearless Girl\" is meant to \"send a message\" about workplace gender diversity and encourage companies to recruit women to their boards. The plaque below the statue states: \"Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,\" with SHE referring to both the gender of the subject and the fund's NASDAQ ticker symbol.\n\nThe commission by State Street Global Advisors specified that the statue should depict a girl with hands on her hips and chin up, with a height of 36 inches, which Kristen Visbal and her collaborators then increased to 50 inches, to better match the size of \"Charging Bull\". Still, Visbal commented that \"I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud, and strong, not belligerent\". She modeled the sculpture on two children, but many of the distinguishing features were removed so that it would be universally appealing. A child who would represent all children \"so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl.\"\n\nThe statue was installed on March 7, 2017—the day before International Women's Day—by State Street Global Advisors, in a campaign developed by advertising agency McCann New York. SSgA was celebrating the first anniversary of its \"Gender Diversity Index\" fund that \"invests in U.S. large-capitalization companies that rank among the highest in their sector in achieving gender diversity across senior leadership\". The concept for the statue was developed by Senior Art Director Lizzie Wilson and Senior Copywriter Tali Gumbiner. Wilson and Gumbiner established both the idea for the statue as well as the overall look of the girl using countless moodboards and imagery, which Visbal referenced.\n\n\"Fearless Girl\" was originally given a one-week City Hall permit that was later extended to 30 days. Later, it was announced that the statue would remain in place through February 2018. Among those advocating for the statue to stay longer was U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York's 12th congressional district, who stated, \"This statue has touched hearts across the world with its symbolism of the resiliency of women.\" New York City Public Advocate Letitia James wrote a letter that supported keeping the statue, \"Fearless Girl stands as a powerful beacon, showing women—young and old—that no dream is too big and no ceiling is too high\".\n\nA petition on Change.org asking for the statue to be made permanent gathered 2,500 signatures in its first 48 hours. Efforts to make the statue permanent continued after the statue was granted a one-year permit. In April 2018, after \"Fearless Girl\" had been in place for thirteen months, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that both \"Charging Bull\" and \"Fearless Girl\" would be moved to a location facing the New York Stock Exchange. The move would occur before the end of 2018.\n\nThe statue was removed from its original location at Bowling Green on November 28, 2018. It will be relocated to a spot in front of the New York Stock Exchange. On the spot where the statue stood now has a marker which reads, \"Fearless Girl is on the move to The New York Stock Exchange. Until she's there, stand for her.\" The plaque also has footprints where people can stand.\n\nArturo Di Modica, who installed \"Charging Bull\" in 1989, asked that the statue of the girl be removed, arguing that the piece exploited his work for commercial purposes and altered the perception of the bull. He called \"Fearless Girl\" \"an advertising trick\" that he wants relocated, citing its political messaging.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, Di Modica and his attorney, former New York Civil Liberties Union director Norman Siegel, challenged city officials who let the \"Fearless Girl\" statue be installed. Di Modica said that the statue corrupted \"Charging Bull\" artistic integrity by distorting the intent of his statue from \"a symbol of prosperity and for strength\" into a villain, and does so for SSgA's commercial gain. Siegel said a lawsuit had not been filed as of yet. De Blasio supported keeping the statue, tweeting that \"Men who don't like women taking up space are exactly why we need the Fearless Girl.\"\n\nSome women criticized the statue as \"corporate feminism\" that violated their own feminist principles. \"The New York Times\" columnist Gina Bellafante called it \"an exercise in corporate imaging\" by State Street, which, she wrote, had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Department of Justice, agreeing to pay more than $64 million to resolve fraud charges for secretly billing clients for unwarranted commissions. \"Corporate feminism\", she wrote, \"operates with the singular goal of aiding and abetting a universe of mothers who tuck their daughters in at night whispering, 'Someday, honey, you can lead the emerging markets and sovereign debt team at Citigroup, and then become a director at Yahoo. Christine Emba, an opinion writer for \"The Washington Post\", wrote that the statue \"portrays the empowered woman as a child, reinforcing the idea of femaleness as cute and inoffensive—a child with potential, maybe, but not all the way there.\"\n\nGothamist reported on March 20, 2017, that masked New York activists covered the statue in \"Make America Great Again\" apparel and a US flag. They also placed pro-Donald Trump signs on it, including one reading \"VETS B4 ILLEGALS\" and another with a drawing of Pepe the Frog.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, artist Alex Gardega added a statue of a small dog, titled \"Pissing Pug\" (alternatively \"Peeing Pug\" or \"Sketchy Dog\"), and removed it after approximately three hours. He described \"Fearless Girl\" as \"corporate nonsense\" and \"disrespect to the artist that made the bull.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2017, State Street, the company that funded \"Fearless Girl\", paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit from its female and minority employees who alleged the company violated equal pay rights.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg News, analysts from marketing firm Apex Marketing estimated that the statue resulted in $7.4 million in free publicity for SSGA as of April 2017, broken down into $201,075 worth of free radio coverage, $393,047 worth of free social media coverage, $3,115,751 worth of free TV coverage, and $3,729,926 worth of free online/print news coverage.\n\nAt the 2017 Cannes Lions festival, \"Fearless Girl\" won three Grand Prix on the first day of the event alone, in the Glass (which deals with marketing addressing gender inequality) and PR categories, and tying for first in the Outdoor category alongside a campaign by Twitter.\n\nA duplicate of the sculpture was unveiled outside the Grand Hotel in the Norwegian city of Oslo on March 8, 2018. It faces the Norwegian parliament Stortinget.\n\nFearless Girl is one of only two campaigns that have ever won four Grand Prix at Cannes.\n\n"}

Canby Hall was named after Julia Canby, the daughter of a Boston businessman who had died of Scarlet Fever while abroad in Europe. Shelley Hyde, from Iowa; Faith Thompson from Washington, D.C. and Dana Morrison from New York City. They were assigned to 407 Baker Hall. (The other two dorm halls were Addison and Charles houses) At first the three girls clashed due to their differences, (Dana and Faith, both being from the East Coast, bonded immediately and Shelley having a harder time of it due to her being from the Midwest) but their young and hip housemother, Alison Cavanaugh, helped them sort through their differences and they bonded and became best friends. Their friendship was even more solidified when, during a trip to see Shelley's family and friends in Iowa, Faith had a terrible medical emergency, which scared everyone involved.\n\nAfter Shelley, Dana and Faith graduated, three new girls (Andrea \"Andy\" Cord; Jane Barrett and October \"Toby\" Houston) moved into 407, and on occasion, the six girls would get together, mainly for their former housemother's wedding and her pregnancy. Jane's family (the Barretts) had helped give the money to build the school's science hall named Barrett Hall. After Alison's marriage and her move to Boston, a new housemother named Meredith Pembroke comes along, and at first, handed out demerits with reckless abandon because she was overreacting to her own wild adolescence. Andrea, Jane and Toby talked her through the rough time, and then Meredith (nicknamed, Merrie) became as nice and friendly as Alison had been.\n\nThe other main adult, aside from the housemothers, was the school's austere headmistress, Patrice Allardyce, who was known as P.A. behind her back. Despite her austerity and her enforcement of the rules, Ms. Allardyce was also discovered to be a fair, compassionate and personable human being too.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22611273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22611273", "title": "Godkiller", "text": "Godkiller\n\nGodkiller is a transmedia series of graphic novels, illustrated films, and novels created by filmmaker Matt Pizzolo that tells the stories of human beings caught in the crossfire of warring fallen gods.\n\nThe core series is a trilogy of feature-length illustrated films beginning with \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\", illustrated by Anna Muckcracker and featuring performances by Lance Henriksen, Davey Havok (lead singer of AFI), Danielle Harris, Bill Moseley, Lydia Lunch, Nicki Clyne, and Justin Pierre (lead singer of Motion City Soundtrack). The series is particularly notable for its use of experimental and innovative media formats, such as the \"illustrated film\" format Pizzolo developed with producer Brian Giberson that merges sequential art with 3D CGI, motion graphics and dramatic voice performances in the style of a radio play.\n\nPizzolo and Muckcracker are currently at work on the second part of the trilogy \"Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes.\"\n\nThe October 2009 illustrated film DVD \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us - Episode 1\" quickly established itself as its distributor's all-time fastest-selling release.\n\nIn January 2012, the first issue of the \"Godkiller 2: Tomorrow's Ashes\" comic book series debuted as a digital series.\n\nGodkiller returned in 2014 as a monthly paper comic book series from Black Mask Studios.\n\nIn November 2014, it was reported that \"Godkiller\" would be rebooted as an animated feature film trilogy directed by Pizzolo.\n\nPizzolo said about the inspiration behind \"Godkiller\":\n\nI thought it would be fun to design a new mythology for fuck-ups and misfits. My goal with it is to present heroes that don't behave heroically because it's their job to maintain the status quo or because they're bored and want to rescue a princess, they act heroically because they're regular misfits who are trying to do the best they can for each other in an unjust, fucked-up world.\n\nThe \"Godkiller\" series was devised to be simultaneously produced as a series of graphic novels and films (both utilizing the same sequential art) with the ultimate goal being a trilogy of feature-length films. Pizzolo and Muckcracker began by serializing \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\" into a 6-issue comic book series (debuting in 2008) and a 3-episode film series (debuting in 2009) before the completed \"Walk Among Us\" feature film opened theatrically in 2010.\n\nThe \"Walk Among Us\" film was slated for a unique release of limited edition, bi-monthly DVDs starting September 29, 2009, followed by a theatrical run of the full feature in January 2010 and a DVD/Blu-ray release in March 2010.\n\nDue to overwhelming demand far beyond studio expectations, the first DVD's street date was delayed until October 6, 2009, so enough DVDs could be supplied to the stores, including Best Buy, Borders Books, F.Y.E. and Suncoast, among many more retailers.\n\nPizzolo and Muckcracker are currently working on the second part of the trilogy, \"Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes.\" The new series is slated to be released in mid-2011, followed soon after by the next wave of films. The complete \"Tomorrow's Ashes\" feature-length film is expected to premiere theatrically in 2011.\n\nPizzolo is currently writing the serialized, ongoing pre-apocalyptic prequel \"Godkiller: Silent War,\" an urban fantasy novel series which debuted as episodic e-books & audiobooks on the special features of the \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\" DVDs in October 2009.\n\nPizzolo explained the dramatic structure to \"Dread Central\":\n\n\"Godkiller\" is split into two periods ... there's the pre-nuke world of \"Silent War\" and there's the post-nuke world of the graphic novel and illustrated film \"Walk Among Us.\" So \"Silent War\" is only a prequel insofar as it happens beforehand, but its events drive the \"Walk Among Us\" story, and many of the same characters appear in both. I'm super excited that the two stories can roll out together in this integrated way--everything about this project is unorthodox and crazy, hopefully everyone will enjoy the ride.\n\nThe early chapters of \"Silent War\" (released in October 2009, January 2010, and March 2010) depicted chaotic, youth-driven protests on Wall Street and are now considered prescient of the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011. The protest scenes were illustrated by Muckcracker in mid-2011 as flashbacks in the comic book \"Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes - Spiderland\" and bear an uncanny resemblance to Occupy imagery. Pizzolo talked to \"Bleeding Cool\" about how the images of violent street protest, including a lynching of the Wall Street Charging Bull, were not widely considered predictive at the time of their initial release.\n\nWe start tying in the events of \"Silent War\" in \"Spiderland.\" \"Silent War\" was previously a serialized prequel novella included on the \"Walk Among Us\" DVDs as e-books and audiobooks. I wrote it back in 2009 and some of the core plot takes place among young radicals protesting on Wall Street. The pages in \"Spiderland\" look like they're directly lifted from Occupy Wall Street, but Anna actually illustrated those pages last summer before Occupy started. It's funny because when \"Silent War\" started coming out people were telling me they didn't believe there would be a populist youth movement targeting Wall Street, but now when \"Spiderland\" comes out everyone will be like oh yeah that's so obvious haha.\n\nPizzolo has indicated that his upcoming graphic novel series \"The Long Knives\" takes place in a shared universe with \"Godkiller\" and deals with several key \"Godkiller\" characters during the breakdown of society that precedes \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\". \"The Long Knives\" is a Giallo-style horror illustrated by newcomer Ana Ludeshka.\n\nLudeshka told \"Bloody Disgusting\":\n\nI was very shocked when I first read the Long Knives script. And not only because of the blood and the gore. There's no mercy in this story. It burns like cold things burn.\n\nIn the near future, 17-year-old Joe Junior and his girlfriend Bee run a speakeasy in the basement of an abandoned NYC church where they serve narcotic drinks to underagers while providing sanctuary and black-market employment to draft dodgers. When Joe is recruited by an armed cult of populist assassins, he is thrust into a secret world of international cabals, alien conspiracies, and the countdown to Armageddon.\n\nA deadly viral pandemic is tearing America apart. Amid the looting and lawlessness, a murderous gang of awol black ops is abducting children ... but no one knows why. When 16-year-old Bird winds up in their clutches, she'll uncover a dark conspiracy with terrifying consequences.\n\nSet in the future after an economic collapse, a nuclear holy war and an alien invasion, \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\" follows orphan Tommy as he searches for a new heart for his ill sister, Lucy.\n\nContinues Tommy's quest from \"Godkiller: Walk Among Us\".\n\nPizzolo developed the concept of an \"illustrated film\" with his producing partner Brian Giberson, mixing elements of anime, radio drama, video games, and motion comics. Utilizing the original artwork from the comic book, the \"illustrated film\" adds motion animation, visual effects, elaborate sound design, music, and voice-acting performances.\n\nWired asked Pizzolo to explain the differences between motion comics and illustrated films:\n\nIn illustrated films, we drive the pace of the storytelling with the dramatic voice performances and the sound design, so that allows us to showcase the illustrations in a way where you can really take a moment to absorb the art in the same way you can when reading a comic book ... Motion comics are closer to a form of limited animation that uses comics as source material. Illustrated films are closer to the experimental cinema of Ralph Bakshi's work, Chris Marker's La jetée or animation like Liquid Television.\n\nPizzolo gave \"Bloody Disgusting\" additional thoughts on differences between motion comics and illustrated films:\n\nThe simple answer is illustrated-films are an attempt to merge comic book sequential art with cinematic storytelling, whereas motion comics seem more intent on re-purposing comic books into cartoons. And I don't mean to sound like a dick because I think motion comics are cool, these are just different. On first glance, they look very similar ... and people might say \" 'it's moving comics on a screen, that's motion comics' \" to which I say \" 'just because Seinfeld is moving people captured on 35mm film doesn't make it the same thing as Full Metal Jacket.' \" On one level you could see motion comics and illustrated films as siblings like comics books vs graphics novels or TV shows vs feature films, but there are deeper distinctions. Basically, we're filmmakers so we're bringing a cinematic sensibility to this... We animate motion in the frame, but the need for motion is different in film ... it's not like Michael Madsen bounces around the frame in Reservoir Dogs the way Wakko does in Animaniacs.\n\nExplaining the decision to develop the new filmmaking format, Pizzolo told \"Bloody Disgusting\":\n\nWhen we decided to make an anime adaptation of the comic book, I couldn't see how a traditional animated approach would do justice to Anna's incredibly lush and detailed illustrations. It made perfect sense to adapt the medium to suit her art, rather than vice versa.\n\nPizzolo clarified further in an interview with \"Horror News\":\n\nThere are lots of reasons [Godkiller was made as an illustrated film], but I think the most important one was really being inspired by Anna Muckcracker's gorgeous artwork. Brian Giberson (my partner at Halo-8) and I had been experimenting with the illustrated film format for a while, but we might still have gone with traditional animation for Godkiller since it's really risky to experiment with a crazy story and a new filmmaking format at the same time. But once I saw Anna's art I knew that no traditional form of animation could do justice to the grimy, textured, surreal aesthetic she created. It was really an artistic choice, because from a business point of view it's just so risky.\n\nAccording to \"Fangoria\", \"Lance Henriksen, Bill Moseley and Tiffany Shepis are the genre stalwarts lending their vocal talents to the project; also on board in that capacity are underground cinema queen Lydia Lunch and singers Justin Pierre (of Motion City Soundtrack) and Davey Havok (of AFI).\"\n\nPizzolo and Giberson unveiled a preview clip of the \"Godkiller\" illustrated film during the \"Comic Books & Indie Movies\" panel at Comic-Con International's Wondercon in San Francisco on February 28, 2009.\n\nAccording to \"Shock Till You Drop\", \"Danielle Harris (known for her turns in the Halloween franchise), Katie Nisa (Threat), and Nicki Clyne (Battlestar Galactica) have joined previously announced cast members Lance Henriksen, Bill Moseley, Tiffany Shepis, Justin Pierre (singer of Motion City Soundtrack), Lydia Lunch (Richard Kern's 'Hardcore Collection'), and Davey Havok (AFI) in the cast of the 'illustrated film' adaptation \"Godkiller\", written and directed by award-winning filmmaker Matt Pizzolo (Threat) based on the comic book he created with illustrator Anna Muckcracker.\"\n\nPizzolo, Giberson and actresses Danielle Harris and Tiffany Shepis presented two exclusive preview clips of the \"Godkiller\" illustrated film at Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors in Los Angeles on April 18, 2009.\n\nImmediately following the preview clip debut at Weekend of Horrors, \"Fangoria\" posted the first exclusive online clip of \"Godkiller\" on its website.

{"id": "37674763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37674763", "title": "Harry letters affair", "text": "Harry letters affair\n\nThe \"Harry\" letters, written by Peter Benenson, founder of the international human rights group Amnesty International, detail the funding during 1966 of Amnesty's mission in the Rhodesian capital of Salisbury by somebody or something referred to as \"Harry\", commonly interpreted as code for the British government, then headed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The letters were made public in March 1967 by Polly Toynbee, an Englishwoman who had worked for Amnesty in Salisbury while a 19-year-old gap year student during early 1966. Scandal resulted within both the British government and Amnesty; Benenson left the group soon after.\n\nWhile with Amnesty in Rhodesia, Toynbee became suspicious of the disproportionately large amounts of money apparently at the disposal of Amnesty's mission there, as well as the modest scale of Amnesty's operations in both Rhodesia and Nigeria. Toynbee asked Benenson about the origin of the money, and pressed him on rumours that Britain was funding Amnesty's mission in Salisbury; according to her, he admitted it, and referred to it as \"Operation \"Lordship\"\". This ran at odds with Amnesty's claimed apolitical stance. Toynbee subsequently acquired a set of letters that appeared to confirm her suspicions. Addressed to an Amnesty official in Salisbury, they described efforts to gain external financing for the Rhodesia mission. Toynbee made the existence of the letters public in March 1967, concurrently alleging that Amnesty had been \"bought off\" by Whitehall.\n\nWhen questioned in Parliament on payments by the government to Amnesty, Wilson said that his administration had indeed been \"approached by a member of the organisation\", and had given a list of possible financial donors in response. Amnesty claimed that any such activities had been unilaterally conducted by Benenson on his own accord, and denied any collective wrongdoing. Benenson held that the money had been intended for Rhodesian political prisoners and their families, and said that the British government had wished for the payments to be kept secret for political reasons. The relationship between Whitehall and Amnesty was ended as a result of the affair, with Amnesty reaffirming its official impartiality.\n\nIn early 1966, during her gap year from studies at Oxford University, Polly Toynbee served as the secretary for the peer and former West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine on an Amnesty International mission to Nigeria and Rhodesia, two countries in Africa. In Lagos, the Nigerian capital, Toynbee and the other Amnesty members were supposed to be helping political detainees, but Toynbee recalled that \"We sat around drinking and entertaining the press. We must have spent an enormous amount but we never achieved anything. We never saw anyone important. We just got vague assurances that the prisoners were all right.\" The mission then went on to Rhodesia, where the predominantly white minority government under Ian Smith had unilaterally declared independence the previous November. Since the declaration of independence there had been reports of mass arrests of black nationalist leaders.\n\nDuring Toynbee's six weeks in Salisbury, Toynbee and other volunteers dispensed funds to the families of political detainees, and tried to arrange legal aid for the prisoners. Toynbee claimed that Amnesty's operations in both Nigeria and Rhodesia were little more than nominal, and became suspicious of the financial situation surrounding the Salisbury mission in particular. Although Amnesty then had a modest budget for such a prominent organisation—it operated out of Benenson's cramped legal chambers, and during the financial year 1965–66 boasted an annual budget of only £7,000—Toynbee said she found that there was, in her own words, a seemingly \"endless supply of money. I could go to the bank and draw out £200 at a time. And there was no check on what I did with the money.\" When Amnesty founder Peter Benenson visited the group in Salisbury, Toynbee asked him where the funds came from, saying there were rumours flying around the city that it was coming from Whitehall, the British government. According to Toynbee, Benenson said the British government was indeed supplying money. He reportedly described the transactions as \"Operation \"Lordship\"\".\n\nToynbee and others were expelled from Rhodesia in March 1966 for refusing information to the police. While she was there, however, she acquired some letters that she said had been abandoned in a safe. The letters appeared to have been written in London by Benenson between January and March 1966; some were typed, while others were in his handwriting. Alternately signed \"Margaret\" or \"Peter\", and addressed to the Amnesty representative in Salisbury, they contained frequent references to somebody or something called \"Harry\", which Toynbee interpreted as code for the UK government.\n\nMany of the letters contained detailed requests for payments and funding. One of them, dated 2 February 1966, included the passage \"What with North Hull Harry wants a fair buzz of legal activity. Harry's financial problems apparently have been solved and he's in a generous mood.\" Toynbee construed this as a reference to the Hull North by-election of the previous month, which had increased the Labour government's majority in the House of Commons from three to four members. Toynbee's interest was aroused as Amnesty took pride in its declared apolitical stance, a concept very much at odds with the idea of funding from a national government.\n\nOn 5 March 1967, Toynbee revealed the existence of the letters in newspaper interviews. She claimed that Amnesty had been \"bought off\" by the British government; \"Instead of dealing with legal test cases,\" she said, \"it is wasting its time on welfare work which could equally well be done by the Red Cross\".\n\nThe letters' public appearance caused a scandal. Amnesty distanced itself from the Rhodesia mission, claiming that any such activities had been unilaterally undertaken by Benenson alone. On 9 March, in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister Harold Wilson answered a parliamentary question on the letters from Knox Cunningham, who asked whether or not the \"payments made to Amnesty International were made with his [Wilson's] authority; for what reason such payments were made; and what was the total amount paid by Her Majesty's Government during 1966 to Amnesty International.\" Wilson replied that the government had been \"approached by a member of the organisation concerned for the humanitarian purpose of helping the families of men who have been oppressively detained. We thought it right to suggest possible donors who might be willing to help.\"\n\nBenenson contended that the money had been for the prisoners and their families, and had not been gifted to Amnesty by the government. He insisted that the British government had wished the payments to remain secret for political reasons. A private letter written by Benenson two months before Toynbee's interviews said that a third party, the hotelier Charles Forte, had been asked by Whitehall to provide £10,000 for the Rhodesia mission. In his letter, Benenson appeared to imply that Forte's donation might lead to an honour from the British government. Benenson later returned the money so as not to jeopardise the political reputation of the British government members involved in the payments.\n\nFollowing a state of crisis, Amnesty held a meeting in Denmark in March 1967, where Benenson's resignation was accepted. Benenson resigned on the grounds that Amnesty's offices had been bugged by the British government. In a report, Amnesty chairman Seán MacBride referred to Beneson's \"erratic activities\" and \"unilateral decisions\". Benenson responded by demanding MacBride's resignation, pointing out that the American Central Intelligence Agency had funded the International Commission of Jurists, of which MacBride was Secretary-General. The relationship between Amnesty and the British government was thereupon suspended. Amnesty vowed future impartiality, saying that it \"must not only be independent and impartial but it must not be put into a position where anything else could even be alleged\". Whitehall concurrently switched its stance towards Amnesty from one of co-operation to \"one of reserve\".\n\n"}

He is particularly noted for early work on vanadium and for photochemical studies.\n\nHenry Enfield Roscoe was born in London, the son of Henry Roscoe (1800–1836) and Maria Roscoe (née Fletcher)(1798-1885), and grandson of William Roscoe (1753–1831).\nStanley Jevons was a cousin.\n\nRoscoe studied at the Liverpool Institute for Boys and University College London. He then went to Heidelberg to work under Robert Bunsen, who became a lifelong friend. He also befriended William Dittmar. In 1857, Roscoe returned to England with Dittmar and was appointed to the chair of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester, with Dittmar as his assistant. Roscoe remained at the college until 1886 by which time the Victoria University had been established. From 1885 to 1895 he was MP for Manchester South. He served on several royal commissions appointed to consider educational questions, in which he was keenly interested, and from 1896 to 1902 was vice-chancellor of the University of London. He was knighted in 1884.\n\nRoscoe's scientific work includes a memorable series of researches carried out with Bunsen between 1855 and 1862, in which they laid the foundations of comparative photochemistry. In 1864 they carried out what is reputed to be the first flashlight photography, using magnesium as a light source. In 1867, Roscoe began an elaborate investigation of vanadium and its compounds, and devised a process for preparing it pure in the metallic state, at the same time showing that the substance which had previously passed for the pure metal was contaminated with oxygen. In so doing he corrected Berzelius's value for the atomic mass. Roscoe was awarded the 1868 Bakerian Lecture for this work. He also carried out researches on niobium, tungsten, uranium, perchloric acid, and the solubility of ammonia.\n\nHe was the uncle of Beatrix Potter. The mineral Roscoelite was named after him, due to its vanadium content and Roscoe's work on that element.\n\nRoscoe received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. In November 1909 he was sworn in the Privy Council. He was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912.\n\nRoscoe's publications include, besides several elementary books on chemistry that had a wide circulation and were translated into many foreign languages, \"Lectures on Spectrum Analysis\" (1869); a \"Treatise on Chemistry\" (the first edition of which appeared in 1877–1892); \"A New View of Dalton's Atomic Theory\", with Dr Arthur Harden (1896); and an Autobiography (1906). The \"Treatise on Chemistry\", written in collaboration with Carl Schorlemmer (1834–1892), who was appointed his private assistant at Manchester in 1859, official assistant in the laboratory in 1861, and professor of organic chemistry in 1874, was long regarded as a standard work. Roscoe's \"Lessons in Elementary Chemistry\" (1866) passed through many editions in the UK and abroad.\n\n\nThe Roscoe Building at the University of Manchester was named after Professor Roscoe: it is a large general-purpose teaching facility used for various levels of teaching in Brunswick Street.\n\n"}

He trained many professional wrestlers including Hulk Hogan, The Great Muta, \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff, Scott Hall, Lex Luger, \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton, and Ron Simmons.\n\nKojima adopted his Hiro Matsuda identity while competing in the southern United States, inspired by earlier wrestlers Sorakichi Matsuda and Matty Matsuda. He initially debuted under his real name at Rikidōzan's Japanese Wrestling Association, but then left Japan to pursue wrestling in the Americas. Once in a while he would return to Japan, where he formed a tag team with Antonio Inoki that was only the outward reflection of the long-time friendship between the two men.\n\nMatsuda was the first Japanese to win a National Wrestling Alliance world singles title when he won the junior heavyweight championship on July 11, 1964, in Tampa, Florida by defeating Danny Hodge. He would win a second title in 1975 and lose it to Hodge.\n\nAs a trainer, Matsuda was famous for being very stiff with his trainees to toughen them up and teach them to respect the business. He was very tough on a young Hulk Hogan; on his first day of training, Matsuda broke his leg. After Hogan healed, he came right back to Matsuda's school, looking to continue his training. Matsuda was so impressed by his display of \"guts\" that he trained him properly from that day on.\n\nHe came to work in Jim Crockett Promotions in 1987 as a heel to participate in a feud between his disciple Lex Luger and Dusty Rhodes, plus wrestled a few matches on TV with Four Horsemen manager James J Dillon acting as his manager. Matsuda was in Luger's corner. During the feud, he was billed as \"The Master of the Japanese Sleeper,\" a sleeper hold. He famously locked Johnny Weaver, who was in Rhodes' corner, in the hold. The prolonged application of the hold caused Weaver to bleed profusely from the mouth.\n\nHe later on worked briefly for World Championship Wrestling acting as the manager in early 1989 for the Yamasaki Corporation (a renamed Four Horsemen) and then being involved in Terry Funk's stable, The J-Tex Corporation as their business agent from Japan. As was the case with Tojo Yamamoto, he was frequently made the manager or spokesman of Japanese wrestlers on excursion in the United States. In this role, he \"introduced\" The Great Muta (managed by Gary Hart) on a \"World Championship Wrestling\" episode.\n\nKojima died in 1999 in Tampa, Florida of prostate cancer.\n\n\n"}

Generally the movies are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. Some Indian ghost movies, such as the comedy/horror film \"Chandramukhi\", have been great hits, dubbed into several languages. They usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore, but in some cases are remakes of Western movies, such as \"Anjaane\", based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story \"The Others\".</onlyinclude>\n\nThe 1949 \"Mahal\" (Hindi: महल; Urdu: محل; English: \"The Mansion\") was a groundbreaking Hindi language movie directed by Kamal Amrohi and starring Ashok Kumar and Madhubala, one of the earliest known Bollywood films dealing with reincarnation. \"Mahal\" became one of the biggest box office hits of 1949 in India. The movie paved the way for Indian gothic fiction.\n\n\"Chandramukhi\" (Tamil: சந்திரமுகி; Telugu: చంద్రముఖి; Hindi: चंद्रमुखी) (2005) is a horror, comedy and drama film directed by P. Vasu and produced by Ramkumar Ganesan. The soundtrack and background score for the film, which later became successful enough to be released as a separate album, was written by Vidyasagar. It was later dubbed into several languages, and became one of the highest grossing Tamil film ever.\n\"Chandramukhi\" is a remake of the 2004 Kannada film \"Apthamitra\", which was the highest grossing Kannada film in recent times. The movie tells of the experiences of a married couple who buy an ancient palace in Mysore that turns out to be haunted.\n\"Apthamitra\" itself was a remake of the successful 1993 Malayalam film \"Manichitrathazhu\" directed by Fazil and written by Madhu Muttam.\n\nThe ghost movies often concern modern people unexpectedly involved in the ghostly results of past events. \n\"Bhoot\" (Hindi: भूत, English: Ghost) (2003) was directed by Ram Gopal Varma and starring Urmila Matondkar and Ajay Devgan. A couple takes an apartment that turns out to have a horrifying past. A series of inexplicable experiences drives the wife to near madness. Bhoot was perceived to be different from a typical Bollywood movie as it did not contain songs.\n\"Krishna Cottage\" (2004) starring Sohail Khan, Natassha, and Ishaa Koppikar is a horror story that includes ghosts, death, reincarnation, and love, revolving around a fictional book \"Kayi Unkahi Batein\" (a few untold things) by Professor Siddharth Das (Rajendranath Zutshi).\n\nSome have a more philosophical theme.\nIn \"Hum Tum Aur Ghost\", starring Arshad Warsi and Dia Mirza, the hero is a charming fashion photographer whose life is marred by the fact that he hears voices that nobody else can hear, which disrupts his social life. He becomes aware of his special ability to connect with the souls that haven't crossed over, and sets out on a journey where he assists three souls, in the process learning much about himself.\n\nIndian ghost movies are often based on Indian novels or short stories about ghosts.\n\"Anandabhadram\" (Malayalam: അനന്തഭദ്രം) is a Malayalam film released in 2005 about ghosts, spirits, and black magic, based on the award-winning novel of the same name by Sunil Parameswaran. \nIt is the first Malayalam venture of Indian director Santosh Sivan as well as of Bengali model/actress Riya Sen. \nThe story of \"Ananthabhadram\" is a fairy tale. Set in rural Kerala, the tale is dominated by black magicians, martial arts experts, sorcerers and seductresses. Sivan said \"it was the story of Ananthabhadram that captivated me. The stories my grandmother used to tell me used to take me to a world of mystery. It was the same feeling when I heard this story and I have tried to capture that in my film.\"\n\n\"Paheli\" (Devanagari: पहेली, Nastaliq: پہیلی, ) (2005) was directed by Amol Palekar and produced by Gauri Khan, Sanjiv Chawla and Shahrukh Khan, who also plays the male lead. It is based on the short story written by Vijayadan Detha and tells the story of a wife (Rani Mukerji) who is left by her husband (Shahrukh Khan) and visited by a ghost, disguised as her husband, who is in love with her and takes her husband's place.\n\"Duvidha\" (1973) was directed by Mani Kaul and was critically acclaimed and won Best Film at the 1974 Filmfare Awards. The film is based on a story by Vijayadan Detha which relates a popular folktale from Rajasthan about merchant’s son whose relationship with his young bride is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her, resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband.\n\n\"Shodh\" (1981) is based on the book \"Steaming Rice and a Ghost Story\" by Sunil Gangopadhyay. Surendra (Om Puri), having been exiled from his village in youth and established himself in the city, comes back to the news of his father's demise, reportedly at the hands of a phantom. He announces a prize for anyone who succeeds in showing him a ghost, which attracts the greed of the poor hungry peasants, resulting in the accusations of innocent people as haunted and even murders with the hope of producing a ghost.\n\nSome Bollywood ghost movies are adapted from Western sources, with varying degrees of success.\nThe 2003 \"Saaya\" (Hindi: साया, Urdu: سایا, translation: \"Shadow\") is a direct lift of the 2002 Hollywood film Dragonfly.\n\"Raaz\" (Hindi: राज़, Urdu: راز, translation: \"Secret\") (2002) directed by Vikram Bhatt, is an unofficial Bollywood adaptation of the 2000 film \"What Lies Beneath\". \nThe film is based on the story of a couple who have moved to Ooty to save their failing marriage. However, what they find in their new home is more than they expected when a ghost starts haunting the place. Sanjana suddenly finds that her husband is part of the ghostly conspiracy, which she must fix in order to escape.\n\n\"Anjaane\" (2005) starred Manisha Koirala, Sanjay Kapoor, Tejasvini Kolhapure and Helen. The film was based on Alejandro Amenábar's ghost story The Others starring Nicole Kidman. The film was criticized for being a copycat of the American version and the acting of Koirala was described by reviewers as \"uninterested\" and \"mechanical\".\n\"Bhoothnath\" (Devanagari: भूतनाथ translation: \"Lord of Ghosts\") directed by Vivek Sharma and produced by Ravi Chopra, is an adaptation of the Oscar Wilde short-story The Canterville Ghost.\nThe story is about the relationship between a deceased old man (played by Amitabh Bachchan) and a boy named Banku.\n\nSome Hollywood movies refer to Bollywood ghost movies. For example, the 2001 movie \"Ghost World\" by Terry Zwigoff includes a clip from the 1965 hit \"Gumnaam\" by Raja Nawathe, which tells of a group of travelers in an isolated hotel who are murdered one by one. \"Gumnaam\" itself borrows from Agatha Christie's detective fiction novel \"And Then There Were None\".\n\n"}

The library offered music that was customizable by the licensee. The product format delivered perfectly looping, sampled recordings of each instrument that made up a given composition. End-users could then use their own multimedia software such as Adobe Flash to create new arrangements of the music they had licensed.\n\nkillersound was officially formed as a California corporation on April 26, 1999, and was based in the Silicon Valley region. Initially focused on original music creation for discrete client-driven projects, an additional business line was introduced in 2000. Cast-offs from the recording of original music soundtracks were enhanced, edited and produced to completion and organized into a searchable, online music library. With the debut of the second version of its killersound.com website in July 2000 at the Flash Forward Conference & Film Festival, killersound became the first online music library with fully searchable and downloadable music tracks and single-tier pricing.\nOver time, the library grew to nearly 1,000 customizable and loop-able music tracks featuring several dozen composers. One of the most notable composers discovered by killersound was none other than 2009 Grammy Award Nominated Artist Joel Zimmerman (Deadmau5) as well as music producer and sound designer MIDIhead who has most recently created patch libraries for Spectrasonics Omnisphere™. Eventually, other audio products were added including sound effects collections and multimedia bundles of images and audio. Later in the 2000s, the company found success re-purposing and licensing its material for the mobile phone ring tone market.\n\nHelping to launch the new business direction towards the production music library model, company co-founder, Frank Gelat (bio) helped develop a technique utilizing Flash for delivering high-quality, low-bandwidth music soundtracks over narrowband, dial-up internet connections. Composers for the killersound library became accustomed to composing in this modular format for web presentations and found it lucrative.\nFrank presented this technique in a session at the next Flash Forward Conference and his technique became widely known in the Flash community as \"The killersound Technique\". Given that neither Macromedia nor Adobe Systems have never developed a similar capability in subsequent versions of Flash, the technique is still useful to developers today. In fact, Adobe Systems still features the technique as it now perfectly applies to low-bandwidth audio presentation on mobile devices at Adobe.com.\n"}

Outlining what he viewed as \"objective thought that ensures the long-term Jewish national interests,\" Koenig stressed the need to \"examine the possibility of diluting existing Arab population concentrations\".\n\nThe leaking of the report by the Israeli newspaper Al-Hamishmar is frequently referred to as \"a major turning point in the relationship between the Israeli State and the Palestinian minority.\"\n\nThe Koenig Memorandum was the first publicly available document to outline some of the \"policies of discrimination and containment\" that Palestinian citizens have been subject to since 1948, reflecting \"planning and deliberations at the policy-making circles.\" Its publication also exposed policy options that Israeli policy makers were considering prior to Land Day, as its first (main) section was finalized on 1 March - one month before the events of Land Day.\n\nAlthough the Israeli Government never officially acknowledged that official government policies were guided by this plan, some of Koenig's recommendations were implemented, particularly those regarding the expansion of land expropriations from Arab owners and the establishment of new Jewish settlements in the area in order to fragment and contain the Palestinian Arab population in Israel.\n\nAdditionally, both the Tel Aviv magazine, New Outlook and the New York newspaper Jewish Press reported in the fall of 1976 that Koenig had collaborated with prominent activists in Mapai, the party of Ben-Gurion, Eshkol, Meir, Peres and Rabin to prepare the report, and that Zvi Aldoraty, Mapai candidate for Director of Arab Affairs, was a major co-author.\n\nThe Koenig Memorandum came to the public’s attention in September 1976, when it was reprinted in full in Al Hamishmar, a Hebrew-language newspaper in Israel.\n\nIts publication provoked widespread debate in both the domestic and international arena.\n\nThe comments of the Egyptian Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Abdul Meguid, provide one illustration of such debate in the international arena. At a meeting of the Security Council on November 1, 1976, Meguid stated, “The aims of the Israeli Government are well known, but recently one of these official plans came to the notice of public opinion: it is a secret document, known as the Koenig memorandum, presented to the Office of the Prime Minister by Mr. Koenig, who is a high official in the Israeli Interior Ministry and is responsible for the treatment of Arabs in Israel. The Israeli Government is somewhat embarrassed — or so it says — not because of the contents of this memorandum, but only because it was brought to the attention of world public opinion.”\n\nDomestically in Israel, the memorandum’s publication was received with a generally more muted response. The Israeli newspaper, Yediot Aharonot reported on September 7 that senior elements close to the Prime Minister attached importance to the Koenig report. Israeli radio on September 8 reported that Interior Minister, Yosef Burg, reacted to the document’s publication by saying that he had complete faith in Mr. Koenig.\n\nOn September 9, Haaretz newspaper reported that Amos Eiran, Director General of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, deplored the \"leaking\" of the Koenig Report by Al-Hamishmar, but no governmental figures repudiated its recommendations.\n\nAhmad H. Sa'di, a lecturer in the Department of Politics and Government at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel claims that \"The racist language of the Report and its draconian suggestions caused wide-ranging indignation by Palestinians. However, State officials dismissed this reaction as unwarranted. They maintained that the Report represented the opinion of its author(s), and did not represent an official policy nor did it reflect the mode of thinking in decision-making circles. The debates that followed the Report's publication have mostly centered on the limits of freedom of expression (and racism) that civil servants ought to observe, instead of dealing with the premises of the State policy towards the minority.\"\n\nThe first section of Koenig's report is entitled, \"The Demographic Problem and the Manifestations of Arab Nationalism.\" In this section, Koenig claims that the Arab population of the Galilee region would constitute a majority (51%) of the population there by 1978 and that this, along with rising \"nationalistic\" sentiments \"will endanger our control of that area.\" He then proceeds to review the organizational capabilities of the Rakah party, foreshadowing and reflecting the important role they played in Land Day demonstrations that took place on March 30, 1976, in which six Arab citizens of Israel were killed by the IDF and Israel Police.\n\nIn her book, \"The Fate of the Jews: A People Torn Between Israeli Power and Jewish Ethics\", Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht summarizes some of the major strategic objectives and tactical steps endorsed by The Koenig Memorandum, as follows:\n\n\nFurther elements in the memorandum included Koenig's reflection that, \"Social and economic security free[s] the individual and the family from economic worries ... and give[s] him, consciously and subconsciously, leisure time for social and nationalistic thoughts that are exploited by hostile elements to generate ferment and bitterness.\" As one practical measure to help obviate this end, Koenig proposed \"neutralizing grants to large families.\"\n\nAn English translation of the full report appeared in \"SWASIA\".\n\nIn his book, \"Deliberate Deceptions: Facing the Facts About The U.S.-Israeli Relationship,\" Paul Findley cites among other examples, the recommendations of the Koenig Memorandum, to refute the common pro-Zionist assessment that Jewish citizens of Israel \"do not have more rights than their non-Jewish fellows.\" He notes that these recommendations included encouraging emigration of Palestinian Arabs through study abroad programs and giving \"preferential treatment to Jewish groups or individuals rather than to Arabs.\"\n\nIn Haaretz's online English Edition, Yisrael Koenig, now a pensioner, is quoted as saying that Israel's Arabs \"only want to suck the best out of us.\" He further relates a story about a friend of his, \"a rich Christian from Nazareth,\" who is grateful to him for Koenig's having persuaded him to immigrate to Canada. Koenig relates that the rationale he used was: \"Your children will never have it good here.\"\n\n\n"}

The discipline that deals with these dictionaries is specialised lexicography. Medical dictionaries are well-known examples of the type.\n\nAs described in Bergenholtz/Tarp 1995, LSP dictionaries are often made for users who are already specialists with a subject field (experts), but may also be made for semi-experts and for users who may be laypeople relative to a particular subject field. In contrast to LSP dictionaries, LGP (language for general purposes) dictionaries are made to be used by an average user. LSP dictionaries may have one or more functions. LSP dictionaries may have communicative functions such as help users to translate texts, help users to understand texts and help users to produce texts. Dictionaries may also have cognitive functions such as help users to develop knowledge in general or about a specific topic, such as the birthday of a famous person and the inflectional paradigm of a specific verb.\n\nAccording to Nielsen 1994, LSP dictionaries may cover one language (monolingual LSP dictionaries) or two languages (bilingual LSP dictionaries), and occasionally more languages. An LSP dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the vocabulary in a subject field as possible is called a maximizing dictionary, and an LSP dictionary that attempts to cover a limited number of terms within a subject field is called a minimizing dictionary.\n\nAlso, Nielsen 1994 distinguishes between the following types of dictionaries: An LSP dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a multi-field dictionary, an LSP dictionary that covers one subject field (e.g. a dictionary of law) is called a single-field dictionary, and an LSP dictionary that covers part of a subject field (e.g. a dictionary of contract law) is called a sub-field dictionary.\n\nA common form of LSP dictionary is a \"usage dictionary\" for a particular field or genre, such as journalism, providing advice on words and phrases to prefer or prefer, and distinctions between easily confused usages. Probably the best known of these for new style writing is the \"AP Stylebook\". Many such works also have elements of a style guide, though most of the latter are not in dictionary format, but arranged as a series of rules in sections, and more concerned with grammar and punctuation. Some usage dictionaries are intended for a general rather than specialized audience, and are therefore more comprehensive; two major ones are \"Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" and \"Garner's Modern English Usage\".\n\n\n"}

An example is the sentence below in which Spanish–derived words are in italics (original in parentheses):\n\nThe adoption of the Abakada alphabet in 1940 changed the spelling of most of the Spanish loanwords present in the Filipino language.

Examples include \"agila\" (from Sp. \"águila\"), \"alkalde\" (from Sp. \"alcalde\"), \"bakuna\" (from Sp. \"vacuna\"), \"banyo\" (from Sp. \"baño\"), \"baso\" (from Sp. \"vaso\"), \"biktima\" (from Sp. \"víctima\"), \"bintana\" (from Sp. \"ventana\"), \"bisita\" (from Sp. \"visita\"), \"biyahe\" (from Sp. \"viaje\"), \"braso\" (from Sp. \"brazo\"), \"demokrasya\" (from Sp. \"democracia\"), \"diyaryo\" (from Sp. \"diario\"), \"estudyante\" (from Sp. \"estudiante\"), \"heneral\" (from Sp. \"general\"), \"hustisya\" (from Sp. \"justicia\"), \"kama\" (from Sp. \"cama\"), \"kambyo\" (from Sp. \"cambio de marcha\"), \"keso\" (from Sp. \"queso\"), \"kutsara\" (from Sp. \"cuchara\"), \"kwarto\" (from Sp. \"cuarto\"), \"kwento\" (from Sp. \"cuento\"), \"lababo\" (from Sp. \"lavabo\"), \"mensahe\" (from Sp. \"mensaje\"), \"meryenda\" (from Sp. \"merienda\"), \"mikrobyo\" (from Sp. \"microbio\"), \"niyebe\" (from Sp. \"nieve\"), \"panyo\" (from Sp. \"paño\"), \"pila\" (from Sp. \"fila\"), \"plema\" (from Sp. \"flema\"), \"presyo\" (from Sp. \"precio\"), \"prinsesa\" (from Sp. \"princesa\"), \"reseta\" (from Sp. \"receta médica\"), \"reyna\" (from Sp. \"reina\"), \"serbisyo\" (from Sp. \"servicio\"), \"sinturon\" (from Sp. \"cinturón\"), \"teklado\" (from Sp. \"teclado\"), \"telebisyon\" (from Sp. \"televisión\"), \"tinidor\" (from Sp. \"tenedor\"), \"trabaho\" (from Sp. \"trabajo\"), \"tuwalya\" (from Sp. \"toalla\") and \"yelo\" (from Sp. \"hielo\").\n\nOther loanwords derived from the Spanish language underwent spelling and pronunciation changes. Vowel changes can be observed to some of the Spanish words upon adoption into the Filipino language. For example, an /i/ to /a/ vowel shift can be observed in the Filipino word \"paminta\", which came from the Spanish word \"pimienta\". A rare vowel change from /e/ to /u/ can be observed in the words \"unano\" (from Sp. \"enano\") and \"umpisa\" (from Sp. \"empezar\"). Other words derived from Spanish underwent vowel deletion upon adoption into the Filipino language, such as the words \"pusta\" (from Sp. \"apostar\"), \"tarantado\" (from Sp. \"atarantado\"), \"kursonada\" (from Sp. \"corazonada\"), \"Pasko\" (from Sp. \"Pascua\") and \"labi\" (from Sp. \"labio\"). Consonant shifts can also be observed to some of the Spanish words upon their adoption into the Filipino language. The [r] to [l] consonant shift can be observed in the following words: \"albularyo\" (witch doctor or folk healer, from Sp. \"herbolario\"), \"alma\" (from Sp. \"armar\"), \"almusal\" (from Sp. \"almorzar\"), \"asukal\" (from Sp. \"azúcar\"), \"balbas\" (from Sp. \"barba\"), \"bandila\" (from. Sp. \"bandera\"), \"dasal\" (from Sp. \"rezar\"), \"hibla\" (thread or strand, from Sp. \"hebra\"), \"hilo\" (dizzy, from Sp. \"giro\"), \"hulmá\" (to mould, from Sp. \"ahormar\"), \"kasal\" (from Sp. \"casar\"), \"kumpisal\" (from Sp. \"confesar\"), \"litratista\" (photographer, from Sp. \"retratista\"), \"litrato\" (photograph, portrait or picture; from Sp. \"retrato\"), \"multo\" (from Sp. \"muerto\"), \"nunal\" (from Sp. \"lunar\"), \"pastol\" (from Sp. \"pastor\") and \"pasyal\" (from Sp. \"pasear\"). The loss of the /l/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino word \"kutson\" derived from the Spanish \"colchón\". The loss of the /t/ phoneme can be observed in the Filipino words \"talino\" (intelligence or wisdom, from Sp. \"talento\") and tina (dye, from Sp. \"tinta\"). Some Spanish-derived words have also undergone consonant or syllable deletion upon introduction to Tagalog like in the case of \"limos\" (from Sp. \"limosna\"), \"masyado\" (from Sp. \"demasiado\"), \"posas\" (from Sp. \"esposas\"), \"restawran\" (from Sp. \"restaurante\"), \"riles\" (rail, railway or railroad; from Sp. \"carriles\"), \"sindi\" (from Sp. third-person singular present tense conjugation of the verb \"encender\") and \"sintonado\" (from Sp. \"desentonado\").\n\nThe Spanish digraph [ll] is pronounced by the Spaniards as /j/ during the Renaissance era and this reflected on the pronunciation and the spelling of Spanish-derived loanwords in Tagalog introduced before the 19th century, where the digraph [ll] becomes [y] in Tagalog. Such is the case of the words \"barya\" (from Sp. \"barilla\"), \"kabayo\" (from Sp. \"caballo\"), \"kutamaya\" (from. Sp. \"cota de malla\"), \"lauya\" (a stew of meat and vegetables, from Sp. \"la olla\"), \"sibuyas\" (from Sp. \"cebollas\") and \"tabliya\" or \"tablea\" (from Sp. \"tablilla de chocolate\"). Spanish loanwords in which the digraph [ll] is pronounced as /lj/ in Tagalog were probably introduced (or reintroduced) during the 19th century by educated Peninsulares. Examples include \"apelyido\" (from Sp. \"apellido\"), \"balyena\" (from Sp. \"ballena\"), \"kalye\" (from Sp. \"calle\"), \"kutsilyo\" (from Sp. \"cuchillo\"), \"makinilya\" (from Sp. \"maquinilla de escribir\"), \"sepilyo\" (from Sp. \"cepillo de dientes\"), \"silya\" (from Sp. \"silla\") and \"sigarilyo\" (from Sp. \"cigarrillo\"). There are also instances of the Spanish digraph [ll] being transformed into [l] upon adoption by Tagalog. Such is the case of the following words: \"kulani\" (lymph node, from Sp. \"collarín\"), \"kursilista\" (from Sp. \"cursillista\") and \"uling\" (coal, soot or charcoal; from Sp. \"hollín\").\n\nOthers have morphed like 'ku(ha)nin' (Sp.: 'coja' + Tag.: '–nin'), which has inconspicuously developed into another pure Tagalog–sounding word. Another one is \"maamong kordero\" (from Sp. \"amo\" & \"cordero\"). Combined together, it conveys the description of a meek, tame, harmless human with Tagalog adjective prefix and suffix added. The compound word \"batya't palo–palo\", a must word in the laundry business where many Spanish words proliferate. The words were taken from the Spanish \"batea\" for \"washing tub\" and \"palo\" for \"stick\" or \"beater\", something a typical Filipino might think had no Spanish provenance at all. Others are \"umpisa\" (\"empieza\"), \"pulubi\" (\"pobre\"), \"pader\" (\"pared\").\n\nSome have acquired an entirely new meaning, such as \"kursonada\" (\"corazonada\", originally meaning '\"hunch\"), which means \"object of desire\"; \"sospechoso\" is the \"suspicious person\" and not the \"suspect\" as in the original; \"insekto\" (\"insecto\"), which still means \"insect\" but also refers to a \"pesty clownish person\"; or even sige (\"sigue\"), a Spanish word for \"continue\" or \"follow\", which is now widely understood to mean \"all right\" or \"go ahead\".\n\nOthers use Spanish prefixes and/or suffixes, combined from Tagalog or other languages, without which the word can not be completed and convey its meaning. For example, \"pakialamero\" (from Tag. \"pakialam\", \"to meddle\" and the Sp. suffix \"–ero\", masculine subject); same as \"majongero\" (\"mahjong\", a Chinese word and the Sp. suffix \"–ero\"). \"Daisysiete\" is a corruption and portmanteau of the English \"daisy\" and the Spanish \"diecisiete\" (\"seventeen\"), now meaning a sweet and sexually desirable underaged (below 18, hence the number) female. \"Bastusing katawán\" (Sp.: \"basto\" & Tag.: \"katawan\") is an example of a two-word term for a bombshell body\n\nEven after the Spanish era, Tagalog is still being influenced by Spanish as new words are coined, albeit along its own terms, viz., \"alaskadór\" (\"Alaska\" + Sp. suffix '–ador'); \"barkada\" (from Sp.: \"barca\",\"boat\" to \"clique\"); \"bérde\" (\"verde\"=\"green\", nuanced to \"toilet humour\" or \"blue joke\"); which are not readily understood in Spain or any Latin American country. In a strange twist, even if Filipinos have a chance to Tagalized words using foreign words, currently English—their most accessible influence—they coin words in a uniquely Hispanizing way i.e. \"boksingero\" (from Eng. \"boxing\") instead of using the Spanish \"boxeador\". Or \"basketbolista\" (from Eng. \"basketball\"), instead of borrowing from Spanish \"baloncesto\" to make it say \"baloncestista\" or \"baloncestador\" (although basketball \"básquetbol\" in many Latin American countries).\n\nHere are some examples of Spanish–derived Tagalog words in the following format:\nWord (Etymology – Original Definition/s if different from Nuanced Definition. = Derivative Definition if Compound Words) – Nuanced Definition. Shared Definition precedes Nuanced Definition if both exist.\nNote that the first syllable of loanwords from Spanish that start with /aw/ are also sometimes pronounced and spelled /o/ (e.g. 'otonomiya' rather than 'awtonomiya') due to the predominance of pronunciation of loanwords from English.\n\nUpon adoption into Tagalog, a number of Spanish-derived terms underwent a process of semantic shift or change in meaning. A loanword is said to have undergone a semantic shift if its meaning in Tagalog deviates from the original meaning of the word in the source language (in this case, Spanish). A type of semantic shift is the so-called \"semantic narrowing\", which is a linguistic phenomenon in which the meaning of a Spanish-derived word acquires a less general or inclusive meaning upon adoption into Tagalog. Semantic narrowing occurs when a word undergoes specialization of usage. For example, the word \"kuryente\" (meaning \"electricity\" or \"electric current\") comes from the Spanish word \"corriente\", which is a general term to refer to any current, whether electric or not. Upon adoption of the word \"corriente\" into Tagalog as \"kuryente\", it underwent a semantic narrowing and its usage became restricted to refer only to an electric current, unlike its Spanish counterpart. Another example of a semantic narrowing is the Tagalog word \"ruweda\" (meaning \"Ferris wheel\"), a term derived from the Spanish word \"rueda\" which refers to any kind of wheel. Upon adoption into Tagalog, \"ruweda\" underwent usage specialization and its meaning became restricted to the Ferris wheel.\n\nSemantic shift may also occur through semantic interference by another language, usually the English language. This phenomenon can result into reinterpretation of a Spanish-derived term by attributing to it an English meaning upon assimilation into Tagalog. An example is the Tagalog word \"libre\", which is derived from the Spanish translation of the English word \"free\", although used in Tagalog with the meaning of \"without cost or payment\" or \"free of charge\", a usage which would be deemed incorrect in Spanish as the term \"gratis\" would be more fitting. Another example is the Tagalog word \"iskiyerda\", derived from the Spanish term \"izquierda\" meaning \"left\" as opposed to \"right\", although used in Tagalog with the meaning of \"to leave\".\n\nHere is the list of Spanish-derived words which underwent semantic shift upon assimilation into Tagalog:\n\nSome of the Spanish loanwords in Tagalog appear in their pluralized form, marked with -s or -es. However, in Tagalog, such words are not considered as plural and when they are pluralized in Tagalog, they need to be pluralized in the way that Tagalog pluralizes native words, i.e., by placing the pluralization marker \"mga\" before the word . For example, the word \"butones\" (meaning button used in clothing, from Sp. \"botones\") is considered singular in Tagalog and its plural form is \"mga butones\".\n\nSeveral Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Most of them are in their infinitive form characterized by the deletion of their final /r/, like for example in the case of the Tagalog \"intindi\" (to understand) derived from the Spanish verb \"entender\". This feature is also found in Chavacano verbs which have a Spanish origin and it can be argued that an already restructured form of Spanish (Chavacano or a pidgin) was the origin of these Tagalog words. A list of these loanwords can be viewed below.\n\nAlternatively, upon adoption into Tagalog, the final /r/ of the Spanish verbs in their infinitive form becomes /l/. Such is the case of the following loanwords: \"almusal\" (to have breakfast, from Sp. \"almorzar\"), \"dasal\" (from Sp. \"rezar\"), \"kasal\" (from Sp. \"casar\"), \"kumpisal\" (from Sp. \"confesar\"), \"minindal\" (from Sp. \"merendar\"), \"pasyal\" (from Sp. \"pasear\") and \"sugal\" (from Sp. \"jugar\"). In some cases, the Tagalog form is phonetically unassimilated like in the case of \"andar\" (to set in action or motion; from Sp. \"andar\").\n\nConjugated Spanish verbs are also adopted into Tagalog. Examples include: \"kúha\" (from Sp. \"coger\"), \"pára\" (from Sp. \"parar\"), \"pása\" (from Sp. \"pasar\"), \"puwede\" (from Sp. \"poder\"), \"tíra\" (from Sp. \"tirar\") and \"sige\" (from Sp. \"seguir\"). \"Imbiyerna\" (meaning to annoy or to irritate someone) is derived from the Spanish verb \"infernar\" (meaning to irritate or to provoke) and was allegedly coined by Ricardo \"Rikki\" Dalu, originally to describe the hellish feeling and the frustration he experienced when attending Spanish classes. In some cases, the conjugated verbs are combined with another word to form Tagalog morphemes like in the case of the following words: \"asikaso\" (from the combination of Sp. \"hacer\" and Sp. \"caso\"), \"balewala\" or \"baliwala\" (from the combination of Sp. \"valer\" and Tag. \"wala\"), \"etsapwera\" (from the combination of Sp. \"echar\" and Sp. \"fuera\") and \"kumusta\" (from the combination of Sp. \"cómo\" and Sp. \"estar\").\n\nSome Tagalog compound terms are actually formed through a combination of a native Tagalog term and an etymologically Spanish term, like in the case of the idiomatic expression \"balat-sibuyas\" (a term referring to a person's easiness to be offended), which is a combination of the Tagalog \"balat\" and Spanish \"cebolla\". The linguist Ekaterina Baklanova distinguishes at least two types of Spanish-Tagalog compound terms: \"hybrid loanwords\" or \"mixed-borrowings\" are partially-translated Spanish terms which are adopted into Tagalog, \"e.g.\" \"karnerong-dagat\" (derived from the Spanish term \"carnero marino\", meaning \"seal\") and \"anemonang-dagat\" (derived from the Spanish term \"anémona de mar\", meaning \"sea anemone\"), while \"hybrid neologisms\" are new terms invented by Filipinos with use of some native and already assimilated Spanish-derived material, \"e.g.\" \"pader-ilog\", meaning \"embankment\", derived from the combination of the Tagalog word \"ilog\" (meaning \"river\") and Spanish word \"pared\" (meaning \"wall\" and adopted in Tagalog as the word \"pader\").\n\nBelow is the list of some Spanish-Tagalog hybrid compound terms. Because of the lack of standardization, some of the compound terms listed below are written differently (\"i.e.\" without the hyphen) in other Tagalog-based literature. For example, while the term \"sirang-plaka\" is usually encountered in many Tagalog-based works without the hyphen, there are also some instances of the term being written with the hyphen like in the case of one of the books written by the Chairman of the Commission on the Filipino Language Virgilio Almario, entitled \"Filipino ng mga Filipino: mga problema sa ispeling, retorika, at pagpapayaman ng wikang pambansa\". Another example is the term \"takdang-oras\", which can also be encountered in the literature without the hyphen. As a rule, a hybrid compound term below will be hyphenated if it has at least one instance of it being written with the hyphen in Tagalog-based literary works.\n\nEnglish has been used in everyday Tagalog conversation. This kind of conversation is called Taglish. English words borrowed by Tagalog are mostly modern and technical terms, but English words are also used for short usage (many Tagalog words translated from English are very long) or to avoid literal translation and repetition of the same particular Tagalog word. English makes the second largest vocabulary of Tagalog after Spanish. In written language, English words in a Tagalog sentence are written as they are, but they are sometimes written in Tagalog phonetic spelling. Here are some examples:\n\nMany Malay loanwords entered the Tagalog vocabulary during pre-colonial times as Old Malay became the lingua franca of trade, commerce and diplomatic relations during the pre-colonial era of Philippine history as evidenced by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription of 900 AD and accounts of Pigafetta at the time of the Spanish arrival in the country five centuries later.\n\nAs in most Austronesian languages, the Sanskrit vocabulary incorporated into Tagalog are mostly borrowed indirectly via Malay or Javanese. Examples include:\n\nExamples:\n\nExamples:\n\nMany of the Chinese loanwords in Tagalog are derived from Hokkien, the Southern Chinese variety spoken in the Philippines. Most of the 163 Hokkien-derived terms collected and analyzed by Gloria Chan-Yap are fairly recent and do not appear in the earliest Spanish dictionaries of Tagalog. Many of the Hokkien-derived loanwords like \"pancit\" entered the Tagalog vocabulary during the Spanish colonial era when the Philippines experienced an increased influx of Chinese immigrants (mostly from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in Southern China) as Manila became an international entrepôt with the flourishing of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade. Attractive economic opportunities boosted Chinese immigration to Spanish Manila and the new Chinese settlers brought with them their skills, culinary traditions and language, with the latter then influencing the native languages of the Philippines in the form of loanwords, most of which are related to cookery. On the other hand, only few of the Chinese loanwords are derived from Mandarin and not from Hokkien, such as \"apyan\" (opium, from Chinese 鴉片/yāpiàn), \"betsin\" (monosodium glutamate, from Chinese 味精/wèi-jīng), \"ginto\" (gold, from Chinese 金條/jīn-tiáo), \"pisaw\" (small knife, from Chinese 匕首/bǐ-shǒu) and \"sampan\" (Chinese junk, from Chinese 舢板/shān-bǎn).\n\nThere are very few Tagalog words that are derived from Japanese. Many of them are introduced as recently as the twentieth century like \"tansan\" (bottle cap, from the Japanese 炭酸 which originally means refers to soda and carbonated drinks) and \"karaoke\" (from the Japanese カラオケ, literally means \"empty orchestra\") although there are very few Japanese words that appear in the earliest Spanish dictionaries of Tagalog such as \"katana\" (Japanese sword, from the Japanese かたな with the same meaning).\n\nSome Filipino jokes are based on comical reinterpretation of Japanese terms as Tagalog words like for example in the case of \"otousan\" (from the Japanese お父さん meaning \"father\") which is reinterpreted as \"utusan\" (meaning \"servant\" or \"maid\") in Tagalog. As for the Tagalog word \"Japayuki\", it refers to the Filipino migrants who flocked to Japan starting in the 1980s to work as entertainers and it is a portmanteau of the English word \"Japan\" and the Japanese word \"yuki\" (or 行き, meaning \"going\" or \"bound to\").\n\nTagalog gained Nahuatl words through Spanish from the Galleon trade with Mexico during the Hispanic era.\n\nHere are some examples:\n"}

{"id": "2137749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2137749", "title": "Peter Maivia", "text": "Peter Maivia\n\nFanene Leifi Pita Maivia (born Fanene Pita Anderson; April 6, 1937 – June 12, 1982) was a Samoan-American professional wrestler better known as Peter Maivia. He is the maternal grandfather of Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, part of the famous Anoa'i family and was a promoter for the National Wrestling Alliance in Hawaii.\n\nAfter spending his first twenty years in American Samoa, Mavia moved to New Zealand.\n\nHe began his wrestling career, wrestling not as The High Chief, but as Prince Peter Maivia. Athletic, naturally talented and a quick study, Maivia received his original ring training in New Zealand, under the watchful eye of local wrestler/promoter Steve Rickard.\n\nBoth in and out of the ring, Rickard taught the young Samoan a great deal about his new profession, and under his guidance, Maivia developed at an amazing rate. On August 3, 1964, after less than a year in the business, the popular rookie sensation stunned new Zealand's wrestling fanbase by toppling the rugged, experienced Rickard to win the prestigious New Zealand Heavyweight title in Auckland. The title victory was impressive, indeed, however Maivia's reign turned out to be extremely short, and he held the coveted New Zealand title for just three days, dropping the championship back to Steve Rickard in Wellington on August 6, 1964. The point had been made though, and from that period forward, Maivia enjoyed main-event status in the NWA's New Zealand territory.\n\nLater in 1964, Maivia followed up his previous success by winning another very prestigious championship, the NWA Australasian Heavyweight title. Maivia became the new Australasian champion by defeating Kangaroo Kennedy in Auckland, and he would go on to carry the belt for four consecutive years before finally losing his title to Steve Rickard in 1968.\n\nAfter developing his repertoire and ring skills in New Zealand, Maivia slowly began to branch out and take bookings in other (and often times larger) promotions, with success invariably following the popular islander.\n\nDuring his stay in the then called World Wide Wrestling Federation, he was one of its most prominent stars, making numerous appearances on Championship Wrestling. He worked matches with many well known wrestler who would go on to be WWE Hall of Famers, such as Superstar Billy Graham, Ivan Putski and Bob Backlund.\n\nMaivia, also known as the Flying Hawaiian, was of the Ali'i lineage of Malietoa. Maivia's traditional Samoan tattoos, which covered his abdomen and legs, were a symbol of his High Chief status. According to Superstar Billy Graham, they were completed in three days. Maivia's grandson Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson revealed that they were done with traditional Samoan instrumentation: a small hammer, a needle, and ink.\n\nMaivia disapproved of his daughter's relationship with Rocky Johnson because he was a professional wrestler. The duo married despite Maivia's objections. His son, Peter Jr, also wrestled in Hawaii and the west coast after the passing of Peter Sr. sometimes under the name \"Prince Peter Maivia\".\n\nMaivia was considered a \"blood brother\" by Amituanai Anoa'i, the father of the Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika), thus the Anoa'i family regard the Maivia line from him on forward as an extension of their own clan.\n\nMaivia was also in the fifth James Bond film, \"You Only Live Twice\", where he plays a driver who transports a disguised Bond to Osato headquarters. His character also fights Bond, is hit with a sofa, wields a katana, and is put down with a statue. He was the (uncredited) stunt fight co-ordinator for the film.\n\nIn 1981, Maivia was diagnosed with cancer. He died on June 12, 1982. Maivia was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, along with his son-in-law Rocky Johnson, in 2008 by his grandson Dwayne Johnson. The award was accepted on his behalf by his daughter Ata Maivia-Johnson. During his tribute video, WWE chairman Vince McMahon refers to him as a 'tough S.O.B.' and somebody 'you didn't want to mess with' outside the ring, but added he was 'a real wonderful, likable guy'.\nOn October 19, 2008, Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, died.\n\nIn the 2016 Disney animated film, Moana, the character design of Maui was derived from photographs of Peter Maivia, according to interviews with his grandson, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "475090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475090", "title": "Rime table", "text": "Rime table\n\nA rime table or rhyme table () is a Chinese phonological model, tabulating the syllables of the series of rime dictionaries beginning with the \"Qieyun\" (601) by their onsets, rhyme groups, tones and other properties. The method gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of those dictionaries than the previously used \"fǎnqiè\" analysis, but many of its details remain obscure.\nThe phonological system that is implicit in the rime dictionaries and analysed in the rime tables is known as Middle Chinese, and is the traditional starting point for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese.\nSome authors distinguish the two layers as Early and Late Middle Chinese respectively.\n\nThe earliest rime tables are associated with Chinese Buddhist monks, who are believed to have been inspired by the Sanskrit syllable charts in the Siddham script they used to study the language. The oldest extant rime tables are the 12th-century \"Yunjing\" (\"mirror of rhymes\") and \"Qiyin lüe\" (\"summary of the seven sounds\"), which are very similar, and believed to derive from a common prototype. Earlier fragmentary documents describing the analysis have been found at Dunhuang, suggesting that the tradition may date back to the late Tang dynasty.\n\nSome scholars use the French spelling \"rime\", as used by the Swedish linguist Bernhard Karlgren, for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.\n\nThe \"Qieyun\", produced by Lù Fǎyán (陸法言) in 601, was a rime dictionary, serving as a guide to the recitation of literary texts and an aid in the composition of verse.\nIt quickly became popular during the Tang dynasty, leading to a series of revised and expanded editions, the most important of which was the \"Guangyun\" (1008).\nIn these dictionaries, characters were grouped first by the four tones, and then into rhyme groups.\nEach rhyme group was subdivided into groups of homophonous characters, with the pronunciation of each given by a \"fanqie\" formula, a pair of familiar characters indicating the sounds of the initial and final parts of a syllable respectively. The dictionaries typically used several characters for each initial or final.\n\nThe fanqie method of indicating pronunciation made the dictionaries awkward to use.\nThe \"děngyùnxué\" (等韻學 \"study of classified rhymes\") was a more sophisticated analysis of the \"Qieyun\" pronunciations, initially developed by Chinese Buddhist monks who were studying Indian linguistics.\nA tantalizing glimpse of this tradition is offered by fragments from Dunhuang.\nA fragment held by the British Library (Or.8210/S.512) simply lists 30 initial consonants.\nAnother document includes three fragments attributed to a monk called Shǒuwēn (守温), who may have lived as early as the 9th century.\nThese fragments do not contain tables, but describe the phonological analysis that underlies them.\n\nThe oldest known rhyme tables are a version of the \"Yunjing\" published with prefaces dated 1161 and 1203, and the \"Qiyin lüe\", which was included in the 1161 encyclopedia \"Tongzhi\".\nThe two are very similar, and are believed to be derived from a single version pre-dating the Song dynasty.\nThe tables were accompanied by a body of teachings known as \"mēnfǎ\" (門法 \"school precepts\"), including rules for placing fanqie spellings that did not conform to the system within the tables.\n\nLater rhyme tables were more elaborate.\nThe \"Sìshēng děngzǐ\" (四聲等子) was probably created during the Northern Song, and explicitly introduced broad rhyme classes (\"shè\" 攝), which were previously implicit in the ordering of the tables.\nThe preface of the \"Qièyùn zhĭzhǎngtú\" (切韻指掌圖) is dated 1203, in the Southern Song.\nIn this work the tables are restructured with separate columns for each of the 36 initials.\nThe \"Jīng shǐ zhèng yīn Qièyùn zhǐnán\" (經史正音切韻指南), produced by Liú Jiàn (劉鑑) in 1336, was the basis for one of the two sets of rime tables at the front of the Kangxi dictionary.\n\nThe \"Yunjing\" was lost in China for several centuries.\nThe \"Qieyun zhizhangtu\", incorrectly attributed to the 11th century scholar Sima Guang, was believed to be the oldest of the rime tables, and was used in the earliest reconstruction efforts.\nHowever, in the 1880s several versions of the \"Yunjing\" were discovered in Japan.\nComparison with the \"Qiyin lüe\" showed that they were based on a common model, of which the other rime tables were later refinements.\nAll recent reconstruction work has been based on the \"Yunjing\".\nThe \"Fù Sòng Yǒnglù\" (覆宋永禄) edition of 1564 is considered the most reliable, and is the basis of all reproductions in circulation.\n\nIn the medieval rime dictionaries, characters were organized into rhyme groups (\"yùn\" 韵), with 193 groups in the \"Qieyun\", growing to 206 in the \"Guangyun\".\nThe order of the rhyme groups within each tone implies a correspondence between rhyme groups across the four tones.\nThus for each rhyme group with an -m, -n or -ng coda in the level tone there are typically corresponding rhyme groups with the same coda in the rising and departing tones, and a corresponding rhyme group in the entering tone with a -p, -t or -k coda respectively.\nIn contrast, syllables with vocalic codas typically had corresponding rhyme groups only in the level, rising and departing tones.\nThere were also four departing tone rhyme groups with -j codas that had no counterparts in the other tones.\n\nThe rime tables were solely concerned with the pronunciation of syllables of these rime dictionaries, and do not contain dictionary-like material such as definitions.\nSimilarly, where a group of characters are recorded as homophones in the rime dictionaries, typically only one will occur in a rime table.\nA rime table book presents these distinct syllables in a number of tabular charts, each devoted to one or more sets of parallel rhyme groups across the tones.\n\nThe preface to \"Qieyun\" indicates that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations from the late Northern and Southern dynasties period.\nMost linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions it recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere.\nThe rime tables were compiled centuries later in the time of a new standard, and many of the distinctions in the \"Qieyun\" would have been meaningless to the compilers.\nEdwin Pulleyblank has argued that the tables contain enough evidence to reconstruct the speech of that later period. He calls this language Late Middle Chinese (LMC) in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the \"Qieyun\", and argues that it was the standard speech of the imperial capital Chang'an in the late Tang dynasty. His reconstruction accounts for most of the distinctions in modern varieties of Chinese (except Min), as well as layers of Chinese loanwords, such as the Kan-on layer of Sino-Japanese vocabulary.\n\nEach chart of the \"Yunjing\" is labelled as either \"open\" (\"kāi\" 開) or \"closed\" (\"hé\" 合).\nThe corresponding terms in the \"Qiyin lüe\" are \"heavy\" (\"zhòng\" 重) and \"light\" (\"qīng\" 輕).\nThe open/closed distinction is interpreted to indicate the absence or presence of lip rounding (often transcribed as -w- or -u-).\nSome \"Guangyun\" rhyme groups include syllables of both kinds, and thus span two charts, while others are purely \"open\" or \"closed\", and thus fit within one chart.\nCharts are grouped together in broad rhyme classes (\"shè\" ), each characterized as either \"inner\" (\"nèi\" ) or \"outer\" (\"wài\" ), thought to be related to vowel heights, contrasting close vowels and open vowels respectively.\n\nFor example, the first of the 43 charts of the \"Yùnjìng\" is shown below (the Arabic numerals are modern annotations):\n\nThe five big characters on the right-hand side read \"Nèi zhuǎn dìyī kāi\" (內轉第一開). In the \"Yùnjìng\", each chart is called a \"zhuǎn\" (lit. \"turn\"). The characters indicate that the chart is the first (第一) one in the book, and that the syllables of this chart are \"inner\" (內) and \"open\" (開).\n\nThe columns of each table classify syllables according to their initial consonant (\"shēngmǔ\" 聲母 lit. \"sound mother\"), with syllables beginning with a vowel considered to have a \"zero initial\". Initials are classified according to\nThe order of the places and manners roughly match that of Sanskrit, providing further evidence of inspiration from Indian phonology.\n\nEach table had 16 rows, with a group of four rows for each of the four tones of the \"Qieyun\".\nThe above chart covers four parallel \"Guangyun\" rhyme groups, the level-toned 東 \"dōng\", the rising-toned 董 \"dǒng\", the departing-toned 送 \"sòng\", and the entering-toned 屋 \"wū\" (which in Middle Chinese ended in -k, the entering tone counterpart of -ng).\n\nWithin each tone group are four rows known as \"děng\" (等 \"class\", \"grade\" or \"group\"), which Bernhard Karlgren translated as \"divisions\" while other linguists prefer \"grades\".\nThey are usually denoted by Roman numerals I to IV.\nTheir meaning remains the most controversial aspect of rime table phonology, but is believed to indicate palatalization (transcribed as the presence or absence of -j- or -i-), retroflex features, phonation, vowel quality (high vs. low or front vs. back) or some combination of these.\nOther scholars view them not as phonetic categories but formal devices exploiting distributional patterns in the \"Qieyun\" to achieve a compact presentation.\n\nThe symbol ○ indicates that that particular syllable does not occur.\n\nBernard Karlgren noticed that classes of finals from the rime dictionaries were placed in different rows of the rime tables.\nAs three classes of final occurred in the first, second and fourth rows respectively, he named them finals of divisions I, II and IV.\nThe remaining finals he called \"division-III finals\" because they occurred in the third row of the tables.\nSome of these (the \"pure\" division-III finals) occurred only in that row, while others (the \"mixed\" finals) could also occur in the second or fourth rows with some initials.\n\nLater workers noted that in the so-called \"chongniu\" rhyme groups, 支 \"zhī\", 脂 \"zhī\", 祭 \"jì\", 宵 \"xiāo\", 鹽 \"yán\", 侵 \"qīn\", 仙 \"xiān\" and 真 \"zhēn\", a consistent distinction within each rhyme group in the rime books is reflected in the rime tables by dividing the rhyme group between rows III and IV, often in adjacent tables.\nLi Rong, in a systematic comparison of the rhyme tables with a recently discovered early edition of the \"Qieyun\", identified seven classes of finals.\nThe table below lists the combinations of initial and final classes that occur in the \"Qieyun\", with the row of the rime tables in which each combination was placed:\nIn addition, division-II and division-IV finals occur only in \"outer\" \"shè\".\n\nThis distribution is the foundation of the compact tabular presentation of rime dictionary syllables.\nFor example, the dental and retroflex stop initials are combined in a single group in a rime table, with the rows distinguishing the different \"Qieyun\" initials, and the three groups of sibilant initials are similarly combined.\nIn a similar fashion different finals may occupy different rows of the same chart.\n\nThe \"Guangyun\" rhyme groups (here illustrated in the level tone, except where a group occurs only in the departing tone) are distributed across the 43 charts of the \"Yunjing\" and \"Qiyin lüe\" as follows:\n\nIn some cases, the \"Guangyun\" already reflected the open/closed distinction with separate rhyme groups, while in others they were included in the same group.\n\nThe earliest documentary records of the rime table tradition, the Dunhuang fragments, contain lists of 30 initials, each named after an exemplary character.\nThis was later expanded to a standard set of 36 in the preface of the \"Yunjing\", the major addition being a series of labiodental fricatives split from the labial series:\n\nTables of the \"Yunjing\" have only 23 columns, with one group of columns each for labials, coronals and sibilants, with the different types placed in different rows of the tables.\nSome later tables such as the \"Qieyun zhizhangtu\" have 36 columns, one for each of the 36 initials.\n\nThe 36 initials were so influential that it was not until 1842 that it was discovered (by Chen Li) that the initials of the \"Qieyun\" were slightly different.\n\nFootnotes\nWorks cited\n"}

The building was constructed in 1965, funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, a Hungarian-Jewish philanthropist. The building was designed by Armand Phillip Bartos, Frederick John Kiesler and Gezer Heller over a period of seven years.\n\nThe shrine is built as a white dome, covering a structure placed two-thirds below the ground, that is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. According to one interpretation, the colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness; the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness\n\nAs the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it \"rests\" from exposure.\n\nThe shrine houses the Isaiah scroll, dating from the second century BCE, the most intact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Aleppo Codex, dating from the 10th century CE, the oldest existing Hebrew Bible.\n\nIn 2013, the Bank of Israel released an Israeli bullion coin dedicated to the Shrine of the Book.\n\n\n\n"}

The Latin word \"affinis\" can be translated as \"closely related to\", or \"akin to\".\n\nAn author who inserts \"n.sp.,\" or \"sp. nov., aff\" before a species name thereby states the opinion that the specimen is a new, previously undescribed species, but that there may not (yet) be enough information to complete a formal description. To use aff. alone, implies that the specimen differs suggestively from the holotype but that further progress is necessary to confirm that it is a novel species.\n\nAn example would be: a gastropod shell listed as \"Lucapina\" aff. \"aegis\" would mean that this shell somewhat resembles the shell of \"Lucapina aegis\", but is thought more likely to be another species, either closely related to, or closely resembling \"Lucapina aegis\". In a suitable context it also may suggest the possibility that the shell belongs to a species that has not yet been described.\n\nThe use of aff. is similar to other indicators of open nomenclature such as cf., sp., or ?, but the latter indicate that the species is \"uncertain\" rather than undescribed.\n\n"}
