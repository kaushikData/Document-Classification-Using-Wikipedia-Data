In the first, is the Author’s best advice to them what to do, before they bring in a Billa vera in cases of Witchcraft, with a Christian Direction to such as are too much given upon every cross to think themselves bewitched. In the Second, is a Treatise touching Witches good and bad, how they may be known, evicted, condemned, with many particulars tending thereunto was first published in 1627 and written by a puritan clergyman named Richard Bernard. The work is a collection of two dissertations on the legal aspects of witchcraft and how those participating in the trials may be deceived by deceit and counterfeited accounts but further elaborates on how many natural ills can be taken as bewitchment. Bernard gives advice on how to determine an actual account of witchcraft from that of a false accusation and even more, the signs one should seek to determine if a man is truly bewitched or suffering from a natural sickness. The dissertation was written to help reform the laws on witchcraft and also to educate the men commissioned to seek out, investigate and prosecute instances of witchcraft, and as a guide to witchfinding with a combination of scientific analysis and theological understanding that was not previously used. Previously, the Justices of Peace did not always expect direct evidence, and seeing that the works of witched were works of darkness, there were often no witnesses present with them to accuse them.\n\nThe first book covers a wide range of topics but focuses on some key points. The first is the scientific aspect to witchcraft; that strange diseases can happen to both men and animals that are neither inflicted by devils or witches. There were many who were falsely accused of witchcraft based on their natural ailments, but it was Richard Bernard's belief that men were also able to counterfeit various claims of bewitchment for their own financial, social or political purpose and that if the devil were involved, he could work without the consent or association of a witch. \n\nThe second book delves into the study of demonology and the theology of witchcraft, and works to prove through theological study what witches are real and how a witch is said to enlist a spirit to conduct mischief and bewitch others. Bernard explains the behavioral characteristics of an individual most likely to become a witch and how the Devil solicits an individual and prepares them to partake in the practices of witchcraft and deceit. Bernard felt that a person who goes to a witch, wizard, or blesser for assistance is just as guilty of witchcraft in the biblical perspective. There are also elaborations on the following topics:\n\n\n"}

Although she wrote six romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott, her reputation rests on the 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections that she wrote under her own name, which have sold over two billion copies—an amount only surpassed by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare. Her works contain several regular characters with whom the public became familiar, including Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Parker Pyne and Harley Quin. Christie wrote more Poirot stories than any of the others, even though she thought the character to be \"rather insufferable\". Following the publication of the 1975 novel \"Curtain\", Poirot's obituary appeared on the front page of \"The New York Times\". The literary historian Howard Haycraft considered that \"few fictional sleuths can surpass the amazing little Belgian—with his waxed moustache and egg-shaped head, his inflated confidence in the infallibility of his 'little grey cells', his murderous attacks on the English language—either for individuality or ingenuity.\"\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Ashfield, Torquay, Devon. She met her future husband just before the First World War; after he was sent to the Western Front, she worked with the Voluntary Aid Detachment, and in the chemist dispensary, giving her a working background knowledge of medicines and poisons. Christie's writing career began during the war after she was challenged by her sister to write a detective story; she produced \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\", which was turned down by two publishers before it was eventually published in 1920. Following the limited success of the novel, she continued to write and steadily built up a fan base for what \"Contemporary Authors\" calls \"her unfailingly clever plots\". She went on to write over a hundred works, including further novels, short stories, plays, poetry, and two autobiographies. Aside from works under her own name, she wrote six romantic novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. \n\nOne of Christie's plays, \"The Mousetrap\", opened in West End theatre in 1952 and, as at March 2018, was still running; in 2009 the London run exceeded 25,000 performances. In September 2015 a public vote identified \"And Then There Were None\"—originally published in 1939 under the name \"Ten Little Niggers\"—as the public's favourite Christie novel; the book was the writer's favourite, and the one she found most difficult to write.\n\nIn September 1930 Christie married the archaeologist Max Mallowan, whom she met when she visited the excavations at Ur in Mesopotamia. The pair travelled frequently on expeditions, where Christie would help with the finds, and she used the experiences as a basis for her plots, including \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (1934), \"Murder in Mesopotamia\" (1936) and \"Death on the Nile\" (1937). She also wrote the autobiographical travel book \"Come, Tell Me How You Live\" (1946), which described their life in Syria; her biographer, Janet Morgan, reports that \"archaeologists have celebrated ... [Christie's] contribution to Near Eastern exploration\". Christie died in January 1976, her reputation as a crime novelist high. Her biographer, H. R. F. Keating, describes Christie as \"a towering figure in the history of crime literature\", while her obituarist in \"The Times\" considers that, following the death of Dorothy L. Sayers in 1957, Christie was \"the undoubted queen of her profession\".\n\nInitially in chronological order by UK publication date, even when the book was published first in the US or serialised in a magazine in advance of publication in book form.\n\nMany of Christie's stories first appeared in journals, newspapers and magazines.

The Wikipedia Bradshaw's Guide page also lists a number of other countries that issued compiled timetables, borrowing the Bradshaw name from the British model: France, Germany and Austria, India, Italy, Syria and Turkey. In Australia two Bradshaw's were issued: the short-lived Bradshaw's New South Wales postal & road guide which was published for a short time in the 1870s and, possibly, a little earlier; and Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria, which had an 86-year life, from 1856 to 1942.\n\nBradshaw’s Railway and General Guide to Victoria was first published in May 1856. It appropriated the name of the famed British Bradshaw’s Railway Guide. It was first published less than two years after the opening of Victoria's (and Australia's) first railway from Melbourne to Sandridge, but a number of other railways were in the course of construction, and the timetables were included as soon as the particular line opened. Nevertheless, the early editions of Bradshaw's contained numerous coach timetables and other miscellaneous material.\n\nJuly 1859 is an example of an early issue; a time when Melbourne's railways were at an embryonic stage. The privately-owned Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, and the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company were all operating, and the government-owned Victorian Railways had just built their first lines to Williamstown and Sunbury. Railway information only occupied eight of the 124 pages. The remainder of the Guide provided comprehensive detail of all manner of institutions in what was a very fast-growing colony, mainly because of the Victorian gold rush. Information is given about the Parliament, Government, courts, municipal councils, the electric telegraph, banks, insurance companies, churches, Masonic lodges, postal charges and arrangements, and country localities. There were also a number of advertisements. The printing is of a high standard for the times.\n\nThe Victorian Bradshaw was published monthly and was available from newsagents throughout the state. In latter years, the railway timetable section was based on information supplied by Victorian Railways but sometimes the information was a little behind that in the V.R.s own public timetables, usually published twice-yearly, and available from train stations across the state. However, as we've already seen, Bradshaw's provided much more than railway timetables. The November 1936 edition also contained: cab fares; calendars; information on cities, towns, boroughs, shires, including population; a comprehensive Commonwealth of Australia section; list of consuls; directions for making a will; fish, minimum lengths of; gardening notes; a comprehensive Government of Victoria section; a post office and telegraph section, including rates; railway cloak room rates, fares, parcels rates, etc.; stamp duties; standard time; tides at Williamstown; a comprehensive tramway section covering government and private tramways, cable and electric; voter's qualifications.\n\nBy 1890 the layout of Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria was basically as it was in 1936 (see above) and it retained a similar layout until it ceased publication in 1942. By 1890 about 70% of Bradshaw was railway timetables, about 25% Postal arrangements, and the balance a miscellaneous collection of sometimes odd information about Victoria (as listed above).\n\nWhen Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria commenced publication, its railway section was a compiled timetable covering the services of all Victorian railways, public and privately owned. In that respect it was similar to other Bradshaw's Guide around the world. However, within a few decades, the Victorian Railways had taken over the vast majority of railways in the state, and by the 1920s the shire-owned Kerang-Koondrook Tramway was the only privately owned railway in Victoria. Its timetable was published by Bradshaw, and although it wasn't a V.R. line, its services were also shown in V.R. timetables.\n\nUntil December 1896 Bradshaw's was published by Wilson, Mackinnon and Fairfax. Much of the artwork was provided by engraver Fredrick Grosse. From January 1897 and until the last edition, the publishing and printing of Bradshaw's was in the hands of Mr Bill Stillwell who, at various stages operated as Stillwell & Knight, Stillwell & Stephens. Stillwell & Co.\n\nAs the Victorian Railways grew, the size of Bradshaw’s did not increase. Rather, information other than that for the railways and postal services was dropped. The other striking characteristic of Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria over the years was that the quality of the printing and layout did not improve - it deteriorated. By the late nineteenth century, Bradshaw’s had a poor appearance.\n\nUnlike V.R. timetables which showed the various tables in geographical order, Bradshaw's was geographically erratic. Smaller tables were placed under larger ones where there was an appropriate space and there was no attempt at any order. Generally, mainlines appeared at the beginning, but then logic disappears. Branch lines appeared in random order, with no regard to geography. Country and suburban tables are mixed up. Sometimes the printing went right up to the edge of the page, and sometimes even a small portion of a table was missing.\n\nBradshaw's Guide to Victoria ceased publication in August 1942.\n\nIn latter years the V.R. appeared to perceive Bradshaw's as competition to their own public timetables and were therefore reluctant to hand over timetable changes to Bradshaw's, and when they did it was usually after the same information had appeared in their own publications. This is strongly believed to be the main reason for Stillwell & Co stopping production.\n\nIn its final years, 1940–42, the overwhelming impression is of a poor, cheaply produced publication. One of the first items in these editions is a list of consuls accredited in Victoria. This still listed the consuls for Germany, Japan, Austria, Czechoslovakia and other countries with which Australia had either been at war for a number of years or whose country had disappeared even earlier in the lead-up to war! Indeed, the impression is that the publishers really didn’t care any more. The arrangement of the timetables is even more higgledy-piggledy than before; they are in no particular order as to geography and country and suburban tables are still mixed up together. Some suburban lines have services on different days appearing in different parts of the book. Some railway timetables are placed, for no apparent reason, well away from the rest of the railway section; after the postal information.\n\nNevertheless, a study of the railway timetables over these last three years shows that attempts were made to keep these tables up-to-date. The timetables show, in general, a decline in the standard of VR passenger service as war priorities took hold.\n\nIn 1940 the tramway summary timetables still reflected the separate pre-1920 suburban Tramway Trusts! However, between 1940 and 1941, the publisher did take the trouble to redesign the tramway summary timetables. On the other hand, between 1941 and 1942, the railway country and metropolitan foldout maps disappeared. Presumably this was a cost-saving measure.\n\nThe non-railway and non-postal information that survived to this period was a very odd mixture: lists of Federal and State Members of Parliament, consuls in Victoria, gardening notes (presumably recycled each year), and Victorian game hunting laws.\n\nThe final Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria was published in August 1942. There was a large print run of the last edition, and it was available from many newsagents for some years after it was published. In December 1941, the Victorian Railways had published their last public timetable, primarily because of staff shortages caused by World War II but also continuing into the post-war period. There was not another VR timetable until 1954. Therefore, the last edition of Bradshaw's, albeit out of date, was the only thing that the public had to refer to. Within nine months Victoria went from having two regular Railway public timetables to none.\n\nDespite its disreputable and off-putting appearance Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria is a valuable source of historical timetable information. The railway information was usually kept up-to-date, even when the rest of the information was not. However, for the best information, it is of course preferable to go the official Victorian Railways timetables, but Bradshaw’s is still useful: firstly, its more frequent publication gave greater topicality; and secondly, it is more widely available in reference libraries than VR timetables.\n\n"}

{"id": "3185540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3185540", "title": "Cataloging", "text": "Cataloging\n\nIn library and information science, cataloging (or cataloguing) is the process of creating metadata representing information resources, such as books, sound recordings, moving images, etc. Cataloging provides information such as creator names, titles, and subject terms that describe resources, typically through the creation of bibliographic records. The records serve as surrogates for the stored information resources. Since the 1970s these metadata are in machine-readable form and are indexed by information retrieval tools, such as bibliographic databases or search engines. While typically the cataloging process results in the production of library catalogs, it also produces other types of discovery tools for documents and collections.\n\nBibliographic control provides the philosophical basis of cataloging, defining the rules for sufficiently describing information resources to enable users to find and select the most appropriate resource. A cataloger is an individual responsible for the processes of description, subject analysis, classification, and authority control of library materials. Catalogers serve as the \"foundation of all library service, as they are the ones who organize information in such a way as to make it easily accessible\".\n\nRonald Hagler identified six functions of bibliographic control.\n\nWhile the organization of information has been going on since antiquity, bibliographic control as we know it today is a more recent invention. Ancient civilizations recorded lists of books onto tablets and libraries in the Middle Ages kept records of their holdings. With the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, multiple copies of a single book could be produced quickly. Johann Tritheim, a German librarian, was the first to create a bibliography in chronological order with an alphabetical author index. Konrad Gesner followed in his footsteps in the next century as he published an author bibliography and subject index. He added to his bibliography an alphabetical list of authors with inverted names, which was a new practice. He also included references to variant spellings of author's names, a precursor to authority control. Andrew Maunsell further revolutionized bibliographic control by suggesting that a book should be findable based on the author's last name, the subject of the book, and the translator. In the 17th century Sir Thomas Bodley was interested in a catalog arranged alphabetically by author's last name as well as subject entries. In 1697, Frederic Rostgaard called for subject arrangement that was subdivided by both chronology and by size (whereas in the past titles were arranged by their size only), as well as an index of subjects and authors by last name and for word order in titles to be preserved based on the title page.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, France's government was the first to put out a national code containing instructions for cataloging library collections. At the British Museum Library Anthony Panizzi created his \"Ninety-One Cataloging Rules\" (1841), which essentially served as the basis for cataloging rules of the 19th and 20th centuries. Charles C. Jewett applied Panizzi's \"91 Rules\" at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\"Descriptive cataloging\" is a well-established concept in the tradition of library cataloging in which a distinction is made between descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging, each applying a set of standards, different qualifications and often also different kinds of professionals. In the tradition of documentation and information science (e.g., by commercial bibliographical databases) the concept document representation (also as verb: document representing) have mostly been used to cover both \"descriptive\" and \"subject\" representation. Descriptive cataloging has been defined as \"the part of cataloging concerned with describing the physical details of a book, such as the form and choice of entries and the title page transcription.\"\n\nSubject cataloging may take the form of classification or (subject) indexing. Classification involves the assignment of a given document to a class in a classification system (such as Dewey Decimal Classification or the Library of Congress Subject Headings). Indexing is the assignment of characterizing labels to the documents represented in a record.\n\nClassification typically uses a controlled vocabulary, while indexing may use a controlled vocabulary, free terms, or both.\nLibraries have made use of catalogs in some form since ancient times. The library of Ninevah had the first classification system. It is located in present-day Iraq. The first known cataloging occurred with ancient clay tablets. They had marks on each side of the tablet. There is evidence of catalogs dating back to approximately 310/05-240 B.C. in Sumer. The Library of Alexandria is reported to have had at least a partial catalog consisting of a listing by Callimachus of the Greek literature called “Pinakes”, however was have very little and poor evidence about “Pinakes.” Pinakes means list. There were originally 825 fragments of Callimachus’ “Pinakes,” but only 25 of them have survived. The Chinese Imperial Library of the Han Dynasty of the 3rd century A.D. had a catalog listing nearly 30,000 items, each item similar in extent of its content to a Western scroll. The first catalogs in the Islamic world, around the 11th century, were lists of books donated to libraries by persons in the community. These lists were ordered by donor, not by bibliographic information, but they provided a record of the library's inventory.\n\nMany early and medieval libraries in Europe were associated with religious institutions and orders, including the Papal library in Rome. The first Vatican Library catalog is from the late 14th century. These catalogs generally used a topical arrangement that reflected the topical arrangement of the books themselves. The Vatican Library published 'rules for the catalog of printed books' in 1939. These rules were then translated to English and published in the US in 1949. Meanwhile, the Sorbonne library in Paris had accumulated more than one thousand books, and in 1290 their catalog pioneered the use of the alphabet as an organizing tool.\n\nIt was the growth in libraries after the invention of moveable-type printing and the widespread availability of paper that created the necessity for a catalog that organized the library's materials so that they could be found through the catalog rather than \"by walking around.\" By the 17th century libraries became seen as collections of universal knowledge. Two 17th century authors, Gabriel Naudé, in France, and John Dury, in Scotland, both developed theories of systematic organization of libraries. The development of principles and rules that would guide the librarian in the creation of catalogs followed. The history of cataloging begins at this point.\n\nIn ancient times in the orient the title was used to identify the work. Since the renaissance the author has been the main source of identification.\n\nCataloging rules have been defined to allow for consistent cataloging of various library materials across several persons of a cataloging team and across time.\n\nThe English-speaking libraries have shared cataloging standards since the early 1800s. The first such standard is attributed to Anthony Panizzi, the Keeper of the Printed Books of the British Museum Library. His 91 rules, published in 1841, formed the basis for cataloging standards for over 150 years.\n\nSubsequent work in the 19th century was done by Charles Coffin Jewett, head of the Smithsonian library, which at the time was positioned to become the national library of the United States. Jewett used stereotype plates to produce the library's catalog in book form, and proposed the sharing of cataloging among libraries. His rules were published in 1853. A disagreement with the head Smithsonian secretary caused Jewett to be dismissed from his position but soon after he accepted a position with the Boston Public Library. He was tasked with purchasing books as well as arranging them. Jewett earned the role of director of the Boston Public Library in 1858; during this time the \"Index to the Catalogue of a Portion of the Public Library of the City of Boston Arranged in its Lower Hall\" was published. The article included new cataloging information alongside many of the Smithsonian cataloging rules that Jewett created. His systems became a model for other libraries as he pushed for alphabetical card catalogs.\n\nJewett was followed by Charles Ammi Cutter, an American librarian whose \"Rules for a Dictionary Catalog\" were published in 1876. Cutter championed the concept of \"ease of use\" for library patrons.\n\nIn the 20th century, library cataloging was forced to address new formats for materials, including sound recordings, movies, and photographs. Seymour Lubetzky, once an employee of the Library of Congress and later a professor at UCLA, wrote a critique of the 1949 ALA rules for entry, \"Cataloging Rules and Principles: A Critique of the ALA Rules for Entry and a Proposed Design for the Revision\". Lubetzky's writings revealed the weaknesses in the existing rules, and spoke to the need for preparing a set of standards for a more complete and succinct code. As changes in culture over time would necessitate an ever-increasing/changing list of rules, Lubetzky \"helped remedy the situation by advocating the concept of cataloging according to 'basic principles,' in place of a rule for each case that might arise.\" He was tasked to do extensive studies of the current cataloging rules over the time period from 1946-1969. His analyses shaped the subsequent cataloging rules.\n\nThe published American and Anglo-American cataloging rules in the 20th century were:\n\nThe 21st century brought renewed thinking about library cataloging, in great part based on the increase in the number of digital formats, but also because of a new consciousness of the nature of the \"Work\" in the bibliographic context, often attributed to the principles developed by Lubetzky.\nThis was also supported by the work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), which emphasized the role of the work in the bibliographic context. FRBR created a tiered view of the bibliographic entity from Item, Manifestation, Expression, to Work. Item refers to the physical form of the book. Manifestation refers to the publication. Expression meaning the translation of the book from other languages. Work refers to the content and ideas of the book. This view was incorporated into the cataloging rules subsequent to AACR2-R, known as Resource Description and Access (RDA).\n\nThe Bodleian Library at Oxford University developed its cataloging code in 1674. The code emphasized authorship, and books by the same author were listed together in the catalog.\n\nWe can trace the origins of modern library cataloging practice back to the 1830s and Anthony Panizzi's 91 rules. Panizzi's singular insight was that a large catalog needed consistency in its entries if it was to serve the user. The first major English-language cataloguing code was that developed by Sir Anthony Panizzi for the British Museum catalogue. Panizzi's 91 rules were approved by the British Museum in 1839, and published in 1841. The British Museum rules were revised up until 1936. The library departments of the British Museum became part of the new British Library in 1973.\n\nThe Prussian government set standard rules for all of its libraries in 1899. The rules were based on those of the University Library at Breslau by Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko. These were adopted throughout Germany, Prussia and Austria.\n\nThe Prussian Instructions was a standardized system of cataloging authorized in 1908. In the Prussian Instructions, titles in literature are arranged grammatically not mechanically and literature is entered under its title.\n\nAfter the adoption of the Paris Principles (cataloging) in 1961, Germany developed the (RAK) in 1977. The goal of the Paris Principles was to serve as a basis for international standardization in cataloguing. Most of the cataloguing codes that were developed worldwide since that time have followed the Principles.\n\nCataloging codes prescribe which information about a bibliographic item is included in the entry and how this information is presented for the user; It may also aid to sort the entries in printing (parts of) the catalog.\n\nCurrently, most cataloging codes are similar to, or even based on, the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), a set of rules produced by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to describe a wide range of library materials. These rules organize the bibliographic description of an item in the following eight areas: title and statement of responsibility (author or editor), edition, material specific details (for example, the scale of a map), publication and distribution, physical description (for example, number of pages), series, notes, and standard number (ISBN). There is an initiative called the Bibliographic Framework (Bibframe) that is \"an initiative to evolve bibliographic description standards to a linked data model, in order to make bibliographic information more useful both within and outside the library community.\" The most commonly used cataloging code in the English-speaking world was the \"Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition\" (AACR2). AACR2 provides rules for \"descriptive cataloging\" only and does not touch upon \"subject cataloging\". AACR2 has been translated into many languages, for use around the world. The German-speaking world uses the \"Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung\" (RAK), also based on ISBD. The Library of Congress implemented the transition to RDA from AACR2 in March 2013.\n\nIn subject databases such as Chemical Abstracts, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, the Common Communication Format (CCF) is meant to serve as a baseline standard. Different standards prevail in archives and museums, such as CIDOC-CRM. Resource Description and Access (RDA) is a recent attempt to make a standard that crosses the domains of cultural heritage institutions.\n\nMost libraries currently use the MARC standards—first piloted from January 1966 to June 1968 —to encode and transport bibliographic data.\nThese standards have seen critiques in recent years for being old, unique to the library community, and difficult to work with computationally. The Library of Congress is currently developing BIBFRAME, an RDA schema for expressing bibliographic data. BIBFRAME is being revised and piloted currently by the Library of Congress, but still is not available to the public. It will first be available to vendors to try out, but afterwards there will be a hybrid form of the system (MARC and BIBFRAME) until the data can be fully translated.\n\nLibrary digital collections often use simpler digital formats to store their metadata. XML-based schemata, particularly Dublin Core and MODS, are typical for bibliographic data about these collections.\n\nLibrary items that are written in a foreign script are, in some cases, transliterated to the script of the catalog. In the United States and some other countries, catalogers typically use the ALA-LC romanization tables for this work. If this is not done, there would need to be separate catalogs for each script.\n\nFerris maintains that catalogers, in using their judgment and specialized viewpoint, uphold the integrity of the catalog and also provide \"added value\" to the process of bibliographic control, resulting in added findability for a library's user community.\nThis added value also has the power to harm, resulting in the denial of access to information.\nMistakes and biases in cataloging records can \"stigmatize groups of people with inaccurate or demeaning labels, and create the impression that certain points of view are more normal than others\".\n\nSocial responsibility in cataloging is the \"fair and equitable access to relevant, appropriate, accurate, and uncensored information in a timely manner and free of bias\".\nIn order to act ethically and in a socially responsible manner, catalogers should be aware of how their judgments benefit or harm findability. They should be careful to not misuse or misrepresent information through inaccurate or minimal-level cataloging and to not purposely or inadvertently censor information.\n\nBair states that it is the professional obligation of catalogers to supply thorough, accurate, high-quality surrogate records for databases and that catalogers also have an ethical obligation to \"contribute to the fair and equitable access to information.\" Bair recommends that catalogers \"actively participate in the development, reform, and fair application of cataloging rules, standards, and classifications, as well as information-storage and retrieval systems\". As stated by Knowlton, access points \"should be what a particular type of library patron would be most likely to search under -- regardless of the notion of universal bibliographic control.\"\n\nA formal code of ethics for catalogers does not exist, and thus catalogers often follow library or departmental policy to resolve conflicts in cataloging. While the American Library Association created a \"Code of Ethics\", Ferris notes that it has been criticized for being too general to encompass the special skills that set catalogers apart from other library and information professionals. As stated by Tavani, a code of ethics for catalogers can \"inspire, guide, educate, and discipline\" (as cited in Bair, 2005, p. 22). Bair suggests that an effective code of ethics for catalogers should be aspirational and also \"discuss specific conduct and actions in order to serve as a guide in actual situations\". Bair has also laid out the beginnings for a formal code of cataloging ethics in \"Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging.\"\n\nSanford Berman, former Head Cataloger of the Hennepin County Library in Minnetonka, Minnesota, has been a leading critic of biased headings in the Library of Congress Subject Headings. Berman's 1971 publication \"Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People\" (\"P&A\") has sparked the movement to correct biased subject headings. In \"P&A\", Berman listed 225 headings with proposed alterations, additions, or deletions and cross-references to \"more accurately reflect the language used in addressing these topics, to rectify errors of bias, and to better guide librarians and readers to material of interest\". Berman is well known for his \"care packages,\" mailings containing clippings and other materials in support of changes to subject headings and against racism, sexism, homophobia, and governmental secrecy, among other areas for concern.\n\nIn \"Three Decades Since \"Prejudices and Antipathies\": A Study of Changes in the Library of Congress Subject Headings,\" Knowlton examines ways in which the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has changed by compiling a table of changes described in \"P&A\", followed by the current status of headings in question. Knowlton states that his intent for this table is to \"show how many of Berman’s proposed changes have been implemented\" and \"which areas of bias are still prevalent in LCSH.\" In the discussion of Knowlton's findings, it is revealed that of the 225 headings suggested for change by Berman, only 88 (39%) have been changed exactly or very closely to his suggestions (p. 127). Another 54 (24%) of headings have been changed but only partially resolve Berman's objections, and \"which may leave other objectionable wording intact or introduce a different shade of bias.\" 80 (36%) headings were not changed at all according to Berman's suggestions.\n\nBuilding on Berman's critique of cataloging practices, queer theorists in library and information science such as Emily Drabinski and Amber Billey have written about the implications of creating stable categorizations for gender identities. Utilizing queer theory in conjunction with library classification and cataloging requires perspectives that can present both ethically and politically sound viewpoints that support marginalized persons such as women, people of color, or members of the LGBTQ+ community. This work has resulted in the modification of Rule 9.7, governing how gender is represented in record creation. At the ALA Midwinter meeting in January 2016, the controlled vocabulary for gender in RDA was abolished, allowing catalogers and libraries to describe a person's gender in whatever terms best represent that person.\n\n\n"}

The appointment of a journalist-editor from a major newspaper such as \"Le Point\" as advisor to the President sparked controversy. Asked about the issue of relations between the press and politics in France, the reporter John Vinocur from the \"International Herald Tribune\" responded in an interview by in \"L'Express\" (31 May 2007): \"I think that you exaggerate the complicity of the links that in reality exist in all the democracies of the world.

Dated palaeographically to the 6th-century, the manuscript is written in an uncial hand on purple vellum with silver ink. The codex is preserved at the Albanian National Archives (Nr. 1) in Tirana, Albania. It was formerly possessed by the St. George Church in the town of Berat, Albania, hence the 'Beratinus' appellation.\n\nCodex Beratinus contains only the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark, with several considerable lacunae (Matthew 1:1-6:3, 7:26-8:7, 18:23-19:3, and Mark 14:62-end). The codex contains 190 extant parchment leaves measuring 31.4 × 26.8 cm, or approximately the same size as those of Codex Alexandrinus, and have two columns per page, but the letters are much larger. It is written with 17 lines per page, 8-12 letters per line, in very regular letters, in silver ink. The title and the first line in Mark are written in gold. The writing is continuous in full lines without stichometry. Quotations from the Old Testament are marked with an inverted comma (<).\n\nThe text is divided according to the κεφαλαια (chapters) and according to the Ammonian Sections (smaller than κεφαλαια). On the left margin are inserted the numerals of the κεφαλαια and above the pages are inserted the τιτλοι (titles) of the κεφαλαια. The numerals of the Ammonian sections are given on the left margin, and a references to the Eusebian Canons were added by a later hand in the 8th century. A note in the manuscript states that the loss of the other two Gospels is due to \"the Franks of Champagne\", i.e. some of the Crusaders, who may have seen it while at Patmos, where it was believed formerly to have been.\n\nThe Greek text of the codex is generally of the Byzantine text-type, but it contains the long Western addition after Matthew 20:28, occurring also in Codex Bezae: Aland gave for it the following textual profile: 131, 83, 11, 18.\n\"But seek to increase from that which is small, and to become less from which is greater. When you enter into a house and are summoned to dine, do not sit down at the prominent places, lest perchance a man more honorable than you come in afterwards, and he who invited you come and say to you, \"Go down lower\"; and you shall be ashamed. But if you sit down in the inferior place, and one inferior to you come in, then he that invited you will say to you, \"Go up higher\"; and this will be advantageous for you.\"\nIn , the following interpolation occurs, sharing affinity only with syr:\n\nκαι εξελθον εις υπαντησιν αυτω πολλοι χαιροντες και δοξαζοντες τον θεον περι παντων ων ειδον\n\"And many went out to meet him; all who were seeing [him] round about were rejoicing and glorifying God.\"\nIn Matthew 27:9, in the phrase επληρωθη το ρηθεν δια Ιερεμιου του προφητου (\"fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet\") the word Ιερεμιου (Jeremiah) is omitted, as in Minuscule 33, a, b, syr, syr, and cop.\n\nIn Matthew 27:16 it has additional reading ος δια φονον και στασιν ην βεβλημενοις εις φυλακην (\"who for murder and insurrection had been thrown in prison\").\nAccording to B. H. Streeter, Codex Beratinus is a tertiary witness of the Caesarean text. It is grouped with N, O, Σ, and Uncial 080 to constitute the Purple Uncials. Aland categorized the first four into Category V, and it is certain that they are more Byzantine than anything else. Aland did not categorize Uncial 080.\n\nFormerly it was believed to have been at Patmos. According to Xhevat Lloshi it came from Ballsh. It was held in Berat, Albania from 1356. The text of the codex was published by Pierre Batiffol in 1887. \"During World War II, Hitler learned of it and sought it out. Several monks and priests risked their lives to hide the manuscript.\" Since 1971, it has been preserved at the National Archives of Albania in Tirana.\n\nOscar von Gebhardt designated it by siglum Φ, which is often used in critical editions.\n\nThe Codex Purpureus Beratinus was inscribed on the UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 2005 in recognition of its historical significance. The two Beratinus codices preserved in Albania are very important for the global community and the development of ancient biblical, liturgical and hagiographical literature and are part of the \"seven purple codices”, which were written over a period of 13 centuries, i.e. from the sixth to the eighteenth centuries. The other five “purple codices” are in Italy (two), France (one), England (one), and Greece (one).\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally designed by Frank Denis and Yecheng Fu.\n\nAlthough multiple client and server implementations exist, the protocol was never proposed to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by the way of a Request for Comments (RFC).\n\nDNSCrypt wraps unmodified DNS traffic between a client and a DNS resolver in a cryptographic construction in order to detect forgery. Though it doesn't provide end-to-end security, it protects the local network against man-in-the-middle attacks. \n\nIt also mitigates UDP-based amplification attacks by requiring a question to be at least as large as the corresponding response. Thus, DNSCrypt helps to prevent DNS spoofing. \n\nDNSCrypt can also be used for access control, as done by Comodo in their cDome Shield product.\n\nIn addition to private deployments, the DNSCrypt protocol has been adopted by several public DNS resolvers, the vast majority being members of the OpenNIC network, as well as virtual private network (VPN) services.\n\nOpenDNS (now a part of Cisco) announced the first public DNS service supporting DNSCrypt in December 2011, shortly followed by CloudNS Australia.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, Yandex announced support for the DNSCrypt protocol on their public DNS servers, as well as in their web browser.\n\nLater, Infoblox announced ActiveTrust Cloud, leveraging DNSCrypt to secure DNS communications.\n\nOn October, 2016, AdGuard added DNSCrypt to their DNS filtering module so that users could move from their ISPs to custom or AdGuard's own DNS servers for online privacy and ad blocking.\n\nQuad9 public DNS resolver service run by the not-for-profit organization contributed by IBM, Packet Clearing House, and Global Cyber Alliance announced support for DNSCrypt in September 2018.\n\nOther servers that support secure protocol are mentioned in the DNSCrypt creators’ list.\n\nDNSCrypt can be used either over UDP or over TCP. In both cases, its default port is 443, even though the protocol radically differs from HTTPS.\n\nInstead of relying on trusted certificate authorities commonly found in web browsers, the client has to explicitly trust the public signing key of the chosen provider.\n\nThis public key is used to verify a set of certificates, retrieved using conventional DNS queries.\nThese certificates contain short-term public keys used for key exchange, as well as an identifier of the cipher suite to use.\nClients are encouraged to generate a new key for every query, while servers are encouraged to rotate short-term key pairs every 24 hours.\n\nQueries and responses are encrypted using the same algorithm and padded to a multiple of 64 bytes in order to avoid leaking packet sizes. \nOver UDP, when a response would be larger than the question leading to it, a server can respond with a short packet whose TC (truncated) bit has been set. The client should then retry using TCP and increase the padding of subsequent queries.\n\nVersions 1 and 2 of the protocol use the X25519 algorithm for key exchange, EdDSA for signatures, as well as XSalsa20-Poly1305 or XChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption.\n\nThe DNSCrypt protocol can also be used for access control or accounting, by accepting only a predefined set of public keys. This can be used by commercial DNS services to identify customers without having to rely on IP addresses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5719951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5719951", "title": "Grandes Chroniques de France", "text": "Grandes Chroniques de France\n\nThe Grandes Chroniques de France is a vernacular royal compilation of the history of France, most manuscripts of which are luxury copies that are heavily illuminated. Copies were produced between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, the text being extended at intervals to cover recent events. It was first compiled in the reign of Saint Louis (d. 1270), who wished to preserve the history of the Franks from the coming of the Trojans to his own time, in an \"official\" chronography whose dissemination was tightly controlled. It was continued under his successors until completed in 1461. It covers the Merovingian, Carolingian, and Direct Capetian dynasties of French kings, with illustrations depicting personages and events from virtually all their reigns.\n\nIt survives in approximately 130 manuscripts, varying in the richness, number and artistic style of their illuminations, copied and amended for royal and courtly patrons, the central work of vernacular official historiography. Over 75 copies are illustrated, with between one and over 400 scenes shown; analysis of the selections of subjects reveals the changing political preoccupations of the different classes of patrons over time.\n\nFollowing the contemporary styles of illustration seen in other manuscripts, early copies had mostly fairly small scenes, normally with a patterned background rather than a landscape or interior setting. In front of this a number of figures were engaged in key historical moments, especially battles, coronations, weddings and important meetings. There might be over 200 such scenes illustrated, often collected together as individual compartments in a full-page miniature with a decorated framework. By the mid-15th century the number of illustrations was fewer, around 50 even in lavish copies, but the miniatures were larger, and now had lovingly detailed landscape or interior backgrounds. Scenes of ceremonial moments, now often including large crowds, had become more popular, though battles retained their place.\n\nThe \"Grandes Chroniques de France\" had its origin as a French translation of the Latin histories written and updated by the monks of Saint-Denis, who were, from the thirteenth century, official historiographers to the French kings. As first written, the \"Grandes Chroniques\" traced the history of the French kings from their origins in Troy to the death of Philip II of France (1223). The continuations of the text were drafted first at Saint-Denis and then at the court in Paris. Its final form brought the chronicle down to the death of Charles V in the 1380s.\n\nThere are also Burgundian variants, which give a different account of the final period, a product of the dissention which finally led to the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War in 1407-35. Philip the Good's copy follows the Paris text up to 1226, but then uses Guillaume de Nangis' \"Chronicon\" up to 1327, and then Flemish chronicles from the monasteries of Saint Bertin and Notre Dame at Saint-Omer. The compiler, Abbot Guillaume Fillastre of Saint Bertin (not the earlier cardinal), aimed to promote Philip's claim to the French throne. He is shown handing over the work to Philip in the presentation miniature by Simon Marmion in Philip's copy.\n\nSources for material on the reign of Charlemagne included the \"Historia Caroli Magni\", also known as the \"Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle\" and the \"Vita Karoli Magni\" by Einhard. Other sources included Abbot Suger's \"Life of Louis IV\".\n\nThe earliest surviving copy was presented by the monks of St-Denis to Philip III in about 1274, with 36 miniatures (many with multiple scenes) and historiated initials by Parisian artists. These were mostly derived from other manuscript sources, but ingeniously focused into a coherent programme of illustration reflecting the points the abbey wished the king to absorb, regarding both its own aspirations and the nature of kingship in general.\n\nEspecially fine are the lavishly illustrated copies made for Charles V (BnF, Ms. Fr. 2813), Louis VII, illuminated by Jean Fouquet (1455-1460, BnF, Ms. Fr. 6465, above) and Philip the Good of Burgundy, now in the Russian National Library, Saint Petersburg (1457, above).\n\nFor the first 150 years of the \"Grandes Chroniques\"'s existence, its audience was carefully circumscribed: its readership was centered in the royal court at Paris, and its owners included French kings, members of the royal family and the court, and a few highly connected clerics in northern France. During this period, there were no copies of the work that belonged to members of the Parlement or the university community.\n\nBut from the mid-15th century a number of unillustrated copies survive \"on paper or on mixtures of parchment and paper that belonged (when provenance is known) to secretaries and notaries and to members of the Parlement. These inexpensive books filled a practical need; they provided a chronology for persons charged with maintaining the state archives and doubtless also assisted them in their increasingly common role as writers of history\". Latterly, under the Valois Dukes of Burgundy, it spread there as well, and copies were given to foreign royalty.\n\nOf the three copies (not all complete) in the Royal manuscripts, British Library, representing most of what survives from the medieval English royal library, one may have come to England after the capture of King John II of France 1356 at the battle of Poitiers (Ms Royal 19 D. ii). A unusually late copy, never finished, was begun in Calais in 1487, commissioned by the Treasurer of the English enclave for presentation to the new Henry VII of England. The miniatures that were completed seem to be by English artists.\n\nPrinted copies on vellum, which were then illuminated, were produced in Paris by Antoine Vérard, who specialized in such hybrids, and normal editions by others, but by around 1500 the work seems to have been regarded as outdated, and was replaced by other texts. Altogether only four early print editions were made, all in Paris. These were in 1477, 1493, 1514 and 1518.\n\n\n"}

Within the hall, the German Empire was declared in 1871 (Deutsche Reichsgründung) and the Treaty of Versailles signed by the victorious powers of World War I in 1919.\n\nAs the principal and most remarkable feature of King Louis XIV of France's third building campaign of the Palace of Versailles (1678–1684), construction of the Hall of Mirrors began in 1678. To provide for the Hall of Mirrors as well as the \"salon de la guerre\" and the \"salon de la paix\", which connect the \"grand appartement du roi\" with the \"grand appartement de la reine\", architect Jules Hardouin Mansart appropriated three rooms from each apartment as well as the terrace that separated the two apartments.\n\nThe principal feature of this hall is the seventeen mirror-clad arches that reflect the seventeen arcaded windows that overlook the gardens. Each arch contains twenty-one mirrors with a total complement of 357 used in the decoration of the \"galerie des glaces\". The arches themselves are fixed between marble pilasters whose capitals depict the symbols of France. These gilded bronze capitals include the fleur-de-lys and the Gallic cockerel or rooster. Many of the other attributes of the Hall of Mirrors were lost to war for financial purposes, such as the silver table pieces and \"guéridons,\" which were melted by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg.\n\nIn the 17th century, mirrors were among the most expensive items to possess at the time; the Venetian Republic held the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors. In order to maintain the integrity of his philosophy of mercantilism, which required that all items used in the decoration of Versailles be made in France, Jean-Baptiste Colbert enticed several workers from Venice to make mirrors at the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs. According to legend, in order to keep its monopoly, the government of the Venetian Republic sent agents to France to poison the workers whom Colbert had brought to France.\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors' dimensions are 73.0 m × 10.5 m × 12.3 m (Length x Width x Height) (239.5 ft × 34.4 ft × 40.4 ft) and is flanked by the \"salon de la guerre\" (north) and the \"salon de la paix\" (south). Construction on the \"galerie\" and its two salons continued until 1684, at which time it was pressed into use for court and state functions. The ceiling decoration is dedicated to the political policies and military victories of Louis XIV. The central panel of the ceiling, \"Le roi gouverne par lui-même\" (\"The king governs alone\"), alludes to the establishment of the personal reign of Louis XIV in 1661. The present decorative schema represents the last of three that were presented to Louis XIV. The original decorative plan was to have depicted the exploits of Apollo, being consistent with the imagery associated with the Sun-King, Louis XIV. However, when the king learned that his brother, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, had commissioned Pierre Mignard to decorate the ceiling of the \"grande galerie\" of his brother's residence at Château de Saint-Cloud, Louis XIV rejected the plan. The next decorative plan was one in which the exploits of Hercules — as allegories to the actions of Louis XIV — were to be depicted. Again, as with the first plan, the Hercules theme was rejected by the king. The final plan represents military victories of Louis XIV starting with the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) to the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678–1679). In a departure from the decoration of the ceilings in the \"grand appartement du roi\", Le Brun has depicted Louis XIV directly, and has ceased to refer to the king in allegorical guises. In this way, themes such as good governance and military prowess are rendered with Louis XIV himself as the key figure.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Hall of Mirrors was used daily by Louis XIV when he walked from his private apartment to the chapel. At this time, courtiers assembled to watch the king and members of the royal family pass, and might make a particular request by intoning: \"Sire, Marly?\". This was the manner in which one was able to obtain a much sought-after invitation to one of the king's house parties at Marly-le-Roi, the villa Louis XIV built north of Versailles on the route to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. However, of all the events that transpired in this room during the reign of Louis XIV, the Siamese Embassy of 1685–1686 must be cited as the most opulent. At this time, the \"galerie des glaces\" and the \"grands appartements\" were still appointed with silver furniture. In its heyday, over 3,000 candles were used to light the Hall of Mirrors. In February 1715, Louis XIV held his last embassy in the \"galerie des glaces\", one in which he received Mehemet Reza Bey, ambassador of the Shah of Persia.\n\nIn the successive reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, the Hall of Mirrors continued to serve for family and court functions. Embassies, births, and marriages were fêted in this room; however, perhaps the most celebrated event of the 18th century occurred on 25 February 1745: the celebrated \"bal des Ifs\" (Ball of the Yew Trees). It was during this costume ball that Louis XV, who was dressed as a yew tree, met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson d'Étiolles, who was costumed as Diana, goddess of the hunt. Jeanne-Antoinette, who became Louis XV's mistress, is better known to history as the Marquise de Pompadour.\n\nIn the 19th century, at the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian king, William I, was declared German emperor — thus establishing the German Empire — on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors by Bismarck and the victorious German princes and lords. This was seen as a victory with heavy symbolism for the Germans and a stinging insult for the defeated French. French Prime Minister Clemenceau chose the Hall of Mirrors as the location wherein was signed the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I on 28 June 1919.\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors is still used for state occasions of the Fifth Republic, such as receptions for visiting heads of state.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40324404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40324404", "title": "Hoepla", "text": "Hoepla\n\nHoepla (\"Whoops\") was a Dutch experimental cultural television show broadcast in 1967. It aimed at a young teenage audience and was notable for being unpredictable and risky in its subject matter, featuring reports, performances, declarations, and interviews that tied in with the subversive atmosphere of the Provo movement. Three episodes were made for the VPRO, and the show caused national controversy when a naked woman, Phil Bloom appeared on the show, being the first time this happened on Dutch television. A fourth episode was taped but did not air until 2008. The show was written and produced by the team of Wim T. Schippers, Wim van der Linden, Willem de Ridder, and Hans Verhagen.\n\n\"Hoepla\" was made by and for a teenage audience (the post-World War II generation), at a time (the early 1960s) when Dutch culture was one of \"boredom and obedience\". That segment of the population had already clashed with the establishment over a VARA television show that ran from 1963 to 1966, \"\", \"the most despised and controversial satirical TV program ever\". That show, based on the BBC program \"That Was the Week That Was\", had aired a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\"Give us this day our daily television\"), on 4 January 1964, in a skit called \"Beeldreligie\" (\"image worship\") which led to criticism from television viewers and politicians; questions were asked in parliament, and one of the show's presenters, the wildly popular and by no means rebellious Mies Bouwman, was forced to resign from the show after receiving threats. Police were called in to protect the studio during subsequent tapings. Like \"Zo is het toevallig\", \"Hoepla\" would tackle controversial topics such as \"the colonial past, the royal family, and sexuality\" in a social system where \"authority and community were central\".\n\nAccording to Hans Verhagen, one of \"Hoepla\"s writers and directors, the show was intended to operate on a \"wavelength\" which had hitherto not been tried on television. That \"Hoepla\" was in tune with happening developments in popular culture was indicated by its guest list: musical performances were given by some of the era's hippest artists, including Soft Machine (episode 2), The Mothers of Invention (ep. 2), and The Jimi Hendrix Experience (ep. 3), and there were declarations by and interviews with such idols as Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger. The Experience performed \"Foxy Lady\", \"Catfish Blues\", and \"Purple Haze\" in the studio on 10 November 1967, before playing an evening show in Rotterdam; that rendition of \"Catfish Blues\" was reissued on the 1994 compilation album \"Blues\". (The section with \"Foxy Lady\" appears to be lost, and might have been stolen from the archive by a Hendrix fan.)\n\nThe first episode aired on 28 July 1967 and immediately redrew the earlier battle lines familiar from the \"Beeldreligie\" controversy. Opposition against the show was mobilized by the national daily newspaper \"De Telegraaf\", who had complained earlier that \"Zo is het toevallig\" was a waste of the public's television licence, and published pictures of the cast and crew of \"Zo is het toevallig\" to accompany its coverage of \"Hoepla\", to remind its audience of what was at stake. Notable sections of the show included an interview of Pete Townshend by Hans Verhagen and the appearance of Phil Bloom, naked except for a strategically placed garland of plastic flowers, during a performance by the singer Teddy Lee J. (a 25-year-old singer from Suriname) who sang \"I'm a sexman\" Verhagen paid Bloom 150 guilders for her work, and the VPRO lost 67 members.\n\nFor the second episode, the writers had upped the ante, and got Phil Bloom to appear completely naked. During a skit, she is reading a newspaper, sitting on a sofa; she reads, out loud, a review of the first episode of \"Hoepla\" that appeared in the Catholic daily \"Trouw\" and when she lowers the newspaper she is shown to be completely naked. But when photos of the taping leaked out and were published, the scene was shot again; this time Bloom is on a chair (likewise naked) reading another \"Hoepla\" article, this time from \"Het Vrije Volk\", the social-democrat daily paper, which states that the VPRO cut Bloom's scene after the photos leaked out. As soon as the scene is over, the screen shows the VPRO's postal address, to accommodate those who wished to cancel their membership.\n\nReactions were predictable: \"Telegraaf\" columnist Leo Riemens referred to the show as \"filth\" and \"pornography\", and letters to the various editors struck the same chords. Other newspapers, though, were more positive, and the commentary in parliament by SGP representative C. N. van Dis (the Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij is a small, orthodox, Calvinist party), who strongly criticized the Minister of Culture Marga Klompé for allowing women to be degraded, did not meet with approval in parliament or the press. The VPRO anticipated angry letters from some of its members, and had prepared a standard reply in which the organization said it understood that not everyone would agree with the show's message, but that it wanted to be an \"open organization\" which could adjust to the rapidly changing attitudes toward society's norms.\n\nThe third episode was taped on 10 November 1967 but did not air until 23 November, minus two controversial items that the VPRO cut: a section called \"Vleesch\" (an old-fashioned spelling for \"vlees\", \"meat\"), which reported on the last five minutes in an abattoir of a cow's life, and a section in which a model performs a striptease over an audio tape of Dutch prime minister Piet de Jong, responding to the questions asked in parliament by C. N. van Dis about \"Hoepla\" The \"Vleesch\" section had been moved from the second to the third episode; after a committee of child psychiatrists had delved into the matter, it was approved as safe for children but was again moved, to the fourth episode, which never aired. The section was conceived by Hans Verhagen and vegetarian Wim T. Schippers; Wim van der Linden filmed the section, and afterward became a vegetarian as well. The story on the missing episode was reported on \"Vlees Magazine\" (\"Meat Magazine\"), since it and the attendant video footage provided insight into slaughter procedures in the 1960s.\n\nA fourth episode was supposed to air on 8 January 1968 (and apparently a record number of people had tuned in to watch it), but it was decided on that very day to cancel it, with the explanation given that Phil Bloom had been photographed by \"Playboy\" during rehearsals, and such commercial ventures were not allowed on public television. The VPRO told the show's makers on 15 January that there would be no more new episodes. The tapes for the fourth episode were discovered early in the 21st century, unedited; they were newly edited and aired in January 2008.\n\n\n"}

In \"Kilburn\", a husband had, before his marriage, passed and registered a notarial bond for £500 as a second charge on all his property in favour of his wife.\n\nThe court found as a fact that, although the bond purported to secure a sum of £500 which the husband had verbally promised to pay his wife, it was not a serious promise, and there was therefore no intention to pay that sum. The intention of the spouses, in agreeing to the notarial bond, was only to give a preferential claim on the sum if the husband were to be declared insolvent.\n\nThe principal debt was invalid, and so, in turn, was the notarial bond. As, therefore, there was no legal obligation secured by the bond, the wife could not, on the insolvency of her husband, claim in a \"concursus creditorum\" on the bond. The decision of the court \"a quo\" (in the Natal Provincial Division) in \"Kilburn v Estate Kilburn\" was thus confirmed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044611", "title": "Kukeri", "text": "Kukeri\n\nKukeri (; singular: kuker, кукер) are elaborately costumed Bulgarian men, and sometimes women, who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. Closely related traditions are found throughout the Balkans and Greece (including Romania and the Pontus). The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals (sometimes double-faced) and large bells attached to the belt. Around New Year and before Lent, the kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the village during the year.\n\nThe kukeri traditionally visit peoples' houses at night so that \"the sun would not catch them on the road.\" After parading around the village they usually gather at the village square to dance wildly and amuse the people. Kukeri rituals vary by region but remain largely the same in essence.\n\nThe custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian Dionysos cult in the wider area of Thracia.\nSimilar rituals can be also found in much of the Balkans. \nThe name \"kuker\" has been derived from Latin \"cuculla\" meaning \"hood, cowl\" or \"cucurum\", \"quiver\" (i.e. in the sense of a container; an abbreviation of \"koukouros geros\"). \n\nThe corresponding figure in Greek-speaking Thrace is known as \"Kalogeros\" \"rod-carrier\", also shortened to \"cuci\", in former Yugoslavia known as \"didi, didici\", in Bulgaria as \"kuker\" or \"babushar\", as \"momogeros\" in Pontic Anatolia. In Romania, this figure mostly appears together with a goat, known as \"capra\", \"turca\" or \"brezaia\".\n\nKukeri is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in Bulgaria and Serbia it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of carnival) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields (ploughing, sowing) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.\n\nCapra comes from the Danish words kahmpu (To wear upon the head) and rah (The divine light). A halo like head piece was worn as a crown to symbolize the spiritual divine realm. While animal fur, bird feathers and the sort were worn to symbolize nature. The fact that nature has good and evil, and that humans are the intermediary between spirit and nature. It was a time to pay homage to the Spieth gods. Some cultures imbibed in human flesh to satiate the gods thirst for blood, as an act of solidarity for the gods.\n\nKukeri or Kuker Warriors are some of the main characters in the epic fantasy animated series 'The Golden Apple' which is currently being developed by Studio Zmei. In it, young brothers Bran and Vlad have been trained as Kuker Warriors to fight evil spirits but they have to question what they have been taught when they are forced to team up with half-spirit Vihra and Samodiva-spirit Tina in order to protect their world. \n\nKukeri are featured in the music video for the song \"Fish on\", by the industrial metal band Lindemann, and in the movie \"Toni Erdmann\", directed by Maren Ade.\n\n\n"}

The area of the liberty expanded in 1686. It became part of the County of London in 1889 and was dissolved in 1894.\n\nThe liberty originally consisted of the area inside the walls of the Tower of London (also known as Tower Within) and immediately outside it (known as Old Tower Without). The boundaries were presented by a Leet Jury in 1525 and again as surveyed by Haiward and Gascoyne in 1597.\n\nIn 1686 letters patent granted by James II added the Old Artillery Ground, Little Minories and the Liberty of Wellclose. These areas came into the possession of the Crown when the religious houses that formerly administered them were dissolved. They had subsequently been used for the storing of ordnance.\n\nThe population was 3,995 in 1811 and 4,190 in 1831.\n\nThe liberties had an administration separate from the neighbouring county and city, headed by the Constable of the Tower of London, and appointed their own coroner, and had their own courthouse with general and quarter sessions and gaol. A force of constables was appointed for the area. The inhabitants had certain other privileges such as being able to claim any beast that fell from, and any swans under London Bridge.\n\nFrom 1837 the liberty formed part of the Whitechapel Poor Law Union. Extra-parochial places were progressively eliminated and following the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857, the Tower of London and Old Tower Without became civil parishes in 1858. The Old Artillery Ground became a civil parish in 1866, following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866.\n\nFrom 1855 the area became part of the Whitechapel District and was administered by the Whitechapel District Board of Works. The liberty became part of the County of London in 1889.\n\nBy 1889 the liberty had become obsolete and it was thought that the Local Government Act 1888 had removed the jurisdiction of the justices. However, the charter was found to be still in operation. The liberty was abolished on 25 June 1894 following a petition by the justices of the peace of the County of London under the Liberties Act 1850.\n\nThe area of the former liberty was included in the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney in 1900.\n\nThe liberty continued as a franchise coroner's district. The Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926 provided that when a vacancy arises the district could be dissolved and when a vacancy occurred on 10 May 1939 an order was made on 30 November 1939 combining it with the east district, coming into effect on 1 January 1940.\n\nThe area of the former liberty now forms part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and following boundary changes around the Minories in 1994 is partly in the City of London.\n\n"}

Rider Haggard travelled to southern Africa in 1875 and remained in the country for six years, during which time he served as Master of the High Court of the Transvaal and an adjutant of the Pretoria Horse.\n\nRider Haggard's time in Africa proved inspirational for him, and while still in Natal he wrote two articles for \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" describing his experiences. He returned to Britain in 1881 and was called to the bar; while studying he wrote his first book, \"Cetywayo and His White Neighbours\", a critical examination of Britain's policies in South Africa. Two years later he published his first work of fiction, \"Dawn\". In 1885 he wrote one of his most popular novels, \"King Solomon's Mines\"—detailing the life of the adventurer Allan Quatermain—which was followed by \"\" (1886), which introduced the female character Ayesha, both of which became series of books; according to the author Morton N.

All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference. Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials. Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.\n\nUnited States Department of Justice attorneys and Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents commonly make use of memoranda of conversation. A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.\n\nMemoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the fraud unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, \"the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events.\"\n\nFormer Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Brent Scowcroft, who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of Gerald R. Ford, kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation. He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the United States National Security Council. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum contains over 1,000 such memorandum of conversation documents relating to the Presidency of Richard Nixon and Presidency of Gerald Ford, mainly related to national security of the United States.\n\n"}

Popescu (August 9, 1843–June 8, 1921) was a Romanian prose writer.\n\nHe was born in Bucharest to Romanian Orthodox priest Dimitrie Popescu and his wife Niculina. Popescu began high school in his native city, but left early in 1861 in order to become a civil servant at the Foreign Ministry, where he worked until retiring in 1913. He wrote numerous calendars starting in 1866, and also published work in \"Amicul familiei\", \"Columna lui Traian\", \"Ghimpele\", \"Revista contimporană\", \"Revista literară și științifică\", \"România ilustrată\", \"Telegraful\" and \"Vatra\". He wrote sensationalist novels, either historically themed or inspired by ballads and traditions surrounding famous \"hajduks\" and bandits. A few of his many novels include \"Radu al III-lea cel Frumos\", 1864; \"Amazoana de la Rahova\", 1879; \"Iancu Jianu\", 1880; \"Miul haiducul\", 1881; \"Tunsul haiducul\", 1881; \"Codreanu haiducu\", 1882 and \"Boierii haiduci\", 1892. As shown by their repeated republication, these were much loved by the late 19th century reading public. He also published a series of song and couplet collections, in the style of Anton Pann's old anthologies.\n"}
{"id": "156732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156732", "title": "National Film Board of Canada", "text": "National Film Board of Canada\n\nThe National Film Board of Canada (or simply National Film Board or NFB) (French: Office national du film du Canada, or ONF) is Canada's public film and digital media producer and distributor. An agency of the Government of Canada, the NFB produces and distributes documentary films, animation, web documentaries, and alternative dramas. In total, the NFB has produced over 13,000 productions since its inception, which have won over 5,000 awards. The NFB reports to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. It has English-language and French-language production branches.\n\n\nThe National Film Board currently maintains its head office in Saint-Laurent, a borough of Montreal, in the Norman McLaren electoral district, named in honour of the NFB animation pioneer. The NFB HQ building is also named for McLaren, and is home to much of its production activity.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, the NFB is scheduled to move to its headquarters to the new Îlot Balmoral building located at Montreal's Quartier des spectacles, adjacent to the square. The NFB will occupy the first six floors of the building, which will allow it to have closer contact with the public, and will also feature expanded digital media research and production facilities.\nIn addition to the English and French-language studios in its Montreal HQ, there are centres throughout Canada. English-language production occurs at centres in Toronto (Ontario Centre), Vancouver (Pacific & Yukon Centre, located in the Woodward's Building), Edmonton (North West Centre), Winnipeg (Prairie Centre), and Halifax (Atlantic Centre). As of October 2009, the Atlantic Centre also operates an office in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. In June 2011, the NFB appointed a producer to work with film and digital media makers across Saskatchewan, to be based in Regina.\n\nOutside Quebec, French language productions are also made in Moncton (Studio Acadie) and Toronto (Canadian Francophone Studio). The NFB also offers support programs for independent filmmakers: in English, via the Filmmaker Assistance Program (FAP) and in French through its Aide du cinéma indépendant – Canada (ACIC) program.\n\nThe organization has a hierarchical structure headed by a \"Board of Trustees\", which is chaired by the \"Government Film Commissioner and NFB Chairperson\". It is overseen by the \"Board of Trustees Secretariat and Legal Affairs\".\n\nFunding is derived primarily from government of Canada transfer payments, and also from its own revenue streams. These revenues are from print sales, film production services, rentals, and royalties, and total up to $10 million yearly; the NFB lists this as \"Respendable Revenues\" in its financial statements. As a result of cuts imposed by 2012 Canadian federal budget, by 2015 the NFB's public funding will be reduced by $6.7 million, to $60.3 million.\n\nAs part of the 2016 Canadian federal budget, the NFB will receive an additional $13.5 million in funding, spread out over a five-year period.\n\nIn 1938, the Government of Canada invited John Grierson, a British documentary film producer who introduced the term \"documentary\" to English-speaking film criticism, to study the state of the government's film production. Up to that date, the Government Motion Picture Bureau, established in 1918, had been the major Canadian film producer. The results of Grierson's report were included in the National Film Act of 1939.\n\nIn , the Act led to the establishment of the National Film Commission, which was subsequently renamed the National Film Board (NFB). The NFB was founded in part to create propaganda in support of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1940, with Canada at war, the NFB launched its \"Canada Carries On\" series of morale boosting theatrical shorts. The success of \"Canada Carries On\" led to the creation of \"The World in Action\", which was more geared to international audiences.\n\nIn this period, other NFB films were issued as newsreels, such as \"The War Is Over\" (1945), intended for theatrical showings. These films were based on current news and often tackled wartime events as well as contemporary issues in Canadian culture.\n\nEarly in its history, the NFB was a primarily English-speaking institution. Based in Ottawa, 90% of its staff were English and the few French Canadians in production worked with English crews. There was a French Unit which was responsible for versioning films into French but it was headed by an Anglophone. And in NFB annual reports of the time, French films were listed under \"foreign languages\". Screenwriter Jacques Bobet, hired in 1947, worked to strengthen the French Unit and retain French talent, and was appointed producer of French versions in 1951. During that period, commissioner Albert Trueman, sensitive to how the Quiet Revolution was beginning to transform Quebec society, brought in Pierre Juneau as the NFB's \"French Advisor\". Juneau recommended the creation of a French production branch to enable francophone filmmakers to work and create in their own language.\n\nDuring the 1940s and early 1950s, the NFB employed 'travelling projectionists' who toured the country, bringing films and public discussions to rural communities.\n\nIn 1950, a revision of the National Film Act removed any direct government intervention into the operation and administration of the NFB.\n\nIn 1956, the NFB's headquarters was relocated from Ottawa to Montreal, improving the NFB's reputation in French Canada and making the NFB more attractive to French-speaking filmmakers.\n\nIn 1964, a separate French production branch was finally established, with Bobet as one of its four initial executive producers.\n\nIn 1967, the creation of the Canadian Film Development Corporation (now known as Telefilm Canada) refined the mandate for the National Film Board. The Canadian Film Development Corporation would become responsible for promoting the development of the film industry. The Challenge for Change was also created the same year as a community media project which would develop the use of film and video as a tool for initiating social change.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the National Film Board produced several educational films in partnership with Parks Canada, including Bill Schmalz's \"Bears and Man\".\n\nIn the early 1970s, the NFB began a process of decentralization, opening film production centres in cities across Canada. The move had been championed by NFB producers such as Rex Tasker, who became the first executive producer of the NFB's studio in Halifax.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the National Film Board produced a series of vignettes, some of which aired on CBC and other Canadian broadcasters as interstitial programs. The vignettes became popular because of their cultural depiction of Canada, and because they represented its changing state, such as the vignette \"Faces\" which was made to represent the increasing cultural and ethnic diversity of Canada. In 1996, the NFB operating budget was cut by 32%, forcing it to lay off staff and to close its film laboratory, sound stage (now privatized) and other departments.\n\nIn 2006, the NFB marked the 65th anniversary of NFB animation with an international retrospective of restored Norman McLaren classics and the launch of the DVD box set, \"Norman McLaren – The Master's Edition\". The NFB budget has since been cut again. The six-storey John Grierson Building at its Montreal headquarters has been unused for several years – with HQ staff now based solely in its adjacent Norman McLaren Building. In October 2009, the NFB released a free app for Apple's iPhone that would allow users to watch thousands of NFB films directly on their cell phones.\n\nIn 2010, the NFB released an iPad version of their app that streams NFB films, many in high definition.\n\nIn March 2012, the NFB's funding was cut 10%, to be phased in over a three-year period, as part of the 2012 Canadian federal budget. The NFB eliminated 73 full and part-time positions.\n\nBeginning on 2 May 2014, the NFB's 75th anniversary was marked by such events as the release of a series of commemorative stamps by Canada Post, and an NFB documentary about the film board's early years, entitled \"Shameless Propaganda\".\n\nIn the post-war era the NFB became a pioneer in new developments in documentary film. The NFB played a key role in both the Cinéma vérité and Direct Cinema movements, working on technical innovations to make its 16 mm synchronized sound equipment more light-weight and portable—most notably the \"Sprocketape\" portable sound recorder invented for the film board by Ches Beachell in 1955. Influenced by the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, the NFB's Studio B production unit experimented with cinema verite in its 1958 \"Candid Eye\" series. \"Candid Eye\" along with such NFB French-language films as \"Les Raquetteurs\" (1958) have been credited as helping to inspire the cinéma vérité documentary movement. Other key cinéma vérité films during this period included \"Lonely Boy\" (1961) and \"Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen\" (1965).\n\nRunning from 1967 to 1980, \"Challenge for Change\" and its French-language equivalent \"Societé Nouvelle\" became a global model for the use of film and portable video technology to create community-based participatory documentary films to promote dialogue on local issues and promote social change. Over two hundred such films were produced, including 27 films about Fogo Island, Newfoundland, directed by Colin Low and early NFB efforts in Indigenous filmmaking, such as Willie Dunn's \"The Battle of Crowfoot\" (1968).\n\nNFB documentarians played a key role in the development of the IMAX film format, following the NFB multi-screen experience \"In the Labyrinth\", created for Expo 67 in Montreal. The film was the centrepiece of a $4.5 million pavilion, which attracted over 1.3 million visitors in 1967, and was co-directed by Roman Kroitor, Colin Low and Hugh O'Connor, and produced by Tom Daly and Kroitor. After Expo, Kroitor left the NFB to co-found what would become known as IMAX Corporation, with Graeme Ferguson and Robert Kerr. The NFB continued to be involved with IMAX breakthroughs at subsequent world's fairs, with NFB director Donald Brittain directing the first-ever IMAX film \"Tiger Child\" for Expo 70 in Osaka, and with the NFB producing the first full-colour IMAX-3D film \"Transitions\" for Expo 86 in Vancouver and the first 48 fps IMAX HD film \"Momentum\" for Seville Expo '92.\n\nIn the 1980s, the National Film Board also produced a number of \"alternative drama\" films, which combined documentary and narrative fiction filmmaking techniques. Generally starring non-professional actors, these films used a documentary format to present a fictionalized story and were generally scripted by the filmmakers and the cast through a process of improvisation, and are thus classified as docufiction.\n\nThe alternative drama films were \"The Masculine Mystique\" (1984), \"90 Days\" (1985), \"Sitting in Limbo\" (1986), \"The Last Straw\" (1987), \"Train of Dreams\" (1987), \"Welcome to Canada\" (1989) and \"The Company of Strangers\" (1990).\n\nWhen Norman McLaren joined the organization in 1941, the NFB began production of animation. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized experimental filmmaker. The NFB's French-language animation unit was founded in 1966 by René Jodoin.\n\nWhen McLaren joined the NFB, his first film at the film board was the drawn-on-film short, \"Mail Early\". He would go on to refine his technique make a series of hand-drawn films at the NFB during and after the Second World War, most notably \"Boogie-Doodle\" (1940), \"Hen Hop\" (1942), \"Begone Dull Care\" (1949) and \"Blinkity Blank\" (1955).\n\nThe NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as pinscreen animation, and as of June 2012, the NFB is reported to have the only working animation pinscreen in the world.\n\nMcLaren's Oscar-winning \"Neighbours\" popularized the form of character movement referred to as pixilation, a variant of stop motion. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name. In 2015, the NFB's animation studios were credited as helping to lead a revival in stop-motion animation in Canada, building on the tradition of NFB animators such as McLaren and Co Hoedeman.\n\nThe NFB was a pioneer in computer animation, releasing one of the first CGI films, \"Hunger\", in 1974, then forming its Centre d'animatique in 1980 to develop new CGI technologies. Staff at the Centre d'animatique included Daniel Langlois, who left in 1986 to form Softimage.\n\nThe NFB was licensed by IMAX Corporation to develop new artistic applications using its SANDDE system for hand-drawn stereoscopic computer animation, with the NFB producing a number of films including \"Falling in Love Again\" (2003) and \"Subconscious Password\" (2013).\n\nTraditional animators included Richard Condie, John Weldon, Allison Snowden, Janet Perlman, Cordell Barker, Brad Caslor, Michael Mills, Paul Driessen among others (some draw on paper rather than cels).\n\nCaroline Leaf used this technique on films such as The Metamorphosis Of Mr. Samsa and The Owl Who Married A Goose. The Sand Castle was the first (and so far only) sand animation to win an Oscar.\n\nWendy Tilby and Amanda Forbes perfected the paint on glass technique (mixing oil paint with glycerine) on films such as Strings and Wild Life. This technique was also used on Caroline Leaf's film The Street.\n\nAs of March 2013, the NFB devotes one quarter of its production budget to interactive media, including web documentaries. The NFB is a pioneer in interactive web documentaries, helping to position Canada as a major player in digital storytelling, according to transmedia creator Anita Ondine Smith, as well as Shari Frilot, programmer for Sundance Film Festival's New Frontier program for digital media.\n\n\"Welcome to Pine Point\" received two Webby Awards while \"Out My Window\", an interactive project from the NFB's \"Highrise\" project, won the IDFA DocLab Award for Digital Storytelling and an International Digital Emmy Award.\n\nLoc Dao is the executive producer and \"creative technologist\" responsible for NFB English-language digital content and strategy, based in the Woodward's Building in Vancouver. Jeremy Mendes is an interactive artist producing English-language interactive works for the NFB, whose projects include a collaboration with Leanne Allison (\"Being Caribou\", \"Finding Farley\") on the webdoc \"Bear 71\".\n\nDao's counterpart for French-language interactive media production at the NFB is Hugues Sweeney, based in Montreal. Sweeney's recent credits include the online interactive animation work, \"Bla Bla\".\n\nThe NFB is also recognized as a leader in virtual reality, with works such as the Webby Award-winning \"The Unknown Photographer\", \"Way to Go\" and \"Cardboard Crash\".\n\nIn January 2009, the NFB launched its online Screening Room, NFB.ca, offering Canadian and international web users the ability to stream hundreds of NFB films for free as well as embed links in blogs and social sites. By mid-2013, the NFB's digital platforms had received approximately 41 million views.\n\nIn October 2009, the NFB launched an iPhone application that was downloaded more than 170,000 times and led to more than 500,000 film views in the first four months. In January 2010, the NFB added high-definition and 3D films to the over 1400 productions available for viewing online. The NFB introduced a free iPad application in July 2010, followed by its first app for the Android platform in March 2011. When the BlackBerry PlayBook launched on April 19, 2011, it included a pre-loaded app offering access to 1,500 NFB titles. In January 2013, it was announced that the NFB film app would be available for the BlackBerry 10, via the BlackBerry World app store.\n\nIn September 2011, the NFB and the Montreal French-language daily \"Le Devoir\" announced that they would jointly host three interactive essays on their websites, ONF.ca and ledevoir.com. The NFB is a partner with China's ifeng.com on NFB Zone, the first Canadian-branded web channel in China, with 130 NFB animated shorts and documentary films available on the company's digital platforms. NFB documentaries are also available on Netflix Canada.\n\nIn April 2013, the NFB announced that it was \"seeking commercial partners to establish a subscription service for Internet television and mobile platforms next year. The service would be available internationally and would feature documentaries from around the world as well as the NFB’s own catalogue.\" As of April 2015, NFB.ca offered VOD films from partners Excentris and First Weekend Club along with NFB productions, with over 450 English and French VOD titles scheduled to be added in 2015.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the NFB announced a three-year plan entitled \"Redefining the NFB's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples\" that commits the organization to hiring more Indigenous staff, designating 15% of its production spending for Indigenous works and offering cross-cultural training to all employees. The plan also sees the NFB building on its relationships with Canadian schools and organizations to create more educational materials about Indigenous peoples in Canada.\n\nOne of the most notable filmmakers in the history of the NFB is Alanis Obomsawin, an Abenaki director who will be completing her 50th film with the NFB in 2017.\n\nIn November 2011, the NFB and partners including the Inuit Relations Secretariat and the Government of Nunavut introduced a DVD and online collection entitled \"\", makes over 100 NFB films by and about Inuit available in Inuktitut and other Inuit languages, as well as English and French.\n\nIn November 2006, the National Film Board of Canada and the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation announced the start of the Nunavut Animation Lab, offering animation training to Nunavut artists. Films from the Nunavut Animation Lab include Alethea Arnaquq-Baril's 2010 digital animation short \"Lumaajuuq\", winner of the Best Aboriginal Award at the Golden Sheaf Awards and named Best Canadian Short Drama at the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival.\n\nIn 2005, the NFB introduced its \"First Stories\" program for emerging Indigenous directors from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Twelve five-minute films were produced through the program, with four from each province. First Stories was followed by \"Second Stories,\" in which three filmmakers from the previous program—Gerald Auger, Tessa Desnomie and Lorne Olson—were invited back to create 20 minute films.\n\nThe NFB was a founding partner in Wapikoni Mobile, a mobile film and media production unit for emerging First Nations filmmakers in Quebec.\n\nThe Indian Film Crew was an early effort in First Nations filmmaking at the NFB, through its Challenge for Change program, and was jointly sponsored by the Company of Young Canadians and the Department of Indian Affairs. After five months' training about various aspects of filmmaking, participants worked on community development projects and research for future films. The unit's first release was \"The Ballad of Crowfoot\" (1968), described as \"the first NFB film to present First Nations experience from an Indigenous point of view.\" Subsequent films included the 1969 documentaries \"These Are My People\" and \"You Are on Indian Land\". A documentary was also made about the effort to increase aboriginal representation in filmmaking.\n\nThe NFB has been a leader in films by women, with the world's first publicly funded women's film's studio, Studio D, followed subsequently by its French-language equivalent, Studio des femmes. Beginning on March 8, 2016, International Women's Day, the NFB began introducing a series of gender parity initiatives.\n\nIn 1974, in conjunction with International Women's Year, the NFB created Studio D on the recommendation of long-time employee Kathleen Shannon. Shannon was designated as Executive Director of the new studio—the first government-funded film studio dedicated to women filmmakers in the world— which became one of the NFB's most celebrated filmmaking units, winning awards and breaking distribution records.\n\nNotable films produced by the studio include three Academy Award-winning documentaries \"I'll Find a Way\" (1977), \"If You Love This Planet\" (1982) and \"\" (1983), as well as \"Not a Love Story\" (1982) and \"\" (1992). Studio D was shut down in 1996, amidst a sweeping set of federal government budget cuts, which impacted the NFB as a whole.\n\nAs of March 8, 2016, researchers and librarians at the University of Calgary announced an archival project to preserve records of Studio D.\n\nOn March 8, 2016, NFB head Claude Joli-Coeur announced a new gender-parity initiative, with the NFB committing that half of all its production spending will be earmarked for films directed by women. The following year, the NFB announced that it also plans to achieve gender balance by 2020 in such creative positions as editing, scriptwriting, musical composition, cinematography and artistic direction. As of 2017, 53% of its producers and executive producers are women, as well as half of its administrative council.\n\nNFB training programs include:\n\nHothouse, a program for emerging animators that marked its tenth anniversary in 2015. Notable Hothouse alumni include Academy Award nominee Patrick Doyon, part of its 2006 edition. Cinéaste recherché(e) is a similar program for French-language emerging animators. Past graduates include Michèle Cournoyer, who took part in the program's 9th edition in 1989.\n\nA collaboration with the Canadian Film Centre on a theatrical documentary development program. First launched in January 2009, the program has led to the production of Sarah Polley’s \"Stories We Tell\", Yung Chang‘s \"The Fruit Hunters\" and Su Rynard’s \"The Messenger\". In May 2015, the CFC and NFB announced a new version of the program entitled the NFB/CFC Creative Doc Lab.\n\nAs of 2015, the NFB is organized along the following branches:\n\nWith six regional studios in English Program:\n\nAnd four regional studios in French Program:\n\nUpon its merger with the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau in 1941, the NFB's mandate expanded to include motion as well as still pictures, resulting in the creation of the Still Photography Division of the NFB.\nFrom 1941 to 1984, the Division commissioned freelance photographers to document every aspect of life in Canada. These images were widely distributed through publication in various media.\n\nIn 1985, this Division officially became the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography.\n\nThe division's work is the subject of a 2013 book by Carleton University art professor Carol Payne entitled \"The Official Picture: The National Film Board of Canada’s Still Photography Division and the Image of Canada, 1941-1971\", published by the McGill-Queen's University Press.\n\nAs part of the 2012 budget cuts, the NFB announced that it was forced to close its Toronto Mediatheque and Montreal CineRobotheque public facilities. They ceased to operate as of September 1, 2012. In September 2013, the Université du Québec à Montréal announced that it had acquired the CineRobotheque for its communications faculty.\n\nAs stipulated in the National Film Act of 1950, the person who holds the position of Government Film Commissioner is the head of the NFB. As of December 2014, the 16th commissioner of the NFB is Claude Joli-Coeur, who first joined the NFB in 2003 and had previously served as interim commissioner.\n\n\nOver the years, the NFB has been internationally recognized with more than 5000 film awards. In 2009, Norman McLaren's \"Neighbours\" was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme, listing the most significant documentary heritage collections in the world.\n\nThe NFB has received more than 90 Genie Awards, including a Special Achievement Genie in 1989 for its 50th anniversary. The following is an incomplete list:\n\n\"Winners\":\n\n\"Nominated\":\n\nThe National Film Board of Canada has received 12 Academy Awards to date. It has received 74 Oscar nominations, more than any film organization in the world outside Hollywood. The first-ever Oscar for documentary went to the NFB production, \"Churchill's Island\". In 1989, it received an Honorary Award from the Academy \"in recognition of its 50th anniversary and its dedicated commitment to originate artistic, creative and technological activity and excellence in every area of filmmaking.\" On January 23, 2007, the NFB received its 12th and most recent Academy Award, for the animated short \"The Danish Poet\", directed by Torill Kove and co-produced with MikroFilm AS (Norway). 55 of the NFB's 74 Oscar nominations have been for its short films.\n\n\"Winners:\"\n\n\"Nominated:\" (incomplete list)\n\nAs of April 2014, the NFB has received five Peabody Awards, for the web documentary \"A Short History of the Highrise\", co-produced with \"The New York Times\"; the Rezolution Pictures/NFB co-production \"Reel Injun\" (2011); Karen Shopsowitz's NFB documentary \"My Father's Camera\" (2002), the NFB/Télé-Action co-produced mini-series \"The Boys of St. Vincent\" (1995) and the NFB documentary \"Fat Chance\" (1994).\n\nNFB Annie Awards nominations include:\n\n\"Nominated:\" (incomplete list)\n\nIn June 2011, NFB received the Award of Excellence in Interactive Programming from the Banff World Media Festival. In August 2011, the NFB received an outstanding technical achievement in digital media award from the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television.\n\nAs of 2016, NFB web documentaries have won 17 Webby Awards, presented International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for excellence on the internet. \"Filmmaker-in-Residence\", a project by Katerina Cizek about St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, was named best online documentary series at the 2008 Webbys. In 2010, the NFB website \"Waterlife\", on the state of the Great Lakes, won in the Documentary: Individual Episode category. In 2011, \"Welcome to Pine Point\" received two Webbys, for Documentary: Individual Episode in the Online Film & Video category and Net art in the Websites category.

The series became the subject of an inquiry by the Senate.\n\nOther controversial productions included the 1981 film \"\", a 1981 Studio D documentary critiquing pornography that was itself banned in the province of Ontario on the basis of pornographic content. Released the following year, \"If You Love This Planet\", winner of the Academy Award for best documentary short subject, was labelled foreign propaganda under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 in the United States.\n\nThe NFB is a minority owner of the digital television channel, Documentary in Canada. NFB-branded series \"Retrovision\" appeared on VisionTV, along with the French-language \"Carnets ONF\" series on APTN. Moreover, in 1997 the American cable channel Cartoon Network created a weekly 30-minute show called \"O Canada\" specifically showcasing a compilation of NFB-produced works; the segment was discontinued in favour of \"Adult Swim\". As of 2010, many of the NFB children's shows are available on the children's IPTV service Ameba.\n\nThe Board's logo consists of a standing stylized figure (originally green) with its arms wide upward. The arms are met by an arch that mirrors them. The round head in between then resembles a pupil, making the entire symbol appear to be an eye with legs.

{"id": "1638154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1638154", "title": "Portland Art Museum", "text": "Portland Art Museum\n\nThe Portland Art Museum in Portland, Oregon, United States, was founded in 1892, making it the oldest art museum on the West Coast and seventh oldest in the US. Upon completion of the most recent renovations, the Portland Art Museum became one of the 25 largest art museums in the US, at a total of 240,000 square feet (22,000 m²), with more than 112,000 square feet (10,400 m²) of gallery space. The permanent collection has more than 42,000 works of art, and at least one major traveling exhibition is usually on show. The Portland Art Museum features a center for Native American art, a center for Northwest art, a center for modern and contemporary art, permanent exhibitions of Asian art, and an outdoor public sculpture garden. The Northwest Film Center is also a component of Portland Art Museum.\n\nThe mission of the Portland Art Museum is to serve the public by providing access to art of enduring quality, by educating a diverse audience about art and by collecting and preserving a wide range of art for the enrichment of present and future generations. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, with accreditation through 2024.\n\nOriginally incorporated as the Portland Art Association, the museum's roots date to 1892. Late that year seven prominent business and cultural leaders in the city created the association so as to start a high-quality art museum for a city approaching 50,000 residents. Henry Corbett donated $10,000 to the association that funded the museum's first collection (the Corbett Collection), which consisted of one hundred plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculptures. The individual pieces of the collection were selected by Winslow B. Ayer and his wife during a trip to Europe. They had been advised by curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston prior to the trip on what pieces to select. The collection was originally displayed at the Multnomah County Library located at Southwest Seventh and Stark streets in Downtown.\n\nBy the time of the Lewis & Clark Exposition held in Portland in 1905, the Portland Art Museum had outgrown its location in the public library and had moved into its own building at SW 5th and Taylor. The first exhibition in the new building featured watercolors and paintings that had come to Portland as part of the 1905 Exposition. Curator Henrietta H. Failing (the niece of founder Henry Failing) organized the exhibition with New England artist Frank Vincent DuMond.\n\nThree years later, in 1908, the museum acquired its first original piece of art, \"Afternoon Sky, Harney Desert\" by American impressionist painter Childe Hassam, who frequented Malheur and Harney counties in Eastern Oregon with his friend, C.E.S. Wood.\n\nAnna Belle Crocker succeeded Henrietta Failing as curator of the museum in 1909. She would remain at the museum until her retirement in 1936. Crocker became one of the Portland Art Museum's most important early figures. She was also the first head of the Museum Art School, which opened in 1909 and is now the Pacific Northwest College of Art.\n\nIn late 1913, the museum hosted one of its most important early exhibitions. The exhibition featured artwork that had been on display earlier that year at the famous 1913 New York Armory Show, which introduced American audiences to modern art. The exhibition included works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Matisse, Manet, Renoir, and the controversial \"Nude Descending a Staircase\" by Marcel Duchamp.\n\nThe museum continued to grow during the years following World War I. In the 1920s, the museum hosted two memorable exhibitions organized by Sally Lewis, the daughter of a prominent Portland family. Lewis had befriended many well-known artists on trips to New York and Europe. In 1923, Lewis organized an exhibition at the museum that included 44 paintings by Picasso, Matisse, André Derain and American modernists, such as Maurice Prendergast, Charles Burchfield, and Max Weber. She was also one of 22 patrons who purchased Derain's \"Tree\" for the museum's permanent collection. The success of her first exhibition led to her second, more daring endeavor a year later that juxtaposed paintings, drawings, and sculptures from Europe with African masks. Among the sculptures was Brâncuși's \"A Muse\", which Lewis owned and donated to the museum in 1959.\n\nThe museum's final location opened to the public on November 18, 1932, at the corner of SW Park Avenue and Jefferson Street. The building, designed by noted Portland architect Pietro Belluschi, is situated along downtown Portland's South Park Blocks and remains a landmark in the city's Cultural District. It was constructed with a lead gift of $100,000 from Winslow B. Ayer, the same patron who selected the museum's collection of plaster casts 40 years earlier. For this reason, the original portion of today's larger main building is referred to as the Ayer Wing.\n\nBarely six years later, construction began on a new wing to expand the main building. The Hirsch Wing, also designed by Pietro Belluschi, was funded largely through the bequest of Ella Hirsch in honor of her parents, Solomon and Josephine Hirsch. The new wing opened on September 15, 1939 and doubled the museum's gallery space.\n\nIn 1942, the Portland Art Museum celebrated a subdued 50th Anniversary due to World War II. But the following year in 1943, staff completed the museum's first full inventory, which counted a permanent collection of 3,300 objects and 750 works on long-term loan.\n\nThe next decade was distinguished by a series of record-setting exhibitions. In 1956, nearly 55,000 visitors came to the museum during the six-week run of an exhibition featuring paintings from the collection of Walter Chrysler. The exhibition was organized by the Portland Art Museum and toured nine other cities. More than 80,000 people visited for a Vincent van Gogh exhibition in 1959, the proceeds from which were used to purchase \"Water Lilies\" by Claude Monet. The 1950s also witnessed the creation of the museum's Docent Council in 1955, which created a core group of volunteers who continue to serve the museum to this day.\n\nIn the 1960s, the museum underwent another major renovation to build the Hoffman Memorial Wing, named for L. Hawley Hoffman, who served as president of the museum twice. Funded by the museum's first capital campaign, the new wing began construction in November 1968 and was finished in September 1970. Pietro Belluschi served as the architect again, and the project allowed him to realize a complete vision for the museum that he had conceived nearly 40 years earlier. The expansion created classroom and studio space for the Museum Art School, a sculpture mall, a new vault for the collections, and an auditorium.\n\nOver the course of the next several decades, the collections and programs of the Portland Art Museum continued to grow and evolve. In 1978, Vivian and Gordon Gilkey began their association with the museum, bringing with them an extraordinary collection of thousands of works on paper that would eventually lead to the opening of the Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Center for Graphic Arts in 1993. Also in 1978, the Northwest Film Center was incorporated into the museum, offering a wide range of film festivals, classes, and outreach programs focused on the moving image arts.\n\nThe Portland Art Museum celebrated its centennial in 1992, which was marked by successful negotiations to purchase the Masonic Temple, now known as the Mark Building. The purchase was completed in 1994, the same year that a capital campaign to finance a refurbishment of the Main Building began. This ambitious project included improving the galleries, reinstalling the permanent collection, and equipping the building with a climate control system. The refurbishment allowed the museum to host the most successful exhibition in its history: Imperial Tombs of China, which brought 430,000 visitors to the museum the following year.\n\nA major renovation of the Hoffman Wing was completed in 2000 and added more than of new gallery space to the museum. The first gallery space addition since 1939, the new galleries included the Grand Ronde Center for Native American Art and the Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Northwest Art. The renovation was funded by the largest capital campaign ever undertaken by a cultural organization in the State of Oregon, which raised $45 million.\n\nIn 2001, the Portland Art Museum announced the largest single acquisition in its history when it purchased the private collection of renowned New York art critic Clement Greenberg. The 159 works by artists such as Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, and Anthony Caro substantially enhanced the museum's permanent collection of 20th century modern and contemporary art. To house this new collection, the museum renovated the former Masonic temple, transforming it into the Mark Building, which opened in October 2005. The renovation added the six-floor, Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art, the largest exhibition space for modern and contemporary art in the region. The Mark Building also houses the 33,000 volume Crumpacker Family Library, meeting spaces, ballrooms, and administrative offices.\n\nNow with a collection consisting of some 40,000 objects, the Portland Art Museum is one of the leading cultural institutions in the Pacific Northwest. The museum is currently under the leadership of Brian Ferriso, The Marilyn H. and Dr. Robert B. Pamplin, Jr. Director since 2006. In 2007, Vincent van Gogh's 1884 painting \"The Ox-Cart\" was donated to the museum, becoming the first work of that artist in a Northwest museum. Beginning in December 2013, Francis Bacon's \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\" went on display for three months shortly after it was sold at auction at the highest price ever paid for a work of art.\n\nIn 2016, the Portland Art Museum announced that it will undertake a glass-walled expansion to unite its two existing free-standing buildings. The addition, to be called the Rothko Pavilion, comes with a partnership with Mark Rothko’s children, Christopher Rothko and Kate Rothko Prizel, that will provide loans of major Rothko paintings from their private collection. The works will be lent individually in rotation over the course of the next two decades.\n\nThe museum has a collection of over 40,000 objects and works of art. Among them:\n\n\nThe Oregon Biennial was a biennial art exhibition held every two years at PAM. In 2007, it was replaced by the Contemporary Northwest Art Awards or CNAA, which will be held every two years and covers artists in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana selected from a shortlist of artists. One artist from the CNAA show will be awarded the $10,000 Arlene Schnitzer Prize.\n\nThe Crumpacker Family Library, founded with the museum in 1892, contains over 40,000 catalogued items. The library is open to researchers by appointment, with computers and wireless internet available for use. Visitors can view past Museum lectures and artist videos in the media room. Reference help is available via phone, email, or in-person visits. The library is located on the second floor of the Mark Building, and is open Monday through Thursday from noon until five PM by appointment only.\n\n"}

Founded by two artists, Tish Miller and Sarah Schwartz, RSG began in Schwartz's living room, later moving to 853 W. Randolph Street on Chicago's west side. The late 1970s, was a period when young artists in all disciplines were collectively founding visual and performing art organizations as alternatives to mainstream and commercial venues in many US cities. RSG was one of more than a dozen 'alternative' galleries - along with many new 'alternative' theatre groups - situated on the near north and west sides of Chicago. The gallery’s focus was on the needs of artists and practitioners who created work that was unsupported, or at the time, perceived to be unsupportable by most commercial or institutional funders. Randolph Street Gallery was also the locus for groundbreaking collaborative projects such as The File Room: An Archive on Cultural Censorship, conceived by Antoni Muntadas, and was the publisher of P-Form: Performance Art Magazine.\n\nFor nineteen productive years RSG fulfilled its role as cultural laboratory for Chicago and the general art world. By the late 1990s, changing trends, expectations, and patterns of patronage in the arts took their toll on the gallery as well as on any of the other few comparable artist-run organizations in the United States (e.g., La Mamelle and the Capp Street Project in San Francisco, the Washington Project for the Arts in the District of Columbia) and the gallery eventually closed.\n\nMany of the emerging and mid-career artists who presented and experimented at Randolph Street Gallery are now recognized as leaders who have changed the context of our cultural dialog. They include visual and performance artists, photographers, filmmakers, sound and video artists, writers and curators.\n\nIn 1999, the complete archives of Randolph Street Gallery were donated to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and include all available material documenting the nineteen-year history of RSG, a high percentage of which are original source materials. The archives contain historical records of performance, sculpture, visual and other art forms created or presented by local and international artists, artists’ portfolios, slides, posters, signage, photographs, performance art programs, publications, news clippings, publicity files, a variety of video formats, sound recordings, computer files, administrative records, and some works of art donated to Randolph Street Gallery for auctions and fund raisers. Public access to the archives is possible on a limited basis and by reservation only.\nThe Randolph Street Gallery Archives are complemented by an additional 33 linear feet of archival material from the editors of P-Form: Performance Art Magazine.\n\n"}

{"id": "154851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154851", "title": "Reentrancy (computing)", "text": "Reentrancy (computing)\n\nIn computing, a computer program or subroutine is called reentrant if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again (\"re-entered\") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an interrupt or signal. Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations will resume correct execution.\n\nThis definition originates from single-threaded programming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an interrupt and transferred to an interrupt service routine (ISR). Any subroutine used by the ISR that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system kernel are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.\n\nThis definition of reentrancy differs from that of thread-safety in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety, but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).\n\nOther terms used for reentrant programs include \"pure procedure\" or \"sharable code\".\n\nReentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the atomicity of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function in an expression like codice_1, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in C, because the expression has no sequence point.) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for signals, such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for interrupts, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.\n\nTo illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a C utility function, , that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.\n\nThis is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine codice_2:\n\nThe function in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making thread-local. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if is called in the same context as a thread already executing :\n\nThe following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since it does not ensure the global data is in a consistent state during execution:\n\nAn implementation of that allocates on the stack instead of on the heap is both thread-safe and reentrant:\n\nReentrancy is not the same thing as idempotence, in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.\n\nData has a characteristic called scope, which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either global (outside the scope of any function and with an indefinite extent) or local (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).\n\nLocal data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of global variables (data shared between all functions), or as static variables (data shared by all functions of the same name). In object-oriented programming, global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of instance variables, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).\n\nReentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, thread-safety. A function can be thread-safe and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a mutex (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only \"one\" thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.\n\n\nA reentrant interrupt handler is an interrupt handler that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce interrupt latency. In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.\n\nIn the following code, neither codice_5 nor codice_6 functions are reentrant.\n\nIn the above, depends on a non-constant global variable ; thus, if two threads execute it and access concurrently, a race condition results. The value of and, therefore, the return value of , cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on the timing of the execution. Hence, is not reentrant. Neither is , because it calls , which is not reentrant.\n\nThese slightly altered versions \"are\" reentrant:\n\nIn the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:\n\nIn the above, can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.\n\n\n\n"}

So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.\n\nAlmanacs, travel guides, field guides, and timelines are also examples of tertiary sources.\n\nSurvey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though review articles in peer-reviewed academic journals are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. reviews, which are primary-source opinions).\n\nSome usually primary sources, such as user guides and manuals, are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.\n\n"}
{"id": "30312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30312", "title": "The Communist Manifesto", "text": "The Communist Manifesto\n\nThe Communist Manifesto (originally Manifesto of the Communist Party) is an 1848 political pamphlet by the German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Commissioned by the Communist League and originally published in London (in German as \"Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei\") just as the revolutions of 1848 began to erupt, the \"Manifesto\" was later recognised as one of the world's most influential political documents. It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and then-present) and the conflicts of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.\n\n\"The Communist Manifesto\" summarises Marx and Engels' theories concerning the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism. Near the end of the Manifesto, the authors call for \"forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions\", which served as the justification for all communist revolutions around the world.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Communist Manifesto\" was registered to UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme with \"Capital, Volume I\".\n\n\"The Communist Manifesto\" is divided into a preamble and four sections, the last of these a short conclusion. The introduction begins by proclaiming \"A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre\". Pointing out that parties everywhere—including those in government and those in the opposition—have flung the \"branding reproach of communism\" at each other, the authors infer from this that the powers-that-be acknowledge communism to be a power in itself. Subsequently, the introduction exhorts Communists to openly publish their views and aims, to \"meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself\".\n\nThe first section of the \"Manifesto\", \"Bourgeois and Proletarians\", elucidates the materialist conception of history, that \"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". Societies have always taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited under the yoke of an oppressive minority. In capitalism, the industrial working class, or \"proletariat\", engage in class struggle against the owners of the means of production, the \"bourgeoisie\". As before, this struggle will end in a revolution that restructures society, or the \"common ruin of the contending classes\". The bourgeoisie, through the \"constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions\" have emerged as the supreme class in society, displacing all the old powers of feudalism. The bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for its labour power, creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. However, in doing so, the bourgeoisie serves as \"its own grave-diggers\"; the proletariat inevitably will become conscious of their own potential and rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.\n\n\"Proletarians and Communists\", the second section, starts by stating the relationship of conscious communists to the rest of the working class. The communists' party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike them, it will express the general will and defend the common interests of the world's proletariat as a whole, independent of all nationalities. The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, including claims that it advocates \"free love\" or disincentivises people from working. The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands—among them a progressive income tax; abolition of inheritances and private property; abolition of child labour; free public education; nationalisation of the means of transport and communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned etc.—the implementation of which would result in the precursor to a stateless and classless society.\n\nThe third section, \"Socialist and Communist Literature\", distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time—these being broadly categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism; and Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. While the degree of reproach toward rival perspectives varies, all are dismissed for advocating reformism and failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary role of the working class. \"Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties\", the concluding section of the \"Manifesto\", briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth century such as France, Switzerland, Poland, and Germany, this last being \"on the eve of a bourgeois revolution\", and predicts that a world revolution will soon follow. It ends by declaring an alliance with the social democrats, boldly supporting other communist revolutions, and calling for united international proletarian action—Working Men of All Countries, Unite!.\n\nIn spring 1847 Marx and Engels joined the League of the Just, who were quickly convinced by the duo's ideas of \"critical communism\". At its First Congress in 2–9 June, the League tasked Engels with drafting a \"profession of faith\", but such a document was later deemed inappropriate for an open, non-confrontational organisation. Engels nevertheless wrote the \"Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith\", detailing the League's programme. A few months later, in October, Engels arrived at the League's Paris branch to find that Moses Hess had written an inadequate manifesto for the group, now called the League of Communists. In Hess's absence, Engels severely criticised this manifesto, and convinced the rest of the League to entrust him with drafting a new one. This became the draft \"Principles of Communism\", described as \"less of a credo and more of an exam paper.\"\n\nOn 23 November, just before the Communist League's Second Congress (29 November – 8 December 1847), Engels wrote to Marx, expressing his desire to eschew the catechism format in favour of the manifesto, because he felt it \"must contain some history.\" On the 28th, Marx and Engels met at Ostend in Belgium, and a few days later, gathered at the Soho, London headquarters of the German Workers' Education Association to attend the Congress. Over the next ten days, intense debate raged between League functionaries; Marx eventually dominated the others and, overcoming \"stiff and prolonged opposition\", in Harold Laski's words, secured a majority for his programme. The League thus unanimously adopted a far more combative resolution than that at the First Congress in June. Marx (especially) and Engels were subsequently commissioned to draw up a manifesto for the League.\n\nUpon returning to Brussels, Marx engaged in \"ceaseless procrastination\", according to his biographer Francis Wheen. Working only intermittently on the manifesto, he spent much of his time delivering lectures on political economy at the German Workers' Education Association, writing articles for the \"Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung\", and giving a long speech on free trade. Following this, he even spent a week (17–26 January 1848) in Ghent to establish a branch of the Democratic Association there. Subsequently, having not heard from Marx for nearly two months, the Central Committee of the Communist League sent him an ultimatum on 24 or 26 January, demanding he submit the completed manuscript by 1 February. This imposition spurred Marx on, who struggled to work without a deadline, and he seems to have rushed to finish the job in time. (For evidence of this, historian Eric Hobsbawm points to the absence of rough drafts, only one page of which survives.)\n\nIn all, the \"Manifesto\" was written over 6–7 weeks. Although Engels is credited as co-writer, the final draft was penned exclusively by Marx. From the 26 January letter, Laski infers that even the League considered Marx to be the sole draftsman (and that he was merely their agent, imminently replaceable). Further, Engels himself wrote in 1883 that \"The basic thought running through the \"Manifesto\" ... belongs solely and exclusively to Marx.\" Although Laski doesn't disagree, he suggests that Engels underplays his own contribution with characteristic modesty, and points out the \"close resemblance between its substance and that of the [\"Principles of Communism\"]\". Laski argues that while writing the \"Manifesto\", Marx drew from the \"joint stock of ideas\" he developed with Engels, \"a kind of intellectual bank account upon which either could draw freely.\"\n\nIn late February 1848, the \"Manifesto\" was anonymously published by the Workers' Educational Association (\"Communistischer Arbeiterbildungsverein\") at Bishopsgate in the City of London. Written in German, the 23-page pamphlet was titled \"Manifest der kommunistischen Partei\" and had a dark-green cover. It was reprinted three times and serialised in the \"Deutsche Londoner Zeitung\", a newspaper for German \"émigré\"s. On 4 March, one day after the serialisation in the \"Zeitung\" began, Marx was expelled by Belgian police. Two weeks later, around 20 March, a thousand copies of the \"Manifesto\" reached Paris, and from there to Germany in early April. In April–May the text was corrected for printing and punctuation mistakes; Marx and Engels would use this 30-page version as the basis for future editions of the \"Manifesto\".\n\nAlthough the \"Manifesto\"s prelude announced that it was \"to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages\", the initial printings were only in German. Polish and Danish translations soon followed the German original in London, and by the end of 1848, a Swedish translation was published with a new title—\"The Voice of Communism: Declaration of the Communist Party\". In June–November 1850 the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\" was published in English for the first time when George Julian Harney serialised Helen Macfarlane's translation in his Chartist magazine \"The Red Republican\". (Her version begins, \"A frightful hobgoblin stalks throughout Europe. We are haunted by a ghost, the ghost of Communism.\") For her translation, the Lancashire-based Macfarlane probably consulted Engels, who had abandoned his own English translation half way. Harney's introduction revealed the \"Manifesto\"s hitherto-anonymous authors' identities for the first time.\nSoon after the \"Manifesto\" was published, Paris erupted in revolution to overthrow King Louis Philippe. The \"Manifesto\" played no role in this; a French translation was not published in Paris until just before the working-class June Days Uprising was crushed. Its influence in the Europe-wide revolutions of 1848 was restricted to Germany, where the Cologne-based Communist League and its newspaper \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\", edited by Marx, played an important role. Within a year of its establishment, in May 1849, the \"Zeitung\" was suppressed; Marx was expelled from Germany and had to seek lifelong refuge in London. In 1851, members of the Communist League's central board were arrested by the Prussian police. At their trial in Cologne 18 months later in late 1852 they were sentenced to 3–6 years' imprisonment. For Engels, the revolution was \"forced into the background by the reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated 'by law' in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852\".\n\nAfter the defeat of the 1848 revolutions the \"Manifesto\" fell into obscurity, where it remained throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Hobsbawm says that by November 1850 the \"Manifesto\" \"had become sufficiently scarce for Marx to think it worth reprinting section III ... in the last issue of his [short-lived] London magazine\". Over the next two decades only a few new editions were published; these include an (unauthorised and occasionally inaccurate) 1869 Russian translation by Mikhail Bakunin in Geneva and an 1866 edition in Berlin—the first time the \"Manifesto\" was published in Germany. According to Hobsbawm, \"By the middle 1860s virtually nothing that Marx had written in the past was any longer in print.\" However John Cowell-Stepney did publish an abridged version in the \"Social Economist\" in August/September 1869, in time for the Basle Congress.\n\nIn the early 1870s, the \"Manifesto\" and its authors experienced a revival in fortunes. Hobsbawm identifies three reasons for this. The first is the leadership role Marx played in the International Workingmen's Association (aka the First International). Secondly, Marx also came into much prominence among socialists—and equal notoriety among the authorities—for his support of the Paris Commune of 1871, elucidated in \"The Civil War in France\". Lastly, and perhaps most significantly in the popularisation of the \"Manifesto\", was the treason trial of German Social Democratic Party (SPD) leaders. During the trial prosecutors read the \"Manifesto\" out loud as evidence; this meant that the pamphlet could legally be published in Germany. Thus in 1872 Marx and Engels rushed out a new German-language edition, writing a preface that identified that several portions that became outdated in the quarter century since its original publication. This edition was also the first time the title was shortened to \"The Communist Manifesto\" (\"Das Kommunistische Manifest\"), and it became the bedrock the authors based future editions upon. Between 1871 and 1873, the \"Manifesto\" was published in over nine editions in six languages; in 1872 it was published in the United States for the first time, serialised in \"Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly\" of New York City. However, by the mid 1870s the \"Communist Manifesto\" remained Marx and Engels' only work to be even moderately well-known.\n\nOver the next forty years, as social-democratic parties rose across Europe and parts of the world, so did the publication of the \"Manifesto\" alongside them, in hundreds of editions in thirty languages. Marx and Engels wrote a new preface for the 1882 Russian edition, translated by Georgi Plekhanov in Geneva. In it they wondered if Russia could directly become a communist society, or if she would become capitalist first like other European countries. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels alone provided the prefaces for five editions between 1888 and 1893. Among these is the 1888 English edition, translated by Samuel Moore and approved by Engels, who also provided notes throughout the text. It has been the standard English-language edition ever since.\n\nThe principal region of its influence, in terms of editions published, was in the \"central belt of Europe\", from Russia in the east to France in the west. In comparison, the pamphlet had little impact on politics in southwest and southeast Europe, and moderate presence in the north. Outside Europe, Chinese and Japanese translations were published, as were Spanish editions in Latin America. This uneven geographical spread in the \"Manifesto\"s popularity reflected the development of socialist movements in a particular region as well as the popularity of Marxist variety of socialism there. There was not always a strong correlation between a social-democratic party's strength and the \"Manifesto\"s popularity in that country. For instance, the German SPD printed only a few thousand copies of the \"Communist Manifesto\" every year, but a few hundred thousand copies of the \"Erfurt Programme\". Further, the mass-based social-democratic parties of the Second International did not require their rank and file to be well-versed in theory; Marxist works such as the \"Manifesto\" or \"Das Kapital\" were read primarily by party theoreticians. On the other hand, small, dedicated militant parties and Marxist sects in the West took pride in knowing the theory; Hobsbawm says \"This was the milieu in which 'the clearness of a comrade could be gauged invariably from the number of earmarks on his Manifesto.\n\nFollowing the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Vladimir Lenin-led Bolsheviks to power in Russia, the world's first socialist state was founded explicitly along Marxist lines. The Soviet Union, which Bolshevik Russia would become a part of, was a one-party state under the rule of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Unlike their mass-based counterparts of the Second International, the CPSU and other Leninist parties like it in the Third International expected their members to know the classic works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Further, party leaders were expected to base their policy decisions on Marxist-Leninist ideology. Therefore works such as the \"Manifesto\" were required reading for the party rank-and-file.\n\nTherefore the widespread dissemination of Marx and Engels' works became an important policy objective; backed by a sovereign state, the CPSU had relatively inexhaustible resources for this purpose. Works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin were published on a very large scale, and cheap editions of their works were available in several languages across the world. These publications were either shorter writings or they were compendia such as the various editions of Marx and Engels' \"Selected Works\", or their \"Collected Works\". This affected the destiny of the \"Manifesto\" in several ways. Firstly, in terms of circulation; in 1932 the American and British Communist Parties printed several hundred thousand copies of a cheap edition for \"probably the largest mass edition ever issued in English\". Secondly the work entered political-science syllabuses in universities, which would only expand after the Second World War. For its centenary in 1948, its publication was no longer the exclusive domain of Marxists and academicians; general publishers too printed the \"Manifesto\" in large numbers. \"In short, it was no longer only a classic Marxist document,\" Hobsbawm noted, \"it had become a political classic \"tout court\".\"\n\nEven after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the 1990s, the \"Communist Manifesto\" remains ubiquitous; Hobsbawm says that \"In states without censorship, almost certainly anyone within reach of a good bookshop, and certainly anyone within reach of a good library, not to mention the internet, can have access to it.\" The 150th anniversary once again brought a deluge of attention in the press and the academia, as well as new editions of the book fronted by introductions to the text by academics. One of these, \"The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition\" by Verso, was touted by a critic in the \"London Review of Books\" as being a \"stylish red-ribboned edition of the work. It is designed as a sweet keepsake, an exquisite collector's item. In Manhattan, a prominent Fifth Avenue store put copies of this choice new edition in the hands of shop-window mannequins, displayed in come-hither poses and fashionable décolletage.\"\n\nA number of late-20th- and 21st-century writers have commented on the \"Communist Manifesto\"s continuing relevance. In a special issue of the \"Socialist Register\" commemorating the \"Manifesto\"s 150th anniversary, Peter Osborne argued that it was 'the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century.' Academic John Raines in 2002 noted that \"In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read \"The Communist Manifesto\", written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx foresaw it all.\" In 2003, the English Marxist Chris Harman stated, \"There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where its going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today's world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and 'overproduction' on the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation.\" Alex Callinicos, editor of \"International Socialism\", stated in 2010 that \"This is indeed a manifesto for the 21st century.\" Writing in \"The London Evening Standard\" in 2012, Andrew Neather cited Verso Books' 2012 re-edition of \"The Communist Manifesto\", with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm, as part of a resurgence of left-wing-themed ideas which includes the publication of Owen Jones' best-selling \"\" and Jason Barker's documentary \"Marx Reloaded\".\nIn contrast, critics such as Revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Eduard Bernstein distinguished between \"immature\" early Marxism—as exemplified by the \"Communist Manifesto\" written by Marx and Engels in their youth—that he opposed for its violent Blanquist tendencies, and later \"mature\" Marxism that he supported. This latter form refers to Marx in his later life acknowledging that socialism could be achieved through peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies. Bernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working-class claimed in the \"Communist Manifesto\" did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that the working-class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself, later in his life, acknowledged that the middle-class was not disappearing in his work \"Theories of Surplus Value\" (1863). The obscurity of the later work means that Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known. George Boyer described the \"Manifesto\" as \"very much a period piece, a document of what was called the 'hungry' 1840s.\"\n\nMany have drawn attention to the passage in the \"Manifesto\" that seems to sneer at the stupidity of the rustic: \"The bourgeoisie ... draws all nations ... into civilisation ... It has created enormous cities ... and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic!] of rural life\". As Eric Hobsbawm noted, however:\n\nMarx and Engels’ political influences were wide-ranging, reacting to and taking inspiration from German idealist philosophy, French socialism, and English and Scottish political economy. \"The Communist Manifesto\" also takes influence from literature. In Jacques Derrida’s work, \"Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International\", he uses Shakespeare’s \"Hamlet\" to frame a discussion of the history of the International, showing, in the process, the influence that Shakespeare’s work had on Marx and Engel’s writing. In his essay, “Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx,” Christopher N. Warren makes the case that English poet John Milton also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engel’s work. Historians of 19th-century reading habits have confirmed that Marx and Engels would have read these authors, and it is known that Marx loved Shakespeare, in particular. Milton, Warren argues, also shows a notable influence on \"The Communist Manifesto\": “Looking back on Milton’s era, Marx saw a historical dialectic founded on inspiration in which freedom of the press, republicanism, and revolution were closely joined.” Milton’s republicanism, Warren continues, served as \"a useful, if unlikely, bridge\" as Marx and Engels sought to forge a revolutionary international coalition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19678111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19678111", "title": "Ultimate attribution error", "text": "Ultimate attribution error\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is a group-level attribution error that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in ingroup and outgroup members. \nUltimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their personality, and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication \"The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice\". As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of Gordon Allport's work in attribution theory.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly genetically determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) \"exceptional case\", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.\n\nIn general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and stereotypes toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other races, religions, cultures, or even social class as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted.\n\nThe attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived locus of control of act (internal vs external).\n\nThe \"exceptional case\" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the \"good\" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as \"bad\".\n\nThe \"luck or special advantage\" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. \"Special advantage\" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance.\n\nThe \"highly motivated\" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member.\n\nSimilar to the \"exceptional case\" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.\n\nThe \"situational\" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members. In a 2x2 between-group design, Hindu or Muslim participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups.\n\nPrior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that White participants viewed Black individuals as more violent than White individuals in an \"ambiguous shove\" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person. In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).\n\nMorris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant. In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.\n\nTogether, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.\n\nSupporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990. The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:\n\n"}

It also houses a library and an art collection, and it is the site of Italian and English gardens. Villa I Tatti is located on an estate of olive groves, vineyards, and gardens on the border of Florence, Fiesole and Settignano.\n\nVilla I Tatti is not generally open to the public.\n\nFor almost sixty years Villa I Tatti was the home of Bernard Berenson (1865–1959), the connoisseur whose attributions of early Italian Renaissance painting guided scholarship and collecting in this field for the first half of the twentieth century. It houses the Berenson collection of Italian primitives, and of Chinese and Islamic art, as well as a research library of 140,000 volumes and a collection of 250,000 photographs.\n\nIn 1900 Bernard Berenson married Mary Whitall Pearsall Smith, who had formerly been married to the British politician, Frank Costelloe. Mary Berenson came from a liberal Quaker family from Philadelphia, and had two daughters from her previous marriage, but the marriage to Berenson remained childless. The couple moved to I Tatti shortly before their marriage, first renting the property from the expatriate English aristocrat, John Temple Leader, and then in 1907 buying it outright from Temple Leader’s heir, Lord Westbury. Between 1907 and 1915 the seventeenth-century farmhouse became a Renaissance-style villa under the direction of the English architect and writer Geoffrey Scott, while a formal garden in the Anglo-Italian Renaissance style was laid out by the English landscape architect Cecil Pinsent.\n\nBerenson envisaged Villa I Tatti as a “lay monastery” for the leisurely study of Mediterranean culture through its art. He was against academic production, specialization, degrees, and what are now called in the Italian academic world “titoli”, and instead prized the slow maturing of ideas in tranquil contemplation. He considered his own achievement to lie as much in conversation as in writing.\n\nBerenson died at the age of 94 in 1959 after bequeathing the estate, the collection, and the library to Harvard University. “Villa I Tatti, The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies”, as it was officially named, opened its doors to six fellows in 1961. In the intervening five decades since then it has welcomed over 700 fellows and visiting scholars from the United States and Canada, almost all of the European countries east and west, as well as Japan and Australia.\n\nBerenson’s esteem for Harvard dated from his youth. He arrived in Boston at age ten as a poor Jewish immigrant from Lithuania. His brilliance was soon recognized and, after finishing the Boston Latin School and completing a year at Boston University, he was supported through Harvard College by wealthier members of Boston society, graduating with the class of 1887. His interests there were in literature and ancient and oriental languages. He trained himself as a connoisseur of early Italian painting by travel throughout Europe and especially Italy, beginning in 1887. As early as 1915 he expressed his intention to leave his house and library to Harvard, and he reaffirmed his intention in 1937, in a letter published in the fiftieth-anniversary volume of his Harvard class. However, Fascism, war, and post-war travail in Italy led Harvard to hesitate, and the bequest was only formally accepted by the Harvard Corporation at the time of Berenson’s death in 1959, opening its doors to the first class of fellows in 1961.\n\nThe garden was created by the then young and inexperienced garden designer Cecil Pinsent. Pinsent had been touring Tuscany making topographic drawings of buildings together with his friend Geoffrey Scott; they were both hired through Scott's connection with Berenson's wife, Mary. I Tatti was to become a formidable test, through which Pinsent could become a recognized specialist of the formal garden.\n\nThe Green Garden at I Tatti was Pinsent's first attempt to recreate a garden in the early Renaissance style. It was conceived as an outdoor extension of the house, an unfolding sequence, designed with the open intention of reviving the Italian style The steep slopes were made into terraced \"floors\" and the walkways and stairways that connect the various floors were paved with mosaics of cobblestones. A large water tank enables \"english style\" lawns. Tall cypress trees screen the garden and box hedges divide its compartments. In the words of horticulturist presenter Monty Don, \"[Pinsent] has ruthlessly excluded all colour except green\".\n\nI Tatti is set in a mythic landscape. The stony hillsides above it, pockmarked by quarries that supplied the pietra serena for Renaissance Florence, bred masons and sculptors. Nearby Settignano was home to the sculptor Desiderio da Settignano and to the infant Michelangelo, who was sent there to nurse at his family’s estate (the Villa Michelangelo). A number of houses in the area are given out as the refuge of Boccaccio during the plague and thus the setting of the Decameron. Boccaccio’s Arcadian poem, the Ninfale fiesolano, celebrates the Mensola, a stream flowing through the property. The scarred and over-quarried hillsides were reforested with cypresses by Temple Leader in the late nineteenth century, giving them their present sylvan aspect. Anglo-American villa culture flourished in the area at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\n“Villa I Tatti, The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies” is owned and administered by Harvard University, but it is not the typical American student program abroad. Rather, Harvard conceives of Villa I Tatti as an international institution for the advancement of Italian Renaissance studies on the post-doctoral level. Villa I Tatti is one of three centers for advanced research in the humanities belonging to Harvard but located outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The others are Dumbarton Oaks, founded in 1940 for Byzantine, pre-Columbian and garden and landscape studies, and the Center for Hellenic Studies, founded in 1962, both in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile remaining true to the principal outlines of Berenson’s vision, Harvard altered Berenson’s intended structure by admitting other fields than art history. History and literature were present from the beginning of the Center’s existence as a Harvard research institute, and music followed upon the establishment of a library in music history, funded generously by gifts from Elizabeth and Gordon Morrill. It was Harvard’s insistence on a mix of fields that gives I Tatti its distinctive character. Although “interdisciplinary” was not much in use as a term in 1961, the Center was effectively an interdisciplinary institution from the start.\n\nEach year fifteen full-year fellows are chosen from about 110-120 applicants. All have the doctorate at the time of application but are still in the early phase of their careers. Senior distinguished scholars are not eligible for the fellowship, but every year the director invites some who come without stipend as Visiting Professors in Residence. In a given year perhaps a third of the fellowships tend to be in art history, a third in history, and a third in literature and music. There are no quotas of nation. About half of the fellows over almost 50 years have been from the United States and Canada and half from other countries.\n\nIn addition to the fifteen year-long fellowships there are a number of short-term awards aimed at specific groups. A limited number of Mellon Visiting Fellowships, for periods ranging from three to six months, are available each academic year for advanced research in any aspect of the Italian Renaissance. This Fellowship is designed to reach out to Italian Renaissance scholars from areas that have been under-represented at I Tatti, especially those living and working in Asia, Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean basin (except Italy and France) and the Islamic countries. There is a similar three-month award, named after I Tatti's third director the Craig Hugh Smyth Fellowship, for Renaissance scholars whose career paths do not normally allow sabbaticals or afford extended summer vacations, such as museum curators.\n\nBerenson described I Tatti as a library with a house attached. Library spaces were added to I Tatti in 1909, 1915, 1923 and 1948–54. The shelf space created during Berenson’s lifetime was doubled in 1985 when an additional section, the Paul E. Geier Library, was created in one of the former farm buildings. The wing of the library built by Berenson in 1948–54 was recently renovated by the Roman architectural firm of Garofalo and Miura and renamed in honor of I Tatti’s third director and his wife, Craig Hugh Smyth and Barbara Linforth Smyth. Opened in October 2009, the new Smyth Library effectively doubled both the wing’s original shelving capacity and the number of workspaces available there.\n\nAt his death Berenson left a large personal library of 50,000 volumes, principally dedicated to Mediterranean culture seen through its art and archeology. It also included significant holdings in Chinese, Indian and Near Eastern art, reflecting his collecting interests in those fields. The books were located in a library designed by Cecil Pinsent in 1915, but, also scattered throughout the house. It was not conceived as an interdisciplinary Renaissance library from the beginning but as a reflection of Berenson’s personal interests. Italian literature was not strongly represented and music was absent. During the early decades of the institution’s life it became a priority to flesh out the library’s holdings in areas of Renaissance studies not collected by Berenson himself, and to initiate periodical subscriptions in these fields.\n\nTransformed from a rich but idiosyncratic personal library into a modern research library, the Biblioteca Berenson aims to provide comprehensive research-level coverage of current scholarly publications in all fields of Italian art, architecture, history, science, medicine, society, culture and literature approximately from 1200 to 1650. Research tools are also acquired in adjacent fields such as northern Europe in the same period, medieval studies, and Byzantine and Islamic cultures around the Mediterranean, especially where these relate to Renaissance Italy. It tries to provide modern editions of many of the works of Greek and Latin literature. Currently it holds some 140,000 volumes, which include 106,000 books, 7,000 offprints, 14,000 auction catalogues, and 23,000 periodical volumes. Over 600 periodicals are currently received, most with complete runs from the start of publication.\n\nIn 1993 I Tatti joined with three other research libraries in Florence to form a consortium for joint, on-line cataloging, IRIS, which now counts seven member libraries. The Biblioteca Berenson is also one of the 73 libraries that form the Harvard College Library and its holdings are accessible through the Harvard on-line catalogue, HOLLIS. In addition, the considerable electronic resources available through the Harvard library are also available at I Tatti, which makes it one of the largest collections of electronic resources in Italy.\n\nEstablished by a gift from F. Gordon Morrill and Elizabeth Morrill, the Morrill Music library has been part of the Biblioteca Berenson since 1966. It covers all western music from the Greeks to the early baroque period, with emphasis on Italian music composed up to 1640. It includes 4,150 scores and 4,300 critical studies, monographs, treatises, and reference works; it subscribes to 84 journal titles. There is also an extensive microfilm collection of musical manuscripts and early printed books. The aim is to acquire every published work in Italian musicology for the period up to 1640.\n\nThe Fototeca Berenson contained 170,000 photographs at Berenson’s death and now contains approximately 250,000 photographs. They are organized topographically, according to Berenson’s original scheme: Florence, Siena, Central Italy, Northern Italy, Lombardy, Venice, Southern Italy, and within each school by artist and location. A section of the Fototeca is devoted to images of “homeless” works of art—the term used by Berenson for objects that were once on the art market but whose presents locations are now unknown. The versos of many photographs contain handwritten notes by Bernard and Mary Berenson, Nicky Mariano and other art connoisseurs from the first half of the twentieth century. A project to digitize the Fototeca Berenson, making its holdings accessible through the Harvard Libraries’ website, is currently in progress.\n\nApart from the main collection of photographs on Renaissance painting, there are other minor sections of images representing sculpture, medieval art, Byzantine and early Christian architecture. Of particular importance are the photos taken by the Islamic architectural historian Archibald Creswell and the collection of some 2,000 vintage prints with views of India from the photographers Johnston & Hoffmann.\n\nBernard and Mary Berenson cultivated many friendships through letters. Their letters of their correspondents and some of their own letters are kept in the Berenson Archive, together with diaries, notes, drafts of books, personal photographs and other biographical material. The Archive has been enriched since the founding of the Harvard Center by gifts or acquisitions of papers pertaining to Giorgio Castelfranco, Kenneth Clark, Andrea Francalanci, Frederick Hartt, Giuseppe Marchini, Emilio Marcucci, Nicky Mariano, Roberto and Livia Papini, Valeria Piacentini, Laurance P. and Isabel M. Roberts, Stanislaus Eric Steenbok and the Whitall Pearsall Smith family.\n\nI Tatti is home to the art collection of Bernard and Mary Berenson, which includes an important collection of about 100 late Medieval and Renaissance Italian paintings. The painting collection was formed between ca. 1900 and ca. 1920, with few additions thereafter. Shortly before his death in 1959, Berenson donated his Madonna and Child by Ambrogio Lorenzetti to the Uffizi, which owned two smaller paintings that originally came from the same dismembered altarpiece. The most famous works in the collection, and among the first to be acquired by the Berensons, are three panels depicting St. Francis in Glory, The Blessed Rainieri Rasini, and St. John the Baptist coming from the Sansepolcro Altarpiece by the Sienese painter Sassetta (painted 1437–1444). A comprehensive modern catalogue of the Berenson Collection of Italian paintings is currently in preparation.\n\nBernard Berenson also formed a smaller but important collection of Oriental art, including works from China, Japan, Tibet, Thailand, Java, Cambodia and Burma. Berenson also assembled a small but significant collection of Near Eastern manuscripts, including an illuminated page from the renowned fourteenth-century Great Mongol (formerly Demotte) Shahnama.\n\nI Tatti’s scholarly programs provide a special forum for discussion, and have become increasingly crucial to the Center’s mission of creating bridges with its sister institutions and the international scholarly community. There is also an active program of public lectures by outside scholars and shop-talks by fellows. In addition, I Tatti organizes and hosts one or two symposia or giornate di studio each semester which bring scholars from other countries.\n\nEach year I Tatti hosts the Bernard Berenson Lectures, a series of three interconnected lectures on a given theme, presented by a senior scholar of worldwide renown in the field of Renaissance studies. Each cycle of Berenson Lectures is published by Harvard University Press. In addition to publication of the acts of various conferences, select monographs, and the annual Berenson Lectures, there is an annual journal for scholarly essays on Renaissance subjects in English and Italian, I Tatti Studies, which was founded in 1985.\n\nRecently a series of monographs on Renaissance history has been initiated with Harvard University Press, the I Tatti Studies in Italian Renaissance History, under the general editorship of Edward Muir.\n\nUnder the editorship of James Hankins of Harvard, Harvard University Press also publishes the I Tatti Renaissance Library, which is modeled on the Loeb Classical Library and aims to publish the major literary, historical, philosophical and scientific works of the Italian Renaissance written in Latin with modern English translation on facing pages. Forty-one volumes have appeared to date and about 120 more are envisaged in the course of the next decade. The series will put this “lost continent” of Latin literature within the reach of scholars and students in many fields.\n\nBoth the fellowship and the scholarly events have been enhanced by the completion late in 2010 of the Deborah Loeb Brice Loggiato, site of fellows' studies and a small auditorium, the Gould Hall, on the designed by Charles Brickbauer.\n\nThe concerts of early music organized by the Morrill Music Library are an integral part of the academic activities at Villa I Tatti. They range from intimate performances for the I Tatti community, often on period instruments, to those performed by early music groups for a wider audience. The series Early Music at I Tatti, established in 2002 by Joseph Connors with Kathryn Bosi, offers twice-yearly concerts performed by musicians of international renown. These aim to present to the Florentine community innovative programs of early music centering on a particular theme or idea, such as an examination of the concept of humor in Renaissance music (Early Music at I Tatti, II), the role of music in medieval thought (Early Music at I Tatti, I) or the traditional repertoire deriving from the therapeutic effects of music on the bite of the tarantula spider in southern Italy (Early Music at I Tatti, XII). Many offer repertoires which are rarely heard in Italy today, ranging from works by one of the earliest known Florentine composers, Paolo da Firenze (fl. 1390–1425) (Early Music at I Tatti, VII), to music written for the Habsburg court at Vienna in the mid seventeenth century by Italian composers favored by the Austrian emperors (Early Music at I Tatti, IX). Contemporary music is sometimes an integral part of the programs: Early Music at I Tatti, IV juxtaposed Petrarch settings by Renaissance composers with settings by the English composer Gavin Bryars, while Early Music at I Tatti, VIII focused on the fruitful relationship which has developed between contemporary composers and performers of early music. Both concerts featured world premieres of new works written for the occasion.\n\n\nThose on Wikipedia include Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Margaret Bent, Derek Bok, Gene Brucker, Howard Burns, Giulio Calvi, Joseph Connors, Janet Cox-Rearick, Georges Didi-Huberman, Caroline Elam, Sydney Joseph Freedberg, Carlo Ginzburg; James Hankins, Frederick Hartt, William Hood, Deborah Howard, John W.
