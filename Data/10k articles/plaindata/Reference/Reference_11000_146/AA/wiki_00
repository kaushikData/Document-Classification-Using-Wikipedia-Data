First published in 1763 by C.W. Ettinger in Gotha in Thuringia, Germany, at the ducal court of Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, it came to be regarded as an authority in the classification of monarchies and their courts, reigning and former dynasties, princely and ducal families, and the genealogical, biographical and titulary details of Europe's highest level of aristocracy. It was published from 1785 annually by Justus Perthes Publishing House in Gotha, until 1944. The Soviets destroyed the \"Almanach de Gotha's\" archives in 1945.\n\nIn 1998, a London-based publisher acquired the rights for use of the title of \"Almanach de Gotha\" from Justus Perthes Verlag Gotha GmbH. Perthes regard the resultant volumes as new works, and not as a continuation of the editions which Perthes had published from 1785 to 1944. The new volumes have been widely criticized for inaccuracies and errors Two volumes have been printed since 1998, with Volume I containing lists of the sovereign, formerly sovereign and mediatised houses of Europe, and a diplomatic and statistical directory; and Volume II containing lists of the non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe.\n\nThe original \"Almanach de Gotha\" provided detailed facts and statistics on nations of the world, including their reigning and formerly reigning houses, those of Europe being more complete than those of other continents. It also named the highest incumbent officers of state, members of the diplomatic corps, and Europe's upper nobility with their families. Although at its most extensive the \"Almanach\" numbered more than 1200 pages, fewer than half of which were dedicated to monarchical or aristocratic data, it acquired a reputation for the breadth and precision of its information on royalty and nobility compared to other almanacs.\n\nThe \"Almanach\"'s publication by Justus Perthes began at the ducal court of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany and, its reigning dynasty was listed first therein well into the 19th century, usually followed by kindred sovereigns of the House of Wettin and then, in alphabetical order, other families of princely rank, ruling and non-ruling. Although always published in French, other almanacs in French and English were more widely sold internationally. The almanac's structure changed and its scope expanded over the years. The second portion, called the \"Annuaire diplomatique et statistique\" (\"Diplomatic and Statistical Yearbook\"), provided demographic and governmental information by nation, similar to other almanacs. Its first portion, called the \"Annuaire généalogique\" (\"Genealogical Yearbook\"), came to consist essentially of three sections: reigning and formerly reigning families, mediatized families and non-sovereign families at least one of whose members bore the title of prince or duke.\n\nThe first section always listed Europe's sovereign houses, whether they ruled as emperor, king, grand duke, duke, prince (or some other title, e.g., prince elector, margrave, landgrave, count palatine or pope). Until 1810 these sovereign houses were listed alongside such families and entities as Barbiano-Belgiojoso, Clary, Colloredo, Furstenberg, the Emperor, Genoa, Gonzaga, Hatzfeld, Jablonowski, Kinsky, Ligne, Paar, Radziwill, Starhemberg, Thurn and Taxis, Turkey, Venice and the Order of Malta and the Teutonic Knights. In 1812, these entries began to be listed in groups. First were German sovereigns who held the rank of grand duke or prince elector and above (the Duke of Saxe-Gotha was, however, listed here along with, but before, France—see below).\n\nListed next were Germany's reigning ducal and princely dynasties under the heading \"College of Princes\", e.g., Hohenzollern, Isenburg, Leyen, Liechtenstein and the other Saxon duchies. They were followed by heads of non-German monarchies, i.e. Austria, Brazil, Great Britain, etc. Fourthly were listed non-reigning dukes and princes, whether mediatized or not, including Arenberg, Croy, Furstenberg alongside Batthyany, Jablonowski, Sulkowski, Porcia and Benevento.\n\nIn 1841 a third group was added to those of the sovereign dynasties and the non-reigning princely and ducal families. It was composed exclusively of the mediatized families of comital rank recognized as belonging, since 1825, to the same historical category and sharing some of the same privileges as reigning dynasties by the various states of the German Confederation; these families were German with a few exceptions (e.g. Bentinck, Rechteren-Limpurg). The 1815 treaty of the Congress of Vienna had authorized — and Article 14 of the German Confederation's \"Bundesakt\" (charter) recognized — retention from the German Imperial regime of equality of birth for marital purposes of mediatized families (called \"Standesherren\") to reigning dynasties. The almanac added a third section consisting exclusively of mediatized families of comital rank.\n\nIn 1877, the mediatized comital families were moved from section III to section II A, where they joined the princely mediatized families. For the first time in the century of its existence, the largely non-German, un-mediatized princely and ducal families of the \"Almanach de Gotha\" were removed from the same section as other non-reigning families bearing princely titles. While non-mediatized German and Austrian families (e.g. Lichnowsky, Wrede), were likewise relocated from the almanac's second to its third section, the second section's new preponderance of German families, princely and comital, which were henceforth recognized as possessing the exclusive privilege of inter-marriage with reigning dynasties was salient: Excluded were members of such historically notable families as the Rohans, Orsinis, Ursels, Norfolks, Czartoryskis, Galitzines, La Rochefoucaulds, Kinskys, Radziwills, Merodes, Dohnas and Albas.\n\nAlthough theoretically mediatized families were distinguished from Europe's other nobility by the former status of their territories as \"Reichsstand\" and their exercise within the Holy Roman Empire of \"semi-sovereignty\" or imperial immediacy (\"Reichsunmittelbarkeit\"), many \"Standesherr\" families, especially those bearing the comital title, had not been fully recognized as legally possessing immediate status within the Empire prior to its collapse in 1806. No other families whose highest title was count were admitted to any section of the almanac.\n\nMoreover, other deposed European dynasties (e.g. Arenberg, Biron, Dadiani, Boncompagni-Ludovisi, Giray, Murat) did not benefit \"vis-a-vis\" the almanac from a similar interpretation of their historical status. Many princely or ducal families were listed only in its third, non-dynastic section or were excluded altogether, evoking criticism in the 20th century from such genealogists as Cyril Toumanoff, Jean-Engelbert, Duke d'Arenberg and William Addams Reitwiesner, the latter commenting that the changes displayed \"pan-German triumphalism\" and even a \"fairly nasty bit of Germanic chauvinism.\"\n\nEven in the early 19th century the almanac's retention of deposed dynasties evoked objections, although not necessarily the desired changes. The elected Emperor Napoleon protested in writing to his foreign minister, Champagny: \"Monsieur de Champagny, this year's \"Almanach de Gotha\" is badly done. First comes the Comte de Lille [title used in exile by Louis de Bourbon, Count of Provence -- future King Louis XVIII of France], followed by all the princes of the Confederation as if no change has been made in the constitution of Germany; the family of France is named inappropriately therein. Summon the Minister of Gotha, who is to be made to understand that in the next Almanach all of this is to be changed. The House of France must be referred to as in the [French] Imperial Almanac; there must be no further mention of the Comte de Lille, nor of any German prince other than those retained by the Articles of Confederation of the Rhine. You are to insist that the article be transmitted to you prior to publication. If other almanacs are printed in my allies' realms with inappropriate references to the Bourbons and the House of France, instruct my ministers to make it known that you have taken note, and that this is to be changed by next year.\"\n\nThe response of the publishers was to humour Napoleon by producing two editions: one for France, with the recently ennobled, and another which included dynasties deposed since abolition of the Holy Roman Empire. A merged version, whose first section including recently reigning dynasties but also families which lost sovereignty after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, remained in publication until 1944, and has been replicated in subsequent dynastic compilations (e.g., \"Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser\", \"Le Petit Gotha\", Ruvigny's \"Titled Nobility of Europe\").\n\nIn 1887 the \"Almanach\" began to include non-European dynasties in its first section, with the inclusion of one of the ruling families of India.\n\nWhen Soviet troops entered Gotha in 1945, they systematically destroyed all archives of the \"Almanach de Gotha\".\n\nIn 1951 a different publisher, C.A. Starke, began publication of a multi-volume German-language publication entitled the \"Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels\" (). The publication is divided into subsets; the \"Fürstliche Häuser\" subset is largely equivalent to the German language \"Gothaischer Hofkalender\" and its \"Fürstlichen Häuser\" volume which was also published by Perthes, or sections 1, 2 and 3 of the \"Almanach de Gotha\". However, no single volume of the \"Fürstliche Häuser\" includes all the families included in the \"Hofkalender\" or \"Almanach de Gotha\". It is necessary to use multiple volumes to trace the majority of European royal families.\n\nIn 1989 the family of Justus Perthes re-established its right to the use of the name \"Almanach de Gotha\". The family then sold these rights in 1995 to a new company, Almanach de Gotha Limited, formed in London. The new publishers launched with the 182nd edition on 16 March 1998 at Claridge's Hotel. It was written in English instead of French as the editor felt that English was now the language of diplomacy. Charlotte Pike served as editor of the 1998 edition only and John Kennedy as managing director and publisher. The new publishers also revived the Committee of Patrons under the presidency of King Juan Carlos I of Spain and chairmanship of King Michael I of Romania.\n\nThe London publisher produced a further four editions of volume I (1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004) based on the 1998 edition of volume I which include Europe's and South America's reigning, formerly reigning, and mediatised princely houses, and a single edition of volume II in 2001 edited by John Kennedy and Ghislain Crassard which include other non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe. A review in \"The Economist\" criticised the low editorial standards and attacked volume II for a lack of genealogical accuracy. After a gap of eight years a new edition of volume I was published in 2012 under the editorship of John James. A review in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" praised the 2012 volume I for a \"punctilious itemization of titles, lineage and heraldry [aiming] for scholarship rather than sensation...Some family legends – such as the Ottoman boast of descent from a grandson of Noah – do not merit inclusion in a work with authoritative aspirations. Most quixotically of all, the title page displays the word 'Annual', although it has been eight years since the last edition appeared.\"\n\nAs it was the practice of the diplomatic corps to employ official titles, adhere to local precedence and etiquette, and to tender congratulations and condolences to members of the dynasty of the nation to which they were assigned, the almanac included a \"Calendrier des Diplomates\" (\"Diplomats' Calendar\") section, which detailed major national holidays, anniversaries, ceremonies and royal birthdates.\n\nFollowing World War I and the fall of many royal houses, fewer regulatory authorities remained to authenticate use of titles; however the \"Almanach de Gotha\" continued the practice of strict verification of information, requesting certified copies of letters patent, genealogies confirmed by competent authorities, documents, decrees and references for titles claimed. Europe's middle and lower nobility (families whose principal title ranked below that of prince or duke — except mediatized families, listed in a section of their own) were not included in the almanac. Nor were the grandees or ducal families of Portugal and Spain (where titles, being habitually transmissible through both male and female lines, were often inherited by relatives of non-patrilineal lineage). Families of some Italian and East European nations (e.g., Russia, Romania), where the princely title was claimed by many, were also incomplete. Yet the reigning, formerly reigning and noble families included in the almanac numbered in the hundreds by the time it ceased publication in 1944.\n\nIn 1890 the almanac renamed II A to section II, and II B to section III. Dynasties ruling non-European nations were located in section I B. Families which became extinct were listed for the final time in the year following death of the last member, male or female, and subsequent editions referred readers to that volume.\n\nFamilies that ceased to be included for other reasons, such as lack of proof of a family's legitimate descendants or discovery that it did not hold a valid princely or ducal title, were henceforth excluded but added, along with dates of previous insertion, to a list following the last section of each \"Annuaire Genealogique\" (Genealogical Yearbook), which page was entitled \"Liste des Maisons authrefois publiees dans la 3e partie de l'Almanach de Gotha\" (\"List of Houses formerly published in the 3rd section of the \"Almanach de Gotha\".\") \n\nFrom 1927, the almanac ceased to include all families in each year's edition, henceforth rotating entries every few years. Where titles and styles (such as Serene Highness) had ceased to be recognized by national governments (e.g. Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia), the almanac provided associated dates and details, but continued to attribute such titles and styles to individuals and families, consistent with its practice since the French revolution; deposed sovereigns and dynasties continued to be accorded their former titles and rank, but dates of deposition were noted, and titles exclusively associated with sovereignty (e.g. emperor, queen, grand duke, crown princess) were not accorded to those who had not borne them during the monarchy. Titles of pretence below sovereign rank were accorded to members of formerly reigning dynasties as reported by heads of their houses, otherwise self-assumed titles were not used. The almanac included an explicit disclaimer announcing that known biographical details, such as birthdates and divorces, would not be suppressed.\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Toronto, Ontario, it is the largest independent LGBTQ+ archive in the world.\n\nThe Archives were established in 1973 by \"The Body Politics editorial collective (also known as the Pink Triangle Press). Originally named the Canadian Gay Liberation Movement Archives, the organization became the Canadian Gay Archives\"' in 1975; established a separate collective in 1976; incorporated in 1980; received Charitable status in 1981; formed a board of directors in 1992; and adopted its current name in 1993.\n\nBeginning as a one-cupboard reference collection co-housed with Pink Triangle Press, the Archives relocated to an independent location on Temperance Street in downtown Toronto in 1992.\n\nIn November 2005, the CLGA moved to a temporary location at 65 Wellesley Street in the city's Church and Wellesley gay village, launched a fundraising campaign, and began the search for a permanent home in the same area. The historic Jared Sessions house at 34 Isabella Street,built in 1860, was donated to the Archives by the city's Children's Aid Society after CAS began construction on a newer, larger building next door. After major renovations to 34 Isabella Street, the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives re-opened in September 2009. In December 2016, the Archives received a $50,000 grant from Toronto City Council to improve the building's accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nToday the Archives host a reading room and rare book library, vertical file room, offices, AV room, and gallery space for exhibitions. Additional holdings remain at 65 Wellesley and in deep storage.\n\nAt their AGM in May 2018, after a year long consultation process, they announced that they will be changing their name to The ArQuives.\n\nThe Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives was established in order to \"preserve, organize, and give public access to information and materials in any medium, by and about LGBT people, primarily produced in or concerning Canada.\" As such, the archives are not limited to traditional printed material, but instead contain many diverse collections.\n\nIn addition to traditional printed material (over 3000 books, diaries, booklets, leaflets, programmes, zines, press clippings, etc.), the Archives collects artifacts that would normally be considered museum objects to capture specific moments in the history of the lesbian and gay community. Such artifacts include:\n\n\nThe Archives have acquired over 500 original works of art from within the lesbian and gay community. These are primarily paper or canvas works, and the emphasis is historical. Examples include:\n\nContaining more than 2000 hours of sound on tapes and over 1300 discs, the Archives house LPs, gramophone records, cassettes, and CDs. Much of this material is vocal or instrumental recordings of lesbian and gay performers, but there is also a significant library of taped interviews and radio programs, as well.\n\nThe moving images collection includes more than 2200 items, in 8 mm film and 16 mm film, Betamax, VHS, and DVD formats. While there are feature films, documentaries, and erotica housed in the Archives, there are also videos shot at lesbian and gay community events. Because of its extensive collection, the Archives are often used to provide source material for Canadian film projects, such as \"\".\n\nEstablished in 1998, the National Portrait Collection honours individuals who have contributed to the growth and development of the LGBT community in Canada.

It is the earliest known Spanish work from the period of Arab occupation.\n\nThe work is very much shorter than the \"Chronicle of 754\". It contains little Spanish history; the first 14 sections contain very brief mentions of the Visigothic kings up to the reign of Suintila (621-631), taken from the \"Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum\" of Isidore of Seville. The remainder of the content consists of alternating sections dealing with the Byzantine Emperors and the parallel leaders of the Arabs beginning with the Prophet Muhammad. These sections perhaps derive from the \"Chronicon Mundi\" of John of Nikiû and from Arabic or Syriac works which have not survived. Some of these sections contain very brief mentions in passing, of the Arab invasions of North Africa, Spain, France, and parts of the Middle East.\n\nLittle if any of the content is original; the value of the work lies in what it reveals of the author and his times.\n\nThe work is noted for being pro-Arab and in particular pro-Umayyad. Various theories about the author have been proposed to account for this:\n\nLikewise, various cities of origin have been proposed, such as Toledo, Cordoba, Seville or Mérida, but arguments for these are based on very general considerations.\n\nThe date of the work cannot be earlier than 741, as it mentions the Byzantine Emperor Leo III and the length of his reign which terminated in that year.\n\nMartín has pointed out that the work contains the words \"nostris temporibus\" (our times) when saying that the caliphate was then held by a great-grandson of the caliph Marwan I. The first of Marwan's great-grandsons to hold that position was Al-Walid II, reigned 743-744, and this is likely to represent the date of writing.\n\nFrom: Julius Wellhausen, \"The Arab Kingdom and its Fall\", Engl. translation by Margaret Graham Weir, p. 168 (Univ. of Calcutta, 1927):\n"}

It is widely held have been founded by the economist Calvin Bryce Hoover. Comparative economics therefore consisted mainly of comparative economic systems analysis before 1989 but switched substantially its efforts to comparison of the economic effects of the transition experience from socialism to capitalism. It is a part of economics which is the study of gaining knowledge concerned with the production, consumption and transfer of wealth. It is based on the collective wants of the population and the resources available that initially create an economic system. The performance of the economic system can be measured through gross domestic product; that is, it will indicate the growth rate of country. Normative judgments can be made as well by asking questions like whether the gap of the distribution of wealth and income and social justice. Theoreticians regularly try to evaluate both the positive and normative aspects of the economic system in general and they do so by making assumptions about the rules of the game governing utility-seeking. It is comparatively easy to predict the economic outcomes when the economic system of the country has either a perfect competition or has a perfect planning economic system. With those types of the economic systems, it is easy to offer policy guidance. \n\nEthics, politics and culture play an important roles in determining the performance of systems. \nCommon cultures may prohibit or restrict individual's satisfaction, ultimately changing of the rule of the economic game while on the other hand, competitive societies may abuse of the economic system and over-stimulate self-seeking. Marxist culture of the 1930s, which associated markets with labor exploitation, obligated Stalin to adopt administrative command planning, and inhibited reform until attitudes softened under Khrushchev a quarter century later.\n\nThere is no unity about right and wrong economic systems. Each type of economic system can be compared, based on a set of factors but generally there is not a general agreement about which economic system is more right than the other. Hence, there is no single standard that is able to evaluate indisputably the merit of the economic system. Even though, facts can be gathered and models can be built to discuss the economic performance of a country, it cannot prove that any system is the best. With the proper guide, it is enables to do normative assessments, that is measuring the potential,the moral and ethical reasoning of an economic system. Systems can be measured relative to the achievement of the rivals and normative assessments can be done based on statistics of the living standard, the gap of income and wealth distribution and the level of unemployment \nThe modeling of comparative economic is strongly affected by the perceptions on which accepted cultural, political and ethically motives are the most predominant as well as the importance of the demand and supply side factors.\nThere are three school of thoughts. The first one are comparativists rely on what extent does the economy rely on the market and the degree of government intervention. Others stress on motivation. Finally, most are more concerned with the interplay.\n\nThe comparative study of economic systems was of significant practical and political significance during the Cold War, when the relative merits of capitalist and communist systems of economic and political organization were a central topic of political concern. One of the most important early contributions was the calculation debate regarding the assertion of Ludwig von Mises that a system of central planning could never work because the information generated by a price system would never be available to planners. One response was the advocacy and partial implementation of systems of market socialism.\n\nDespite huge economic inferiority, countries like Germany and Japan were at the brink of complete success before the World War II. However, due of having a small army force and a lack of military weapons, put an end to the success that were previously within their grasp during the first period of the war. Economic Systems' fundamentals changed drastically during the second period of the war. Military forces grew to be of much importance than the gross domestic product or the population of a country. Countries that had a powerful military force could take risks and absorb the cost of mistakes and gain quantitative superiority against countries that had powerful economies but less arm-force.\n\nThe table below shows the balance post World War II. \n\nWith the fall of Communism, attention shifted to problems of transition economies. With a handful of exceptions, all currently existing systems are capitalist in orientation, though the substantial economic role of the state supports the alternative view that the mixed economy has emerged as the dominant form of economic organisations.\n\nEven in the absence of substantial differences between countries, the comparative study of economic systems of resource allocation is of considerable value in illustrating the implications of alternative methods of resource allocation, including markets, households, centralised allocation and custom.\n"}

Today \"n\" is often 8, 16, 32, or 64, but other sizes have been used. This is actually a strong simplification. A computer architecture often has a few more or less \"natural\" datasizes in the instruction set, but the hardware implementation of these may be very different. Many architectures have instructions operating on half and/or twice the size of respective processors' major internal datapaths. Examples of this are the 8080, Z80, MC68000 as well as many others. On this type of implementations, a twice as wide operation typically also takes around twice as many clock cycles (which is not the case on high performance implementations). On the 68000, for instance, this means 8 instead of 4 clock ticks, and this particular chip may be described as a 32-bit architecture with a 16-bit implementation. The external databus width is often not useful to determine the width of the architecture; the NS32008, NS32016 and NS32032 were basically the same 32-bit chip with different external data buses. The NS32764 had a 64-bit bus, but used 32-bit registers.\n\nThe width of addresses may or may not be different from the width of data.\nEarly 32-bit microprocessors often had a 24-bit address, as did the System/360 processors.\n\nThe number of operands is one of the factors that may give an indication about the performance of the instruction set.\nA three-operand architecture will allow\nto be computed in one instruction.\n\nA two-operand architecture will allow\nto be computed in one instruction, so two instructions will need to be executed to simulate a single three-operand instruction\n\nAn architecture may use \"big\" or \"little\" endianness, or both, or be configurable to use either. Little endian processors order bytes in memory with the least significant byte of a multi-byte value in the lowest-numbered memory location. Big endian architectures instead order them with the most significant byte at the lowest-numbered address. The x86 architecture as well as several 8-bit architectures are little endian. Most RISC architectures (SPARC, Power, PowerPC, MIPS) were originally big endian (ARM was little endian), but many (including ARM) are now configurable.\n\nEndianness \"only\" applies to processors that allow individual addressing of units of data (such as bytes) that are \"smaller\" than the basic addressable machine word.\n\nUsually the number of registers is a power of two, e.g. 8, 16, 32. In some cases a hardwired-to-zero pseudo-register is included, as \"part\" of register files of architectures, mostly to simplify indexing modes. This table only counts the integer \"registers\" usable by general instructions at any moment. Architectures always include special-purpose registers such as the program pointer (PC). Those are not counted unless mentioned. Note that some architectures, such as SPARC, have register window; for those architectures, the count below indicates how many registers are available within a register window. Also, non-architected registers for register renaming are not counted.\n\nNote, a common type of architecture, \"load-store\", is a synonym for \"Register Register\" below, meaning no instructions access memory except special – load to register(s) – and store from register(s) – with the possible exceptions of atomic memory operations for locking.\n\nThe table below compares basic information about instruction sets to be implemented in the CPU architectures:\n\n"}
{"id": "7645630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7645630", "title": "Electronic Yellow Pages", "text": "Electronic Yellow Pages\n\nElectronic Yellow Pages are online versions of traditional printed business directories produced by telephone companies around the world. Typical functionalities of online yellow pages include the alphabetical listings of businesses and search functionality of the business database by name, business or location. Since Electronic Yellow Pages are not limited by space considerations, they often contain far more comprehensive business information such as vicinity maps, company profiles, product information, and more.\n\nAn advantage of Electronic Yellow Pages is that they can be updated in real time; therefore, listed businesses are not constrained by once-a-year publishing of the printed version which leads to greater accuracy of the listings since contact information may change at any time.\n\nBefore the popularity of the internet, business telephone numbers in the United Kingdom could be searched by accessing a remote computer terminal by modem. The initial prototype of this was superseded in 1990 with a commercial service. This service allowed searches via Name, Business classification and locality for business listings and a free text field was provided to allow \"unstructured text\" searching of Adverts. This dialup service was available via Prestel and \"BT Gold\" services. The service Electronic Yellow Pages was superseded in the mid-1990s by the internet service www.yell.com. A similar system called \"Phonebase\" for published residential phone numbers was discontinued in the 1990s, being superseded a web-based search interface.\n\nThe first true online Yellow Pages, was a creation based on the independent YP publisher in Seattle, Washington called Banana Pages. This was the first print directory which was registered with both YPPA (the Yellow Pages Publishers Association), and the ADP (Association of Directory Publishers) to place their listings online. The Yellow Pages product was the brain child of the co-owner brothers of the company, Peter and John Richards. Many RBOCS (Regional Bell Operating Companies) would follow. Banana Pages eventually became YPI (Yellow Pages on the Internet, Inc) which was sold to InfoSpace.com and became their Yellow Pages offering to cobrands.\n\nAmong the first to place their listings on the Web was Pacific Bell's now-defunct “At Hand” online yellow pages that was officially launched on August 30, 1996. At Hand debuted with approximately 1.2 million merchant listings from across California. At the time, the service was competing with BigBook.com, a nationwide Web directory that was since absorbed by SuperPages.\n\nAlthough it is “old hat” now, At Hand allowed an online visitor to look for a French restaurant in a given town and get an interactive map. If the restaurant has paid for an enhanced listing, the visitor could also find out other information, such as whether it took American Express or if it served bouillabaise. At Hand showcased editorial content from 14 publishers, including HarperCollins, the Hearst Corporation, the New York Times Company and American Express.\n\nAnother early entrant into the then-$11 billion yellow pages industry occurred in 1997 when four Baby Bells banded together to create a co-branded Web site and initiated a $1 million marketing campaign to drive more traffic to their regional yellow pages sites. That \"original yellow pages\" site was simply a map of the United States, where users could click on any state and be linked to the appropriate online directory, as published by Ameritech, BellSouth, Pacific Bell, or US West. The site experienced stiff competition from Big Yellow (now part of SuperPages) and SuperPages itself.\n\nOn Nov. 4, 2004 SBC Communications Incorporated (now AT&T) and BellSouth announced a joint venture to acquire Yellowpages.com. The venture utilized the highly recognized brand name to become the market leader in local search (Internet). At the time of acquisitions, it was expected that the YellowPages.com site would receive more than 50 million consumer searches per month.\n\nIn 2005, Amazon.com elbowed its way into the online yellow pages business, with a new service from its A9.com search engine, featuring photo-rich listings that allow an online visitor to “wander around” near a given destination.\n\nAccording to market research company the Kelsey Group, advertising in online yellow pages is rapidly expanding but still only retain less than 7% of the total market, including online and print. The reason for this is that traditional yellow pages publishers, such as the phone companies, have big sales forces to approach local businesses.\n\nMarketWatch, an online financial newsletter, carried an article on Dec. 18, 2006 detailing how mobile online yellow pages were enhancing small business lead generation. The article noted that Internet-based yellow pages, local search and wireless was growing by an estimated 30.5% versus print advertising, and that a company could only benefit from this online growth by being listed in an Internet-based directory.\n\nSearch engines such as Google Maps carry a significant number of business listings, often rivaling and sometimes exceeding the number of listings found in the traditional online yellow pages. These search engine results are a very effective way to reach new customers.\n\nSearch engine listings can often be edited by users, not just business owners. It is therefore important for business owners to verify and register their business address with all the major search engines.\n\nSome of the problems associated with search engine advertising is click fraud. This is when ads are clicked on with no intention of purchasing anything. The search engines still charge the advertiser for these clicks, if the advertiser does not discover the fraud. Many online advertisers have discovered that clicks do not equal calls.\n\nMany small businesses find the search engine keyword model very complicated. The average category in an Internet Yellow Pages would take an average of 20different keywords/search terms to \"cover\" on a search engine. For example, a plumber might need to buy leaky sink, leaky pipe, Toilet repair, sink repair, drain cleaning and on and on. It is easier for many businesses to buy an ad under \"plumbers\" in their local IYP's.\n\nElectronic Yellow Pages or Online Yellow Pages use software to quickly edit and change online content for display on the internet. Printed Yellow Pages or business directories often discontinue publication to limit printing costs and instead publish directly to the internet as a web directory. Online yellow pages or directories continue publishing online because advertisers pay for the visual exposure from those who read or use these online publications on the internet. Publishers or people that create these online directories create software with their own resources or use opensource or Off-the shelf software to build their website or online directory. Banana Pages was an online directory function built with their own resources. The cost of online yellow pages or online directory software is limited compared to the large cost of physical printing and distribution of a phone book or directory of information.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3761756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3761756", "title": "Empress Place Building", "text": "Empress Place Building\n\nThe Empress Place Building is a historic building in Singapore, located on the north bank of the Singapore River in the Downtown Core, within the Central Area in Singapore's central business district. The building is currently the second wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum. The other wing of the museum is located at the Old Tao Nan School building along Armenian Street.\n\nDuring the colonial era, the Empress Place Building was known simply as Government Offices. The first civic buildings were planned here in Sir Stamford Raffles' day. Originally intended to be a courthouse, the Empress Place Building instead became offices for the government departments located in the adjacent Maxwell's House (later the old Parliament House). \n\nMaxwell's House, designed by George Drumgoole Coleman, was a two-storey house built for a merchant, John Argyle Maxwell, in 1827. However, it was never occupied by him and it became a courthouse and lands office. Subsequently, it was converted to Government Offices and additions were made in 1839 and 1847.\n\nConstructed in four phases from 1864 to 1920, Government Offices was built to provide much needed space for the growing colonial administration. The original section of the building was designed by colonial engineer J.F.A. McNair and built by convict labour between June 1864 and December 1867. This original section now forms the part of the building nearest to the old Parliament House. \n\nYet another courthouse was built in 1865; this is now the core of the Government Offices. In 1873–1875, the old courthouse was extended towards the river and this is where the Supreme Court of the Colony held its sessions from 1875 until 1939 when the first Supreme Court was built. Maxwell's original house became the Assembly House in 1954 after extensive renovations and reconstruction. The decision to build a new Town Hall was made in 1854; the building was completed in 1862.\n\nGovernment Offices that were housed included the Secretariat, Audit Office, Registration of Deeds Office, Land Office, Public Works and Medical Department, Treasury and Stamp Office, and the bureaux of the Colonial Engineer, the Official Assignee, and the Inspector General of the Police Force. The Legislative chamber occupied a room on the upper floor.\n\nIn front of the building was a public square which was given the name Empress Place by the Municipal Council in 1907 in honour of Queen Victoria. It may well be the oldest pedestrian space in Singapore. Over time, Government Offices became associated with Empress Place and its name changed to what we know it today.\n\nAs the demand for more government office space increased, three major extensions were added in 1880, 1904–1909 and 1920. Fortunately, every one of these extensions were faithful to McNair's Neo-Palladian design and the building maintained a harmonious overall look.\n\nIn the surrounding area also known as Empress Place, the Memorial Hall and Tower were added in 1905 and extensive renovations were carried out from 1954 till 1979. Raffles' statue, now in front of the Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre, as it is now called, was first erected on the Padang in 1887 but later removed to its present site in 1919. A second statue, a copy of the first one, was erected at Raffles Landing Place in 1972. The Dalhousie Memorial was originally located at Dalhousie Pier but found its present place in 1886. Cavenagh Bridge was built in 1869 and was converted to pedestrian traffic after the erection of Anderson Bridge. These are the major elements which have contributed to the developing qualities of Empress Place.\n\nThe Empress Place Building was used by government departments until the late 1980s. It is perhaps best known as the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Citizenship Registry, and the Immigration Department.\n\nIn the late 1980s, plans were made to convert Empress Place Building into a museum. Extensive restoration began, culminating in the opening of the Empress Place Museum on 7 April 1989 by the then Second Deputy Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong. \n\nAlthough the museum was afflicted with structural and logistical problems from its inception, it nonetheless managed to organise five outstanding exhibitions on Chinese history in six years. The first of these exhibitions, which featured royal objects from the Qing Dynasty, put on display many precious artefacts never seen before outside China. By 1995, the museum's problems got the better of it and on 30 April that year, it closed its doors.\n\nSubsequently, the Empress Place Building underwent renovations and opened as the second wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum on 2 March 2003, exhibiting Southeast, South, and West Asian collections.\n\nThe Empress Place Building was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992.\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Singapore River, the Empress Place Building's imposing Neo-Palladian exterior with timber-louvred windows and pitched clay tile roofs caught the attention of immigrants and visitors sailing into Singapore harbour. A 1905 Singapore guidebook says of Government Offices and its neighbouring buildings, \"Apart from the cities of India, there is, perhaps, no place in the East which boasts such a handsome group of [government] buildings as viewed from the sea.\"\n\nInside, the rooms are stately, with high ceilings, handsome Doric columns and exquisite plaster mouldings and cornices. Elegantly proportioned, the building is laid out symmetrically along a central axis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3418022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3418022", "title": "Geography (Ptolemy)", "text": "Geography (Ptolemy)\n\nThe Geography (, \"Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis\",  \"Geographical Guidance\"), also known by its Latin names as the and the , is a gazetteer, an atlas, and a treatise on cartography, compiling the geographical knowledge of the 2nd-century Roman Empire. Originally written by Claudius Ptolemy in Greek at Alexandria around AD 150, the work was a revision of a now-lost atlas by Marinus of Tyre using additional Roman and Persian gazetteers and new principles. Its translation into Arabic in the 9th century and Latin in 1406 was highly influential on the geographical knowledge and cartographic traditions of the medieval Caliphate and Renaissance Europe.\n\nVersions of Ptolemy's work in antiquity were probably proper atlases with attached maps, although some scholars believe that the references to maps in the text were later additions.\n\nNo Greek manuscript of the \"Geography\" survives from earlier than the 13th century. A letter written by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes records that he searched for one for Chora Monastery in the summer of 1295; one of the earliest surviving texts may have been one of those he then assembled. In Europe, maps were sometimes redrawn using the coordinates provided by the text, as Planudes was forced to do. Later scribes and publishers could then copy these new maps, as Athanasius did for the emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus. The three earliest surviving texts with maps are those from Constantinople (Istanbul) based on Planudes's work.\n\nThe first Latin translation of these texts was made in 1406 or 1407 by Jacobus Angelus in Florence, Italy, under the name \"\". It is not thought that his edition had maps, although Manuel Chrysoloras had given Palla Strozzi a Greek copy of Planudes's maps in Florence in 1397.\n\nThe \"Geography\" consists of three sections, divided among 8 books. Book I is a treatise on cartography, describing the methods used to assemble and arrange Ptolemy's data. From Book II through the beginning of Book VII, a gazetteer provides longitude and latitude values for the world known to the ancient Romans (the \"ecumene\"). The rest of Book VII provides details on three projections to be used for the construction of a map of the world, varying in complexity and fidelity. Book VIII constitutes an atlas of regional maps. The maps include a recapitulation of some of the values given earlier in the work, which were intended to be used as captions to clarify the map's contents and maintain their accuracy during copying.\n\nMaps based on scientific principles had been made in Europe since the time of Eratosthenes in the 3rd century BC. Ptolemy improved the treatment of map projections. He provided instructions on how to create his maps in the first section of the work.\n\nThe gazetteer section of Ptolemy's work provided latitude and longitude coordinates for all the places and geographical features in the work. Latitude was expressed in degrees of arc from the equator, the same system that is used now, though Ptolemy used fractions of a degree rather than minutes of arc. His Prime Meridian ran through the Fortunate Isles, the westernmost land recorded, at around the position of El Hierro in the Canary Islands. The maps spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Fortunate Isles in the Atlantic to China.\n\nPtolemy was aware that Europe knew only about a quarter of the globe.\n\nPtolemy's work included a single large and less detailed world map and then separate and more detailed regional maps. The first Greek manuscripts compiled after Maximus Planudes's rediscovery of the text had as many as 64 regional maps. The standard set in Western Europe came to be 26: 10 European maps, 4 African maps, and 12 Asian maps. As early as the 1420s, these canonical maps were complemented by extra-Ptolemaic regional maps depicting, e.g., Scandinavia.\n\nThe original treatise by Marinus of Tyre that formed the basis of Ptolemy's \"Geography\" has been completely lost. A world map based on Ptolemy was displayed in Augustodunum (Autun, France) in late Roman times. Pappus, writing at Alexandria in the 4th century, produced a commentary on Ptolemy's \"Geography\" and used it as the basis of his (now lost) \"Chorography of the Ecumene\". Later imperial writers and mathematicians, however, seem to have restricted themselves to commenting on Ptolemy's text, rather than improving upon it; surviving records actually show decreasing fidelity to real position.\n\nWhereas previous Greco-Roman geographers such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder demonstrated a reluctance to rely on the contemporary accounts of sailors and merchants who plied distant areas of the Indian Ocean, Marinus and Ptolemy betray a much greater receptiveness to incorporating information received from them. For instance, Grant Parker argues that it would be highly implausible for them to have constructed the Bay of Bengal as precisely as they did without the accounts of sailors. When it comes to the account of the Golden Chersonese (i.e. Malay Peninsula) and the \"Magnus Sinus\" (i.e. Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea), Marinus and Ptolemy relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexandros, who claimed to have visited a far eastern site called \"Cattigara\" (most likely Oc Eo, Vietnam, the site of unearthed Antonine-era Roman goods and not far from the region of Jiaozhi in northern Vietnam where ancient Chinese sources claim several Roman embassies first landed in the 2nd and 3rd centuries).\n\nMuslim cartographers were using copies of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" and \"Geography\" by the 9th century. At that time, in the court of the caliph al-Maʾmūm, al-Khwārazmī compiled his \"Book of the Depiction of the Earth\" which mimicked the \"Geography\" in providing the coordinates for 545 cities and regional maps of the Nile, the Island of the Jewel, the Sea of Darkness, and the Sea of Azov. A 1037 copy of these are the earliest extant maps from Islamic lands. The text clearly states that al-Khwārazmī was working from an earlier map, although this could not have been an exact copy of Ptolemy's work: his Prime Meridian was 10° east of Ptolemy's, he adds some places, and his latitudes differ. C.A. Nallino suggests that the work was not based on Ptolemy but on a derivative world map, presumably in Syriac or Arabic. The colored map of al-Maʾmūm constructed by a team including al-Khwārazmī was described by the Persian encyclopædist al-Masʿūdī around 956 as superior to the maps of Marinus and Ptolemy, probably indicating that it was built along similar mathematical principles. It included 4530 cities and over 200 mountains.\n\nDespite beginning to compile numerous gazetteers of places and coördinates indebted to Ptolemy, Muslim scholars made almost no direct use of Ptolemy's principles in the maps which have survived. Instead, they followed al-Khwārazmī's modifications and the orthogonal projection advocated by Suhrāb's early 10th-century treatise on the \"Marvels of the Seven Climes to the End of Habitation\". Surviving maps from the medieval period were not done according to mathematical principles. The world map from the 11th-century \"Book of Curiosities\" is the earliest surviving map of the Muslim or Christian worlds to include a graticule but the copyist seems to have not understood its purpose, starting it from the left using twice the intended scale and then (apparently realizing his mistake) giving up halfway through. Its presence does strongly suggest the existence of earlier, now-lost maps which had been mathematically derived in the manner of Ptolemy, al-Khwārazmi, or Suhrāb. There are surviving reports of such maps.\n\nPtolemy's \"Geography\" was translated from Arabic into Latin at the court of king Roger II of Sicily in the 12th century CE. However, no copy of that translation has survived.\n\nThe Greek text of the \"Geography\" reached Florence from Constantinople in about 1400 and was translated into Latin by Jacobus Angelus of Scarperia around 1406. The first printed edition with maps, published in 1477 in Bologna, was also be the first printed book with engraved illustrations. Many editions followed (more often using woodcut in the early days), some following traditional versions of the maps, and others updating them. An edition printed at Ulm in 1482 was the first one printed north of the Alps. Also in 1482, Francesco Berlinghieri printed the first edition in vernacular Italian.\nPtolemy had mapped the whole world from the \"Fortunatae Insulae\" (Cape Verde or Canary Islands) eastward to the eastern shore of the \"Magnus Sinus\". This known portion of the world was comprised within 180 degrees. In his extreme east Ptolemy placed \"Serica\" (the Land of Silk), the \"Sinarum Situs\" (the Port of the Sinae), and the emporium of \"Cattigara\". On the 1489 map of the world by Henricus Martellus, which was based on Ptolemy’s work, Asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape, the Cape of Cattigara. Cattigara was understood by Ptolemy to be a port on the \"Sinus Magnus,\" or Great Gulf, the actual Gulf of Thailand, at eight and a half degrees north of the Equator, on the coast of Cambodia, which is where he located it in his Canon of Famous Cities. It was the easternmost port reached by shipping trading from the Graeco-Roman world to the lands of the Far East.\nIn Ptolemy’s later and more well-known Geography, a scribal error was made and Cattigara was located at eight and a half degrees South of the Equator. On Ptolemaic maps, such as that of Martellus, \"Catigara\" was located on the easternmost shore of the \"Mare Indicum,\" 180 degrees East of the Cape St Vincent at, due to the scribal error, eight and a half degrees South of the Equator.\n\n\"Catigara\" is also shown at this location on Martin Waldseemüller’s 1507 world map, which avowedly followed the tradition of Ptolemy. Ptolemy’s information was thereby misinterpreted so that the coast of China, which should have been represented as part of the coast of eastern Asia, was falsely made to represent an eastern shore of the Indian Ocean. As a result, Ptolemy implied more land east of the 180th meridian and an ocean beyond. Marco Polo’s account of his travels in eastern Asia described lands and seaports on an eastern ocean apparently unknown to Ptolemy. Marco Polo’s narrative authorized the extensive additions to the Ptolemaic map shown on the 1492 globe of Martin Behaim. The fact that Ptolemy did not represent an eastern coast of Asia made it admissible for Behaim to extend that continent far to the east. Behaim’s globe placed Marco Polo’s Mangi and Cathay east of Ptolemy’s 180th meridian, and the Great Khan’s capital, \"Cambaluc\" (Beijing), on the 41st parallel of latitude at approximately 233 degrees East. Behaim allowed 60 degrees beyond Ptolemy’s 180 degrees for the mainland of Asia and 30 degrees more to the east coast of \"Cipangu\" (Japan). Cipangu and the mainland of Asia were thus placed only 90 and 120 degrees, respectively, west of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe Codex Seragliensis was used as the base of a new edition of the work in 2006. This new edition was used to \"decode\" Ptolemy's coordinates of Books 2 and 3 by an interdisciplinary team of TU Berlin, presented in publications in 2010 and 2012.\n\nChristopher Columbus modified this geography further by using 53⅔ Italian nautical miles as the length of a degree instead of the longer degree of Ptolemy, and by adopting Marinus of Tyre’s longitude of 225 degrees for the east coast of the \"Magnus Sinus\". This resulted in a considerable eastward advancement of the longitudes given by Martin Behaim and other contemporaries of Columbus. By some process Columbus reasoned that the longitudes of eastern Asia and Cipangu respectively were about 270 and 300 degrees east, or 90 and 60 degrees west of the Canary Islands. He said that he had sailed 1100 leagues from the Canaries when he found Cuba in 1492. This was approximately where he thought the coast of eastern Asia would be found. On this basis of calculation he identified Hispaniola with Cipangu, which he had expected to find on the outward voyage at a distance of about 700 leagues from the Canaries. His later voyages resulted in further exploration of Cuba and in the discovery of South and Central America. At first South America, the \"Mundus Novus\" (New World) was considered to be a great island of continental proportions; but as a result of his fourth voyage, it was apparently considered to be identical with the great Upper India peninsula (India Superior) represented by Behaim—the Cape of Cattigara. This seems to be the best interpretation of the sketch map made by Alessandro Zorzi on the advice of Bartholomew Columbus (Christopher’s brother) around 1506, which bears an inscription saying that according to the ancient geographer Marinus of Tyre and Christopher Columbus the distance from Cape St Vincent on the coast of Portugal to Cattigara on the peninsula of India Superior was 225 degrees, while according to Ptolemy the same distance was 180 degrees.\n\nPrior to the 16th century knowledge of geography in the Ottoman Empire was limited in scope, with almost no access to the works of earlier Islamic scholars that superseded Ptolemy. His Geography would again be translated and updated with commentary into Arabic under Mehmed II, who commissioned works from Byzantine scholar George Amiroutzes in 1465 and the Florentine humanist Francesco Berlinghieri in 1481.\n\nItalian scholar Lucio Russo points out two apparently distinct errors:\n\n\nPtolemy took as location for the longitude 0° the Fortunate Isles which at his times were identified with the Canary Islands. The strange coincidence of the two aforementioned errors may be accounted for if one assumes that this identification was wrong and that at the time of Ptolemy's sources the Fortunate Isles were actually the eastern Antilles. Since Ptolemy could estimate the actual distance to the Canaries, Russo proposes that he purposely shrank the circumference of Earth to accommodate his data and his wrong identification of the Fortunate Isles. This suggests or even proves that the American continent was known in Classical Antiquity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Paladin Press owner Peder Lund claimed, in an interview with \"60 Minutes\", that the book started life as a detailed crime novel written by a Florida housewife, and that the format was later changed to appeal to Paladin's reader base accustomed to the publisher's non-fiction books on military, survivalist, weapons and similar topics. The book portrays itself as a how-to manual on starting a career as a hit man, fulfilling contracts. However, after a number of lawsuits claiming that the book was used as a handbook in several murders, the publication of the book was stopped. It marked \"the first time in American publishing history that a publisher has been held liable for a crime committed by a reader.\"\n\nPaladin Press published the book under the author's pseudonym \"Rex Feral\" in 1983. The book is written as if by an actual experienced assassin, as a how-to manual on contract killing. It was said to be written by a divorced mother-of-two who simply fabricated much of the material it contains based on mystery novels and movies. The book goes on at length about studying \"the mark\", learning the mark's movements and routine, and silently moving in for the profitable kill, and offers advice on weapon selection and techniques.\n\nOn March 3, 1992, a triple murder was committed in Montgomery County, Maryland, by a man who claimed to have used the book as his guide. James Perry, who had been imprisoned for a violent crime, was caught, convicted, and sentenced three times to death. He had been hired by Lawrence Horn, who sought to receive the proceeds of a trust fund that resulted from his ex-wife's suing a hospital over injuries to their son. \n\nThe families of Mildred Horn, her son Trevor, and her nurse Janice Saunders sued, claiming Paladin Press \"aided and abetted\" the murder. The suit, \"Rice v Paladin Enterprises\", claimed that Paladin Press had a share of responsibility in the murders by virtue of their publication of a book that, by Paladin's own admission, could be used by criminals and would-be criminals in the solicitation, planning, and commission of murder for hire. In November 1997, a U.S. appeals court ruled 3–0 that \"Hit Man\" was not protected by the free speech/free press clause of the First Amendment and thus Paladin Enterprises could be held liable for a triple murder committed by one of its readers. \n\nOn May 21, 1999, Paladin Press' insurance company agreed to settle the case out-of-court, against the wishes of Paladin Press themselves, who were confident that they would prevail in court on First Amendment grounds; however, Paladin’s insurance company balked at going to court again, figuring expenses for a lengthy trial in federal court, plus the posting of a bond in case they lost and appealed, would have cost much more than the settlement. Under this settlement, Paladin's insurance policy paid several million dollars to the families of those killed by the murderer, while also agreeing to destroy the remaining 700 copies of the book in their possession and surrendering any rights they had to publish and reproduce the work. Jon Ford, Paladin’s editorial director, called the settlement \"economic censorship.\"\n\nThe book was also cited as a source of information in a similar crime committed by Robert Vaughn Jones in 1999. In 2000, Paladin Press was sued again as a result of \"Hit Man\". The lawsuit was result of the 1998 attempted murder of Bobby Joe Wilson by her ex-husband, Robert Leslie Goggin, who allegedly hired Robert Jones to kill her in order to get money from her life insurance policy. In court, Jones testified that Goggin recruited him to kill Wilson. Jones said he then purchased Hit Man. In her lawsuit, Wilson outlined two dozen points of advice from the book that Jones followed to the letter in planning to kill her. The suit was eventually settled out of court in 2002.\n\nAfter the legal cases, Paladin no longer published the book, and allowed the remaining undestroyed circulating copies to sell out. Copies exist on the Internet (notably IRC), often accompanied by the spurious claim that the book is now in the public domain. Paladin Press claims that the rights are still held by the author. It can also be purchased used from independent sellers. It is believed that 13,000 copies were sold, although \"Reason Magazine\" estimates there are 20,000 copies of the book in existence.\n\nIn 1999, a book called \"Deliberate Intent: a lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book\", was released by lawyer, author, and First Amendment scholar, Rod Smolla. Deliberate Intent described his involvement in the notorious \"Hit Man\" case, where Smolla successfully represented the families of three murder victims in the court case against Paladin Press. The book was later made into a television movie and actor Timothy Hutton portrayed Smolla.\n\nOn August 6, 2000, a television film by Fox and the FX Cable Network called \"Deliberate Intent\" was aired in the U.S. based directly on the book and the case. It starred Timothy Hutton, Ron Rifkin, Clark Johnson, Penny Johnson Jerald, Cliff DeYoung, James McDaniel, and Yanna McIntosh. Peder Lund, Paladin Press' owner, was played by Kenneth Welsh. It was directed by Andy Wolk, produced by Howard Braunstein and Michael Jaffe, with music by Harald Kloser. In the drama, which clearly parallels the Horn case,The legal team then proceeds to tie the book to the case of a Motown recording engineer (McDaniel) who gets a hitman to murder his ex-wife, their paraplegic daughter and the son’s nurse. By proving that the hired killer followed 22 of the 26 steps shown in Paladin’s book, they’re able to bring home the point that freedom of speech laws should not protect material that is produced for the purpose of aiding and abetting murder.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40853628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40853628", "title": "Identitarian movement", "text": "Identitarian movement\n\nThe identitarian movement is a European and North American far-right and white nationalist movement that originated in France. The identitarians began as a youth movement, with their name derived from the French \"Nouvelle Droite\" (New Right) \"Génération Identitaire\", and the anti-Zionist and National Bolshevik Unité Radicale. Although initially the youth wing of the anti-immigration and nativist Bloc Identitaire, it has taken on its own identity and is largely classified as a separate entity altogether.\n\nThe movement is a part of the counter-jihad movement, with many adherents espousing the white genocide conspiracy theory. They also support the concept of a \"Europe of 100 Flags\" popularized by Yann Fouéré. The movement has also been described as part of the global alt-right.\n\nIn Sweden, identitarianism has been promoted by a now inactive organisation , which founded the online encyclopedia Metapedia. It then mobilised a number of \"independent activist groups\" similar to their French counterparts, among them Reaktion Östergötland and Identitet Väst, who performed a number of political actions marked by a certain degree of civil disobedience. A 24-page first manifesto, aimed at defining the identitarian movement in Northern Europe, was published as \"Identitet och Metapolitik\".\nThe main identitarian youth movement is \"Génération Identitaire\" in France, a youth wing of the \"Bloc Identitaire\" party.\n\nThe origin of the Italian chapter \"Generazione Identitaria\" dates back to 2012.\n\nMarkus Willinger, who grew up in Schärding, Austria, and is now a student of history and political science at the University of Stuttgart, published a 2013 manifesto entitled \"Generation Identity: A Declaration of War Against the '68ers\", (68ers being people whose political identities are seen as stemming from the social changes of the 1960s, what would be called baby boomer liberals in the US, or those sympathetic to them) and translated into English from German by Aetius. The book is considered the manifesto of the \"Identitäre Bewegung Österreichs\", which was founded in 2012.\n\nThe movement also appeared in Germany and converged with preexisting circles, centered on the magazine \"Blaue Narzisse\" and its founder Felix Menzel, a martial artist and former German Karate Team Champion, who according to Gudrun Hentges – who worked for the official Federal Agency for Civic Education – belongs to the \"elite of the movement\". It has been a \"registered association\" since 2014. Drawing upon thinkers of the Nouvelle Droite and the Conservative Revolutionary movement such as Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt or the contemporary Russian Aleksandr Dugin, it played a role in the rise of the PEGIDA marches in 2014/15.\n\nThe identitarian movement has a close linkage to members of the German New Right, e.g., to its prominent member Götz Kubitschek and his journal \"Sezession\", for which the identitarian speaker Martin Sellner writes.\n\nAs their symbol, the European Identitarian movement and Generation Identity, uses a yellow lambda sign, a symbol that was painted on the shields of the Spartan army – popularized by the film \"300\" – supposedly to commemorate the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\nIn August 2016, members of the identitarian movement in Germany scaled the iconic Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and hung a banner in protest at European immigration and perceived Islamisation.\n\nMembers of the identitarian movement erected a new summit cross in a \"provocative\" act (as the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" reported) on the Schafreuter, after the original one had to be removed because of damage by an unknown person.\n\nIn June 2017 the PayPal donations account of the identitarian \"Defend Europe\" was locked, and the identitarian account of the bank \"Steiermärkische Sparkasse\" was closed. Defend Europe crowdfunded more than $178,000 to charter a ship in the Mediterranean. Its intention was ferry any rescued migrants back to Africa, observe any incursions by other NGO ships into Libyan waters, and report them to the Libyan coastguard. In the event, the ship chartered by GI suffered an engine failure, and had to be rescued by a ship from one of the NGOs rescuing migrants.\n\nIn October 2017, key figures of the identitarian movement met in London in efforts to target the United Kingdom, and discussed the founding of a British chapter as a \"bridge\" to link with radical movements in the US.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland branch was launched in late October 2017 after a banner was unfurled on Westminster Bridge reading \"Defend London, Stop Islamisation\".\n\nOn 9 March 2018, Sellner and his girlfriend Brittany Pettibone were barred from entering the UK. The reason stated was that their presence was \"not conducive to the public good.\"\n\nPrior the ban, Sellner intended to deliver a speech to the Young Independence party, though they cancelled the event citing supposed threats of violence from the far-left. He intended to deliver his speech at Speakers' Corner in Hyde park prior to being detained and deported. In June 2018, Tore Rasmussen, a Norwegian activist who had previously been denied entry to the United Kingdom, was working in the Republic of Ireland to establish a local branch of Generation Identity.\n\nThe founder of the far-right Croatian party Generation of Renovation said it was originally formed in 2017 as that country's version of the alt-right and identitarian movements.\n\nLes Identitaires, founded in 2003, is a French identitarian group. Identitäre Bewegung Österreichs is an Austrian identitarian group founded in 2012.\n\nThe political party Identity Ireland was founded in 2015.\n\nThe Traditionalist Youth Network/Traditionalist Worker Party is modeled after the European identitarian movement, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. The Identity Evropa movement labels itself identitarian, and is part of the alt-right. Richard Spencer's National Policy Institute is also a white nationalist movement, which advocates a version of identitarianism.\n\nOn 20 May 2017, two non-commissioned officers with the US Marines were arrested for trespassing after displaying a banner from a building in Graham, North Carolina, during a Confederate Memorial Day event. The banner included the identitarian logo, and the phrase \"he who controls the past controls the future\", a reference to George Orwell's novel, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", along with the acronym YWNRU, or \"you will not replace us\". The Marine Corps denounced the behavior and investigated the incident. A marine spokesperson commented to local news “Of course we condemn this type of behavior ... we condemn any type of behavior that is not congruent with our values or that is illegal.” Both men plead guilty to trespassing. One received military administrative punishment. The other was discharged from the corps.\n\nThe movement has been described as being part of the global alt-right, or as the European counterpart of the American alt-right. Hope Not Hate (HNH) has described identitarianism and the alt-right as \"ostensibly separate\" in origin, but with \"huge areas of ideological crossover\". Many white nationalists and alt-right leaders have described themselves as identitarians, and according to HNH, American alt-right influence is evident in European identitarian groups and events, forming an amalgamated \"International Alternative Right\". Figures within the Identitarian movements and alt-right often cite Nouvelle Droite founder Alain de Benoist as an influence. De Benoist rejects any alt-right affiliation, although he has worked with Richard B. Spencer, and once spoke at Spencer's National Policy Institute. As Benoist stated, \"Maybe people consider me their spiritual father, but I don’t consider them my spiritual sons\".\n\nAccording to Christoph Gurk of Bayerischer Rundfunk, one of the goals of identitarianism is to make racism modern and fashionable. Austrian identitarians invited radical right-wing groups from across Europe, including several neo-Nazis groups, to participate in an anti-immigration march, according to Anna Thalhammer of \"Die Presse\". There has also been Identitarian collaboration with the white nationalist activist Tomislav Sunić. The investigation by political scientist Gudrun Hentges came to the conclusion that the identitarian movement is ideologically situated between the French National Front, the Nouvelle Droite, and neo-Nazism.\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

(1549–1619). Adopting the literary form of the Hindu puranas, it retells the entire story of mankind from the creation days to the time of Jesus, in lyrical verse form. The Christian Puranas – 11,000 stanzas of 4 verses – were very popular in the churches of the area where they were sung on special occasions up to the 1930s. Although no copy of the original edition has yet been discovered, it is believed to have been published at Rachol (Raitur) in 1616 (while the author was still living), 1649, and 1654.\n\n\nAt least five MS of the Khristapurana have been located to date in Goa:\n\nApart from CL, the MS are not dated. The chronology will therefore have to be established from internal evidence, taking into account the terminology (Romanized or Sanskritized), the number of cantos and strophes, the interpolations, the Praise of Marathi (missing in the Marsden MS), the chapter on the Miracle at Cana (missing in the Marsden MS), etc. This will also help us move closer to establishing whether or not the Sanskritized M was the ‘original’ text of the Khristapurana.\n\n\nThe manuscripts had belonged to the library of William Marsden who, Abbot says, ‘a century ago’ had made a large collection of coins and Oriental books when in India, many of the latter having been obtained from the Archives in Goa (which Archives, Abbot does not say). The library was given by Marsden to the Kings College, London, in 1853, but in 1916 came into the possession of the School of Oriental Studies. The catalogue contained only a few Marathi items. Abbot reports two, with entries made by Mr Marsden as follows: \"The Adi or First Puran, a Christian work in the Mahratta language and Nagari character appearing to contain an exposition of the Old Testament.\" \"The Deva Puran, or Divine History, a Christian work in the Mahratta language and Nagari character appearing to contain an exposition of the New Testament or History of Christ.\" The manuscript is in two volumes differing in handwriting. The Deva Puran is a copy of an older copy. The MS end in the usual form of an Indian Puran, Iti Mahapurane, or Iti Deva-Purane, which the Mangalore text does not do.\n\nAbbott claims that this is a copy of Thomas Stephens’ original text. Bandelu feels that there is not enough evidence for Abbott’s claim. Falcao follows Abbott without really arguing his case. Strangely, while admitting that the Marsden MS is a MS and not an ‘edition,’ he still lists it as the 7th edition, coming after Drago, without giving any supporting reasons.\n\nFr H. Staffner obtained a microfilm of M and made 2 copies. One is in the Jaykar Library of the Pune University. The other is in Snehasadan, Pune. It would seem, however, that there is another microfilm of the same in the Mumbai Marathi Sansodhan Mandala, Mumbai, though D does not specify that this is M. Falcao (2003) follows Drago, but specifies that this microfilm is indeed of the Marsden MS.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19845", "title": "Minerva", "text": "Minerva\n\nMinerva (; ; Etruscan: \"Menrva\") was the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. From the second century BC onward, the Romans equated her with the Greek goddess Athena, though the Romans did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the Greeks did.\n\nFollowing the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of Metis, who had been swallowed by Jupiter, and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor. Jupiter forcefully impregnated the titaness Metis, which resulted in her attempting to change shape (or shapeshift) to escape him. Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had Saturn, and in turn, Saturn had Caelus. \n\nFearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom. Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, Vulcan used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armor.\n\nShe was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the \"owl of Minerva\", which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge as well as, less frequently, the snake and the olive tree.\n\nMinerva was worshipped at several locations in Rome, most prominently as part of the Capitoline Triad. She was also worshipped at the Temple of Minerva Medica, and at the \"Delubrum Minervae\", a temple founded around 50 BC by Pompey on the site now occupied by the church of \"Santa Maria sopra Minerva\".\n\nThe Romans celebrated her festival from March 19 to March 23 during the day which is called, in the neuter plural, Quinquatria, the fifth after the Ides of March, the nineteenth, an artisans' holiday. A lesser version, the \"Minusculae Quinquatria\", was held on the Ides of June, June 13, by the flute-players, who were particularly useful to religion. In 207 BC, a guild of poets and actors was formed to meet and make votive offerings at the temple of Minerva on the Aventine Hill. Among others, its members included Livius Andronicus. The Aventine sanctuary of Minerva continued to be an important center of the arts for much of the middle Roman Republic.\n\nAs \"Minerva Medica\", she was the goddess of medicine and physicians. As \"Minerva Achaea\", she was worshipped at Lucera in Apulia where votive gifts and arms said to be those of Diomedes were preserved in her temple.\n\nHer worship also was spread throughout the empire. In Britain, for example, she was syncretized with the local goddess Sulis, who often was invoked for restitution for theft.\n\nIn \"Fasti\" III, Ovid called her the \"goddess of a thousand works\". Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, and when she eventually became equated with the Greek goddess Athena, she also became a goddess of battle. Unlike Mars, god of war, she was sometimes portrayed with sword lowered, in sympathy for the recent dead, rather than raised in triumph and battle lust. In Rome her bellicose nature was emphasized less than elsewhere. \n\nMinerva is featured on the coinage of different Roman emperors. She often is represented on the reverse side of a coin holding an owl and a spear among her attributes.\n\nStemming from an Italic moon goddess \"*Meneswā\" ('She who measures'), the Etruscans adopted the inherited Old Latin name, \"*Menerwā\", thereby calling her Menrva. It is presumed that her Roman name, Minerva, is based on this Etruscan mythology. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to Greek Athena. Like Athena, Minerva burst from the head of her father, Jupiter (Greek Zeus), who had devoured her mother (Metis) in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent her birth.\n\nBy a process of folk etymology, the Romans could have linked her foreign name to the root \"men-\" in Latin words such as \"mens\" meaning \"mind\", perhaps because one of her aspects as goddess pertained to the intellectual. The word \"mens\" is built from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*men-\" 'mind' (linked with memory as in Greek Mnemosyne/μνημοσύνη and \"mnestis\"/μνῆστις: memory, remembrance, recollection, \"manush\" in Sanskrit meaning mind).\n\nThe Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy triad with Tinia and Uni, equivalent to the Roman Capitoline Triad of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.\n\nAs a patron goddess of wisdom, Minerva frequently features in statuary, as an image on seals, and in other forms at educational institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Facsimiles of the originals can be found in the online Biodiversity Heritage Library (Vol.1) and Vol 2).\n\nThe author was the French botanist Jacques Labillardière, who visited the region in 1792 with the d'Entrecasteaux expedition. Published between 1804 and 1806, it is one of the earliest works to describe the plants of the continent; according to Denis and Maisie Carr, \"[i]n practical terms, this was the first general flora of Australia.\"\n\nThe work describes the botanical collections made by himself and his companion on the d'Entrecasteaux expedition, Charles Riche, and the unattributed and later collections of Nicolas Baudin's expedition. Labillardière's collections were seized by the English, but were returned to him in France at the intervention of Joseph Banks. He made his collections at Observatory Island and other locations at the Archipelago of the Recherche. Extensive collection were also made at Recherche Bay, during his two visits to Tasmania.\nThe preface describes the journey \"from Cape of Good Hope to Australia\", an example of the continent being named as 'Australia' before its popularisation by Flinders' use in \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\". The work includes 256 black-and-white botanical illustrations, including contributions by Pierre-Joseph Redouté. Copper plates drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée were produced for other illustrations.\n\nLabillardière had named and described more Australian flora than any other botanist of the day; the work was the most comprehensive until Robert Brown published his \"Prodromus\". This work featured the first descriptions of \"Cephalotus follicularis\", a carnivorous plant, and species \"Adenanthos obovatus\" and \"Gahnia trifida\" from the southern coast. The collections made at southwest Australia also produced new genera \"Adenanthos\" (Proteaceae) and \"Calytrix\" (Myrtaceae), species \"Astartea fascicularis\", \"Hakea clavata\" and \"Taxandria marginata\", and the first description of the now widely introduced \"Acacia saligna\". Tasmanian species include \"Eucryphia lucida\" (leatherwood) and \"Phyllocladus aspleniifolius\" (celery-top pine). The first confirmed collection of Australian bryophytes are described and illustrated by the author; the current name for these species are the mosses \"Cyathophorum bulbosum\" and \"Hypnodendron comosum\" and a liverwort \"Hymenophyton flabellatum\".\n\n\"Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen\" has been praised for the accuracy of its descriptions and for the elegant scientific names coined therein. It has been criticised for its imprecision and occasional errors in collection locality and habitat; for example it attributes the collection of \"Eucalyptus ovata\" to southwest Australia, but it occurs only in Tasmania and southeast Australia. Labillardière has also been criticised for publishing species based upon specimens collected by other botanists, without providing attribution or acknowledgement for the specimens.\n\nThe standard abbreviation for the work, Nov. Holl. Pl., is used in botanical literature, and is also known by the title \"Specimens of the Plants of New Holland\". It is the second publication by Labillardière to describe Australian flora; the first was \"Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse\" in 1799, a popular account of the voyage in search of the La Pérouse expedition. The earlier work contains the first description of plant species such as \"Eucalyptus cornuta\".\n"}

{"id": "20065500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20065500", "title": "Poor Robin", "text": "Poor Robin\n\nPoor Robin was an English 17th and 18th-century satirical almanac series, appearing as Poor Robin's Almanack from 1663. Other similar writings by the pseudonymous Poor Robin were published later, in America and into the 19th century.\n\nThe earliest volume published under the pseudonym of 'Poor Robin' was an almanac calculated from the meridian of Saffron Walden, which is said to have been originally issued in 1661 or 1662. It was taken over by the Stationers' Company, and was continued annually by various hands until 1776. The identity of its original author has been disputed, but is assigned as William Winstanley by Sidney Lee, in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\", who dismisses the claim that Robert Herrick wrote it. He notes the discovery in the parish registers of Saffron Walden for 14 March 1646-7 relating to Robert Winstanley (a nephew of William and a younger brother of Henry Winstanley) but argues that Robert would still have been a boy when the first almanacs were written; a listing for Robert's publications was given by H. Eckroyd Smith. On internal grounds, namely the verse style of William Winstanley in his known works, Lee argues for the latter, and mentions a 1667 portrait of William Winstanley with caption 'Poor Robin,' with verses by Francis Kirkman, in a volume called \"Poor Robin's Jests, or the Compleat Jester'. \n\nIn the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" article on Robert Pory, by Joseph Hirst Lupton, it is said that Pory, at the time of the first edition in 1663 archdeacon of Middlesex, had his name taken in vain with the claim that he had licensed the almanac.\n\nAnother volume in verse by 'Poor Robin,' in which the tone of John Taylor the water-poet is closely followed, was called \"Poor Robin's Perambulation from Saffron Walden to London performed this Month of July 1678\" (London, 1678,); the doggerel poem deals largely with the alehouses on the road, and Lee assigns it to William Winstanley.\n\n\"Poor Robin\" established a tradition of parody, reporting the trivial and inconsequential juxtaposed with the serious, in parallel chronologies—set in rhymed couplets—of the \"Loyal\" and the \"Fanatic\", which began in 1663 and became Old Poor Robin with the 1777 issue. \"Poor Robin\" offered deadpan prognostications of the obvious, and substituted parodic saints' days under the \"Fanatic\" rubric. From the turn of the 18th century, the satire becomes blunted and wise homilies of prudence take their place. It observes the continued use of cucking stools in 1746.\n\nOther works purporting to be by 'Poor Robin' and attributed to Winstanley or his imitators are: \n\n\nIn the 18th century editors included Thomas Peat.\n\n"}

The types of matters handled by school district solicitors can vary significantly, and often include drafting and making recommendations on policies; assisting with labor and employment matters; drafting and reviewing contracts for supplies, construction projects, real estate and more; representing schools in litigation; and assuring compliance with state and federal regulations governing the operation of schools.\n\nMost local school districts are not sovereign entities, but instead get power from whatever state law creates them. The state and federal laws regulating public school districts have become increasingly complex, requiring more and more help from school lawyers in recent years.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a school district solicitor must be a practicing lawyer. There generally is no special license or other registration required. Often, a school district solicitor will work in a private law firm, and the school district will contract with the lawyer or firm for the services. In more rare instances, particularly with larger school entities, the school district may employ its own in-house counsel to act as solicitor.\n\nSchool district solicitors have created a number of professional associations for networking and professional development. For example, the National School Boards Association (NSBA), which is a national advocacy organization made up of school boards from all over the United States, has an affiliated entity known as the Council of School Attorneys (COSA) similarly made up of school district solicitors from throughout the United States.

It was first exhibited at the Tate Modern art gallery in London from October 2010 to May 2011. It is a commentary on the mass production techniques that China caters to Western Countries.\n\nViewers were originally able to interact and walk across the sunflower seeds, but after the Tate Modern Museum recognized that the dust emitting from the installation was harmful to viewers' lungs, they fenced it off. The piece has been exhibited in twelve exhibitions from 2009-2013 in museums and galleries across the world.\n\nAi Weiwei is a conceptual artist in China. Towards the later 20th century, he led societal movements challenging the Chinese Communist Party. Ai has felt the presence and pressures of the society that the Chinese government has imposed on the peoples, and that is generated into his artwork. “‘From a very young age I started to sense that an individual has to set an example in society’, he has said. ‘Your own acts and behaviour tell the world who you are and at the same time what kind of society you think it should be.’”\n\nThis massive art installation includes over 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds that cover a 1,000 square metre floor with a depth of 10cm in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The entire artwork weighs around 150 tons. Each seed went through a 30 step procedure, hand painted and fired at 1,300 degrees. This process required more than 1,600 workers over a span of two and a half years in Jingdezhen, a town that is known as the \"Porcelain Capital,\" and has produced the imperial porcelain for over a thousand years. Ai began the process two-and-a-half years before its exhibition at the Tate Modern.\n\nSunflower seeds were a common theme in the Chinese Communist Party's political propaganda during Ai's childhood. Leader Mao Zedong would often represent himself as the sun, and the people of China as seeds on sunflowers in artworks. Ai also explains that when he was growing up, even the poorest families in China could share the seeds as a treat. The seeds represent optimism during difficult times.\n\nWhen looking at the seeds up close in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, picking out each unique seed proves to be an easy task. However, when standing farther back once each of the 100 million seeds is deposited in a neat and orderly fashion, all together a sense of expanse and immenseness is felt by the viewers. The millions of individually created seeds spread across such a wide space are meant to symbolize the vastness of China, and its uniform and precise order. An individual seed is instantly lost among the millions, symbolizing the conformity and censorship of the Chinese Communist Party. The combination of all the seeds represent that together, the people of China can stand up and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nMost of Ai's artworks and projects carry this theme of making the Chinese Government's faults transparent to the rest of the world, as well as encouraging freedom of expression and strength to act. Along with this, the seeds represent China's growing mass production stemming from the consumerist culture, particularly that in the Western world, upon which Chinese exporters rely. The sculpture directly challenges the “Made in China” mantra that China is known for, considering the labor-intensive and traditional method of creating the work. The work triggered inquiries from the viewers of the piece about their society and the effects of consumerism.\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to allow the telephone number of a subscriber identified by name and address to be found.\n\nThe advent of the Internet and smartphones in the 21st century greatly reduced the need for a paper phone book. Some communities, such as Seattle and San Francisco, sought to ban their unsolicited distribution as wasteful, unwanted and harmful to the environment.\n\nSubscriber names are generally listed in alphabetical order, together with their postal or street address and telephone number. In principle every subscriber in the geographical coverage area is listed, but subscribers may request the exclusion of their number from the directory, often for a fee; their number is then said to be \"unlisted\" (American English), \"ex-directory\" (British English), \"private\" or private number (Australia and New Zealand), or \"non-published\" (Canada).\n\nA telephone directory may also provide instructions: how to use the telephone service, how to dial a particular number, be it local or international, what numbers to access important and emergency services, utilities, hospitals, doctors, and organizations who can provide support in times of crisis. It may also have civil defense or emergency management information. There may be transit maps, postal code/zip code guides, international dialing codes or stadium seating charts, as well as advertising.\n\nIn the US, under current rules and practices, mobile phone and voice over IP listings are not included in telephone directories. Efforts to create cellular directories have met stiff opposition from several fronts, including those who seek to avoid telemarketers.\n\nA telephone directory and its content may be known by the color of the paper it is printed on.\n\nOther colors may have other meanings; for example, information on government agencies is often printed on blue pages or green pages.\n\nTelephone directories can be published in hard copy or in electronic form. In the latter case, the directory can be used provided as an online service through proprietary terminals or over the Internet, or on physical media such as CD-ROM. In many countries directories are both published in book form and also available over the Internet. Printed directories were usually supplied free of charge.\n\nTelephone directories are a type of city directory. Books listing the inhabitants of an entire city were widely published starting in the 18th century, before the invention of the telephone. \n\nThe first telephone directory, consisting of a single piece of cardboard, was issued on 21 February 1878; it listed 50 individuals, businesses, and other offices in New Haven, Connecticut that had telephones.\n\nThe first British telephone directory was published on 15 January 1880 by The Telephone Company. It contained 248 names and addresses of individuals and businesses in London; telephone numbers were not used at the time as subscribers were asked for by name at the exchange. The directory is preserved as part of the British phone book collection by BT Archives.\n\nIn 1938, AT&T commissioned the creation of a new type font, known as BELL GOTHIC, the purpose of which was to be readable at very small font sizes when printed on newsprint where small imperfections were common.\n\nIn 1981 France was the first country to have an electronic directory on a system called Minitel. The directory is called \"11\" after its telephone access number.\n\nIn 1991 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (in \"Feist v. Rural\") that telephone companies do not have a copyright on telephone listings, because copyright protects creativity and not the mere labor of collecting existing information.\n\n1996 was the year the first telephone directories went online in the USA. Yellowpages.com and Whitepages.com both see their start in April.\n\nIn 1999, the first online telephone directories and people-finding sites such as LookupUK.com go online in the UK. In 2003, more advanced UK searching including Electoral Roll become available on LocateFirst.com.\nIn the 21st century, printed telephone directories are increasingly criticized as waste. In 2012, after some North American cities passed laws banning the distribution of telephone books, an industry group sued and obtained a court ruling permitting the distribution to continue. Manufacture and distribution of telephone directories produces over 1,400,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases and consumes over 600,000 tons of paper annually.\n\nA reverse telephone directory is sorted by number, which can be looked up to give the name and address of the subscriber.\n\nRipping phone books in half has often been considered a feat of strength. There are \"Guinness World Records\" for ripping the most phone books within a specific time period: the record for most phone books ripped within three minutes was established by Tina Shelton in 2007 for females (21 books) and by Edward Charon in 2006 for males (56 books).\n\nThe 1984 James Cameron film \"The Terminator\" features a titular 'cyborg assassin' antagonist sent back in time to murder the character Sarah Connor. Knowing only the name and general location of the target, the cyborg uses telephone directories from public phone booths to systematically murder everyone in the local area with that name, in the order in which they appeared in the directory, causing the press and police to use the nickname 'The Phone Book Killer'.\n\n\n"}

Various items and sums of cash were seized.\n\nToich sought an order for the return of the property seized under both warrants, and for the setting aside of the second warrant.\n\nThe court held that the first warrant authorized a search of a certain farm, and not of the applicant's house, which was on an entirely different property. Accordingly, the search of her house had been unauthorized and unlawful, as had been the seizure of her property. Moreover, hardly any of the property seized had been specified in the warrant. In consequence, the applicant was entitled to the return of all the seized items.\n\nRegarding the second warrant, the court found that the police officer had applied to the magistrate for a warrant on the grounds:\n\n\nThe court held that it was clear that the only document relied upon by the police officer in her application for the warrant was her own undated and unattested \"affidavit.\" Given that there had been no \"viva voce\" evidence, and given that the \"affidavit\" had not been attested, there had been no information of any kind placed before the magistrate on oath; he had had no power, therefore, under section 21(1)(a) of the CPA, to authorize the issue of the second warrant; it was accordingly invalid.\n\nFurthermore, the court found that the authorities were clear that the validity of a search warrant was to be examined with a jealous regard for the subject's rights to privacy and property.\n\nIn addition, the magistrate or justice of the peace, in authorizing the warrant, must be satisfied by information on oath only that the article to be searched for and seized was under the control or in the possession of a specified person, or was at a specified premises within his or her jurisdiction.\n\nThe terms of the warrant were to be construed with reasonable strictness. It should ordinarily be read in the terms in which it was expressed.\n\nThere must be reasonable grounds, therefore, for believing that the article sought might afford evidence of an offense, but in the instant case the court held that no such grounds had been advanced to the magistrate. He could consequently not have harbored such a belief.\n\nIt followed that he had not properly applied his mind when issuing the warrant, and that it was invalid.\n"}

Given an English word, the program outputs Latin translations. The software, written in Ada, is free for download but can be used online through several different hosts as well.\n\nThis program, especially the online version, has gained popularity among Latinists because of its simple interface, high coverage of the Latin lexicon and mostly accurate results. Nevertheless, the user has to check the results, since \"WORDS\" uses a set of rules based on natural pre-, in-, and suffixation, declension, and conjugation to determine the possibility of an entry. As a consequence of this approach of analysing the structure of words, there is no guarantee that these words were ever used in Latin literature or speech, even if the program finds a possible meaning to a given word.\n\nA few years after the original author's death, the software became the subject of active digital preservation efforts.\n\nThe dictionary consists of about 39,000 entries, which would result in hundreds of thousands of variations, counting declensions and conjugations.\n\nAdditionally, the dictionary contains prefixes and suffixes.\n\nIn comparison, the Oxford Latin Dictionary, considered to be the most complete Latin lexicon published in the English language, has about 34,000 entries, excluding proper names. The Oxford Latin Dictionary has fewer entries because it only contains entries from Classical Latin, whereas WORDS contains words from many time periods.\n\nFor instance, given the Latin verb form \"amābantur\", WORDS analyzes it as:\n\namābantur = am + (ā + ba + nt + ur), where\n\nSo \"amābantur\" is the passive, 3rd person, plural, imperfect, indicative form of the verb \"to love\", which would be translated \"they were being loved\".\n\nWilliam A. Whitaker (1936–2010) was a colonel in the United States Air Force. While at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), he chaired the High Order Language Working Group that recommended development of the computer language Ada, in which WORDS is written. An amateur Latinist, he created the translation software called WORDS after his retirement from the forces.\n\n\n"}
