There are 53 kinds of jobs, each of which exercises a different aspect of the operating system, such as disk-file operations, process creation, user virtual memory operations, pipe I/O, and compute-bound arithmetic loops\n\nAn AIM7 benchmark run is composed of a sequence of subruns with the number of tasks incrementing by one between each subrun. Each subrun goes until each of its tasks has completed its set of jobs. Each subrun reports a metric of jobs completed per minute, with the final report for the overall benchmark being a table of that throughput metric versus number of tasks. A given system will have a peak number of tasks N at which the jobs per minute is maximized. Either N or the value of the jobs per minute at N is typically used as the metric of interest.\n"}

In traditional underwriting, an APS is one of the most frequently ordered additional sources of medical background information. The APS is one of the more expensive underwriting requirements, as well as the most time consuming. It is usually completed only when a doctor has free time, as their primary focus is caring for patients. The underwriting cycle time is often severely hampered by the APS as it could take weeks or even months to obtain. Once obtained, it can be laborious to review and summarize as APS reports can be large documents containing an indepth medical history information which may or may not be relevant.\n\nIn structured underwriting the data capture process with the proposed insured is asked very detailed questions to attempt to reduce the number of attending physician's statements necessary. However, many medical conditions require supporting evidence from the physician. This is where an APS Summary can assist the underwriter in evaluating the proposed insured's medical risk(s). The APS summaries however, are only as good as the underwriter's experience which varies widely from person to person. Additionally, APS summaries when processed without a “template structure” guiding the information gathered from the APS often yield inconsistent or miss critical underwriting information. Either inconsistent or missing underwriting information will compromise the risk analysis process.\n\nBy leveraging a seasoned underwriter's knowledge and experiences, scripts can be built that ensure the appropriate medical information is captured and recorded from the APS document. This is done by creating scripts that prompt the person summarizing the APS to enter all pertinent specific medical condition uncovered.\n"}

She was elected as Public Advocate for New York City in 2001, and reelected in 2005. She was the third woman elected to a citywide post in NYC history. The other two were Carol Bellamy, who served as City Council President from 1978-1985, and Elizabeth Holtzman, who served as Comptroller from 1990-1993. She is a Democrat.\n\nElisabeth \"Betsy\" Flower attended The Brearley School and graduated from the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry in 1956. She attended Connecticut College for two years, followed by Barnard College. She earned her B.A. from George Washington University in 1961. After graduation, she moved to Recife, Brazil, where she taught high school English and mastered Spanish and Portuguese. She returned to New York several years later and earned a master's degree in Education from Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nGotbaum became involved in civic affairs in the 1970s, while serving on the staff of former Mayor John Lindsay as District Manager for the Chelsea-Clinton (Manhattan West) Neighborhood, Assistant for Women's Issues, and Assistant for Education. She continued her work in education with Mayor Abraham Beame, managing a training program for school security officers. In the late 1970s, she was recruited to run the New York Police Foundation. At the Police Foundation, she developed an innovative citywide health screening and work-site hypertension program with the New York City Police Department and facilitated an intensive training program for 911 operators. She created a program engaging New York City in a campaign to purchase bulletproof vests for every police officer. In 1990 newly elected Mayor David Dinkins appointed her the first female Commissioner of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Gotbaum created a toll-free Parks hotline and successfully argued for a change in city policy allowing Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and other organizations use of Central Park for fundraising events. \n\nAfter leaving the Parks Department in 1994, Gotbaum became President of the New-York Historical Society, a position she held until launching her campaign for Public Advocate in 2001. When she took over, the Historical Society was closed to the public and on the verge of bankruptcy after years of mismanagement. Gotbaum rescued the institution from financial collapse, renovated its landmark building, and recalled its collections from various warehouses. In November 2000, she opened the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture. She instituted exhibitions, education and public programs for a diverse and ever-increasing audience, leaving the society with a $33 million endowment. Gotbaum resigned from the Historical Society to run for the Office of the Public Advocate. \n\nIn 2001, Gotbaum finished first in the Democratic primary and then defeated Norman Siegel in the Democratic runoff. She was unopposed in the general election. As Public Advocate she focused on education policy, along with women's issues, child welfare, affordable housing and senior services. She was known to work with Mayor Michael Bloomberg on certain issues, but she battled Bloomberg on mayoral succession issues. In return, Bloomberg sought to eliminate the office altogether in 2002 and reduced its budget. At the request of the New York State Legislature, Gotbaum created a Commission on School Governance to examine mayoral control before it expires in 2009. \n\nIn the September 13, 2005 Democratic primary, Gotbaum beat civil rights advocate Norman Siegel, and real estate broker Michael Brown came in third with fifteen percent of NYC's vote. She was unopposed in the general election. She took the oath of office for a second term on January 1, 2006. \n\nDespite the extension of New York City term limits, which made Gotbaum eligible for a third term, she decided not to run for reelection.\n\nGotbaum was featured in this docudrama directed by Madeleine Sackler, in which she shared some of her views:\n\nHer husband, Victor Gotbaum (1921-2015) was a retired New York City labor leader who served for 22 years as president of AFSCME District Council 37, New York's largest public employee union. She has a daughter from her first marriage.\n\nOn September 28, 2007, her stepdaughter-in-law, Carol Gotbaum, died in custody shortly after she was arrested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, after getting into a confrontation with gate crews who refused to allow her to board a plane to Tucson. In May 2008, the family filed a lawsuit against the City of Phoenix.\n\n\n\n"}

At their peaks, both states controlled a large portion of the world population and produced political and cultural legacies that endure to the modern era; comparative studies largely focus on their similar scale at their pinnacles and on parallels in their rise and decline. The vast majority of studies focus on one or the other; however, the comparison of the two has enjoyed somewhat increased interest in the 21st century with several studies examining the concepts of ethnicity, identity, and views of foreigners.\n\nWalter Scheidel reviewed the previous scholarship when he explained the purpose of Stanford University's Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project and the framework of its study in the early 21st century. Max Weber and Karl August Wittfogel both wrote works comparing the ancient Mediterranean and China; however, their studies have had little influence on later ancient historians. Scheidel gives this as a contributing cause to the relative paucity of comparative studies between the two. The majority of the research in the subject area has concentrated on looking at the intellectual and philosophical history of each society. He also noted a change in the direction of research in the 2000s, with a refocusing on the \"nature of moral, historical, and scientific thought\" in Ancient Greece and China.\n\nSeveral scholars have made comparative studies of the two empires. As historian Samuel Adshead puts it, \"Other comparisons could be made ... None, however, offers so close a parallel with Han China as the Roman empire\". These have tended to focus on the philosophical and intellectual histories of China and the Greco-Roman world, and despite modern interest, gaps remain in the scholarship comparing Rome and the Han Empire. Scheidel notes that there are no comparative studies of high culture; there is also a virtual absence of work on \"political, social, economic or legal history\" of the Greco-Roman world and ancient China. However, he does note that Adshead does briefly address the issue. Wittfogel's work has come in for criticism by later historians, but his studies have not fully been supplanted by up to date theses. In modern studies of imperialism, ancient China has generally been overlooked. In Scheidel's words, \"[compared to the study of Europe and China in the early modern period] the comparative history of the largest agrarian empires of antiquity has attracted no attention at all. This deficit is only explicable with reference to academic specialization and language barriers\".\n\nThe emergence of the United States of America as effectively the only superpower in the world after the fall of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century led to a renewed interest in empires and their study. For instance, the Roman Empire has occasionally been held up as a model for American dominance. The United States' hegemony is unprecedented in the modern system and thus the only illuminating cases can be found in pre-modern systems: “One difficulty with analyzing unipolarity is that we have mainly the current case, although examining the Roman and ancient China could be illuminating.”\n\nIn general, with the rise of the American primacy the study of historical empires, such as Han China and Rome, increased. In the field of comparative studies between empires, not just Rome and China, Shmuel Eisenstadt's \"The Political System of Empires\" (1963) has been described as influential as it pioneered the comparative approach. The act of comparing the Roman and Han empires is aided by the amount of written evidence from both, as well as other artefactual sources. In the words of Fritz-Heiner Mutschler and Achim Mittag, \"Comparing the Roman and Chinese empires contributes not only to understanding the trajectories along which the two civilizations developed, but also to heightening our awareness of possible analogies between the present and the past, be it with regard to America or China.\" Recent work by Ronald A. Edwards shows how such comparisons can be helpful in understanding ancient Chinese and Roman political institutions.\n\nPrinciples of sociological examination have been identified that can be applied to the study of China and Rome. They draw on analytical and illustrative comparisons.\n\nOne of the most appealing reasons for historians to begin comparing China and Rome, is their ascent to political hegemony over the Mediterranean and East Asia. However, political comparisons by Adshead have received negative response from Chinese history experts; citing his lack of use of Chinese sources, poor support of his arguments and an eagerness to take poorly supported points as facts.\n\nNonetheless more recently, China scholars have been engaging in comparative work on political institutions between China and Rome – see work by Ronald A. Edwards – and between China the early modern Europe – see work by Victoria Tin-bor Hui.\n\nAccording to Adshead's book \"China in World History\", comparing Han China and the Roman Empire gives context and assists understanding of China's interactions and relations with other civilisations of Antiquity. In his China and the Roman Empire before Constantine, their \"differences outweighed the similarities\". In the opinion of Scheidel:\n\n\n\n\n"}

This special committee, created by a 409–10 vote of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 18, 1998, was tasked with the responsibility of investigating whether technology or information was transferred to the People's Republic of China that may have contributed to the enhancement of the nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles or to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA similar investigation had already begun in the U.S. Senate under the leadership of Senator Fred Thompson (Republican-Tennessee). Thompson had opened his hearings on China's influence in America's 1996 presidential and congressional elections 11 months earlier (on July 8, 1997).\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee was Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California, whose name became synonymous with the committee's final report. Four other Republicans and Democrats served on the panel, including Representative Norm Dicks, who served as the ranking Democratic member. The committee's final report was approved unanimously by all 9 members. The redacted version of the report was released to the public May 25, 1999.\n\nThe Cox Report contained five major allegations about China and nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile several groups, including the People's Republic of China, contend that the Report is overstated or inaccurate, its authors and supporters maintain that its gist is undeniable. The report's basic findings were as follows, quoted from the above document's opening summary:\n\nThe Cox Report's release prompted major legislative and administrative reforms. More than two dozen of the Select Committee's recommendations were enacted into law, including the creation of a new National Nuclear Security Administration to take over the nuclear weapons security responsibilities of the United States Department of Energy. At the same time, no person has ever been convicted of providing nuclear information to the PRC, and the one case that was brought in connection to these charges, that of Wen Ho Lee, fell apart.\n\nIn response to the allegations contained in the report, the CIA appointed retired U.S. Navy Admiral David Jeremiah to review and assess the report's findings. In April 1999, Admiral Jeremiah released a report backing up the Cox Report's main allegation that stolen information had been used to develop or modernize Chinese missiles and/or warheads.\n\nThe Chinese government called all allegations \"groundless\".\n\nRichard L. Garwin remarked that stolen information regarding the W-70 and W-88 warhead would not appear to directly impair U.S. national security since to develop weapons based on this technology would require a massive investment in resources and not be in their best strategic interests with regard to their nuclear program.\n\nAn assessment report that was published by Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation said that the language of the Cox report \"was inflammatory and some allegations did not seem to be well supported.\"\nTwo of the U.S. companies named in the report – Loral Space and Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. – were later successfully prosecuted by the federal government for violations of U.S. export control law, resulting in the two largest fines in the history of the Arms Export Control Act. Loral paid a $14 million fine in 2002, and Hughes paid a $32 million fine in 2003.\n\n"}

Cover art was by Kevin Jenkins with Russ Nicholson and Arun Pottier providing maps and illustrations.\n\nOriginally planned as a twelve-book series, only six were released between 1995 and 1996 before the series was cancelled. The first two books were also printed under the name \"Quest\" in the U.S. by publishers Price Stern Sloan. Beginning in July 2015, the makers of Fabled Lands launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund completion of Book Seven; the Kickstarter campaign hit its base target within the first 45 minutes it was online.\n\nThe books are now back in print and available on Amazon as of December 2010. \n\nTwo iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch applications were developed by Megara Entertainment. The first app, based on \"The War-Torn Kingdom\", included new colour art and original coloured in art from Russ Nicholson, and was released on January 20, 2011. The second app was released in June, 2011. Following Megara's decision to withdraw from app development in 2012, digital rights reverted to the authors and the apps were withdrawn from sale.\n\nA Fabled Lands Role Playing Game and 12 source books based on the original game books are being written by Shane Garvey and Jamie Wallis of Greywood Publishing. The RPG rules are based on the original rules of the game books but have been expanded to accommodate an adventuring party rather than a solo player and a role playing experience rather than a game book. The twelve source books are each based on an area covered by the six published and the six unpublished game books from 1995. The first of these source books is titled \"Sokara - The War-Torn Kingdom\". The RPG and first of the source books were released in mid-2011.\n\nThe books deviated from other mainstream gamebooks (such as the Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf series) in a number of ways. The most notable of these was the open-ended, free roaming gameplay. Other gamebooks gave the character a set quest, with some leniency in how they went about accomplishing it; when they completed the quest, the gamebook ended. The Fabled Lands series gave the player an entire fantasy world to roam around in, doing whatever they wished with no limits or linearity; there was no set quest and there is no way to \"finish\" the series (unless the player dies). There are hundreds of quests in the six books that were published, of varying lengths. The player is free to pursue these at their leisure, or spend their time doing entirely different things - wandering, trading, exploring or building up their abilities.\n\nEach book contained a different geographic area of the Fabled Lands, and the player could easily travel between regions by switching to another book. The books became increasingly difficult as they progressed, with tougher enemies and harder quests; this was to account for the player becoming more powerful as they went through each book.\n\nOther differences between previous gamebook series included:\n\nAlthough the final six books in the series have never been published (or even written), Dave Morris has indicated in the past that he is interested in reviving the series:\nOn September 13, 2010, Dave Morris indicated that the series had a possible chance of a revival on his blog, saying, in response to a fan query about the future of the fabled lands and particularly the book \"The Serpent King's Domain\", \"My lips are sealed, though I will say that Frank Johnson, the head of Fabled Lands LLP, was throwing those same words around last week. He might even have thrown in a labyrinth and some legions :)\". In a later announcement, Morris indicated that the publisher was willing to greenlight the production of books 7-12 of the series, provided that the reprintings of books 1-6 each sold approximately ten thousand copies.\n\nThe Fabled Lands system was fairly simple, as with most other gamebooks. The player has six basic attributes:\n\n\nThe player's initial score in each of these six attributes is determined by their chosen profession. There are six different professions to choose from: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Troubadour and Wayfarer (a wandering traveller, most similar to Rangers in other fantasy systems). Each profession is proficient or weak in different abilities; for example, Priests have high SANCTITY but low COMBAT scores, and Wayfarers have high SCOUTING but low CHARISMA scores. The player has opportunities to increase these abilities throughout the books by completing quests. For example, after successfully tracking down a wild boar in a forest, the player can roll two dice, and if they score higher than their SCOUTING ability they can increase it by 1. No ability can be raised higher than 12, or drop below 1.\n\nWhen the player is given the opportunity to use an ability, the task is given a Difficulty rating. The player rolls two dice and adds their score in the ability; to succeed in the task, they must score higher than the difficulty. For example, a player wishes to calm down an angry innkeeper. This might have a CHARISMA score of 9, and the player's CHARISMA ability is 3. The player would have to roll 7 or higher to succeed. It is possible to obtain \"blessings\" in various abilities from different shrines and temples, which allow the player to reroll failed ability rolls. These work once only, however, and cost money.\n\nCombat in the Fabled Lands is an extension of ability rolls; the enemy's DEFENCE is the Difficulty, and the player uses their COMBAT skill to try to defeat their opponent. The amount the player rolls above the enemy's DEFENCE is how many Stamina points the enemy loses.\n\nThe player's own DEFENCE score is equal to their Rank + their COMBAT score + the bonus for any armour they are wearing (if any). Their own Stamina score is given when they begin playing, and can be increased by going up in Rank (which gives them 1d6 Stamina).\n\nThe player's starting Rank is equal to the number of the book they begin in (e.g. a player starting in \"The War-Torn Kingdom\" begins at 1st Rank, while a player starting in \"Lords of the Rising Sun\" begins at 6th Rank). The player can increase Rank by performing extremely difficult tasks, such as slaying a dragon or defeating three samurai in unarmed combat (the book will tell the player when they can increase in Rank).\n\nThe player can carry up to 12 possessions, which are marked in bold text (e.g. \"gold compass\"). Some items give ability bonuses - for example, an \"amber wand (MAGIC +1)\" or a set of \"splint armour (DEFENCE + 4)\". The player can carry unlimited amounts of cash.\n\nThe series feature a number of smaller quests, which can help the player increase their personal might, status and wealth. Many of these, however, are profession-specific: In the \"War-Torn Kingdom\", for instance, only a Wayfarer will get the Chief Druid's mission on the Druid's Isle, while in \"The Plains of Howling Darkness\" only a Rogue may claim the title of 'Nightstalker'.\n\n\"Sokara, a nation at war with itself\"\n\nSet in the land of Sokara, shortly after a civil war in which the king was overthrown in a military coup. This background provides the book's two major quests; the player can choose to either help the heir to the throne and his band of partisans regain power, or assist the new leader General Grieve Marlock in crushing the last few pockets of resistance.\n\nOther quests involve assassinating the king of the rat-men infesting the sewers in the city of Yellowport, looting treasure from the lair of Vayss the Sea Dragon, delivering packages between the druids of the City of Trees and the Forest of Larun, defeating the Black Dragon Knight in combat to the death and rescuing a trapped god from the summit of Devil's Peak.\n\n679 sections, \n\n\"Golnir, a wealthy land steeped in curious folklore\"\n\nSet in the prosperous kingdom of Golnir, wealthy from its rich agriculture. A common complaint readers had about the second book was that it was far more difficult to find quests than in the first book. There are still several major quests, however, including slaying a dragon for the Baroness Ravayne (the ruler of Golnir), searching for magical artefacts for the wizard Estragon, bringing to justice a murderer on behalf of his victim's ghost, finding the key of stars to gain access to a treasure filled tomb in the Forest of the Forsaken and making a map of the northern mountains.\n\nThe quests in the second book have a more whimsical, fairy tale nature to them than those in the first book. This gives Golnir a very strong Merry England atmosphere.\n\n786 sections, \n\n\"Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas\"\n\nSet in the Violet Ocean, which separates the northern continent of Harkuna from the southern continent of Ankon-Konu. Travel is severely restricted without a ship, making it a difficult book to start off in, particularly for less experienced gamebook readers. \"Over the Blood-Dark Sea\" is also one of the first in the series to feature regular danger - the player is almost always at risk of pirates, storms and even sea monsters. \n\nKey quests include assassinating Amcha, king of the pirates, enrolling at a wizard's college in the city of Dweomer to learn magic, searching for buried treasure on hidden islands and climbing the enormous mountain on Starspike Island. \n\n718 sections, \n\n\"The desolate wastes of the Great Steppes\"\n\nSet in the Great Steppes, an environment of grasslands, plains and tundra similar to Siberia and Mongolia. Key quests include liberating the Citadel of Veris Corin for the King of Sokara (closely linked with quests in \"The War-Torn Kingdom\"), releasing the King of Harkuna from his prison underneath the Rimewater (closely linked with quests in \"The Court of Hidden Faces\") and killing the immortal tyrant Kaschuf (based on the legend of Koschei the Deathless) who rules over the village of Vodhya (which requires the player to find and release his soul, hidden on an island in \"Over The Blood-Dark Sea\").\n\nThis was the first book in the series to introduce the concept of a harsh environment - out on the Steppes, the player must make constant SCOUTING rolls in order to find enough food, and on the northern steppes the player loses one point of stamina a day from the cold, unless they have a wolf pelt to keep warm.\n\n710 sections, \n\n\"Exotic intrigue in Uttaku and Old Harkuna\"\n\nSet in the nation of Uttaku (similar to the Byzantine Empire), which is occupying the kingdom of Old Harkuna (similar to the lands of Arthurian legend). If the player frees the king of Old Harkuna from his prison in \"The Plains of Howling Darkness\", the king can reclaim his land, end the Uttaku occupation and restore prosperity. There is also an abandoned castle in Harkuna which the player can rebuild and claim for himself. Most other major quests involve undertaking tasks for the Uttakin government (the titular Court).\n\nThe book takes its title from Uttaku's court of ruling nobles, who wear elaborate masks as a status symbol and to hide their faces. The king himself is born without a face at all.\n\n723 sections, \n\n\"Imperial Akatsurai, land of samurai and ninja\"\n\nSet in a land which is an obvious parallel of classical Japan of the Heian period. Much like \"The War Torn Kingdom\", a revolution is occurring. The self-proclaimed Shogun Yoritomo has declared himself in charge of the eastern seaboard, while the young Imperial Sovereign Takakura rules the country nominally, with real power being in the hands of the chancellor, Lord Kiyomori, who remains in control of the western seaboard. The country is on the brink of a civil war (like Japan during the Genpei War to which the names \"Yoritomo\" and \"Kiyomori\" allude). Although the player can undertake quests for both sides of the revolution, the two forces never actually begin war as they do in the first book.\n\nOther major quests involving retrieving a tatsu pearl from a great dragon, exploring Kwaidan Forest to learn the secrets of the tengu, and venturing into the Black Pagoda.\n\n750 sections, \n\n\"The lost tribes of the Feathered Lands\"\n\nSet in the jungles of the southern continent of Ankon-Konu, a land similar to Africa or South America. \n\nThis book was not published in the 1990s, but in 2018 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It was written by Paul Gresty. The spirit realm, Elaz Carnquen, hangs closely over this world, which allows you travel into the spirit realm. And due to the excessive heat of this area, some armor cannot withstand it and you receive a handicap on your COMBAT value if you do not wear resistant armor. Quests include activating the titan at Borotek, restoring order at Ruined Tarshesh over who was to blame over the fall of it, defeating the Serpent King, Namagal (which requires some mini-quests on its own) and merging with the verdant spire, which allows dominance over the land.\n\n1200 sections, \n\n\"The harsh deserts of western Ankon-konu\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set in the Desert of Bones, in Ankon-Konu. This presumably would have been the Fabled Lands' equivalent of the Sahara. Notes from David Morris indicate the region is home to genii and inspired by the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. It also featured the Blue Grasslands, which according to information in the first six books is populated by blue-skinned nomads - descendants of the Uttakin featured in \"The Court Of Hidden Faces\" - and tribes like the Golden men and their flying arks. Other locations would have been the City of Stargazers, and the Country of the Hidden Ones - judging from information in the first six books, and the names on the map, it would have been similar to the Himalayan countries of Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan.\n\nThe phrase 'the lone and level sands' appears in Shelley's poem \"Ozymandias\".\n\n\"Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set (as the subtitle implies) in the western locations of Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts.\n\nChrysoprais presumably would have been very similar to India; the names on the maps have an Indian flavour (for example, the Crimson Fort rather than the Red Fort). Also, a few clues are left in the first six books regarding the culture of Chrysoprais - for example, in the Japanese-inspired land of Akatsurai featured in \"Lords of the Rising Sun\", there is a religion following the \"Sage of Peace\" which is clearly based on Buddhism. If the player fails in a quest relating to the Sage of Peace, they can travel west to \"the saint of Vulture Peak\" (found in Chrysoprais) to seek redemption and enlightenment. This suggests that people in both Chrysoprais and Akatsurai worship the Sage of Peace; in real life, Buddhism originated in India and later spread to Japan.\n\n\"Philosopher kings of the west\"\n\nThis book was never published, but would have been set in the western lands of Atticala. Atticala was clearly inspired by Ancient Greece; the map of the Fabled Lands reveals this, as many of the towns have Greek-sounding names and are symbolised by Greek architecture.\n\nThe name \"Atticala\" is also similar to \"Attica\", a region of Greece.\n\n\"Danger in the heart of a vast metropolis\"\n\nThis book was never published, but was to have been set in the city of Dangor in the mysterious \"Forbidden Realm.\" It is not known how the book would have been structured to fit within a single city - all other Fabled Lands books were spread over an entire landscape, with many cities and towns in between.\n\nVery little is known about Dangor, except that it is situated at the top of cliffs hundreds of metres high called \"The Golden Cliffs.\" Dangor's harbour is apparently at the very top of these cliffs, with the rest of the city. In \"Over The Blood Dark Sea\", the player can read the account of a Sokaran sailor in the library of Dweomer. He recounts of how his ship waited for three days at the bottom of the cliffs, while a mountain climber took their documents to the port authorities above. When all was found to be in order, \"grapples were lowered and secured and the whole vessel was winched up to the docks a thousand feet above.\"\n\nDangor may have been inspired by the near East, as it is symbolized by what appears to be a near Eastern palace on the map.\n\n\"The ultimate journey\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set in the underworld of the Fabled Lands. Whether the authors intended for this to be a series of caves and caverns or a literal Hell (or both) is uncertain; there are many entrances to the twelfth book throughout the first six. Some of these are through caves and tunnels, while others are through magical gateways, by falling off the edge of the world (in both of these instances the player is told that they will arrive in \"Hell\"), or even board a ship in a celestial harbor.\n\nA series of magical gateways found throughout the books allows the player to travel instantaneously to the many cities of the Fabled Lands, including those in books that were never published. One of these was called \"Erebus\" and sent the player to the twelfth book. In Greek mythology, Erebus was a god associated with the underworld.\n\nIn 1996, the authors decided to use their experience with gamebooks to enter the computer games industry – taking the Fabled Lands series with them. They started work at Eidos Interactive on an MMO. Eidos was sceptical as to whether an MMO could be successful, but was interested to see what might happen, and set the authors up with a team to research the relevant technology. The team's plans for the game were extremely ambitious for the late 90s, as the Fabled Lands MMO was supposed to include an advanced AI that acted as a digital gamesmaster, tailoring the experience for each player. \nThe game was never released; according to Morris and Thomson, this was caused by their own over-ambitious designs, colleagues who didn't understand their ideas and the general poor management of game design and development at the time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32065285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32065285", "title": "Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia)", "text": "Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia)\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) is a member-funded Australian ombudsman service that provides external dispute resolution for consumers who are unable to resolve complaints with member financial services organisations.\n\nThe FOS is led by the Chief Ombudsman, presently Shane Tregillis. He is supported by lead ombudsmen for banking and finance, general insurance, and investment and advice; with ten other ombudsmen supporting various functional areas and disputes.\n\nThe FOS was established on 1 July 2008 following the merger of the Financial Industry Complaints Service (FICS) with the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman (BFSO) and Insurance Ombudsman Service (IOS); all of which were industry self-regulatory bodies. Two additional schemes chose to merge with the FOS later in 2009, the Credit Union Dispute Resolution Centre and the Insurance Brokers Disputes Limited.\n\nThe principles underpinning FOS’s operations and processes are to resolve disputes between consumers and financial services providers in accordance with its Terms of Reference.\n\nBanks and financial services providers must be licensed to provide their services to consumers. It is a condition of such a licence that the bank or financial services provider be a member of an External Dispute Resolution (EDR) scheme that is approved by ASIC. FOS and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) are the two schemes approved by ASIC under the Corporations Act and the National Consumer Credit Protection Act\n\nThe FOS only considers a complaint after the customer has first attempted and failed to resolve their complaint directly with their financial services provider. Most disputes with financial services providers in Australia are resolved between the customer and the relevant bank, credit provider, insurance company or other financial services provider. However, if a dispute is not able to be resolved directly, FOS can then consider it.\n\nThe FOS can make an official recommendation or determination and require a financial services provider to;\n\nThe complainant (but not the financial services provider) may accept or reject the determination within 30 days of receiving it. If the complainant accepts the determination, it is binding on both parties. Dispute resolution by the FOS is free of charge for consumers.\n\nThe FOS is governed by an board of consumer representatives and financial services industry representatives. The Chair of the Board, since 2015, is Professor the Hon. Michael Lavarch . A public company limited by guarantee, called the Financial Ombudsman Service Limited, is the owner of the FOS. This company is approved by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) in accordance with Regulatory Guide 139.\n\nIn 2015 a complaint was raised in Submission 134 to the Senate committee on the scrutiny of financial advice concerning six conversations between the Ombudsman and a consumer’s representative, who had recorded the telephone conversation. Submission 134 made it clear that there were differences between the telephone recordings and the working notes of those conversations made by the Ombudsman. Thereafter the Ombudsman was reported by media as having confirmed \"the decision to refer the matter to a court given the complexity of the dispute, the inability of the FOS to cross examine all relevant witnesses and compel the production of information from third parties, as well as the need to engage experts\", even though in recordings of the conversations the same Ombudsman said the only reason to dismiss the complaint was lack of staff, that the complaint had merit and that if the FOS had staff they would have ruled the dispute inside jurisdiction. It was this decision that subsequently resulted in Supreme Court proceedings to challenge the jurisdictional decision of the FOS not to handle the particular complaint.\n\nThe FOS did not respond in substance. ASIC did not respond to the questions and, since the filing, other senators called for the FOS to explain the circumstances. ASIC appeared before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 16 March 2015, where it stated that the Court dealt ith the issue of the misleading file notes. On 19 June 2015, the Supreme Court of Victoria found in the FOS's favour but it did not address the discrepancies in materials. The Court stated in its judgment that it did not examine any issues beyond the actual decision of the FOS itself, thus it did not examine any materials (including the file notes and the recordings), nor did it dealt with any allegations of misconduct. The FOS released a media statement attempting to dismiss the allegations and rely on the ruling by the court. The statement did not address allegations in the submission about misleading file notes presented in the discovery phase of a trial. Following media coverage of this case there were calls by a number of Australian Senators, including Senator Nick Xenophon, for the FOS to be disbanded and replaced with a government funded body.\n\nDespite criticism of the FOS, consumer advocacy group CHOICE and the government regulator, ASIC, are generally supportive of the FOS. CHOICE has stated that \"while there is room for improvement, the Financial Ombudsman Service is providing an essential service of a high standard.\" Furthermore, ASIC have continued to support the FOS as an 'approved EDR scheme'.\n\nIn November 2016, the FOS attempted to explain limitations to its capability to enforce its rulings when financial services providers would not or were unable to pay compensation in cases decided in a consumer's favour. In such cases, consumers may have to seek formal Court-based enforcement proceedings or assistance from the industry regulator. The FOS has proposed an industry funded 'compensation scheme of last resort' be established to help pay consumers their awarded compensation if left stranded by insolvent or belligerent providers.\n\nIn 2016 the government announced a review into Australia's EDR schemes for the financial system, including the FOS. In November 2016 a Lower House parliamentary committee, which has a majority of incumbent government MPs, recommended a banking tribunal be established to replace the FOS, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The outcome of the EDR review is expected in March 2017. In December 2016 an Australian Treasury appointed panel agreed that the FOS needs an added accountability mechanism in the form of an independent auditor.\n\n\n"}

The series has been a worldwide success with editions in numerous languages.\n\nThe books are an example of a media franchise, consistently sporting a distinctive cover—usually yellow and black with a triangular-headed cartoon figure known as the \"Dummies Man\", and an informal, blackboard-style logo. Prose is simple and direct; bold icons, such as a piece of string tied around an index finger, are placed in the margin to indicate particularly important passages.\n\nAlmost all \"Dummies\" books are organized around sections called \"parts\", which are groups of related chapters. Parts are almost always preceded by a Rich Tennant comic that refers to some part of the subject under discussion. Sometimes the same Tennant drawing reappears in another \"Dummies\" book with a new caption.\n\nAnother constant in the \"Dummies\" series is \"The Part of Tens\", a section at the end of the books where lists of 10 items are included. They are usually resources for further study and sometimes also include amusing bits of information that do not fit readily elsewhere.\n\nThe first title, \"DOS For Dummies\", was written by Dan Gookin and published in November 1991 by IDG Books. \"DOS For Dummies\" became popular due to the rarity of beginner-friendly materials for using DOS. The Windows title written by Andy Rathbone was soon released. While initially the series focused solely on software and technology topics, it later branched out to more general-interest titles, with topics as diverse as \"Acne For Dummies\", \"Chess For Dummies\", \"Fishing For Dummies\" and many other topics, including recent legal topics with \"Success as a Mediator For Dummies\" in 2012. The series is now published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., which acquired Hungry Minds (the new name for IDG Books as of 2000) in early 2001.\n\nNotable \"For Dummies\" books include:\n\nSeveral related series have been published, including \"Dummies 101\", with step-by-step tutorials in a large-format book (now discontinued); \"More ... for Dummies\", which are essentially sequels to the first \"... For Dummies\" book on the subject; \"For Dummies Quick Reference\", which is a condensed alphabetical reference to the subject. A larger \"All-in-One Desk Reference\" format offers more comprehensive coverage of the subject, normally running about 750 pages. Also, some books in the series are smaller and do not follow the same formatting style as the others.\n\nWiley has also launched an interactive online course with Learnstreet based on its popular book, \"Java for Dummies\", 5th edition.\n\nA spin-off board game, \"Crosswords for Dummies\", was produced in the late 1990s. The game is similar to \"Scrabble\", but instead of letter tiles, players draw short strips of cardboard containing pre-built English words. The words vary in length from three to seven letters, with more points acquired for playing longer words. Another board game, \"SAT Game for Dummies\", is used in SAT preparation. A \"Chess for Dummies\" was made, a black-and-yellow chessboard with a picture of a piece, along with a summary of how the piece moves, printed its starting positions, although there is a book with the same name.\n\nIn 2009, French publisher Anuman Interactive obtained the digital exploitation rights and launched many applications based on the \"For Dummies\" collection, such as \"Home Design 3D For Dummies\" and \"History For Dummies\".\n\nWith more than 200 million books in print and around 2,500 titles, \"For Dummies\" brings together a bevy of authors including Dan Gookin, Karl Barksdale, Michael Taillard and Andy Rathbone, Mary Jane Sterling, Mark Ryan and Stephen P.

Its first atlas, of London, was originally compiled in the 1930s by Phyllis Pearsall. The company she founded now publishes street maps of many cities and towns in the UK.\n\nUntil relatively recently, maps produced by the \"Geographers' (A–Z) Map Company\" did not include a publication date. Some clues to dating include:\n\nOn all A–Z maps, there is a 3 or 4 letter code in one of the corners, often the one containing the key. These letters represent numbers, which are the cartographic date, in the form (M)MYY. There was at least one scheme used, and perhaps a second.\n\nIn one scheme, the letters JIHGFEDCBA represent the digits 1 to 9 and 0, so that HFD would be 357, indicating a publication date of March 1957. This seems to have been used on all the company's folding maps, and possibly also those in book form.\n\nThe \"Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas\" and the story of how Phyllis Pearsall came to write the first edition covering London were featured in a 2005 episode of Nicholas Crane's \"Map Man\" TV programme. This revealed that, on all their maps, A–Z print a non-existent trap street so that they can tell if a map has been illegally copied from theirs, a technique used by several publishers of reference works (see fictitious entry).\n\nThe story of Pearsall's creation of the A–Z also inspired the musical \"The A–Z of Mrs P\".\n\nThe London A–Z is a plot device in \"The Blind Banker\", the second episode of the first series of the BBC drama \"Sherlock\" when the protagonist is attempting to decipher a book code used by an international smuggling ring based on a book \"everybody owns\". After attempting to decipher the code using a dictionary and the Bible, Sherlock goes out into Baker Street and appropriates a copy of the A–Z after seeing it being used by a couple of tourists.\n\n\"Geographers' A-Z Map Company\" was the official supplier of atlases and maps for the 2012 Olympic Games and 2012 Paralympic Games and produced detailed maps for the Olympic Park in Stratford, as well as all the other venues that were used during the games in London and throughout the United Kingdom. They produced three special maps detailing transport information on getting to the venues and also provided information on events related to the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. In addition, A–Z provided special sections relating to the Games in their 2012 editions of their main UK-wide and local maps.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2730731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2730731", "title": "Grand Palais", "text": "Grand Palais\n\nThe Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées, commonly known as the Grand Palais (English: Great Palace), is a large historic site, exhibition hall and museum complex located at the Champs-Élysées in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France. Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 following the demolition of the Palais de l'Industrie (Palace of Industry) as part of the preparation works for the Universal Exposition of 1900, which also included the creation of the adjacent Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III. It has been listed since 2000 as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe structure was built in the style of Beaux-Arts architecture as taught by the École des Beaux-Arts of Paris. The building reflects the movement's taste for ornate decoration through its stone facades, the formality of its floor planning and the use of techniques that were innovative at the time, such as its glass vault, its structure made of iron and light steel framing, and its use of reinforced concrete.\n\nOne of its pediments calls it a \"monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art\", reflecting its original purpose, that of housing the great artistic events of the city of Paris. The competition to choose the architect was fierce and controversial, and ultimately resulted in the contract being awarded to a group of four architects, Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, Albert Thomas and Charles Girault, each with a separate area of responsibility.\n\nThe main space, almost 240 metres long, was constructed with an iron, steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof, making it the last of the large transparent structures inspired by London’s Crystal Palace that were necessary for large gatherings of people before the age of electricity. The main space was originally connected to the other parts of the palace along an east-west axis by a grand staircase in a style combining Classical and Art Nouveau, but the interior layout has since been somewhat modified.\n\nThe exterior of this massive palace combines an imposing Classical stone façade with a riot of Art Nouveau ironwork, and a number of allegorical statue groups including work by sculptors Paul Gasq, Camille Lefèvre, Alfred Boucher, Alphonse-Amédée Cordonnier and Raoul Verlet. A monumental bronze quadriga by Georges Récipon tops each wing of the main façade. The one on the Champs-Élysées side depicts Immortality prevailing over Time, the one on the Seine side Harmony triumphing over Discord.\n\nThe grand inauguration took place 1 May 1900, and from the very beginning the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947. The first major Henri Matisse retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais.\nThe structure had problems that started even before it was completed, mainly as a result of subsidence caused by a drop in the water table. The builders attempted to compensate for this subsidence, and for a tendency of the ground to shift, by sinking supporting posts down to firmer soil, since construction could not be delayed. These measures were only partially successful. Further damage occurred once the building was in use. Excessive force applied to structural members during the installation of certain exhibitions such as the Exposition Internationale de la Locomotion Aérienne caused damage, as did acid runoff from the horse shows.\nAdditional problems due to the construction of the building itself revealed themselves over the course of time. Differential rates of expansion and contraction between cast iron and steel members, for example, allowed for water to enter, leading to corrosion and further weakening. When finally one of the glass ceiling panels fell in 1993, the main space had to be closed for restoration work, and was not fully reopened to the public until 2007.\n\nThe Palais served as a military hospital during World War I, employing local artists who had not been deployed to the front to decorate hospital rooms or to make moulds for prosthetic limbs.\n\nThe Nazis put the Palais to use during the Occupation of France in World War II. First used as a truck depot, the Palais then housed two Nazi propaganda exhibitions.\n\nThe Parisian resistance used the Grand Palais as a headquarters during the Liberation of Paris. On 23 August 1944 an advancing German column was fired upon from a window on the Avenue de Sèlves, and the Germans responded with a tank attack upon the Palais. The attack ignited hay that was set up for a circus show, and over the next 48 hours, thick black smoke from the fire caused serious damage to the building. By 26 August, American jeeps were parked in the nave, followed by tanks from the French 2nd Armored Division, completing the liberation of the building.\n\nThe Grand Palais has a major police station in the basement whose officers help protect the exhibits on show in the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, particularly the picture exhibition \"salons\": the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux Arts, Salon d'Automne, and Salon Comparaisons. The building's west wing also contains a science museum, the Palais de la Découverte.\n\nIt was the host venue of the 2010 World Fencing Championships.\n\nFor the 2011 Monumenta exhibition (11 May to 23 June), sculptor Anish Kapoor was commissioned to create the temporary indoor site-specific installation, \"Leviathan\", an enormous (ca. 775,000 square feet) structure that filled half of the main exhibition hall of the Grand Palais.\n\nIt was used during the final stage of the Tour de France in 2017, as part of the promotion for Paris' 2024 Summer Olympics bid. The riders rode through the Palais en route to the Champs Élysées. With Paris having been unanimously awarded the 2024 Games, the Palais will be used for the fencing and taekwondo events.\n\n\nThis article contains material abridged and translated from the French and Spanish \"Wikipedia\".\n\n"}

In 2006 it merged with Newcastle University's Hatton Gallery to form the Great North Museum. The museum reopened as the Great North Museum: Hancock in May 2009 following a major extension and refurbishment of the original Victorian building.\nThe museum and most of its collections are owned by the Natural History Society of Northumbria, and it is managed by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums on behalf of Newcastle University.\n\nThe museum is located on the campus of Newcastle University, next to the Great North Road, and close to Barras Bridge. The nearest Tyne & Wear Metro station is Haymarket, and there is also a bus station at Haymarket.\n\nOne of the Second World War air raid shelter openings into the Victoria Tunnel is beneath the grounds of the museum.\n\nThe collection of the Hancock Museum can be traced to about 1780 when Marmaduke Tunstall started accumulating ethnographic and natural history material from around the world. He then brought his collection from London to North Yorkshire. In 1790 Tunstall died, and George Allan of Darlington purchased Tunstall's collection; and later in 1823 it was acquired by the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1829 the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne (now the Natural History Society of Northumbria) was formed as a scientific offshoot of the Literary and Philosophical Society. Amongst the founding and early members of the Natural History Society were Joshua Alder, Albany Hancock, John Hancock, Prideaux John Selby and William Chapman Hewitson.\n\nThe museum opened on its current site in 1884 after the collection of the Natural History Society outgrew its small museum, located on Westgate Road, which opened in 1834. A major benefactor to the museum was William Armstrong who gave the then large sum of £11,500. Armstrong had also founded the College of Physical Science which later became part of Newcastle University. The museum was renamed in the 1890s, after the local Victorian naturalists, Albany and John Hancock. In 1959 the Natural History Society agreed with the University of Newcastle for the University to care for the building and collections, and since 1992 the University has contracted with Tyne & Wear Museums to manage the Museum under a Service Level Agreement.\n\nThe Hancock Museum was closed on 23 April 2006 for refurbishment and did not reopen until 23 May 2009. It was completely refurbished and extended as part of the Great North Museum Project, at a cost of £26 million. The new museum includes new displays on natural history and geology, Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece, Romans and Hadrian's Wall, World Cultures and Pre-history. It also includes an interactive study zone, an under 5's space, and a digital Planetarium, as well as new learning facilities, a new temporary exhibition space, and a study garden. The new museum houses not only the Hancock Museum collections, but also those of the University's Museum of Antiquities and Shefton Museum. The building that formerly housed the Museum of Antiquities was later demolished. The Hatton Gallery is also a part of the Great North Museum Project, but is not relocating to the Hancock, and is remaining in Newcastle University's Fine Art Building.\n\nIn September 2008, the Great North Museum searched for a lookalike of the Emperor Hadrian, for a photo shoot, whose likeness would feature in a permanent display at the Hancock Museum. On 21 November 2008 the 'Be Part of It' campaign was launched, and it was announced that the Great North Museum: Hancock would be opening in May 2009. Athlete Jonathan Edwards is the patron of the 'Be Part of It' campaign. Other celebrity supporters of the museum include Sir Thomas Allen and Adam Hart-Davis. Donors to the campaign have the opportunity to have their name (or the name of a loved one) permanently included on a donor wall in the museum.\n\nThe Great North Museum formally re-opened on 23 May 2009. In August the museum announced that they had surpassed their expected annual target of 300,000 visitors. By August over 400,000 people had visited the reopened museum. On 6 November 2009 HM The Queen officially opened the Great North Museum.\n\nBy August 2010, the reopened Great North Museum had welcomed its one millionth visitor.\n\nAmong the Museum's permanent residents are a life-size cast of an African elephant; the Egyptian mummy \"Bakt-hor-Nekht\"; a full size replica of a T-Rex skeleton; and Sparkie, Newcastle’s famous talking budgie, who was stuffed after his death in 1962 and is now the subject of a new opera by Michael Nyman.\nThe full size cast of an African Elephant was built in the Living Planet gallery. The model was crafted by Zephyr Wildlife, who took a cast from an actual stuffed elephant at a museum in Bonn in Germany. To get the elephant into the museum a crane, from Bel Lift Trucks, had to be used. The full size model of a T-Rex dinosaur has been shipped from Canada, where it was built by a company called Research Casting International. It forms part of the display known as the Fossil Stories gallery. The T-Rex model was one of the first items to be placed in the new museum, due to its size.\n\nOther exhibitions include 'Hadrian's Wall' looking at Roman life in the north of England, 'Natural Northumbria' focusing on the wildlife found in the northeast, 'Ancient Egypt' looking at the Ancient Egyptians and featuring the museum's two mummies, 'Ice Age to Iron Age' detailing the history of the British Isles over the past 12,000 years, 'World Cultures' featuring artifacts and displays from cultures across the globe, 'The Shefton Collection' with one of the most detailed collections of Greek artifacts in the UK and 'Explore' which is a more hands-on area of the museum and features regular interactive sessions.\n\nThere were live animals on display but these have now been withdrawn, as well as a conference area for corporate events and a fully provisioned learning suite for school visits.\n\nThe museum was entered into the 'long list' for the 2010 Art Fund Prize for museums and galleries.\n\nThe Great North Museum Library is open to the public and is located on the second floor of the Hancock. It houses three collections - the Library and Archives of the Natural History Society of Northumbria, the Library of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle University’s Cowen Library.\n\n\n\n"}

It is possible in some guestbooks for visitors to express their thoughts about the website or its subject. Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain feedback from them. This allows the webmaster to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a script, which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as Perl, PHP, Python or ASP.

{"id": "3919149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3919149", "title": "Ladder tournament", "text": "Ladder tournament\n\nA ladder tournament (also known as a ladder competition or pyramid tournament) is a form of tournament for games and sports. Unlike many tournaments, which usually have an element of elimination, ladder competitions can go on indefinitely. In a ladder competition, players are listed as if on the rungs of a ladder. The objective for a player is to reach the highest rung of the ladder.\n\nThe competition proceeds via a system of challenges. Any player can challenge a player above them on the ladder. These challenges generally should not or can not be declined. If the lower-placed player wins the match, then the two players swap places on the ladder. If the lower-placed player loses, then they may not challenge the same person again without challenging someone else first. There is a limit as to how many rungs above themselves players may challenge. When first setting up a ladder tournament, the usual practice is to place the more skilled players at the bottom of the ladder, so that they have to play to work their way up.\n\nLadder competitions suffer from two problems, both resulting from the challenge system. The first is that the ranking at the end of the tournament (or after a sufficiently long time) may not necessarily reflect the actual rank of the players, since it is not guaranteed that enough challenges, or the appropriate challenges, have been made to correctly \"sort\" the ladder. However, if the balance between number of participants and duration of the competition is defined properly, this usually results in a representative ranking. The second is that some players may make challenges more frequently than others, or are challenged more frequently than others, meaning that not all players may be challenged, and that not all players may play the same number of matches.\n\nAn example of a ladder competition is shown below. Note that the 3 images below show the exact same competition. Each level has its own colour. \n\nPlayer Rafael is allowed to challenge anyone who is ranked higher than him on his own level, and anyone who is ranked one level higher than he. Thus, Rafael is allowed to challenge the following players : Roger, Isabelle, Estelle and Sofie.\n\nLadders are typically used in sports such as squash, badminton & Korea Baseball Organization.\n\nOther systems calculate a numeric rank for each player. This removes the limitation on which matches are allowed. The most widely known system of ranking players is the Elo rating system, which is used for Chess and Go. Every player in the Elo rating system receives a rating based on his or her win/loss record, which establishes his or her position (or level) on the \"game ladder.\" Numerous efforts have been made to design better game ladders by analyzing the statistical correlation between relative ladder levels and a player's expected performance.\n\nA game ladder may be used as the ranking system itself, in lieu of a ranking system like Elo. In this case, players are moved up and down the ladder according to competitive results, dictated by previously determined rules.\n\nA unique game ladder system is the Masterpoints rating system used for contract bridge by the American Contract Bridge League. The Masterpoints system, unlike the Elo rating system, emphasizes participation (i.e., experience in terms of number of games played) over demonstration of skill.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship considers its official rankings (decided by a media pool, based on match results) when matchmaking, though not strictly. Due to the high incidence of training injuries, unranked or low-ranked replacement fighters often compete higher up the ladder than they otherwise would. This is also (more rarely, usually on pay-per-view) done for promotional reasons, when a big name or rivalry makes a low-ranked fighter the more marketable option. Sometimes no similarly-ranked opponents are available, and a fighter may risk losing their spot to a low-ranked one just to stay busy. Winners are interviewed after fights, and all fighters are required to use Twitter. Challenges through these avenues (and others) are encouraged. Though not binding, a publicly agreed fight usually occurs as soon as practical. Rematches are generally disallowed, excepting some championship bouts and others ending in controversial decisions.\n\nThe Korea Baseball Organization has the fourth-seeded team play host to the fifth seed, with the winner playing the third seed. The second-seeded team plays the winner of that game, and whoever wins advances to play the top-seeded team in the Korean Series.\n\n"}

Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, or \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens, that are commonly cited as \"best-selling books\" yet have no reliable sales figures. Similarly, many notable book series that sold very widely are poorly documented (Land of Oz) or consist of multiple sub-series (Tom Swift).\n\nAccording to \"Guinness World Records\" as of 1995, the Bible is the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5billion copies sold and distributed. The Qur'an is also widely reported to be one of the most printed and distributed books worldwide. The \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\", also known as the \"Little Red Book\", has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures — with some sources claiming over 6.5 billion printed volumes, others claiming the distribution ran into the \"billions,\" some citing \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations.\" Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have been excluded from this list of best-selling books for these reasons.\n\nHaving sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, \"Harry Potter\" by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 80 languages, placing Harry Potter among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, where the final installment, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release. With twelve million books printed in the first U.S. run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.\n\nThe \"Perry Rhodan\" series has sold more than 1 billion copies, but is not listed because that figure includes magazine sales, not novels alone. Similarly, the \"Jerry Cotton\" series has sold over 300 million copies, but most of these were in magazine format.\n\nThe figures given for some books are for the number printed instead of confirmed sales.\n\n\n Footnotes \n\n"}

As of March 16, 2017, Lurkmore contains 7598 articles. It is one of the most popular humor—as well as internet-meme-related—websites of the Russian Internet.\n\nLurkmore was started as a knowledge base of Internet memes centered on 2ch.ru, the first popular Russian-language imageboard. With time, the project evolved to encompass the broader Runet subculture. It has been called an \"informal encyclopedia\" about everything. Currently, Lurkmore comprises a wide range of articles, but a very considerable share of them is still about the Internet culture.\n\nLurkmore articles use a distinctive style, distinguishing themselves with a general informality, semiseriousness, sarcasm, the free use of foul language, and impudence, as well as by sharp criticism of the shortcomings of the considered phenomena. The articles are also characterized by a specific slang—\"lurkoyaz\" (луркояз)—consisting of Internet slang, assorted words used by padonki and Kashchenists, and Lurkmore's own neologisms.\n\nA remarkable feature of the project is the concealment of IP addresses of anonymous participants in the editing history of articles for all users except administrators. The inscription of \"Anonimus\" is displayed instead of an IP address. The registered participants having a flag of the autoconfirmed participant also have an opportunity to leave any editing not under the name, and anonymously.\n\nOn 11 November 2012, the IP address of Lurkmore.to was added to the Russian Internet blacklist by decision of the Russian Federal Surveillance Service for Mass Media and Communications, making it inaccessible from most Russian ISPs.

Lurkmore.to was removed from the blacklist on 13 November 2012 after the website administrators deleted two marijuana-related articles. In 2015 Homak declared on his Facebook profile that the project will be frozen and become a \"culture memorial\" due to increasing pressure from Roskomnadzor and other law enforcement agencies, and he left Russia due to general development of situation in Russia.\n\n\n"}

The Met Breuer opened in March 2016 in the building formerly occupied by the Whitney Museum of American Art, designed by Marcel Breuer and completed in 1966. Its works come from the Met's collection and are both monographic and thematic exhibitions.\n\nIn 2008, the idea behind the Met Breuer project was initiated by philanthropist Leonard Lauder. An agreement between the Met and the Whitney was signed, after three years of negotiation, in 2011.\n\nThe location opened in March 2016 following a year and a half of preparations as part of a $600 million Metropolitan Museum of Art renovation plan. Architects Beyer Blinder Belle updated the Met Breuer building, which had been designed by Marcel Breuer. The Met will allocate an annual operating budget of $17 million to run the museum as part of an integrated expansion of the main museum's outreach, with a focus on modern art. The Met has an eight-year lease on the building from the Whitney Museum, with the option to renew another five and a half years, until approximately 2029.\n\nThe Met Breuer will be overseen by Sheena Wagstaff, previously at the Tate Modern, who has been the head of the Modern and Contemporary Art Department of the Met since 2012. Director and CEO of the Met, Thomas P. Campbell, has spearheaded the effort with a stated focus on the digital (moving from analog to digital) and focusing on accessibility and outreach. He considers the Met to be the largest encyclopedic museum in the world, with the Met Breuer an important part of that, especially as it works towards meaningfully engaging with a global audience, as well as the visitors who come to the museum in person. Both Campbell and Wagstaff see the Met Breuer as a sculptural creation and artwork in its own right.\n\nThe opening featured a survey of Nasreen Mohamedi and \"Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible\", an exhibit of incomplete works that ranged over 500 years, from Italian Renaissance to contemporary paintings. The exhibit notably featured Pablo Picasso's never-before-exhibited 1931 painting \"Woman in a Red Armchair\" as well as work by Kerry James Marshall, who will have an upcoming exhibition at the Met Breuer.\n\nIn advance of the Met Breuer's opening, art critic at \"The New York Times\" Roberta Smith wrote that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other major art institutions feared to miss out as the rest of the art world displayed more contemporary art exhibitions. Smith said that the Met excelled at \"bringing older art to life\" and that the Met Breuer's cautious opening exhibit showed unclear goals for the new building. \"Wallpaper\" cited the renovations involved in the opening as being more representative of Breuer's design for the building, with a lower level sunken garden and a more welcoming emphasis on the sculptural design. \"The Architect's Newspaper\" sees the Met's approach as one that treats the building itself as an artwork versus a building, with a focus on the patina of the materials as part of a holistic entity.\n\nCritics of the new endeavor challenge its mission to be less safe and salubratory, with a focus on engagement and innovation. The Met Breuer will address the lack of collection activity of modern and contemporary art in the early to mid-1900s.\n\n\n\n"}

The court \"a quo\" dismissed this argument, finding that the community would consider otherwise.

{"id": "17795084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17795084", "title": "Minuscule 2427", "text": "Minuscule 2427\n\nCodex 2427 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), formerly known as Archaic Mark, is a miniature manuscript of the Gospel of Mark written in minuscule Greek. The manuscript had been very difficult to date paleographically and had been assigned to the 13th-18th century, until 2006 when it was proved a forgery following the publication of digital images of the codex, which had been made available online to renew interest in the manuscript.\n\nThe codex is written in a tiny minuscule hand on parchment leaves, containing 44 leaves (11.5 cm by 8.5 cm), written in one column per page, 21-25 lines per page. The codex has no sections, canons or headings, but it contains 16 colour illuminations. There are no indications on the codex that it was originally part of a tetraevangelium. The codex includes text of Mark 16:9-20.\n\nThe codex 2427 was found among the possessions of John Askitopoulos, an Athenian collector and dealer of antiquities, after his death in 1917. In 1937 the manuscript was sent to the University of Chicago Library, where it still resides (Ms. 972).\n\nIllustrations are very similar to those from minuscule 777. Robert S. Nelson suggested that they were copied from 777.\n\nThe text has some omissions (Mark 7:2-5, 8:11b, 13:28b-29, 10:29 is shorter). All these omissions have parallels in other Gospels, and for some scholars they look like non-interpolations, although they are not supported by any other manuscript.\n\nThe Greek text of the codex was a leading representative of the Alexandrian text-type. It was recognized by Ernest Cadman Colwell (1901-1974) as having an extraordinary degree of correspondence with the Codex Vaticanus. According to Colwell the codex preserved a \"primitive text\" of the Gospel of Mark. Text of the codex was highly esteemed by T. C. Skeat. Kurt Aland placed it in Category I. It was collated by M. M. Mitchell and P. A. Duncan in 2006.\n\nThe manuscript found some early critics upon arriving in Chicago. Robert P. Casey \"voiced his suspicion in 1947\". In 1988 Mary V. Orna found that one of the illustrations contained Prussian blue (KFe[Fe(CN)]), produced since 1704 only. This did not resolve the question of authenticity, however, as it was \"conceivable that the illuminations could have been retouched in a naïve attempt at restoration.\"\n\nIn early 2006 the University of Chicago announced that digital images of the manuscript had appeared online in an effort to \"foster further research.\" By February Stephen Carlson had announced his findings that the codex was a forgery, and proved his case beyond a doubt at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. Its text has been copied from Philipp Buttmann's 1860 Greek New Testament edition (based on Cardinal Mai's edition of Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209). This is especially obvious since the forger also followed Buttmann in 81 out of 85 places where his edition departed from the Codex Vaticanus text. Furthermore, in three places the copyist of 2427 had accidentally omitted a line (6:2, 8:12, 14:14), and it transpired that in each verse the omitted text corresponds exactly to the lineation of Buttmann's edition.\n\nFurthermore, microscopic, chemical and codicological testing eventually proved in 2009 that the manuscript had been made in 1874 at the earliest.\n\nWhat made the text a forgery was that it was carefully manufactured in the style of a medieval codex, when it was in fact a very recent creation, no older than the late 19th century. What originally made scholars so suspicious was that it was textually the closest known manuscript – in fact, virtually identical – to Codex Vaticanus, but of a much later date. Furthermore, Greek codices of a single gospel are extremely unusual, further contributing to the suspicion that it was made as a souvenir.\n\n\n\n"}

Par.) is a Greek chronology, covering the years from 1582 BC to 299 BC, inscribed on a stele. Found on the island of Paros in two sections, and sold in Smyrna in the early 17th century to an agent for Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, this inscription was deciphered by John Selden and published among the Arundel Marbles, \"Marmora Arundelliana\" (London 1628-9) nos. 1–14, 59–119. The first of the sections published by Selden has subsequently disappeared. A further third fragment of this inscription, comprising the base of the stele and containing the end of the text, was found on Paros in 1897. It has entries from 336/35 to 299/98 BC.\n\nThe two known upper fragments, brought to London in 1627 and presented to Oxford University in 1667, include entries for the years 1582/81–355/54 BC. The surviving upper chronicle fragment currently resides in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. It combines dates for events which modern readers would consider mythic, such as the Flood of Deucalion (equivalent to 1529/28 BC) with dates we would categorize as historic. For the Greeks, the events of their distant past, such as the Trojan War (dated from 1217 to 1208 BC in the Parian inscription) and the Voyage of the Argonauts were \"historic\": their myths were understood as legends to the Greeks. In fact the Parian inscriptions spend more detail on the Heroic Age than on certifiably historic events closer to the date the stele was inscribed and erected, apparently during 264/263 BC. \"The Parian Marble uses chronological specificity as a guarantee of truth,\" Peter Green observed in the introduction to his annotated translation of the \"Argonautica\" of Apollonios Rhodios: \"the mythic past was rooted in historical time, its legends treated as fact, its heroic protagonists seen as links between the 'age of origins' and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it.\"\n\nThe shorter fragment base of the stele, found in 1897, is in the Archaeological museum of Paros. It contains chronicle entries for the years 336/35–299/98 BC.\n\nThe major analysis of the \"Parian Chronicle\" is that of Felix Jacoby, written in the early 20th century. This appeared in two works: his book \"Das Marmor Parium\" published in 1904, and as a part of the \"Fragmente der griechischen Historiker\", first published in 1929. There has been no major study devoted to the entire stele since that time, although a few authors have dealt with specific time periods covered in the tablet. Furthermore, there apparently have been no critical studies of the original text on the stele itself since the work of Jacoby, as evidenced by the fact that the display of the Greek text on the Ashmolean Web site is a photocopy of the text that Jacoby published in his \"Fragmente\".\n\nIn attempting to discern the source or sources of the \"Chronicle\", Jacoby followed the rather subjective method that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, whereby a change in the subject matter or style of writing was taken to imply a different source. The style of the \"Chronicle\", however, is quite uniform. Events are listed with little embellishment, and the primary purpose seems to be to give for each event the name of the king or archon ruling in Athens at the time, along with the number of years prior to the base date of the tablet (264/63 BC). The only exceptions are that in nine out of the 107 extant entries, the name of the archon or king is no longer readable, and in 14 entries the number of elapsed years is similarly effaced. The lack of embellishment is shown, for example, in the entry for Cecrops, which attributes nothing remarkable to him or to his reign, even though in later Greek mythology he was a semi-human creature. The \"Chronicle’s\" entries for Deucalion, who became the center of many flood-myths, are more consistent with the earliest Greek legends that merely state that he fled from a flooding river in his native Lycoreia near the Gulf of Corinth, arriving at Athens where his son later became king.\n\nIn contrast to Jacoby’s ideas, a 2012 study maintains that the style of the \"Chronicle’s\" entries suggests that the ultimate source of the information in the \"Parian Chronicle\" was the archives of the city of Athens. Authors Rodger Young and Andrew Steinmann base their views on three key inferences from the available evidence. 1) The naming of the reigning king or archon in Athens for each entry is consistent with an Athenian provenance of the material. 2) The source behind each entry must have provided a year-number from which the author of the \"Parian Chronicle\" was able to calculate the years to his own time, thus suggesting that the archives from which the information was taken were keeping track of the years since the founding of the kingship in Athens under Cecrops. Such framing chronicles are known to have been kept in Rome: the \"Anno Urbis Conditae,\" from which events were reckoned. 3) The annalistic style of the \"Chronicle\" is in keeping with the genre of annalistic records such as the Assyrian Eponym Canon, in which the purpose was not so much to describe events as to give an accurate record of when the events occurred, as related to the years since the founding of the kingship and also tying the event to the king or archon who was currently reigning.\n\nYoung and Steinmann acknowledge several factors that make it less plausible the source behind the \"Parian Chronicle\" was the state archives of Athens. The first is that there are no known examples of writing from Athens that date as early as 1582/81 BC, the date of the \"Chronicle’s\" first entry. The earliest extant writing in Greek from any area is found in the syllabic Linear B script, for which the earliest instances date to about a century and a half after the reputed beginning of the kingship under Cecrops. Another argument against the Athenian provenance of the information in the \"Parian Chronicle\" is the reconstruction given by Jacoby of the first two lines of the tablet, which were largely effaced when Selden made his copy (this top part has since been lost), but of which enough remained that Selden could determine that it was intended as a statement of the source of the tablet’s histories. Jacoby’s restoration of Selden’s Greek text is followed on the Ashmolean Web site, which translates it into English as follows, with square brackets and italics indicating the portion of the text that is conjectural:\n[\"From\"] al[\"l the records and general accounts\"] I have recorded [\"the previous times\"], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.\nThe critical word here is “general,” which represents a Greek original for which Selden could read only the last three letters, νῶν; these are the ending of the genitive plural. Jacoby hypothesized the word was an adjective and restored it to κοινῶν, meaning “common, general, ordinary”. This is consistent with Jacoby’s theory for the source of the \"Chronicle’s\" documents, namely that the author used a variety of selections from diverse materials available in the third century BC. The Ashmolean Web site then translated this into English as shown above. Young and Steinmann, however, maintain that “The writer of an annalistic history that professes to give exact dates for events would not assure readers of his credibility by saying that his information was derived from the “common” folklore ... For the Parian Marble, such reassurance would be given if the original word, for which the genitive plural ending - νῶν has survived, was not κοινῶν, but Ἀθηνῶν,” i.e. “of Athens,” taking the word as a noun (Athens was a plural noun in classical Greek). This restoration would give the reader the assurance that the writer of the tablet had an authoritative source for his information, as follows:\n[\"From\"] al[\"l the public records and histories of Ath\"]ens I have recorded [\"the previous times\"], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.\nOne other conjecture for the source of the \"Parian Chronicle’s\" information is of historical interest. In 1788, Joseph Robertson went to considerable length in arguing that the tablets were of relatively recent date and entirely fraudulent. His book is accessible under the External links below. The finding of the bottom portion of the tablet on Páros in 1897 has made Robertson’s theory untenable.\n\nIn 2013, Ben Altshuler of the Institute for Digital Archaeology oversaw reflectance transformation imaging (RTI) of the Parian Marble, revealing significant, previously illegible text.\n\n\n"}

He believed that previous Chinese dictionaries of multiple-character phrases, including the Yuan Dynasty \"Yunfu qunyu\" 韻府群玉 and the Ming Dynasty \"Wuche yunrui\" 五車韻瑞, were incomplete and sometimes erroneous.

The group, which included historians, writers, rabbis and social workers, was dedicated to chronicling life in the Ghetto during the German occupation. They worked as a team, collecting documents and soliciting testimonies and reports from dozens of volunteers of all ages. The materials submitted included essays, diaries, drawings, wall posters and other materials describing life in the Ghetto. The collection work started in September 1939 and ended in January 1943.\n\nToday the discovered part of the collection, which contains about 6,000 documents (about 35,000 pages), is housed at the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw.\n\nThe name \"Oneg Shabbat\" means \"joy of the Sabbath\" in Hebrew and usually refers to a celebratory gathering held after Sabbath services, often with food, singing, study, discussion, and socializing. This name was selected because the group tended to meet on Shabbat to discuss the progress of their collection and documentation efforts. The form \"Oyneg Shabbos\" is Ashkenazic pronunciation.\n\nThe members of Oyneg Shabbos initially collected the material with the intention that they would write a book after the war about the horrors they had witnessed. As the pace of deportations increased, and it became clear that the destination was the Treblinka death camp and few Jewish Varsovians were likely to survive, Ringelblum had the archives stored in three milk cans and ten metal boxes, which were then buried in three places in the Ghetto. Two of the canisters, containing thousands of documents, were unearthed on 18 September 1946 and a further ten boxes on 1 December 1950. The third cache is rumored to be buried beneath what is now the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw but a search in 2005 failed to locate the missing archival material.\n\nOn January 19, 1942, an escaped inmate from the Chelmno extermination camp, Jacob Grojanowski, reached the Warsaw Ghetto, where he gave detailed information about the camp to the Oneg Shabbat group. His report, which became known as the \"Grojanowski Report\", was smuggled out of the ghetto through the channels of the Polish underground, reached London and was published by June.\n\nAll but three members of the Oyneg Shabbos were murdered in the genocides. Emanuel Ringelblum escaped the ghetto, but continued to return to work on the archives. In 1944 Ringelblum and his family were discovered and were executed along with those who hid them. After the war, Rokhl Auerbakh, one of the three surviving members of Oyneg Shabes, initiated the search for and excavation of the buried chronicles.\n\nIn 1999, the Emanuel Ringelblum Archives were listed on the Memory of the World Register by UNESCO.\n\nA catalog of the Ringelblum Archive was published in book form in 2009 by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw; and the entire archive is also available to researchers in digital format at both institutions. The Jewish Historical Institute has published a book series of 10 volumes summarizing parts of the archive as follows: (1) Letters concerning the Holocaust (2) Children — covert teaching in the Warsaw Ghetto (3) Accounts from Kresy (4) Life and work of Gela Seksztajn (5) The Warsaw Ghetto (6) The General Governatore (7) Legacies (8) Territories annexed to the Reich (9) Territories annexed to the Reich (10) Fate of Jews from Łódź (1939–1942).\n\nIn 2007, historian Samuel Kassow published \"Who Will Write Our History?

It was distributed by King Features Syndicate from October 1961 to June 1963. The series depended heavily on metahumor, and appearances by famous comic-strip characters.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, Mort Walker and Jerry Dumas would meet on Monday mornings to go over the gag ideas they had worked up for future installments of Walker's strips \"Beetle Bailey\" and \"Hi and Lois\". Just for fun, they started putting their considerable knowledge of comic-strip history to use in creating gags about characters from different strips and time periods meeting and interacting. An idea eventually came out of these exercises: What about a feature starring a guy who runs his own comic strip as a business? Walker, a fan of alliteration, came up with the title \"Sam's Strip\". They split the gag writing, Dumas did the drawing, and Walker the lettering. When the pair took samples to Walker's regular distributor, King Features Syndicate, four executives barraged them with questions ahout the contents, but there was enough laughter that the editor finally gave the go-ahead. \"Sam's Strip\" debuted as a daily only on October 16, 1961.\n\nBulb-nosed, seemingly neckless Sam owned and operated the comic strip he inhabited, and both he and his bespectacled, unnamed assistant were aware of their fictional, artistic status. They commented on the elements of cartooning, talked to the readers, abused their artist (a fictionalized Dumas), and played with the stock in their Cartoon Prop Closet (which contained everything from idea bulbs and flying money to pain stars and angry thought bubbles), all the while trying any scheme to make their business a success. Along the way, they encountered strip stars such as Blondie and Charlie Brown, cult favorites like Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse, and old-timers such as Happy Hooligan and Tillie the Toiler. Dumas took pride in drawing each character's style exactly (there were no good copy machines at the time), but the job was intensely time-consuming. It took him three weeks to create a week's continuity about a comic characters convention that featured dozens of \"guest stars.\"\n\nThis metahumor made fans of cartoonists and informed comics aficionados (and some editors), but the reading public was left scratching its collective head. As Walker admitted later, \"the readers had to be familiar with the various characters we were satirizing before they could get the gag. It's a tough sell.\" Just as Sam struggled to make his strip a hit, his creators did the same, and \"Sam's Strip\" never gained more than sixty newspapers before being cancelled on June 1, 1963.\n\nIn 1977, Walker and Dumas reemployed Sam and his sidekick for a new strip with a \"new\" concept called \"Sam and Silo\", about a pair of bumbling cops in a quiet little town. While not as imaginative or innovative (Don Markstein's Toonopedia calls it \"just a typical comic strip\"), it was far more popular. As of 2016, \"Sam and Silo\" is still being produced, now solely by Dumas.\n\n“Walker and Dumas clearly take pleasure in working in callbacks to classic comic strips [and] many of the metatextual gags are funny and fun,\" wrote \"The Comics Journal\"'s Shaenon Garrity, adding that \"Dumas’s drawings of classic comic-strip characters are excellent.” Andrew Williams of \"Den of Geek\" agreed that \"the strips that chip away at the fourth wall in particular frequently raise a smile, and occasionally even a laugh.\" \"Comic Book Resources\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Chad Nevett elaborated that \"Walker and Dumas are very adept at making most of those jokes [featuring run-ins with other strip characters] work on two levels, where the character’s role is obvious to those unaware of its pre-existence, while those in the know will get an extra kick out of it.\" But Christopher Barat felt \"that the creators didn't use [the] inter-strip get-togethers nearly as much as they should have. Instead, they whiled away a lot of their time with politically themed, time-dependent gags trading on the 'New Frontier' administration of John Kennedy and the contemporary Cold War atmosphere.\"\n\nOne paperback collection, \"Sam's Strip Lives!\", was published in small quantities under the aegis of the Museum of Cartoon Art. In December 2008, Fantagraphics Books released a 208-page paperback book containing the entire run of \"Sam's Strip\". It includes brief introductions by Dumas and Walker, unpublished sketches, original artwork, photographs, and sales brochures. Plus there are select annotations by Dumas and comics historian Brian Walker. \"These strips aren't perfect and some gags are repeated far too many times,\" wrote Chad Nevett, \"but this collection made me laugh at least once on nearly every page. ... Once again, Fantagraphics delivers a stellar package.\" Andrew Williams' review agreed with that last statement: \"[T]he near-flawless execution of the book helps to make it feel like more of a prestige package, a celebration of the series rather than just a cheap cash-in. ... Although the book will largely be bought by fans of the series, it's still accessible for absolute newcomers.\" And KC Carlson of Comics Worth Reading stated, \"If you ever had more than a passing interest in newspaper strips, you owe it to yourself to check out this collection.\"\n"}

It is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nFiles from Wikimedia Commons can be used across all Wikimedia projects in all languages, including Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikivoyage, Wikispecies, Wikisource, and Wikinews, or downloaded for offsite use. As of 2018, the repository contains over 50 million free media files, managed and editable by registered volunteers. In July 2013, the number of edits on Commons reached 100,000,000.\n\nThe project was proposed by Erik Möller in March 2004 and launched on September 7, 2004. A key motivation behind the setup of a central repository was the desire to reduce duplication of effort across the Wikimedia projects and languages, as the same file had to be uploaded to many different wikis separately before Commons was created.\n\nThe aim of Wikimedia Commons is to provide a media file repository \"that makes available public domain and freely-licensed educational media content to all, and that acts as a common repository for the various projects of the Wikimedia Foundation.\" The expression \"educational\" is to be understood according to its broad meaning of \"providing knowledge; instructional or informative\".\n\nMost Wikimedia projects still allow local uploads which are not visible to other projects or languages, but this option is meant to be used primarily for material (such as fair use content) which local project policies allow, but which would not be permitted according to the copyright policy of Commons. Wikimedia Commons itself does not allow fair use or uploads under non-free licenses, including licenses which restrict commercial use of materials or disallow derivative works. For this reason, Wikimedia Commons always hosts freely licensed media and deletes copyright violations. Licenses that are acceptable include the GNU Free Documentation License, Creative Commons Attribution and Attribution/ShareAlike licenses, other free content and free software licenses, and the public domain.\n\nThe default language for Commons is English, but registered users can customize their interface to use any other available user interface translations. Many content pages, in particular policy pages and portals, have also been translated into various languages. Files on Wikimedia Commons are categorized using MediaWiki's category system. In addition, they are often collected on individual topical gallery pages. While the project was originally proposed to also contain free text files, these continue to be hosted on a sister project, Wikisource.\n\nThe site has been criticized for hosting large amounts of amateur pornography, often uploaded by exhibitionists who exploit the site for personal gratification, and who are enabled by sympathetic administrators. In 2012, BuzzFeed described Wikimedia Commons as \"littered with dicks\".\n\nIn 2010, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI for hosting sexualized images of children known as \"lolicon\". After this was reported in the media, Jimmy Wales, founder of the Wikimedia Foundation which hosts Commons, used his administrator status to delete several images without discussion from the Commons community. Wales responded to the backlash from the Commons community by voluntarily relinquishing some site privileges, including the ability to delete files.\n\nOver time, additional functionality has been developed to interface Wikimedia Commons with the other Wikimedia projects. Daniel Kinzler wrote applications for finding appropriate categories for uploaded files (\"CommonSense\"), determining the usage of files across the Wikimedia projects (\"CheckUsage\"), locating images with missing copyright information (\"UntaggedImages\"), and relaying information about administrative actions such as deletions to the relevant wikis (\"\").\n\nSpecialized uploading tools and scripts such as \"\" have been created to simplify the process of uploading large numbers of files. In order to review free content photos uploaded to Flickr, users can participate in a defunct collaborative external review process (\"\"), which has resulted in more than 10,000 uploads to Commons.\nThe site has three mechanisms for recognizing quality works. One is known as \"\", where works are nominated and other community members vote to accept or reject the nomination. This process began in November 2004. Another process known as \"\" began in June 2006, and has a simpler nomination process comparable to \"Featured pictures\". \"Quality images\" only accepts works created by Wikimedia users, whereas \"Featured pictures\" additionally accepts nominations of works by third parties such as NASA. A third image assessment project, known as \"\", began on June 1, 2008 with the purpose of recognizing \"the most valued illustration of its kind\", in contrast to the other two processes which assess images mainly on technical quality.\n\nThe three mentioned processes select a slight part (less than 0.1%) from the total number of files. However, Commons collects files of all quality levels, from the most professional level across simple documental and amateur files up to files of very poor quality. Generally, Commons is not a competition but a collection; a quality of the description and organization of files and their descriptive and informational benefits are often more relevant than technical or artistic perfection of the files. Files with specific defects can be tagged for improvement and warning or even proposed for deletion but there exists no process of systematic rating of all files.\n\nThe site held its inaugural \"Picture of the Year\" competition, for 2006. All images that were made a Featured picture during 2006 were eligible, and voted on by eligible Wikimedia movement members during two rounds of voting. The winning picture was a picture of the Aurora Borealis over snowlands, taken by an airman from the U.S. Air Force. The competition has since become an annual event.\n\n\"Source: \"\n\n\n\n"}
