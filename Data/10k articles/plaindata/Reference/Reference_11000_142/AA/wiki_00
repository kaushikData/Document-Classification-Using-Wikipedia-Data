The manuscript contains one further medical text, called \"Leechbook III\", which is also included in this Wikipedia entry.\n\nBoth of the two books of \"Bald's Leechbook\" are organised in a head-to-foot order, but the first book deals with external maladies and the second with internal disorders. Cameron notes that \"this separation of external and internal diseases may be unique in medieval medical texts\".\n\nCameron notes that \"in Bald's \"Leechbook\" is the only plastic surgery mentioned in Anglo-Saxon records\". The recipe in question prescribes surgery for a Cleft lip and palate.\n\nCameron also notes that of the Old English Medical compilations \"\"Leechbook\" iii reflects most closely the medical practice of the Anglo-Saxons while they were still relatively free of Mediterranean influences,\" in contrast to Bald's \"Leechbook\" which \"shows a conscious effort to transfer to Anglo-Saxon practice what one physician considered most useful in native and Mediterranean medicine,\" and the \"Lacnunga\", which is \"a sort of common place book with no other apparent aim than to record whatever items of medical interest came to the scribe's attention\".\n\nRev. Oswald Cockayne, editor and translator of an 1865 edition of the \"Leechbook\", made note in his introduction of what he termed 'a Norse element' in the text, and gave, as example, words such as \"torbegate\", \"rudniolin\", \"ons worm\" and \"Fornets palm\".\n\nOne cure for headache was to bind a stalk of crosswort to the head with a red kerchief. Chilblains were treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root. Agrimony was cited as a cure for male impotence - when boiled in milk, it could excite a man who was \"insufficiently virile;\" when boiled in Welsh beer it would have the opposite effect. The remedy for shingles comprised a potion using the bark of 15 trees: aspen, apple, maple, elder, willow, sallow, myrtle, wych-elm, oak, blackthorn, birch, olive, dogwood, ash, and quickbeam.\n\nA remedy for aching feet called for leaves of Elder, Waybroad and Mugwort to be pounded together, applied to the feet, then the feet bound. In another, after offering a ritualistic cure for a horse in pain requiring the words \"Bless all the works of the lord of lords\" to be inscribed on the handle of a dagger, the author adds that the pain may have been caused by an elf.\n\nIn March 2015, the \"Leechbook\" made the news when one of its recipes – which included garlic and the bile from a cow's stomach – was tested in the United Kingdom as a potential agent for use against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n\n\nCockayne, T.

The Briefcase is designed for mobile PC users so that they may transfer it to a removable drive and have it synchronize with the computer to which the removable drive is attached. It follows the same metaphor as the \"file\" and \"file folder\" and then, while the file management tasks are performed by Windows Explorer, the briefcase behaves just like another folder, i.e. with support for copy-paste and drag-and-drop. It has additional functions and toolbar buttons for updating out-of-sync files. The Windows Briefcase was introduced in Windows 95 and was \n\n\nThe Windows Briefcase synchronizes files and folders within itself with those in any other folder, even on a removable writable media or the network. It is intended for users with portable media or multiple computers. To use the Briefcase, users only need to use Windows Explorer and then drag or copy their files into the Briefcase once. Any further changes to either the files on disk or those in the Briefcase are synchronized whenever the user right-clicks on the briefcase and selects \"Update All\".\n\nIf there are differences between the copies, the Briefcase shows a dialog box with an icon and a description indicating the action it will take when synchronizing; that is, whether it will replace the copy in the Briefcase with the external file or vice versa. The action the Briefcase will take is configurable by right clicking the icon. For example, users can skip synchronizing individual items by selecting the \"Skip\" action upon right clicking the icon. For items deleted in either the Briefcase or the main original folder, the Briefcase can create a copy of the missing item. Users can also sync individual items in the Briefcase by selecting the item first and then clicking the \"Update\" button instead of \"Update All\".\n\nThe update status of each item is stored in the Briefcase. If any item does not link to any original item outside the briefcase, (for example when the drive containing the briefcase is inserted in a secondary computer, or the original has been deleted in the main computer) it is called an \"orphan\".\n\nMost special folders in Windows (such as Briefcase folders) have a hidden file (with \"system\" attribute) called Desktop.ini. They may also have Windows Registry entries describing them. The Desktop.ini for a Briefcase contains the following lines:\n\nA second file called \"Briefcase Database\", bearing \"hidden\" and \"system\" attributes, and no filename extension, serves as the Briefcase index. Its fourCC is \"DDSH\".\n\nThe Briefcase folder itself must have \"read-only\" or \"system\" file attributes (default is read-only) in order to display as a Briefcase. The Desktop.ini and Briefcase Database files are not required to have the hidden or system attributes in order for the parent folder to display as a Briefcase.\n\nWhen a user wishes to sync a file with one in another folder, the filename must be exactly the same. If any item is renamed or moved, it splits from the original, is no longer synchronized and becomes an \"orphan\". If an item is deleted, the associated copy \"by default\" is deleted as well when using \"Update All\". If the briefcase medium becomes full during an Update, there will be no space for writing the updated briefcase database. This has the effect of making many of the folders and files orphans, with no easy way to restore their link with their counterparts on the source medium. Such limitations (and others) make briefcase files very brittle, easily corrupted. This limits robustness as a folder and file backup mechanism.\n\n"}

{"id": "2071077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071077", "title": "Christine (1983 film)", "text": "Christine (1983 film)\n\nChristine is a 1983 American psychological horror film directed by John Carpenter and starring Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. The film also features supporting performances from Roberts Blossom and Kelly Preston. \n\nWritten by Bill Phillips and based on Stephen King’s 1983 novel of the same name, the movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after Arnie buys a vintage 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine. Strange things happen and the viewers learn the car's secret: That it is possessed by a malign spirit out to even the score with anyone who does the car – or its owner – wrong.\n\nUpon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. Despite a lukewarm reception among critics, the film has become a cult classic.\n\nIn September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant in Detroit, the hood of a newly assembled, custom-painted 1958 Plymouth Fury slams down without warning and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the worker slumped in the seat and opens the door; the worker falls to the floor dead, a look of terror on his face. \n\nTwenty-one years later, in September 1978, Arnold \"Arnie\" Cunningham is an awkward and unpopular teenager in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used, badly battered red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury named \"Christine\" (the same car from the assembly plant), in need of extensive repairs. Since his parents will not let him keep the car at their house, Arnie begins to restore it at a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell. As he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s greaser, and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. \n\nUnbeknownst to Arnie, Dennis learns of the car's dark past from the brother of its obsessive original owner: the owner's daughter choked to death in it; his wife committed suicide in it; and he eventually did the same. During a football game, Dennis becomes distracted by the sight of Arnie kissing a girl in front of Christine and is tackled, suffering a season-ending leg injury. Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, chokes on a hamburger while inside the car on a date with him and is saved when a passing man administers the Heimlich maneuver. Sure that Christine is jealous of her, she vows never to get into the car again and urges Arnie to get rid of it. She and Arnie break up when he refuses to even consider this.\n\nAngry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class, school bully Buddy Repperton vandalizes Christine with the help of his gang. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine, but is surprised to see it quickly restore itself to showroom quality as he watches. Christine drives off by itself to seek out the vandals, crushing one in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills two others and sets the car on fire, and finally running down Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell climbs in to sit behind the steering wheel and is crushed to death when Christine pushes the driver's seat forward. The next morning, Christine is back in its slot and fully repaired.\n\nState police detective Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two gang members' deaths. However, he has no direct evidence to implicate Arnie, who has an alibi. Junkins either does not know or cannot believe that Christine can drive itself.\n\nDennis and Leigh, drawn together by their affection for Arnie, begin a relationship of their own and decide that the only way to save Arnie is to destroy Christine. They set a trap for it at Darnell's garage; Dennis waits at the controls of a bulldozer, while Leigh stands ready to close the garage doors and cut off Christine's retreat once it enters. However, Christine has been lying in wait under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time, and when Leigh takes up her position at the door controls, it strikes. Christine crashes through Darnell's office in an attempt to get at Leigh. Arnie - who has been driving the car himself - is thrown through the windshield and impaled on a shard of glass, which kills him. Dennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer, but it continually repairs itself and strikes back. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over the car, damaging Christine so much that it is unable to immediately regenerate.\n\nA few days later, Dennis, Leigh, and Junkins watch as Christine's remains - compacted into a cube by a car crusher - are dropped into a junkyard. The camera zooms in to a close-up of the front grille, which slowly starts to unbend.\n\nProducer Richard Kobritz had previously produced the miniseries \"Salem's Lot\", also based on a Stephen King novel. Through producing the miniseries, Kobritz became acquainted with King, who sent him manuscripts of two of his novels, \"Cujo\", and \"Christine\". Kobritz purchased the rights to \"Christine\" after finding himself attracted to the novel's \"celebration of America's obsession with the motorcar.\"\n\nAccording to John Carpenter, \"Christine\" was not a film he had planned on directing, saying that he directed the film as \"a job\" as opposed to a \"personal project.\" He had previously directed \"The Thing\" (1982), which had done poorly at the box office and led to critical backlash. In retrospect, Carpenter stated that upon reading \"Christine\", he felt that \"It just wasn't very frightening. But it was something I needed to do at that time for my career.\"\n\nKing's novel, the source material for Carpenter's film, made it clear that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of its previous owner, Roland D. LeBay, whereas the film version of the story shows that the evil spirit of the car manifested itself on the day it was built. Other elements from the novel were altered for the film, particularly the execution of the death scenes, which the filmmakers opted for a more \"cinematic approach.\"\n\nInitially, Columbia Pictures had wanted to cast Brooke Shields in the role of Leigh due to her publicity after the release of \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1980), and Scott Baio as Arnie. The filmmakers declined the suggestion, opting to cast young actors who were still fairly unknown. Kevin Bacon auditioned for the role, but opted out when offered a part in \"Footloose\" (1984). Carpenter cast Keith Gordon in the role of Arnie after an audition in New York City; Gordon had some experience in film, and was also working in theater at the time; John Stockwell was cast at an audition in Los Angeles.\n\nNineteen-year-old Alexandra Paul was cast in the film after audition in New York City; according to Carpenter, Paul was an \"untrained, young actress\" at the time, but brought a \"great quality\" about the character of Leigh. According to Paul, she had not read any of King's books or seen Carpenter's films, and read the novel in preparation.\n\n\"Christine\" was shot largely in Los Angeles, California, while the location for Darnell's garage was located in Santa Clarita. Filming began in April 1983, merely days after the King novel had been published. The film's stunts were primarily completed by stunt coordinator Terry Leonard, who was behind the wheel of the car during the high-speed chase scenes, as well as the scene in which the car drives down a highway engulfed in flames.\n\nAlthough the car in the film is identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury—and in 1983 radio ads promoting the film, voiceover artists announced, \"she's a '57 Fury\"—two other Plymouth models, the Belvedere and the Savoy, were also used to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen. John Carpenter placed ads throughout Southern California searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car. All cars were two door hardtops.\n\nTotal production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, \"Buckskin Beige\", seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie. The Fury also got anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender. In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere \"Dartline\" trim. Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury. At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58.\n\nOriginally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but decided after the shoot had finished to include them. The shots of the car regenerating itself were shot in post-production and done using hydraulics.\n\nOf the twenty cars used in the film, only two still exist. One is a stunt vehicle with a manual transmission and now resides in the hands of a private California collector. The other vehicle was rescued from a junkyard and restored by collector Bill Gibson of Pensacola, Florida.\n\n\"Christine\" was released in North America on December 9, 1983, to 1,045 theaters.\n\nIn its opening weekend \"Christine\" brought in $3,408,904 landing at #4. The film dropped 39.6% in its second weekend, grossing $2,058,517 slipping from fourth to eighth place. In its third weekend, it grossed $1,851,909 dropping to #9. The film remained at #9 its fourth weekend, grossing $2,736,782. In its fifth weekend, it returned to #8, grossing $2,015,922. Bringing in $1,316,835 in its sixth weekend, the film dropped out of the box office top ten to twelfth place. In its seventh and final weekend, the film brought in $819,972 landing at #14, bringing the total gross for \"Christine\" to $21,017,849.\n\nBased on 25 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, \"Christine\" has an overall 68% approval rating from critics with the consensus saying: \"The cracks are starting to show in John Carpenter's directorial instincts, but Christine is nonetheless silly, zippy fun.\" and an average score of 5.9 out of 10. \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review, stating: \"\"Christine\" seems like a retread. This time it’s a fire-engine red, 1958 Plymouth Fury that’s possessed by the Devil, and this deja-vu premise [from the novel by Stephen King] combined with the crazed-vehicle format, makes Christine appear pretty shop worn.\"\n\nRoger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars, saying: \"by the end of the movie, Christine has developed such a formidable personality that we are actually taking sides during its duel with a bulldozer. This is the kind of movie where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the Eisenhower.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" gave the film a middling review, saying: \"The early parts of the film are engaging and well acted, creating a believable high-school atmosphere. Unfortunately, the later part of the film is slow in developing, and it unfolds in predictable ways.\" \"Time Out\" said of the film: \"Carpenter and novelist Stephen King share not merely a taste for genre horror but a love of '50's teenage culture; and although set in the present, \"Christine\" reflects the second taste far more effectively than the first.\"\n\nThe film was released on VHS by Columbia Pictures, and later in a special edition DVD in 2004. On March 12, 2013, Twilight Time video released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in a limited edition run numbered at 3,000 copies. On September 29, 2015, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment re-released the film on Blu-ray. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on September 11 2018.\n\nTwo soundtracks were released, one consisting purely of the music written and composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, the other consisting of the contemporary pop songs used in the film.\n\nThe soundtrack album containing songs used in the film was entitled Christine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and was released on LP and cassette on Motown Records. It contained 10 (of the 15) songs listed in the film's credits, plus one track from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's own score. The track listing was as follows:\n\nThe following tracks were not included on this LP release, but were used in the film and listed in the film's credits:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4256069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4256069", "title": "Comparison of application virtualization software", "text": "Comparison of application virtualization software\n\nApplication virtualization software refers to both application virtual machines and software responsible for implementing them. Application virtual machines are typically used to allow application bytecode to run portably on many different computer architectures and operating systems. The application is usually run on the computer using an interpreter or just-in-time compilation (JIT). There are often several implementations of a given virtual machine, each covering a different set of functions.\n\nThe table here summarizes elements for which the virtual machine designs are intended to be efficient, not the list of abilities present in any implementation.\n\nVirtual machine instructions process data in local variables using a main \"model of computation\", typically that of a stack machine, register machine, or random access machine often called the memory machine. Use of these three methods is motivated by different tradeoffs in virtual machines vs physical machines, such as ease of interpreting, compiling, and verifying for security.\n\n\"Memory management\" in these portable virtual machines is addressed at a higher level of abstraction than in physical machines. Some virtual machines, such as the popular Java virtual machines (JVM), are involved with addresses in such a way as to require safe automatic memory management by allowing the virtual machine to trace pointer references, and disallow machine instructions from manually constructing pointers to memory. Other virtual machines, such as LLVM, are more like traditional physical machines, allowing direct use and manipulation of pointers. Common Intermediate Language (CIL) offers a hybrid in between, allowing both controlled use of memory (like the JVM, which allows safe automatic memory management), while also allowing an 'unsafe' mode that allows direct pointer manipulation in ways that can violate type boundaries and permission.\n\n\"Code security\" generally refers to the ability of the portable virtual machine to run code while offering it only a prescribed set of abilities. For example, the virtual machine might only allow the code access to a certain set of functions or data. The same controls over pointers which make automatic memory management possible and allow the virtual machine to ensure typesafe data access are used to assure that a code fragment is only allowed to certain elements of memory and cannot bypass the virtual machine itself. Other security mechanisms are then layered on top as code verifiers, stack verifiers, and other methods.\n\nAn \"interpreter\" allows programs made of virtual instructions to be loaded and run immediately without a potentially costly compile into native machine instructions. Any virtual machine which can be run can be interpreted, so the column designation here refers to whether the design includes provisions for efficient interpreting (for common usage).\n\n\"Just-in-time compilation\" (JIT), refers to a method of compiling to native instructions at the latest possible time, usually immediately before or during the running of the program. The challenge of JIT is more one of implementation than of virtual machine design, however, modern designs have begun to make considerations to help efficiency. The simplest JIT methods simply compile to a code fragment similar to an offline compiler. However, more complex methods are often employed, which specialize compiled code fragments to parameters known only at runtime (see Adaptive optimization).\n\n\"Ahead-of-time compilation\" (AOT) refers to the more classic method of using a precompiler to generate a set of native instructions which do not change during the runtime of the program. Because aggressive compiling and optimizing can take time, a precompiled program may launch faster than one which relies on JIT alone for execution. JVM implementations have mitigated this startup cost by initial interpreting to speed launch times, until native code fragments can be generated by JIT.\n\n\"Shared libraries\" are a facility to reuse segments of native code across multiple running programs. In modern operating systems, this generally means using virtual memory to share the memory pages containing a shared library across different processes which are protected from each other via memory protection. It is interesting that aggressive JIT methods such as adaptive optimization often produce code fragments unsuitable for sharing across processes or successive runs of the program, requiring a tradeoff be made between the efficiencies of precompiled and shared code and the advantages of adaptively specialized code. For example, several design provisions of CIL are present to allow for efficient shared libraries, possibly at the cost of more specialized JIT code. The JVM implementation on OS X uses a Java Shared Archive to provide some of the benefits of shared libraries.\n\nIn addition to the portable virtual machines described above, virtual machines are often used as an execution model for individual scripting languages, usually by an interpreter. This table lists specific virtual machine implementations, both of the above portable virtual machines, and of scripting language virtual machines.\n\n"}

POSIX shells and other Unix shells allow background execution by using the \"&\" character and the end of command, and in PowerShell you can use codice_1 or codice_2 commands.\n\nCompletion features assist the user in typing commands at the command line, by looking for and suggesting matching words for incomplete ones. Completion is generally requested by pressing the completion key (often the key).\n\n\"Command name completion\" is the completion of the name of a command. In most shells, a command can be a program in the command path (usually codice_3), a builtin command, a function or alias.\n\n\"Path completion\" is the completion of the path to a file, relative or absolute.\n\n\"Wildcard completion\" is a generalization of path completion, where an expression matches any number of files, using any supported syntax for file matching.\n\n\"Variable completion\" is the completion of the name of a variable name (environment variable or shell variable).\nBash, zsh, and fish have completion for all variable names. PowerShell has completions for environment variable names, shell variable names and — from within user-defined functions — parameter names.\n\n\"Command argument completion\" is the completion of a specific command's arguments. There are two types of arguments, named and positional: Named arguments, often called \"options\", are identified by their name or letter preceding a value, whereas positional arguments consist only of the value. Some shells allow completion of argument names, but few support completing values.\n\nBash, zsh and fish offer parameter name completion through a definition external to the command, distributed in a separate completion definition file. For command parameter name/value completions, these shells assume path/filename completion if no completion is defined for the command. Completion can be set up to suggest completions by calling a shell function. The fish shell additionally supports parsing of man pages to extract parameter information that can be used to improve completions/suggestions. In PowerShell, all types of commands (cmdlets, functions, script files) inherently expose data about the names, types and valid value ranges/lists for each argument. This metadata is used by PowerShell to automatically support argument name and value completion for built-in commands/functions, user-defined commands/functions as well as for script files. Individual cmdlets can also define dynamic completion of argument values where the completion values are computed dynamically on the running system.\n\nA user of a shell may find that he/she is typing something similar to what the user typed before. If the shell supports \"command history\" the user can call\nthe previous command into the line editor and edit it before issuing it again.\n\nShells that support completion may also be able to directly complete the command from the command history given a partial/initial part of the previous command.\n\nMost modern shells support command history. Shells which support command history in general also supports completion from history rather than just recalling\ncommands from the history. In addition to the plain command text, PowerShell also records execution start- and end time and execution status in the command history.\n\nMandatory arguments/parameters are arguments/parameters which must be assigned a value upon invocation the command, function or script file. A shell that can determine ahead\nof invocation that there are missing mandatory values, can assist the interactive user by prompting for those values instead of letting the command fail.\nHaving the shell prompt for missing values will allow the author of a script, command or function to mark a parameter as mandatory instead of creating script code to either\nprompt for the missing values (after determining that it is being run interactively) or fail with a message.\n\nPowerShell allows commands, functions and scripts to define arguments/parameters as \"mandatory\". The shell determines prior to invocation if there is any\nmandatory arguments/parameters which have not been bound, and will then prompt the user for the value(s) before actual invocation.\n\nWith automatic suggestions the shell monitors while the interactive user is typing and displays context-relevant suggestions without interrupting the typing instead of the user explicitly requesting completion.\n\nThe PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment use the discoverable metadata to provide \"intellisense\" - i.e. suggestions that automatically pops up as the user types, in addition to when the user explicitly requests completion lists by pressing e.g. \n\nA shell may record the locations the user has used as current locations and allow fast switching to any location/directory in the history.\n\nOne of the uses of the zsh directory stack is to record a directory history. In particular, the AUTO_PUSHD option and advanced cd arguments and completion are used for this purpose.\n\nPowerShell allows multiple named stacks to be used. Locations (directories) can be pushed onto/popped from the current stack or a named stack. Any stack can become the current (default) stack. Unlike most other shells, PowerShell's \"location\" concept allow location stacks to hold file system locations as well as other location types like e.g. Active Directory organizational units/groups, SQL Server databases/tables/objects, Internet Information Server applications/sites/virtual directories.\n\n4DOS and Take Command Console record history of current directories and allows the user to switch to a directory in the history using a popup a window.\n\nA directory name can be used directly as a command which implicitly changes the current location to the directory.\n\nWhen a command line does not match a command or arguments directly, spell checking can automatically correct common typing mistakes (such as case sensitivity, missing letters). There are two approaches to this; the shell can either suggest probable corrections upon command invocation, or this can happen earlier as part of a completion or autosuggestion.\n\nThe tcsh and zsh shells feature optional spell checking/correction, upon command invocation.\n\nFish does the autocorrection upon completion and autosuggestion. The feature is therefore not in the way when typing out the whole command and pressing enter, whereas extensive use of the tab and right-arrow keys makes the shell mostly case insensitive.\n\nThe PSReadLine PowerShell module (which is shipped with version 5.0) provides the option to specify a CommandValidationHandler ScriptBlock which runs before submitting the command. This allows for custom correcting of commonly mistyped commands, and verification before actually running the command.\n\nAn integrated environment is the integration of the command-line interface with editors (typically multiple documents), help system and possibly debugging and other tools.\n\nTake Command Console (TCC) comes with an integrated environment with command line pane, file explorer, editor, batch debugger and more.\n\nPowerShell ISE includes a command line pane with support for integrated command line, copy-paste, multiple document editors, source-level debugging, help pane, command explorer pane and scripting interface allowing scripts/modules to manipulate menus, add-ons etc. The ISE (menus, windows, shortcuts, addons) are customizable through scripts.\n\nSnippets are small regions of reusable script code. Snippets are often used to save keystrokes, or to assist the user with common scripting patterns. Many text editors support snippets for scripting either as built-in functionality or through plugins.\n\nPowerShell supports snippets in the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) using .\n\nA shell script can prompt the interactive user for a value.\n\nA shell script can present the interactive user with a list of choices.\n\nA shell script (or job) can report progress of long running tasks to the interactive user.\n\nUnix/Linux systems may offer other tools support using progress indicators from scripts or as standalone-commands, such as the program \"pv\". These are not integrated features of the shells, however.\n\nPowerShell has a built-in command and API functions (to be used when authoring commands) for writing/updating a progress bar. Progress bar messages are sent separates from regular command output\nand the progress bar is always displayed at the ultimate interactive users console regardless of whether the progress messages originates from an interactive script, from a background job or from a remote session.\n\nOutput from a command execution can be displayed in a table/grid which can be interactively sorted and filtered and/or otherwise manipulated after command execution ends.\n\nPowerShell Out-GridView cmdlet displays data in an interactive window with interactive sorting and filtering.\n\nAn independent project offers syntax highlighting as an add-on to the Z Shell (zsh). This is not part of the shell, however.\n\nPowerShell provides customizable syntax highlighting on the command line through the PSReadLine module. This module can be used with PowerShell v3.0+, and it's included with v5.0. Additionally, it is loaded by default in the command line host \"powershell.exe\" in v5.0. The PowerShell ISE also includes syntax highlighting on the command line as well as in the script pane.\nTake Command Console (TCC) offers syntax highlighting in the integrated environment.\n\n4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT / Take Command Console and PowerShell (in PowerShell ISE) looks up context-sensitive help information when is pressed.\n\nZsh provides various forms of configurable context-sensitive help as part of its run-help widget, _complete_help command, or in the completion of options for some commands.\n\nA command builder is a guided dialog which assists the user in filling in a command. PowerShell has a command builder which is available in PowerShell ISE or which can be displayed separately through the Show-Command cmdlet.\n\n\nIn anticipation of what a given running application may accept as keyboard input, the user of the shell instructs the shell to generate a sequence of \"simulated\" keystrokes, which the application will interpret as an keyboard input from an interactive user. By sending keystroke sequences the user may be able to direct the application to perform actions that would be impossible to achieve through input redirection or would otherwise require an interactive user. For example, if an application acts on keystrokes, which cannot be redirected, distinguishes between normal and extended keys, flushes the queue before accepting new input on startup or under certain conditions, or because it does not read through standard input at all. Keystroke stacking typically also provides means to control the timing of simulated keys being sent or to delay new keys until the queue was flushed etc. It also allows to simulate keys which are not present on a keyboard (because the corresponding keys do not physically exist or because a different keyboard layout is being used) and therefore would be impossible to type by a user.\n\nSome shell scripts need to query the user for sensitive information such as passwords, private digital keys, PIN codes or other confidential information. Sensitive input should not be echoed back to the screen/input device where it could be gleaned by unauthorized persons. Plaintext memory representation of sensitive information should also be avoided as it could allow the information to be compromised, e.g., through swap files, core dumps etc.\n\nThe shells bash, zsh and PowerShell offer this as a specific feature. Shells which do not offer this as a specific feature may still be able to turn off echoing through some other means. Shells executing on a Unix/Linux operating system can use the stty external command to switch off/on echoing of input characters. In addition to not echoing back the characters, PowerShell's -AsSecureString option also encrypts the input character-by-character during the input process, ensuring that the string is never represented unencrypted in memory where it could be compromised through memory dumps, scanning, transcription etc.\n\nIf a script reads a password into an environment variable it is in memory in plain text, and thus may be accessed via a core dump. It is also in the process environment, which may be accessible by other processes started by the script.\n\nPowerShell can work with encrypted string variables/parameters. Encrypted variables ensure that values are not inadvertently disclosed through e.g. transcripts, echo'ing, logfiles, memory or crash dumps or even malicious memory scanning. PowerShell also supports saving of such encrypted strings in text files, protected by a key owned by the current user.\n\nSome operating systems define an \"execute\" permission which can be granted to users/groups for a file.\n\nOn Unix systems, the execute permission controls access to invoking the file as a program, and applies both to executables and scripts.\nAs the permission is enforced in the program loader, no obligation is needed from the invoking program, nor the invoked program, in enforcing the execute permission this also goes for shells and other interpreter programs.\nThe behaviour is mandated by the POSIX C library that is used for interfacing with the kernel. POSIX specifies that the codice_4 family of functions shall fail with EACCESS (permission denied) if the file denies execution permission (see ).\n\nThe \"execute\" permission only applies when the script is run directly. If a script is invoked as an argument to the interpreting shell, it will be executed regardless of whether the user holds the \"execute\" permission for that script.\n\nAlthough Windows also specifies an \"execute\" permission, none of the Windows-specific shells block script execution if the permission has not been granted.\n\nSome shells will block scripts determined to be untrustworthy, or refuse to run scripts if mandated by a system administrator.\n\nPowerShell can be set to block execution of scripts which has been marked as obtained from an unknown/untrusted origin (e.g. the Internet). Internet facing applications such as web browsers, IM clients, mail readers etc. mark files downloaded from the internet with the origin zone in an alternate data stream which is understood by PowerShell.\n\nScript/code signing policies can be used to ensure that an operations department only run approved scripts/code which have been reviewed and signed by a trusted reviewer/approver. Signing regimes also protects against tampering. If a script is sent from vendor to a client, the client can use signing to ensure that the script has not been tampered with during transit and that the script indeed originates from the vendor and not an attacker trying to social engineer an operator into running an attack script.\n\nPowerShell can be set to allow execution of otherwise blocked scripts (e.g. originating from an untrusted zone) if the script has been digitally signed using a trusted digital certificate.\n\nA company may want to enforce execution restriction globally within the company and/or certain parts of the company. It may want to set a policy for running signed scripts but allow certain parts of the company to set their own policies for zoned restrictions.\n\nPowerShell allows script blocking policies to be enforced at multiple levels: Local machine, current user etc. A higher level policy overrides a lower level policy, e.g. if a policy is defined for the local machine it is in place for all users of the local machine, only if it is left \"undefined\" at the higher level can it be defined for the lower levels.\n\nSeveral shells can be started or be configured to start in a mode where only a limited set of commands and actions is available to the user. While not a security \"boundary\" (the command accessing a resource is blocked rather than the resource) this is nevertheless typically used to restrict users' actions before logging in.\n\nA restricted mode is part of the POSIX specification for shells, and most of the Linux/Unix shells support such a mode where several of the built-in commands are disabled and only external commands from a certain directory can be invoked.\n\nPowerShell supports restricted modes through \"session configuration files\" or session configurations. A session configuration file can define visible (available) cmdlets, aliases, functions, path providers and more.\n\nScripts that invoke other scripts can be a security risk as they can potentially execute foreign code in the context of the user who launched the initial script. Scripts will usually be designed to exclusively include scripts from known safe locations; but in some instances, e.g. when offering the user a way to configure the environment or loading localized messages, the script may need to include other scripts/files. One way to address this risk is for the shell to offer a safe subset of commands which can be executed by an included script.\n\nPowerShell data sections can contain constants and expressions using a restricted subset of operators and commands. PowerShell data sections are used when e.g. localized strings needs to be read from an external source while protecting against unwanted side effects.\n\n"}

The extant reports were sent between June 1941 and April 1942 to the Chief of the Security Police and the SD () in Berlin, from the occupied eastern territories including modern-day Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Moldova, and the Baltic Countries. During the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials the originals were grouped according to year and month and catalogued using a consecutive numbering system, as listed in the below table. The original photostats are held at the National Archives in Washington D.C.. \n\nFollowing the onset of Operation Barbarossa, during the first 5 weeks of their shooting actions, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" squads targeted primarily male Jews. This changed on July 29, 1941, when Reinhard Heydrich himself, quoted at an SS meeting in Vileyka (Polish Wilejka), criticized their leaders for the low execution figures. It was therefore ordered that the Jewish women and children be included in all subsequent shooting operations. The first women and children were killed along with the men on July 30, 1941, in Vileyka.\n\nThe Nazi \"Einsatzgruppen\" were not the only formation tasked with the mass killings. Other formations included the Order Police battalions from Germany (Orpo) participating equally in the mass murder of Polish and Soviet Jews regardless of their age and sex, including in the territories of the formerly Soviet-occupied Poland (see the Red Friday massacre), the Baltic states, and in the USSR proper. Significant numbers of women and children were murdered behind all front lines not only by the Germans but also by the local Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliary forces. The largest mass shooting of Soviet Jews took place on September 29, 1941, in the ravine of Babi Yar near Kiev, where 33,771 Jews of all ages were machine-gunned (Situation Report No. 101).\n\nAfter World War II, the reports were grouped and numbered by the Allies in order to summarize their content. The actual German cables were sent in their own differing sequence including by the \"Einsatzgruppe\" A (EG–A) attached to Army Group North, \"Einsatzgruppe\" B (EG–B) attached to Army Group Center, \"Einsatzgruppe\" C (EG-C) attached to the Army Group South, and \"Einsatzgruppe\" D (EG–D) attached to the 11th Army. In the OSRs, individual \"Ereignismeldungen UdSSR\" (morning reports) abbr. EM, from EG–A appear in 103 different places. The reports from EG–B appear in 64 OCRs (as arranged by the Allies). The EG-C reports are listed in 77 different OCRs, and the reports from EG–D (with the least representation at source) are featured in 63 OCRs. Occasionally, large gaps appear between individual reports, caused by the lack of time or other complications including broken telephone lines in the East. Notably, in Operational Situation Report number 19, Einsatzgruppe C was changed to Einsatzgruppe B and vice versa, thus confusing further reports of their shooting actions. \n\nThe OSRs are far from being equal. Some of them, such as OSR 156, include translated cables from several cities and weeks of shooting actions not yet concluded with tens of thousands of victims mentioned; while other Operational Situation Reports, such as OSR 67, resemble long essays describing mere investigations into partisan activities in rural countryside resulting in dozens of executions. Notably, the reports do not include all killings before the end of 1942.\n\nThe following selection of reports are available in English translation. The complete set of reports is available in German. \n\n"}

{"id": "39317114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39317114", "title": "Endless House", "text": "Endless House\n\nEndless House is a conceptual work of architecture by Frederick Kiesler. Kiesler used the project to express an elaborate, personal metaphysics based on the concepts of ‘connectivity’, ‘correality’ and ‘biotechnique’. The project was an attempt to merge the spiritual and practical into a new housing typology.\n\nAlthough the structure was never built to scale, a miniaturized version was constructed for the “Visionary Architects” exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, which included Louis Kahn, Frank Lloyd Wright, Buckminster Fuller, and Le Corbusier. Kiesler departed in many ways from the modernist ideals of his contemporaries, objecting to pre-fabrication, rationalism, and orthogonal designs in favor of a curvilinear structure. Reception of the “Endless House” was mixed, garnering the praise of such contemporaries as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, while receiving criticism for ideas that were considered to be impractical and outlandish. The “Endless House” concept also appeared in the Japanese publication Bokubi in 1963, and Kiesler’s posthumously published artistic journals, titled “Inside the Endless House.”\n\nThe Endless House model is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nThe Endless House consists of reinforced concrete over a wire, mesh frame. Its shape is roughly that of a flattened sphere. The structure was elevated on 4 broad pilotis, with two staircases leading to the ground. The layout includes a kitchen/dining room, a living room, a parent’s bedroom, a children’s bedroom, and a space for seclusion. Windows punctuate the design, and are made of semi-transparent plastic. Different types of flooring throughout the house include sand, grass, terra cotta tile, and pebbles. Kiesler’s design is biomorphic; he intended to create an organic space, rather than a geometric, linear one.\n\nKiesler’s Endless House was intended to communicate his personal views of metaphysics. In terms of architecture, he included abstract aspects of ‘connectivity’, ‘corealation’, and ‘biotechnique’. These terms describe abstract ideas, rather than being specific architectural terms.\n\nTo show connectivity, Kiesler included curvilinear structure that is built of one material, concrete, with no structural seams in the building. Correalism, the continual interaction between man and nature, meant that Kiesler thought of the rooms of his house as extensions of the bodies of its inhabitants. He explained this in his 1940 article “On Correalism and Biotechnique”, published in the \"Architectural Record\".\n\nThe Endless House was originally commissioned to be built in full scale in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art. However, a new wing was planned for the museum, which meant that the completed building would only have stood for one year. Instead, Arthur Drexler, director of the museum’s department of architecture and design, invited Kiestler to build a scaled down version for his “Visionary Architects” show, which exhibited 20th century architecture that was considered “too revolutionary to build.\" The exhibit, which opened on September 29, 1960, featured an 8-foot model of the “Endless House”, a full-scale photographic mural of the house, and a series of drawings and sketches.\n\nThe original plans for Endless House were presented in Vienna in 1924. At that time, Kiesler was active in the European avant-garde, and a member of the De Stijl group. “Endless House” was influenced by Kiesler's interaction with this group, and aimed to comingle art and life by creating an environment that encouraged the occupant's natural inclination towards art.\n\nWhen Kiesler moved to New York City in 1926, he was participated in the Surrealist movement, which strove to use art to achieve a healthier, natural mental experience. Kiesler’s “Endless House” sketches were not determined by any artistic or architectural conventions, and suggested no particular use of the space: rather, they simply attempted to convey a biomorphic shape, open to the possibilities of its inhabitant’s intent.\n\nKiesler, although often paired with Modernist architects, was an outspoken critic of Modernism and the International Style. He was especially critical of the Modernist invocation of functionality, which assumes a specific use for a space according to present conceptions of use and value. He considered his biomorphic design to be not only more natural than Modernists who strove for organicity, but also more practical for future use, due to its indeterminacy. Although “Endless House” was presented in 1960 alongside definitively Modernist architecture projects, it was an implicit critique of Modernism.\n\n"}

Is most well known for the writing the \"Compendium Maleficarum\" (Book of Witches).\n\nHe was a member of one of the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosian orders. These religious brotherhoods had appeared at various times since the 14th Century in and around the city of Milan and were quite plentiful, but the only one to attain more than simply local importance was the ‘\"Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus\"’ sometimes known as 'The Brethren of the Grove'.\n\nBefore 1441 there were various monasteries that were canonically recognized under the name ‘Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ but there was little link between them. However, in 1441 Pope Eugene IV merged them into one congregation called ‘Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus’ of which Francesco Maria Guazzo was a member under the papacy of Pope Sixtus V and Pope Paul V.\n\nGuazzo had firsthand experience of the practice and profession of witchcraft and bewitchment and was widely travelled and highly regarded in the field of possessions and demonology and the cures thereof.\n\nDuring his life he is credited with performing several exorcisms including to members of several ducal and princely families, notably the bewitched Cardinal Charles of Lorraine and his relative, Eric, Bishop of Verdun.\n\nOn another occasion Guazzo was called to Düsseldorf in order to exorcise the mad John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (1562–1609). Guazzo first diagnosed possession, but after five months of unsuccessful attempts at spiritual healing and in the summer of 1604, the diagnosis was changed to bewitchment as the cause of the poor Duke’s mental illness. Guazzo had been sent to Düsseldorf by Duke Charles III of Lorraine (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter Antoinette (1569–1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm’s wife.\n\nIt was these direct experiences that inspired Guazzo to write his \"Compendium Maleficarum\" which was published in 1608 and was widely regarded among his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on Witchcraft. Within his text, Guazzo discusses witches’ pacts with the devil, detailed descriptions of witches’ powers and poisons and also prepared his classification of the demons based on a previous work by Michael Psellus.\n\nIn this work, Guazzo was greatly influenced by Duke Charles III of Lorraine’s leading lawyer and demonologist, Nicholas Remy (Remy produced one of the most important early works on demonology and witchcraft in 1595, \"Daemonolatreiae libri tres\", and claimed to have sentenced to death over 900 people during witch trials between 1582–1592).\n\n\n\n"}

Victories in World Group rounds are worth more points than those in Zone Groups, and ties at the later rounds of the competition are progressively worth more points. Bonus points are also awarded for a nation that defeats a higher-ranked nation, but only if the latter nation is ranked in the top 64 for the Davis Cup, or in the top 75 for the Fed Cup. Unique to the Davis Cup, there is an additional bonus for a nation that wins a tie in the opponent's home ground: a 25% bonus is added to the total of round points and ranking bonus points (if any). At the Fed Cup only, nations that win by walkover are awarded round points but no bonus points, and no points are awarded for consolation events.\n\nThe current ranking points and bonus points distribution tables for the Davis Cup are shown below:\n\n\nThe current ranking points and bonus points distribution tables for the Fed Cup are shown below:\n\n"}

Purpose-built from 1447 to 1452 and opened in 1454, and named after the local aristocrat Malatesta Novello, it is significant for being the first civic library in Europe, i.e. belonging to the commune rather than the church or a noble family, and open to the general public. The library was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005.\n\nThe building and creation of the library was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, Malatesta Novello. Construction was directed by Matteo Nuti from Fano (a pupil of Leon Battista Alberti) and lasted from 1447 to 1452. At Novello's direction, the books were owned by the commune of Cesena, not the monastery or the family. Because of this governing structure, the collection was not dispersed like many monastic libraries.\n\nIn 2005 UNESCO included the Library in the Memory of the World Programme Register.\n\nThe Malatestiana Library is the only one in the world of the so-called humanistic-conventual type, which blends humanistic principles with arhictecture otherwise reserved for religious buildings, and has preserved its structure, fittings and codexes since its opening more than 550 years ago. The main doorway was the work of sculptor Agostino di Duccio (1418–1481). The walnut door at the main entrance dates back to 1454 and was carved by the artist Cristoforo from San Giovanni in Persiceto.\n\nInside, the library features geometric design, typical of the early Italian Renaissance style. The aula has the layout of a basilica (reflecting the importance of the library as a \"temple of culture\"), with three naves divided by ten rows of white columns made from local stone; there are eleven bays in each aisle, which are pole vaulted. The central nave is barrel vaulted and ends with a rose under which is the gravestone of Malatesta Novello.\n\nThe fittings are composed of 58 desks, with coat of arms at the sides. The light comes in through the 44 Venetian style windows, which were purpose designed to provide ideal lighting for reading.\n\nThe library has over 400,000 books, including over 340 codices covering various fields such as religion, Greek and Latin classics, sciences and medicine, and about 3,200 manuscripts from the 16th century. The oldest manuscript in the library is a copy of Isidore's \"Etymologiae\".\n"}

On this day, the States of Flanders \"solemnly declare[d] in the name of the People, the province of Flanders to be an independent State, and definitively withdrawn from its loyalty and obedience to emperor Joseph II, count of Flanders, and from the House of Austria.\" The States also declared \"all officials, lieges and other servants, whoever they may be, free and absolved from all concluded and indebted contracts, and discharged from every oath done to the fallen count of Flanders.\" \n\nResistance against the reign of Joseph II in the Austrian Netherlands, which worsened in 1786–87 when a number of States refused to pay their taxes (\"beden\") and the \"landvoogden\" reversed all reform decrees on their own authority, escalated to open rebellion in the course of 1789, heavily influenced by the simultaneous French Revolution and Liège Revolution which had commenced a few months earlier. \nOn 24 October 1789, Hendrik van der Noot had already proclaimed the independence of the Duchy of Brabant by the \"Manifesto of the People of Brabant\", abjuring Joseph II as the duke of Brabant. From Breda in the Dutch Republic, a small army of patriots first conquered Brabant, next Flanders, Hainaut, Tournai and the Tournaisis, Namur and the rest of the Southern Netherlands except Luxembourg, finally taking Brussels in December. \n\nThe manifesto elaborates why the Habsburg princes had not fulfilled their \"constitutional\" duties, and therefore, the abjuration of Joseph II's right to rule was justified. After summing up all violations of their rightful freedoms, the States of Flanders conclude: \"Thus, one sought to subject the brave Netherlanders to complete slavery, and treat them like the inhabitants of Moravia and Croatia.\" The text composed in Dutch and French by Karel Jozef de Graeve, Jean-Joseph Raepsaet and Maarten de Bast. The ideas expressed in the manifesto were primarily inspired by the United States Declaration of Independence (1776).\n\nThe States of the respective Southern Netherlandish provinces united in a new confederal republic, the United Belgian States (7 January – 11 December 1790), which was reconquered after eleven months by the Imperial army. \n\n"}

It partially abolished serfdom in Poland, granting substantial civil liberties to all the peasants. The motives behind the Połaniec Proclamation were twofold: first, Kosciuszko, a liberal and reformer, believed that serfdom was an unfair system and should be ended; second, the uprising was in desperate need of recruits, and freeing the peasants would prompt many to enlist.\n\nThe proclamation provided the peasants with the personal freedom, right for assistance from the state against the abuses of the Polish nobility (szlachta) and gave them specific property rights to the land they cultivated. Although this new law never fully came into being and was boycotted by much of the szlachta, it also attracted many peasants to the ranks of the revolutionists, resulting in the formation of the famous \"kosynierzy\" peasant infantry, the most famous of whom, Bartosz Głowacki, became one of the heroes of the Uprising. It was the first time in Polish history when the peasants were officially regarded as part of the \"nation\", the word being previously equal to \"szlachta\".\n\nThis was the second legal act issued by the reformed Polish state (the first being the Constitution of May 3, considered the second oldest constitution in the world, and was the expansion of the 4th act of that constitution. It was also the last legal act of the Commonwealth, and just like the constitution that made it possible, it had a short lifespan and negligible impact on most of Commonwealth citizens. In many places where revolutionary forces could not enforce it, the local szlachta simply ignored the proclamation. However the news of the proclamation spread among the peasantry and was kept alive by the revolutionary and patriotic minded Poles. Over the next several decades, after the partitions of Poland ended the existence of Poland as a separate state, it became one of the symbols of Polish history.\n\nThe proclamation specifically granted to peasants:\n\n\n\n\"Announce to the people that, according to law, they are under the protection of the nation's government; that the person subject to any lord, is liberated.\"\n"}

Turning professional, he began in Chicago, Illinois and toured the United States with great success. Bastien was small for a wrestler at 185 pounds, but he was quick, vigorous, fast and employed a wide assortment of aerial moves.

He left money for several individuals, the church and the general benefit as described above. Claims have been made by alleged family members that the testament was supposed to be limited in time to 100 years, after which the remaining money were to be transferred to the Teylers family. No claims of such have been recognized in court. \n\nThe Stichting was founded by five friends of Teylers, who were his executors and the first directors. The first replacing director (board member) of the Teylers Stichting was Adriaan van Zeebergh, the pensionaris of the city of Haarlem, a powerful civil servant position at the time. He replaced Barnaart, who died in 1780. \n\nThe foundation is governed by five directors, which are appointed via Co-option. The first directors were five of Teylers friends:\n\nThe directors traditionally meet in the \"Grote Herenkamer\" (Large Boardroom) at the Teylers Fundatiehuis (English: Foundation House), a room adjacent to the Oval Room of Teylers Museum.

The Stichting is also responsible for the Teylers Chair at Leiden University. The actual management of the museum was left to a \"kastelein\" and later the \"museum director\" (not to confuse with the directors of the foundation).\n\nIn 1981 the governance of the Museum was transferred to a separate foundation on the request of the government, so that they could help fund it through subsidies after its recognition as museum of national importance. This separate foundation became the Stichting tot Beheer en Instandhouding van Teylers Museum (\"Foundation for management and conservation of Teylers Museum\"), and the Teylers Stichting still appoints two of the six members of the Supervisory Board of that foundation. The Teylers Stichting still does own the actual buildings. \n\nAs determined in the testament as well, the Stichting is established in the Fundatiehuis.\n\nThe complete archive of the Teylers Stichting is still intact and available. The early years (1778–1827/1828) in the archive have been digitized and are available online on the website of the Teylers Museum. This includes the minutes of the directors' meetings and the receipts of materials and museum pieces that were bought. From these receipts it can be reconstructed what the activities of the Teylers Stichting have been in the past. \n\nThe archive has been stored in a special room in the Fundatiehuis, as specified in the testament, which was provided with a special lock with five keyholes. Each of the directors would get one of the five different keys, and the lock was designed in such a way that it could not be opened or closed without at least three of the five keys - irrespective which.\n"}

The book features sexual practices such as oral sex and various sex positions as well as bringing \"further out\" practices such as sexual bondage and swinging to the attention of the general public.\n\nThe original version was illustrated with a mixture of classical Indian and Japanese erotica and specially commissioned illustrations by Chris Foss (black-and-white line drawings) and Charles Raymond (colour paintings). These two artists based their work on photographs taken by Chris Foss, of Charles Raymond and his wife. The illustrations have become somewhat dated, mainly because of changes in hairstyles. Both the illustrations and text are titillating as well as illustrative, in contrast to the bland, clinical style of earlier books about sex. More recent editions feature new artwork, and added text emphasizing safer sex.\n\nNewer versions have reversed previously-supportive positions on topics such as swinging, due to extensive textual changes made at the height of the 1980s AIDS panic.\n\nA pocket book version entitled, \"The Joy of Sex, the Pocket Edition\" was also published.

The books were restored to shelves in September 2008 in response to ACLU threats of litigation.\n\nPublisher Mitchell Beazley released an updated edition of the book in September 2008.

The funding was used to officially launch the website, with the company relocating to Austin, Texas and Dziabiak later being named company COO.\nThe Zebra was initially launched in September 2013 in both Texas and California, the two states with the most drivers. It initially offered quotes from 33 different insurers (approximately 90% of the market), requiring only a zip code and vehicle information to obtain a quote. The quotes were provided from a direct relationship that The Zebra had with the insurers, or through a rate manual from companies that it did not have a direct relationship with. The website allowed a more detailed quote for users who answered additional questions such as driving history.

Some of the stars Mondt helped create from the 1920s through the 1960s included Wayne Munn, Jim Londos, Antonino Rocca, Bruno Sammartino, Stu Hart and Cowboy Bill Watts.\n\nJoseph Raymond Mondt was born in Garden Grove, Iowa on January 18, 1894. Joseph (Joe) Toots was his professional name. Toots' father, Frank, was a farmer and building contractor. The Mondt family moved to Weld County, Colorado in 1904.\n\nToots Mondt made his wrestling debut in Greeley in 1912 at the age of 18 in a carnival/wrestling style match, a match he would wrestle in for many years. Stu Hart claimed he ran into Toots by chance while wrestling in New York City and that Mondt said he received his first wrestling lesson in 1916 from Jack Taylor, and Mondt tried to recruit Hart into a territory in Washington D.C. Around this time, he also tried his hand at acrobatics. However, this was an unsuccessful move and Toots returned to wrestling matches. Toots received his big break when he was discovered by wrestling pioneer Farmer Burns during one of his scouting trips. The nickname ‘Toots’, had to do with either his small feet or his relative youth and baby face. Mondt was the youngest wrestler in Farmer Burns' camp.\n\nUntil 1919, wrestling matches were slow-moving exhibitions mainly confined to the mat and lasting on an average 60 minutes. Crowds no longer found this to be suitable entertainment and accordingly, they began to dwindle. Wrestling matches slowly and eventually became pre-determined. Toots Mondt joined the camp of Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis with the recommendation of Farmer Burns. Toots served in many capacities as a sparring partner, trainer, sometimes as an opponent and as a police officer. As a sparring partner and trainer, Toots Mondt helped Ed Lewis develop new holds and counters. The working relationship and unity amongst wrestling promoters was beginning to wear thin and crowd attendance was still low. Toots conceived a solution and combined features of a boxing ring, Greco-Roman, freestyle wrestling, and the old-time lumber-camp style of fighting. Toots had called it ’Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling’.\n\nToots Mondt's second plan was to promote this new style of wrestling on a much higher scale. Toots convinced Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow of forming their own promotion as opposed to having different promoters controlling them. The team of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow used their connections to convince many other wrestlers to sign up. Under the control of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow, they served as bookers and agents. Toots also instituted time limits as wrestling matches would often go three or four hours. Within six months, the \"Gold Dust Trio\" controlled the course of professional wrestling in North America. Their product was moved out from venues such as burlesque theaters and back alley halls to the major sports venue in each city. All new talent was tested in Billy Sandow's private ring while routines and finishes were carefully determined by Toots. The Gold Dust Trio later dissolved from a power struggle between Toots Mondt & Billy Sandow's brother Max.\n\nMondt then formed a partnership with Philadelphia promoter, Ray Fabiani. The new combination wasted little time and found their new title holder in Dick Shickat, a former circus strongman from Germany. Once Dick Shickat's title reign had run its course, Mondt and Fabiani made Jim Londos their new champion and continued their hold on the Northeast. They soon expanded onto New York City, Hartford, Baltimore, and Washington DC. Toots/Fabiani were unsuccessful because rival New York promoter Jack Curley prevented them from promoting in NYC for years, and it was during this time that he came around an up-and-coming Lou Thesz, with whom Mondt had a bad history. As Jack Curley was on his deathbed, Toots realized that New York wrestling would fall apart. So Toots & Fabiani immediately formed an alliance with fellow booking heavyweight Rudy Dusek. This formation to take over New York was kept a secret. At Curley's funeral, one of his sons approached Toots about taking over New York and was not aware that Toots had a plan. Toots also gained help from other bookers such as Jack Pfeffer, the Johnston Brothers and Jess McMahon. Jess McMahon worked for boxing promoter and New York Rangers hockey franchise founder Tex Rickard, who despised wrestling, preventing bookings in Madison Square Garden (MSG) from 1939 to 1948. Toots found former wrestler turned millionaire Bernarr McFadden, who gave Toots the financial backings.\n\nBernarr McFadden helped Toots promote in NYC and gain access into Madison Square Garden. In 1948, in the main event of the first card held in MSG for 9 years, Gorgeous George defeated Ernie Dusek. In that same year Toots Mondt was in search for another champion. After several failed attempts, Toots Mondt found Antonino Rocca, who brought in more Latino fans to the matches which financially favored Toots. Mondt, however, was not able to keep Rocca happy and Vince McMahon Sr. was brought into the scene by Ray Fabiani.\n\nIn 1963, Toots Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), renaming Capitol Wrestling Corporation to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Toots Mondt parted ways with NWA President Sam Muchnick on good terms so that the WWWF would not be seen as an enemy. Toots and Vince were also in the middle of fighting off an invasion by Jim Crockett Promotions from promoting in the WWWF territories.\n\nWhen Buddy Rogers was crowned NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Toots controlled the bookings for Rogers’ title defenses. Toots would rarely allow Buddy Rogers to defend the title outside the Northeastern region. This would be one of the factors which led to the World Wide Wrestling Federation splitting from the NWA. In April 1963, Buddy Rogers was awarded the WWWF World Heavyweight title, supposedly for winning a tournament for the title in Rio de Janeiro, a fictitious storyline created by Toots Mondt. In 1965, Toots Mondt stepped down as promoter at Madison Square Garden and Vince McMahon, Sr. took over. When Bruno Sammartino was brought into the WWWF, Vince Sr. predicted that he would be a midcarder for two or three years at best. Toots called Sammartino the future of the company because people instantly liked and responded to him. Toots convinced Vince McMahon Sr. to build the company around Bruno Sammartino. In a June 2012 Wrestling Observer Radio podcast, Bruno acknowledged that Mondt and Vince McMahon Sr. were not on the best of terms during his tenure with the company, with Bruno suggesting it was due to the fallout over the promotion's handling of Buddy Rogers.\n\nChanging times and the rise of television saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to get a handle on television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1688593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1688593", "title": "Urban Legends: Final Cut", "text": "Urban Legends: Final Cut\n\nUrban Legends: Final Cut is a 2000 American slasher film directed by John Ottman, in his directorial debut, and starring Jennifer Morrison, Matthew Davis, Hart Bochner, Joseph Lawrence, Anthony Anderson, and Loretta Devine. In addition to directing, Ottman also edited the film and composed its score. The sequel to the 1998 film \"Urban Legend\", its plot follows a film student who finds herself at the center of serial killings occurring on her university campus shortly after she begins making a thesis film about urban legends.\n\nFilmed in late 1999, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" was released in the United States in September 2000, distributed by Columbia Pictures.\n\nAmy Mayfield, a student at a prestigious film school, is unsure about what her thesis film is going to be. But after a conversation with security guard Reese Wilson about her experience with a series of murders that had happened on the campus she had previously worked in, she is inspired to make a film about a serial killer murdering in the fashion of urban legends. Meanwhile, fellow student Lisa has a drink with classmate Travis at a bar before her scheduled flight out of town. While leaving the bar, she begins to feel dazed, and is attacked and abducted in the coat room. She wakes up in a bathtub filled with ice and discovers that her kidney has been removed. Attacked by her abductor, she tries to flee through the window, but is decapitated in the process. \n\nThe next day, Amy is preparing the shooting of her thesis film but is deserted by the assigned camera man, Toby, who accuses Amy of stealing his thesis idea. Shooting begins with another camera man, Simon. When Sandra, Amy's actress friend who played a victim in a scene, returns to an empty studio after forgetting her keys, she is attacked and slashed to death with a straight razor. Her peers witness her filmed death when the material is smuggled into a sequence of takes of the scene. Amy is disturbed by the footage, and is unable to figure out who shot it; her peers, however, discount it as a piece of a showreel. Sandra's absence is unnoticed, as she was supposed to leave for an audition in Los Angeles for a bit part on \"ER\" the following day.\n\nTravis commits suicide in the campus tower, apparently spurred by a poor grade received on his thesis film which disqualified him from receiving the university's Hitchcock Award. At his funeral, the arrogant Graham, the son of a Hollywood director, offers to help Amy with her film; she declines, after which he discloses to her that he is aware of her backgroundher father was a famous documentarian, a fact she has kept hidden from most of their peers. After the funeral, Amy meets Travis's twin brother, Trevor, who explains to her that he believes his brother was murdered. Later, while Amy is recording audio loops of screams for the film, Simon is beaten to death outside, and the audio of his death is inadvertently recorded. While going over the loops, Amy is attacked by the killer, donning a fencing mask. She is chased through the campus, but manages to evade him.\n\nBefore filming another scene for Amy's film in an empty carnival ride, sophomores Stan and Dirk are attacked and electrocuted while preparing the set. Amy discovers the corpses and is again confronted by the killer. She escapes again and informs the police, who attribute the deaths to accidental electrocution. Amy is comforted by Trevor. They begin having sex when Trevor suddenly stabs Amy. She wakes up and realizes that it was only a dream. Amy later notices a light inside the bell tower. She goes there and finds her friend, Vanessa waiting for her. Vanessa, a lesbian, presents a note she received addressed to her from Amy, in which it states that she has romantic feelings for Vanessa. Amy explains that she did not write the note, and fears that both women have been lured there. They are startled by the killer; Amy presses a panic button in the tower, but the killer manages to pursue them to the top of the tower. Once at the top, Amy is locked in a closet by the killer, where she finds the corpses of Simon and Sandra. Upon breaking free, she finds Vanessa hanging from the bell. Amy runs outside out of the tower passing Reese, who was notified of the disturbance via the campus security system.\n\nAmy runs into the arms of Trevor. Later, he tells her he has found that all the murder victims worked on Travis's thesis film. After watching some of Travis's film, \"The Gods of Men\", they suspect Toby, the only person who worked on the film who is still alive. They kidnap Toby and call in Professor Solomon to an empty film set to present their suspicions. However, Toby reveals that Travis faked Toby's sound credit to help him graduate, admitting that he never went anywhere near Travis's film. Graham happens upon the confrontation, watching from a window. In the confusion, Solomon reveals himself as the killer, attempting to frame Amy and usurp the Hitchcock Awardwhich includes a large stipendby presenting Travis's film as his own. A melee ensues in which Amy wrestles his gun from him and holds him at gunpoint. Reese stumbles upon the scene, and a standoff occurs. Solomon leaps at Amy, and she discharges the gun in his abdomen.\n\nAt the Hitchcock Awards ceremony, Trevor attends to accept the award on his brother's behalf. As he goes onstage, a sniper appears in the rafters, only to be shot by Reese. The altercation is revealed to be a scene in Amy's new film, \"Urban Legends\", on which Toby and Graham are working on her behalf. \n\nLater, Solomon, now wheelchair-bound, is in a mental institution where, after watching Amy's film, a nurse asks him if he enjoyed the movie. He is wheeled out by the nurseBrenda Bates, from the original filmwho tells him that they have a lot in common.\n\nThe screenplay for \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" was written by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson. Ottman sought a \"wacky\" tone for the film that was more tongue-in-cheek than that of its predecessor. \n\nAnson Mount originally auditioned for the dual role of Travis / Trevor Stark, but had wanted to play the role of the antagonistic Toby instead; according to Ottman, he \"aced\" his audition for Toby, and was cast in the role. Matthew Davis auditioned for the role of Travis / Trevor, and was cast, marking his first major film role. Eva Mendes was cast in the role of Vanessa, which had originally been a smaller role, but was expanded to allow her character to be a potential red herring.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada over a period of 47 days in the fall of 1999. The film's opening sequence on the airplane, which was shot over a period of three days, was originally written to have occurred on a boat; however, the script was altered last-minute after the production crew came across an airplane set from the film \"Pushing Tin\" (1999). Due to the film's low budget, director Ottman chose to make use of the set, and staged the sequence on a plane instead.\n\nThe university exteriors featured in the film is Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, which Ottman chose due to its \"modern\" and institutional architecture as opposed to Gothic. The bell tower, however, was constructed solely for the film, for $150,000. Interior sequences, however, were filmed in Toronto. The amusement park Ontario Place served as the filming location for the mining amusement ride sequence; the mine ride featured in the film was in fact a log ride that had been drained of its water for the impending winter months, which was re-dressed to appear as a mine-themed ride. Ottman stated that many of the lighting techniques featured in the filmparticularly the use of strobe lightingwere inspired by Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" (1979) and James Cameron's \"Aliens\" (1986).\n\nThe sequence featuring Lisa and Trevor at the bar (followed by her death scene) was written and shot in Los Angeles after principal photography had finished, as the film's producers felt the film needed a death sequence earlier on to establish a sense of danger. Originally, the production crew intended to make a fake kidney for the sequence (as the character awakens to find her kidney has been removed), but due to budget and time restraints, opted to use a goat's kidney from a butcher shop. Because a goat kidney is anatomically larger than that of a human, it had to be truncated to reduce its size.\n\nDirector Ottman also edited the film, and remarked in the audio commentary on the film's 2001 DVD release that many character interaction sequences were truncated or excised entirely to maintain a quicker pace.\n\nWith the plot centered on a group of film school students, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" uses a self-reflexive narrative approach and features numerous references and allusions to cinema and other horror films. The opening sequence on the airplane was inspired by the \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" (1963). Lisa's abduction sequence in which she is incapacitated with a plastic garment bag in a coat closet is an homage to \"Black Christmas\" (1974).\n\nFilm scholar Jim Harper, in his book \"Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies\" (2004), cites \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" as a \"post \"Scream\" slasher\" influenced by Italian \"giallo\" films, featuring a \"distinct Argento influence\" present in the film, particularly in its killer's attire. Harper also notes direct references in the film to the work of Alfred Hitchcock as well as Michael Powell's \"Peeping Tom\" (1960), which is paid homage in Sandra's filmed murder scene.\n\nThe following urban legends are mentioned or depicted in the film:\n\nThe film brought in $21,468,807 in the United States and brought in $17,105,555 overseas, bringing its total box office revenue to $38,574,362. The film was considered a moderate success, due to the budget of the film being $14,000,000. However, the film only grossed about half of what the first film brought in ($72,000,000).\n\nDave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" wrote of the film: \"[Director] Ottman doesn't have the firm grasp of tone necessary to make his deliberate ambiguities seem other than simple confusion, nor the sense of humor necessary to turn the deliberate cliches into effective satire. \" Robert Koehler of \"Variety\" criticized the film's screenplay for being \"[too] stuffed with movie references and jokes,\" and that it \"slavishly follows in lock-step with the prior film's \"Ten Little Indians\"-like plot line.\" Writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", David Chute wrote: \"The coolest single element in the walk-don't-run horror sequel \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" may be its atmospheric setting...[the] concept seems tailor-made for that kind of ingenuity, for a little bit of sly wit and playfulness. Movies like \"Final Cut\" are bunker-mentality productions, safe, square and purely functional, like buildings made from poured concrete.\"\n\nRoger Ebert awarded it 2 stars out of 4, declaring that the movie \"makes the fatal mistake...of believing there is still life in the wheezy serial-killer-on-campus formula,\" although he did concede that the production credits were \"slick\" and the performances \"quite adequate given the (narrow) opportunities of the genre.\" Michael Thomson of The BBC echoed this in a review by Michael Thomson, who thought that the meta in-jokes of the murder scenes did not work and that the film \"keeps the mediocrity [of the first film] alive as it unleashes yet more unsavoury nonsense.\" \"The A.V. Club\"s Nathan Rabin echoed similar sentiments, writing: \"A sequel with the misguided chutzpah to rip off its derivative predecessor, \"Final Cut\" proves once again that the self-referential slasher film is every bit as tiresome and devoid of new ideas as the unironic bloodbaths that inspired it in the first place.\"\n\nThe meta-critic site Rotten Tomatoes lists the film as having an approval rating of 9% among critics based on 80 reviews, with 7 fresh and 73 rotten reviews, giving it an average rating of 3/10. The site's consensus is: \"This teen horror movie brings nothing new to an already exhausted genre. And it's bad. Really bad\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" was released on DVD by Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment on February 16, 2001. In July 2018, it was announced that Scream Factory will be releasing the film on Blu-ray, with a scheduled release date of November 20, 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "837147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=837147", "title": "V2 word order", "text": "V2 word order\n\nIn syntax, verb-second (V2) word order places the finite verb of a clause or sentence in second position with a single major constituent preceding it, which functions as the clause topic.\n\nV2 word order is common in the Germanic languages and is also found in Indo-Aryan Kashmiri, Northeast Caucasian Ingush, Uto-Aztecan O'odham, and fragmentarily in Rhaeto-Romansh Sursilvan. Of the Germanic family, English is exceptional in having predominantly SVO order instead of V2, although there are vestiges of the V2 phenomenon.\n\nMost Germanic languages do not normally use V2 order in embedded clauses, with a few exceptions. In particular, German, Dutch, and Afrikaans revert to VF (verb final) word order after a complementizer; Yiddish and Icelandic do, though, allow V2 in all declarative clauses: main, embedded, and subordinate. Kashmiri has V2 in 'declarative content clauses' but VF order in relative clauses.\n\nThe following examples from German illustrate the V2 principle:\n\n(The asterisk * indicates that the example is grammatically unacceptable.) Sentences a–d have the finite verb \"spielten\" in second position, with varying major constituents in first position. Sentences e and f sentences are unacceptable because the finite verb no longer appears in second position. V2 word order allows any major constituent to occupy the first position as long as the second position is occupied by the finite verb.\n\nThe V2 principle regulates the position of finite verbs only; its influence on non-finite verbs (infinitives, participles, etc.) is indirect. Non-finite verbs in V2 languages appear in varying positions depending on the language. In German and Dutch, for instance, non-finite verbs appear after the object (if one is present) in clause final position in main clauses (OV order). Swedish and Icelandic, in contrast, position non-finite verbs after the finite verb but before the object (if one is present) (VO order). That is, V2 operates only on the finite verb.\n\nGermanic languages vary in the application of V2 order in embedded clauses. They fall into three groups.\n\nIn these languages, the word order of clauses is generally fixed in two patterns of conventionally numbered positions. Both end with positions for (5) non-finite verb forms, (6) objects (7), adverbials. \nIn main clauses, the V2 constraint holds. The finite verb must be in position (2) and sentence adverbs in position (4). The latter include words with meanings such as 'not' and 'always'. The subject may be position (1), but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject is in position (3). \nIn embedded clauses, the V2 constraint is absent. After the conjunction, the subject must immediately follow; it cannot be replaced by a topical expression. Thus, the first four positions are in the fixed order (1) conjunction, (2) subject, (3) sentence adverb, (4) finite verb\n\nThe position of the sentence adverbs is important to those theorists who see them as marking the start of a large constituent within the clause. Thus the finite verb is seen as inside that constituent in embedded clauses, but outside that constituent in V2 main clauses.\n\nSwedish\nDanish\nSo-called Perkerdansk is an example of a variety that does not follow the above.\n\nNorwegian \nFaroese\nUnlike continental Scandinavian languages, the sentence adverb may either precede or follow the finite verb in embedded clauses. A (3a) slot is inserted here for the following sentence adverb alternative.\n\nIn these languages there is a strong tendency to place some or all of the verb forms in final position.\n\nIn main clauses, the V2 constraint holds. As with other Germanic languages, the finite verb must be in the second position. However, any non-finite forms must be in final position. The subject may be in the first position, but when a topical expression occupies the position, the subject follows the finite verb.\n\nIn embedded clauses, the V2 constraint does not hold. The finite verb form must be adjacent to any non-finite at the end of the clause, with different word-order in different languages.\n\nGerman grammarians traditionally divide sentences into fields. Subordinate clauses preceding the main clause are said to be in the first field (Vorfeld), clauses following the main clause in the final field (Nachfeld). \nThe central field (Mittelfeld ) contains most or all of a clause, and is bounded by left bracket (Linke Satzklammer) and right bracket (Rechte Satzklammer) positions.\n\nIn main clauses, the initial element (subject or topical expression) is said to be located in the first field, the V2 finite verb form in the left bracket, and any non-finite verb forms in the right bracket.In embedded clauses, the conjunction is said to be located in the left bracket, and the verb forms in the right bracket. In German embedded clauses, a finite verb form follows any non-finite forms.\n\nGerman\nDutch\nThis analysis suggests a close parallel between the V2 finite form in main clauses and the conjunctions in embedded clauses. Each is seen as an introduction to its clause-type, a function which some modern scholars have equated with the notion of specifier. The analysis is supported in spoken Dutch by the placement of clitic pronoun subjects. Forms such as ie cannot stand alone, unlike the full-form equivalent hij. The words to which they may be attached are those same introduction words: the V2 form in a main clause, or the conjunction in an embedded clause. \nEquivalent rules also exist in vernacular German, for example regarding the reduced pronunciation of \"du\" (\"you\"). Hence, this pronoun may be pronounced or following verbs and conjunctions, but not otherwise.\n\nDutch differs from German in its word order in subordinate clauses. In Dutch subordinate clauses two word orders are possible for the verb clusters and are referred to as the \"red\": \"omdat ik heb gewerkt\", \"because I have worked\": like in English, where the auxiliary verb precedes the past particle, and the \"green\": \"omdat ik gewerkt heb,\" where the past particle precedes the auxiliary verb, \"because I worked have\": like in German. In Dutch, the green word order is the most used in speech, and the red is the most used in writing, particularly in journalistic texts, but the green is also used in writing as is the red in speech. Unlike in English however adjectives and adverbs must precede the verb: <nowiki>\"dat het boek groen is\"</nowiki>, \"that the book green is\".\n\nThese languages freely allow V2 order in embedded clauses. \n\nIcelandic\nTwo word-order patterns are largely similar to continental Scandinavian. However, in main clauses an extra slot is needed for when the front position is occupied by Það. In these clauses the subject follows any sentence adverbs. In embedded clauses, sentence adverbs follow the finite verb (an optional order in Faroese).\nIn more radical contrast with other Germanic languages, a third pattern exists for embedded clauses with the conjunction followed by the V2 order: front-finite verb-subject.\n\nYiddish\nUnlike Standard German, Yiddish normally has verb forms before Objects (SVO order), and in embedded clauses has conjunction followed by V2 order.\n\nOne type of embedded clause with V2 following the conjunction is found throughout the Germanic languages, although it is more common in some than it is others. These are termed root clauses. They are declarative content clauses, the direct objects of so-called bridge verbs, which are understood to quote a statement. For that reason, they exhibit the V2 word order of the equivalent direct quotation.\n\nDanish\nItems other than the subject are allowed to appear in front position.\nSwedish\nItems other than the subject are occasionally allowed to appear in front position. Generally, the statement must be one with which the speaker agrees.\nThis order is not possible with a statement with which the speaker does not agree.\nNorwegian\nGerman\nRoot clause V2 order is possible only when the conjunction dass is omitted.\nCompare the normal embed-clause order after dass\n\nModern English differs greatly in word order from other modern Germanic languages, but earlier English shared many similarities. Some scholars therefore propose a description of Old English with V2 constraint as the norm. The history of English syntax is thus seen as a process of losing the constraint.\n\nIn these examples, finite verb forms are in bold, non-finite verb forms are in \"italics\" and subjects are underlined.\n\nSubject first\nQuestion word first\nTopic phrase first\nþa first\nNegative word first\nObject first\n\nIn examples b, c and d, the object of the clause precedes a non-finite verb form. Superficially, the structure is verb-subject-object- verb. To capture generalities, scholars of syntax and linguistic typology treat them as basically subject-object-verb (SOV) structure, modified by the V2 constraint. Thus Old English is classified, to some extent, as an SOV language. However, example a represents a number of Old English clauses with object following a non-finite verb form, with the superficial structure verb-subject-verb object. A more substantial number of clauses contain a single finite verb form followed by an object, superficially verb-subject-object. Again, a generalisation is captured by describing these as subject–verb–object (SVO) modified by V2. Thus Old English can be described as intermediate between SOV languages (like German and Dutch) and SVO languages (like Swedish and Icelandic).\n\nWhen the subject of a clause was a personal pronoun, V2 did not always operate.\nHowever, V2 verb-subject inversion occurred without exception after a question word or the negative ne, and with few exceptions after þa even with pronominal subjects.\nInversion of a subject pronoun also occurred regularly after a direct quotation.\n\nEmbedded clauses with pronoun subjects were not subject to V2. Even with noun subjects, V2 inversion did not occur.\n\nIn a similar clause pattern, the finite verb form of a yes-no question occupied the first position\n\nEarly Middle English generally preserved V2 structure in clauses with nominal subjects.\n\nTopic phrase first\nNu first\n\nAs in Old English, V2 inversion did not apply to clauses with pronoun subjects.\n\nTopic phrase first\nObject first\n\nLate Middle English texts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show increasing incidence of clauses without the inversion associated with V2.\n\nTopic adverb first\nTopic phrase first\nNegative clauses were no longer formed with ne (or na) as the first element. Inversion in negative clauses was attributable to other causes.\n\nWh- question word first\nThere first\nObject first\n\nAs in earlier periods, Modern English normally has subject-verb order in declarative clauses and inverted verb-subject order in interrogative clauses. However these norms are observed irrespective of the number of clause elements preceding the verb. Moreover, it is not useful to characterize the verb form which undergoes inversion as 'the finite verb'.\n\nInversion in Old English sentences with a combination of two verbs could be described in terms of their finite and non-finite forms. The word which participated in inversion was the finite verb; the verb which retained its position relative to the Object was the non-finite verb. In most types of Modern English clause, there are two verb forms, but the verbs are considered to belong to different syntactic classes. The verbs which participated in inversion have evolved to form a class of auxiliary verbs which may mark tense, aspect and mood; the remaining majority of verbs with full semantic value are said to constitute the class of lexical verbs. The exceptional type of clause is that of declarative clause with a lexical verb in a Present simple or Past simple form.\n\nInterrogative Wh- questions (like Yes/No questions) are regularly formed with inversion of subject and auxiliary. Present Simple and Present Past questions are formed with the auxiliary do, a process known as do-support. \n\nIn certain patterns similar to Old and Middle English, inversion is possible. However, this is a matter of stylistic choice, unlike the constraint on interrogative clauses.\n\nnegative or restrictive adverbial first \ncomparative adverb or adjective first\nAfter the preceding classes of adverbial, only auxiliary verbs, not lexical verbs, participate in inversion\n\nlocative or temporal adverb first\nprepositional phrase first \n\nAfter the two latter types of adverbial, only one-word lexical verb forms (Present Simple or Past Simple), not auxiliary verbs, participate in inversion, and only with noun-phrase subjects, not pronominal subjects.\n\nWhen the object of a verb is a verbatim quotation, it may precede the verb, with a result similar to Old English V2. Such clauses are found in storytelling and in news reports.\n\nCorresponding to the above examples, the following clauses show the normal Modern English subject-verb order.\n\nDeclarative equivalents\nEquivalents without topic fronting\n\nModern French is a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language like other Romance languages (though Latin was a Subject-Object-Verb language). However, V2 constructions existed in Old French and were more common than in other early Romance language texts. It has been suggested that this may be due to influence from the Germanic Frankish language. Modern French has vestiges of the V2 system similar to those found in modern English. \n\nThe following sentences have been identified as possible examples of V2 syntax in Old French:\n\nAs was first noted in 1914 by Jules Bloch, V2 word order occurs outside of Germanic, in the Indo-Aryan language Kashmiri. Declarative main clauses as well as embedded object clauses in Kashmiri have V2 word order, but relative clauses have SOV order, e.g.\n\n\nKashmiri differs from the V2 languages of Europe in that in all clause types Kashmiri exhibits the characteristics of SOV languages. It has postpositions (not prepositions), objects before the main verb (not after - unless the main verb itself is in position 2), and auxiliaries after main verbs (unless the auxiliary itself is in position 2) [example from 'saaykal' by Ratan Lal Shant]:\n\nThe postposition \"manzi\" 'from inside' follows its object \"Tayri\". The direct object \"Tyuub\" precedes its verb \"keD-\" 'take out'. The compound verb auxiliary \"tshun-\" THROW follows the main verb \"keD-\".\n\nIn his 1976 three-volume study of two Indo-Aryan languages of Himachal Pradesh, Hendriksen reports on two intermediate cases: Kotgarhi and Kochi. Although neither language shows a regular V-2 pattern, they have evolved to the point that main and subordinate clauses differ in word order and auxiliaries may separate from other parts of the verb:\nHendriksen reports that relative clauses in Kochi show a greater tendency to have the finite verbal element in clause-final position than matrix clauses do (III:188).\n\nIn Ingush, \"for main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the clause.\" \n\nO'odham has relatively free word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean \"the boy brands the pig\":\n\n\nDespite the general freedom of sentence word order, O'odham is fairly strictly verb-second in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the above sentences, it is \"ʼo\"; in the following it is \"ʼañ\"):\n\n\nAmong dialects of the Romansh, V2 word order is limited to Sursilvan, the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles occurs, as in 'Cun Mariano Tschuor ha Augustin Beeli \"discurriu\" ' ('Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli'), as compared to Engadinese 'Cun Rudolf Gasser ha \"discurrü\" Gion Peider Mischol' ('Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol'.)\n\nThe constituent that is bounded by the auxiliary, \"ha\", and the participle, \"discurriu\", is known as a Satzklammer or 'verbal bracket'.\n\nDependency grammar (DG) can accommodate the V2 phenomenon simply by stipulating that one and only one constituent can be a predependent of the finite verb (i.e. a dependent which precedes its head) in declarative (matrix) clauses (in this, Dependency Grammar assumes only one clausal level and one position of the verb, instead of a distinction between a VP-internal and a higher clausal position of the verb as in Generative Grammar, cf. the next section). On this account, the V2 principle is violated if the finite verb has more than one predependent or no predependent at all. The following DG structures of the first four German sentences above illustrate the analysis (the sentence means 'The kids play soccer in the park before school'):\n\nThe finite verb \"spielen\" is the root of all clause structure. The V2 principle requires that this root have a single predependent, which it does in each of the four sentences.\n\nThe four English sentences above involving the V2 phenomenon receive the following analyses:\n\nIn the theory of Generative Grammar, the verb second phenomenon has been described as an application of X-bar theory. The combination of a first position for a phrase and a second position for a single verb has been identified as the combination of \"specifier\" and \"head\" of a phrase. The part after the finite verb is then the \"complement\". While the sentence structure of English is usually analysed in terms of three levels, CP, IP, and VP, in German linguistics the consensus has emerged that there is no IP in German.\n\nThe VP (verb phrase) structure assigns position and functions to the arguments of the verb. Hence, this structure is shaped by the grammatical properties of the V (verb) which heads the structure. \nThe CP (complementizer phrase) structure incorporates the grammatical information which identifies the clause as declarative or interrogative, main or embedded. The structure is shaped by the abstract C (complementiser) which is considered the head of the structure. In embedded clauses the C position accommodates subordinating conjunctions. In German declarative main clauses, C hosts the finite verb.\nThus the V2 structure is analysed as \n\nIn embedded clauses, the C position is occupied by a conjunction.In most Germanic languages (but not in Icelandic or Yiddish), this generally prevents the finite verb from moving to C. \n\nThis analysis does not provide a structure for the instances in some language of root clauses after bridge verbs. \nThe solution is to allow verbs such as ved to accept a clause with a second (recursive) CP.\n\n\n"}
