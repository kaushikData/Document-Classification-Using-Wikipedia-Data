Built for the University of London, it has been used by various institutions in the course of its history, including the Civil Service Commission, the British Museum and, currently, the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nThe Italianate building was designed by Sir James Pennethorne between 1867 and 1870 as headquarters for the University of London. It occupied the northernmost section of the former garden of Burlington House. It was a grand building, but not especially large. The University of London is a federal university and this early central building contained little besides examination halls and a few offices; the premises of several of the constituent colleges were larger. The university vacated Burlington Gardens in 1900 for the Imperial Institute building in South Kensington. Briefly the headquarters of the National Antarctic Expedition, in 1902 it was given to the Civil Service Commission.\n\nIn 1970, this was the site of the Department of Ethnography of the British Museum, which housed its collections from the Americas, Africa, the Pacific and Australia, as well as tribal Asia and Europe, because of lack of space in the Museum's main building in Bloomsbury. Between 1970 and 1997, the building, as the Museum of Mankind, hosted around 75 exhibitions, including many famous ones such as \"Nomad and City\", 1976, and \"Living Arctic\", 1987. It was created by Keeper of Ethnography Adrian Digby in the 1960s, and opened by his successor William Fagg. Fagg was succeeded by Malcolm Mcleod in 1974, and by John Mack in 1990. The museum ceased exhibiting at Burlington Gardens in 1997 and the Department of Ethnography moved back to the British Museum in Bloomsbury in 2004.\n\nAfter the ethnography collection’s return to Bloomsbury the building was purchased by the Royal Academy. In 1998 an architectural competition was held to connect it with Burlington House, which was won by Michael Hopkins & Partners. This was abandoned as the Heritage Lottery Fund was not persuaded that there was sufficient need for the project, which would have cost £80 million.\n\nIn about 2005 the building was brought back into use by the Royal Academy, the tenant of the original wing of Burlington House and the wing which lies between the two buildings. It was used mainly by the Royal Academy Schools. On 29 August 2006, the building was damaged by a fire, but there was no loss of Academy artworks as it was being prepared for a future exhibition.\n\nIn 2006 Colin St John Wilson drew up a masterplan for the whole complex, which included a more modest link between the buildings than that proposed by Hopkins. However, Wilson died the following year, which led to another competition being held in 2008, won by David Chipperfield Architects. In order to raise capital for Chipperfield’s design, the building was lent to the commercial gallery Haunch of Venison, which occupied the site from 2009 to 2011 while their existing building was being renovated. In 2012 space in the building was lent to the Pace Gallery, which will occupy it on a 15-year lease. A second application to the HLF for £12.7m to go towards a £36 million project, was successful in 2013. This will include a sculpture court in the bridge between the buildings, a lecture hall where that of the University of London originally stood and a permanent home for Giampietrino’s full-size copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s \"Last Supper\". The redevelopment was completed in 2018, in time for the Academy’s 250th anniversary in 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23998233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23998233", "title": "BBC Archives", "text": "BBC Archives\n\nBBC Information and Archives (sometimes known just as BBC Archives) are collections documenting the BBC's broadcasting history, including copies of television and radio broadcasts, internal documents, photographs, online content, sheet music, commercially available music, press cuttings and historic equipment. The original copies of these collections are permanently retained but are now in the process of being digitised, estimated to take until approximately 2015. Some collections are now being uploaded onto the BBC Archives website on BBC Online for viewers to see. The archive is one of the largest broadcast archives in the world with over 12 million items.\n\nThe BBC Archives encompass numerous different archives containing different materials produced or acquired by the BBC. The earliest material dates back to 1890 and now consists of 1 million hours of playable material, in addition to documents, photographs and equipment. The archives contain 12 million items on 66 miles of shelving spread over several sites. The stock is managed using a bar code system, which help to locate material on the shelves and also track material that has been lent out. The BBC says that the budget for managing, protecting and digitising the archive accounts for only a small part of the BBC's overall spend.\n\nThe BBC is engaging in an ongoing project to digitise archived programme material, converting recordings made on older analogue formats such as audio tape, videotape and film to electronic formats which are compatible with modern computer systems. Much of the audio-visual material was originally recorded on formats which are now obsolete and incompatible with modern broadcast equipment due to the fact that the machines used to reproduce many formats are no longer being manufactured. Additionally, some film and audio formats are slowly disintegrating, and digitisation also serves as a digital preservation programme. As of summer 2010 BBC Archive staff have spent approximately ten years digitising half of the media content and due to improving work practices expect to complete the other half in five years. Current estimates suggest the digitised archive would comprise approximately 52 petabytes of information, with one programme minute of video requiring 1.4 gigabytes of storage. The BBC uses the Material Exchange Format (MXF) which is an uncompressed, non-proprietary format which the BBC has been publicising to mitigate the threat of the format becoming obsolete (as digital formats can and do).\n\nThe Archive digitisation a key part of the BBC's programme to engineer a fully digital and tapeless production workflow across the entire Corporation. It was closely tied in with the ill-fated Digital Media Initiative (DMI), a scheme which ran from 2008 to 2013 and attempted to create a unified online archive search and programme production system. After spiralling development costs and project delays, the problems with DMI came to public attention during coverage of the death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, when it was reported that the lack of digital ingest facilities provided for BBC News staff meant that tapes had to be sent by taxi from the Perivale centre to be digitised by independent companies in central London. DMI was cancelled in 2013.\n\nThe BBC Archive website was relaunched online in 2008 and has provided newly released historical material regularly since then. The BBC works in partnership with the British Film Institute (BFI), The National Archives and other partners in working with and using the materials. A related project called \"Genome\" is expected to complete in 2011 and will make programme listings dating back to 1923, sourced from \"The Radio Times\", available to search online.\n\nIn July 2008, Roly Keating was appointed Director of Archive Content, with responsibility for increasing public access to the BBC’s archives. In October 2008, Keating appointed Tony Ageh Controller of Archive Development with \"specific responsibility for developing ways of making the archive easily understandable and accessible to users\".\n\nIn 2012, BBC Archive Development produced a book - primarily aimed as BBC staff - titled 'BBC Archive Collections: What's In The Archive And How To Use Them'. This book describes the BBC's archive collections and offers guidance around on how items from the collections can be reused online. The book's references to 'Fabric', a system due to be delivered by the Digital Media Initiative are no longer accurate as the project was cancelled.\n\nFrom 1963 to 2010, the majority of television material of nationally networked programmes in the BBC Archive were housed at the Archive centre in Windmill Road, Brentford, in west London. Television programmes were also stored by the Open University in Milton Keynes, and by BBC NATIONAL and REGIONAL libraries around the country. In the late 1990s, and early in the 2000s material from the radio side of the BBC were also stored on the site. The condition of the three Windmill Road buildings deteriorated over the years and suffered occasional flooding incidents, and eventually the Archive was relocated to a new centre at Perivale Park, Perivale, three miles north of the old site. The new BBC Archive Centre was opened in Summer 2010 and all material was successfully moved by March 2011. The cost of the refurbishment and of the move was approximately £16.6 million.\n\nMaterial is stored in thirteen vaults, controlled to match the best climate for the material inside them, and named after a different BBC personality depending on the content contained in them. In addition to the vaults, new editing and workrooms have been added so that the material can easily be transferred between formats as well as viewed and restored. The building has also been fitted with fire suppression systems to protect the archive in the event of an incident at the centre, so the total loss of the archive is avoided.\n\nAs of 4 April 2017, 160 employees work there covering 7 days a week.\n\nThe BBC Television Archive contains over 600,000 hours of television broadcast material located on 600,000/650,000 film reels and 2.4/2.7 million videotapes. The archive itself holds extensive material from approximately the mid-1970s onwards, when important recordings at the broadcaster were retained for the future.\n\nRecordings from before this date are less comprehensively preserved; the process of telerecording was originally invented in 1947 while videotape recording was gradually introduced from the late 1950s onwards, but due to the expense of the tapes, recording was seen for production use only with recordings subsequently being wiped. or telerecordings being junked. The exceptions in the early years were usually occasions of great importance, such as the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In addition, numerous programmes at the time were broadcast 'live' and so utilised no recording procedure in the production process. The earliest item in the collection is from 1936.\n\nIn 2013 there were 340,000 D3 Tapes but the hardware they have could only transfer up to 130,000 D3 tapes. The BBC has had to be very selective of what they are transferring.\n\nBefore anything is put into the archive a team of Digitisation Operators watch and listen to programs looking for problems with the tapes or transfers. \n\nToday, the majority of programmes are kept, including news, entertainment, drama and a selection of other long-running programmes such as quiz shows. The remaining material from the television archive is offered to the British Film Institute prior to being disposed of.\n\nAs of 5 April 2017 there are around 850,000 tapes in the videotape vault.\n\nThe BBC Sound Archive contains the archived output from the BBC's radio output. Widespread recordings exist in the archive from the mid-1930s, when recording of programmes and speeches were kept for rebroadcast; the catalyst for this was the launch of the BBC Empire Service in 1932 and the subsequent rebroadcast of speeches from political leaders at a time convenient in the different time zones. Prior to this, the broadcast of recordings was seen as being false to the listener and was avoided. Any recordings made were frequently disposed of and it was the efforts of Marie Slocombe, who founded the Sound Archive in 1937 when she retained recordings of prominent figures in the country, that the archive became into being officially when she was appointed the Sounds Recording Librarian in 1941. Today, all of the BBC's radio output is recorded for re-use, with approximately 66% of output being preserved in the Archives; programmes involving guests or live performances from artists are kept whereas programmes in which the DJ plays commercially available music are only sampled and not kept entirely. Prior to any material being disposed of, the material is offered to the British Library Sound Archive.\n\nThe archive consists of a number of different formats including 200 wax cylinders, numerous gramophone records made from both shellac and vinyl as well as numerous more recordings on tape, CD and on digital audio tape (DAT). The difficulty of these different formats is the availability of the machines required to play them; some of the vinyl records in the archive are 16 inches in size and require large phonograph units to play, while the players for the wax cylinders and DATs are no longer in production. There are 700,00 vinyl records, 180,000 78's records, 400,000 LP record and 350,000 Cd's in the archive.\n\nThe oldest item is a wax cylinder containing a recording made by Florence Nightingale, recorded on 30 July 1890. Another unique item is the gramophone record from Queen Mary's doll house, which is approximately an inch in size and had the national anthem on it.\n\nThe Sound Archive is based at the new BBC Archive Centre in Perivale, along with the television archive, and was previously based at Windmill Road, Brentford.\n\nThe BBC Written Archive contains all the internal written documents and communications from the corporation from the launch in 1922 to the present day. Its collections shed light into the behind the scenes workings of the corporation and also elaborate on the difficulties of getting a television or radio programme to or off the air as the case may be. The archive guidelines state that access to files post-1980 is restricted due to the current nature of the files; the general exception to this rule are documents such as scripts and Programme as Broadcast records.\n\nThe Written Archives are located at the BBC Written Archive Centre in Caversham, Berkshire, near Reading. The centre houses the archive on four and a half miles of shelving along with reading rooms. The centre is different from the other BBC Archives in that the centre opens for writers and academic researchers in higher education.\n\nThe BBC Photographic Library is responsible for approximately 10 million images, dating back to 1922, created for publicity purposes and subsequently kept for future use. In addition to programme promotion, a large number of images are of historic events which are often incorporate into the daily news bulletins; as a result, half the photographic library team work specifically with these images. The images themselves are kept as originals in the archive, with digitisation only utilised when a specific image is required for use, when the image is sent in a digital format. Copies of images are also used in case any images are damaged, notable due to vinegar syndrome. The BBC \n\nThe most popular images from the Archive include Colin Firth in \"Pride and Prejudice\", Michael Parkinson interviewing Muhammad Ali, Martin Bashir interviewing Diana, Princess of Wales and a picture of Delia Derbyshire at work in the Radiophonic workshop at the BBC.\n\nThe BBC Heritage Collection is the newest of the BBC Archives and holds a variety of historic broadcast technology, art, props and merchandise. The collection was created out of personal collections and bequeaths by former staff members, as the BBC had no formal policy on the heritage collection until c.2003.\n\nThe collection includes, amongst other items, the BBC One Noddy Globe and clock, a BBC-Marconi Type A microphone, an early crystal radio made by the British Broadcasting Company, a Marconi/EMI camera used in the early BBC Television experiments, a BBC Micro computer and a selection of items used to create Foley. In addition to all the broadcast technology, art is also kept, namely the portraits of all the BBC Director Generals, as well as props including an original TARDIS from \"Doctor Who\" and the children's television puppet Gordon the Gopher.\n\nThe heritage collection itself has no one permanent home, as the majority of objects are on display, either around BBC properties or on loan to museums or other collections; the most notable museum housing the collection is the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the BBC launched the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public appeal to recover pre-1980s lost BBC radio and television productions. Original material, featuring several popular programmes were lost due to the practice of wiping, because of copyright issues and for technological reasons.\n\nThe resolution of this appeal was that over one hundred productions were recovered including \"The Men from the Ministry\", \"Something To Shout About\", \"Man and Superman\", \"The Doctor's Dilemma\", \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", \"Hancock's Half Hour\", \"I'm Sorry, I Haven't A Clue\" and \"The Ronnie Corbett Thing\" in addition to recording sessions with Elton John, Ringo Starr and Paul Simon. Also, the Peter Sellers Estate Collection donated numerous recordings featuring Peter Sellers.\n\nThe BBC together with the British Film Institute, the Open University, Channel 4 and Teachers' TV formed a collaboration, named the Creative Archive Licence Group, to create a copyright licence for the re-release of archived material.\n\nThe Licence was a trial, launched in 2005, and notable for the re-release of part of the BBC News' archive and programmes made by the BBC Natural History Unit for creative use by the public. While artists and teachers were encouraged to use the content to create works of their own, the terms of the licence were restrictive compared to copyleft licences. Use of Creative Archive content for commercial, \"endorsement, campaigning, defamatory or derogatory purposes\" was forbidden, any derivative works were to be released under the same licence, and content was only to be used within the UK. The trial ended in 2006 following a review by the BBC Trust and works released under the licence were withdrawn.\n\nVoices from the Archives was a former BBC project, launched in partnership with BBC Four that provided free access to audio interviews with various notable people and professions from a variety of political, religious and social backgrounds. The website ceased to be updated in June 2005, and the concept was instead adopted by BBC Radio 4 as a collection of film interviews from various programmes.\n\nOver the years, the BBC has used various programme catalogue databases to keep a record of the programmes in the archives. Internal databases include Infax and Fabric, and publicly accessible databases include BBC Genome and BBC Programmes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1673458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1673458", "title": "Banglapedia", "text": "Banglapedia\n\nBanglapedia: the\" \"National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh is the first Bangladeshi encyclopedia. It is available in print, CD-ROM format and online, in both Bengali and English. The print version comprises ten 500-page volumes. The first edition was published in January 2003 by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, with a plan to update it every two years. The second edition was issued in 2012.\n\n\"Banglapedia\" was not designed as a general encyclopedia but as a specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh-related topics. For the encyclopedia's purposes, Bangladesh is defined as the territory comprising ancient Eastern India, Suba Bangla, Shahi Bangalah, Mughal Suba Bangla, Bengal Presidency, Bengal Province, East Bengal, East Pakistan, and the independent Bangladesh, in historical succession.\n\nThe encyclopedia's chief editor is Sirajul Islam. Over 1200 writers and specialists in Bangladesh and abroad helped create the entries. \"Banglapedia\" has over 5,700 entries in six editorial categories, each of which is overseen by an expert editor, as well as over 2,000 single and four-colour illustrations and 2,100 cross-references.\n\nThe project was funded by the Bangladeshi government, private sector organizations, academic institutes and UNESCO. Though its original budget was 800,000 taka (roughly 10,000 USD), the Asiatic Society eventually spent 80 million taka (roughly 1 million USD) on the project. Despite controversies over entries on the Bangladesh Liberation War and indigenous people, both the Bengali and English versions became popular upon publication.\n\nThe \"Banglapedia\" project originated when the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh was working on a three-volume study titled \"History of Bangladesh, 1704-1971\" in 1991. The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference, as that project progressed laboriously, culling facts from various libraries. The idea finally led to a concept paper prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994. The \"Banglapedia\" project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997, and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor. As the head of the Project Implementation Committee, his task was to plan and manage the project funding. In 1996, some three dozen committees were formed with three to four people in each committee to recommend the entries. Twenty-seven thousand entries were proposed, requiring a 20 volume compendium. Because of financial constraints, the number of entries was cut down to around 6,000. The project officially took off in 1998.\n\nWhen the project began, the Society had only eight hundred thousand taka in its coffers for the project. \"Banglapedia\" raised further contributions from universities, banks, multinational companies, international organisations and even private individuals. A pool of agencies, including UNESCO, the University Grants Commission, universities, financial institutions and NGOs initially financed the project, which was completed at a cost of taka 80 million. Education Ministry funded about 74% of the cost, while 26% of the fund came mostly from universities and banks. Before direct sales started on 3 January 2003, 4,000 copies of the English version and all but 250 copies of the Bengali version were sold in advance out of the initial print of 5,000 copies for each versions. For an additional run of 10,000 prints people waited in queues outside the Asiatic Society office on the day of the release, and sales continued until 9:30 in the evening. A total of 4,500 sets of the Bengali version and 2,500 of the English version were sold on the day of release.\n\nThe first attempt to compile a Bengali encyclopedia was undertaken by Felix Carey (1786–1822), who was the son of Reverend William Carey (1761–1834) of Serampore and the first lexicographer of the Burmese language. In 1819, he began the translation of the fifth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, naming it \"Vidyarthabali\". From October 1819 till November 1820 the book was printed by Felix Carey every month in 48-page installments. Thus completed, the first part of \"Vidyarthabali\" was compiled into the 638-page \"Vyabachchedvidya\", the first book on anatomy and surgery in Bengali. Work on the second part, \"Smritishastra\", which was largely on jurisprudence, then began. But, Carey died after only two 40-page installments were printed in February and March 1821.\n\nIt was followed by Maharaja Kalikirshna Dev Bahadur's (1808–1974) \"Sankshipta Sadvidyabali\" (1833), a concise encyclopedia. Then came Raja Radhakanta Deb's \"Sabdakalpadrum\" (1822–1858), a Sanskrit encyclopedic dictionary in eight parts. Next was Rajkrishna Ray (1849–1894) and Saratchandra Dev's (1858-unknown) joint work \"Bharatkosh\", the first Bengali encyclopedia laid-out in alphabetical order (1880–1892) published in three volumes. Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee's (1813–1885) adaptation of \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", \"Vidyakalpadruma\" or \"Encyclopædia Bengalensis\" (1846–51), and the 22-volume \"Bangla Visvakosh\" (1886–1911), edited by Nagendranath Basu (1866–1938) with contributions from many major personalities of contemporary Bengal, were published next.\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan and the partition of Bengal in 1947, there have been more attempts to compile and publish an encyclopedia. The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of \"Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia\" by Franklin Book Programs Inc., undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later. The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as \"Bangla Visvacos\" (1972) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi-volume \"Islami Bishwakosh\" (Encyclopedia of Islam, 1986) by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, 5-volume \"Shishu-Biswakosh\" (\"Encyclopedia for Children\", 1995) by Bangladesh Shishu Academy, and 4-volume \"Vijnan Biswakosh\" (\"Encyclopedia of Science\", 1998) by Bangla Academy.\n\n\"Banglapedia\" contains over 5,700 entries, which are divided into six categories: arts and humanities, history and heritage, state and governance, society and economy, natural sciences, and biological sciences. The writing of each article was overseen by an expert editor.\n\n\"Banglapedia\" was not designed as a general encyclopedia. Its purpose is to provide a standard desk reference for Bangladeshis, as well as for people interested in Bangladesh, Bengali-speaking people, and related political, cultural and geographical contexts.\n\nThe encyclopedia's editors intended to cover the rise of the Bengal Delta on the physical plane, and its evolution to date, and the changing features of the formation of the delta's \"janapada\" or human settlements on the human plane. The latter includes the rise and fall of kingdoms, invasions from within and beyond and their implications, dynastic rules and administration, as well as other aspects of Bangladesh's past and present. Entries on topics after 1947 are restricted to the geographical region of Bangladesh. However, for biographical entries, the linguistic identity prevails.\n\nThe range of topics covered by \"Banglapedia\" includes political geography, religion, literature, art and architecture, folk practices and institutions, indigenous and colonial administration, politics, society, economy, ethnicity, and the sciences. All 64 districts of Bangladesh, as well as 451 upazilas, have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts to the number of dairy farms and hatcheries. Over 2,000 single- and four-colour illustrations depict Bangladeshi art and architecture, everyday life, cities and villages and personages. It has about 2,100 cross-references, cartographic information, tables and statistics. It is laid out in alphabetical order and is prefaced by an essay by the Chief Editor. There is a section explaining how to use the \"Banglapedia\", which clarifies issues such as date systems, contributors, cross references, and headings.\n\nAccording to the publisher, the goal of this reference tool is to inquire, interpret and integrate the lived experiences and achievements of the people of Bangladesh from ancient times to the present. The project, conceptually and territorially, interprets the term \"Bangladesh\" to mean successively ancient Eastern India, Suba Bangla, Shahi Bangalah, Mughal Suba Bangla, Bengal Presidency, Bengal Province, East Bengal, East Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The editor's preface states:\n\nOver 1,200 writers and specialists contributed to the encyclopedia, one fifth of whom were foreign experts in Bangladesh or experts working abroad. They are mostly academics, as well as specialists in districts and upazilas for locality inputs and people from professions and occupations. District and upazila cartography has been processed at the Geographic information system (GIS) and cartographic laboratory set up for the Banglapedia. A gazetteer group was created to focus on districts and upazilas. The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective zilas and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering. In addition, 250 people worked in research management for seven years. A total of 2,000 scholars and technicians were involved. There were 270 full-time personnel on the project in all, with 35 to 40 people employed at any given time.\n\nSirajul Islam is the chairman of the Board of Editors of \"Banglapedia\", and the editor of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. A professor of history at the University of Dhaka, the oldest and largest university in Bangladesh, Islam gave up his day job five years before the formal date for retirement, to make time for \"Banglapedia\". He also edited the 3 volumes of the \"History of Bangladesh\" (political, economic and socio-cultural), published by the Asiatic Society In 1991. He is now working on the \"Children’s Banglapedia\" and the \"Cultural Survey of Bangladesh\", and is also in charge of the \"National Online Biography\" project of the Society and the Banglapedia Trust.\n\nThe encyclopedia was prepared by a board of editors that included Professor Sirajul Islam of the Department of History, Dhaka University, as the Chairman and Chief Editor, Professor Sajahan Miah of the Department of Philosophy, Dhaka University, as the Convenor and Managing Editor, Professor M. Aminul Islam as the Chairman of Project Implementation Committee, the Chairman of Fund Management Committee, and the Chairman of Cartography Committee, Professor Abdul Momin Chowdhury as the Chairman of Publication Committee, Professor S M Mahfuzur Rahman as the Convenor of Purchase and Procurement Committee, Shahida Alam as the Convenor of Public Relations and Communication Committee, and Professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury as the Chairman of Multimedia Committee.\n\nThe management structure includes a total of sixty members, divided into six different sub-committees headed by six subject editors. Each sub-committee covered a particular discipline. There were six consulting editors, four language editors, and three translation editors. Each subject editor received assistance from six assistant and associate editors. \"Banglapedia\"s subject editors were: Professor Abdul Momin Chowdhury (History and Heritage), Professor Wakil Ahmed (Arts, Humanities, Religion), Professor Mahfuzur Rahman (Society and Economy), Dr Kamal Siddiqui (State and Governance), and Professor S M H Kabir (Science and Technology).\n\nThe CD-ROM version of \"Banglapedia\" has more entries than the print version, along with 65 video clips, 49 audio clips, 2,714 images and thumbnails, and 647 maps. The audio clips include songs by Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, while the video clips include Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's speech on 7 March 1971. Some images that appear in black and white in the print version are in color in the CD-ROM version. Designed to run on Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows NT, the CD-ROM version includes about 70,000 links and an option to create a personal \"favorite list\".\n\n\"Banglapedia\" has had several online addresses, some are no longer authorised by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh.\n\nControversy over \"Banglapedia\" broke out even before publication, when the Inqilab group, a major Bangladeshi newspaper publishing house, got hold of a few entries on religion and related issues. There have also been complaints about an omission of Jamaat-e-Islami's activities during the Bangladesh Liberation War. A study by Bdnews24.com, a news portal, claimed that \"Banglapedia\" is biased and inaccurate about Bangladesh's indigenous population. The encyclopedia is also reported to have used derogatory coinage such as \"Mogh\" for Marma and Rakhine, \"Tipra\" for Tripuri and \"Murang\" for Mros, as well as \"upajati\" (literally \"sub-nation\", used to mean \"tribal\") to define them all. Leaders of the indigenous community, including Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council member and Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti leader Rupayan Dewan and General secretary of Adivasi Forum Sanjib Drong, have endorsed the study's findings. Chief editor Islam acknowledged the complaint and promised to amend the second edition accordingly.\n\n\n"}

This may vary, depending on the edition and the printing.\n\nIn a technical sense the book is only attributed to George Hepplewhite as author since it was published after his death and the original title page bears the name \"A. Hepplewhite and co.\", for Alice Hepplewhite, his widow. Very little is known of George Hepplewhite's life, unlike that of the other two great British cabinet makers of the period Thomas Sheraton and Thomas Chippendale. We do have information that suggests Hepplewhite was born in 1727 in Ryton Parish, County Durham, England.\n\nThe Dover Books edition which is the main one discussed here, was done as a facsimile of the 3rd edition of the original, \"of 1794\". According to other sources the third edition of the original book came out in 1790, after the first and second editions of 1788 and 1789.\nThis book was reprinted several times over the centuries. One of the most common editions, apart from the Dover one, was made in elephant folio size by the Towse publishing company of New York, in 1942.\n\nAt 28cm high the Dover edition is nearly half the size of the 47cm of the elephant folio sized Towse edition and much smaller than the 36cm of the original edition. The Towse edition also has 88 pages of photographs of furniture done according to the designs in the book. The 128 plates are all monochrome, as in the original.\n\nIt is not known if the designs in it are his own or copies from others, since (unlike Chippendale) he was not famous during his life and no piece of furniture can be traced with certainty back to his workshop. The neoclassical designs in it usually have tapered legs and a variety of contrasting veneers. On the whole this kind of furniture has a relatively delicate look. The designs cover the usual chairs, tables, desks and cabinets. They also cover clock cases, library steps and other objects which came out of the cabinet makers' shop of that era. The book was very influential on cabinet makers in the eastern parts of the US during the whole of the 19th century.\n\nThe Dover edition (1969, paperback, ) is still in print and also available used at about half the price of the new book. The Towse edition is available from specialty book dealers for about ten times the price of the new book. The original edition is also available, for about one thousand times the price of the new book.\n\nThe complete text with the plates is available for download in various formats from or .\n"}

It maintains an international reputation for research and is ranked among the top five natural history museums in the United States.\n\nThe museum consists of organized into 20 galleries as well as research, library, and office space. It holds some 22 million specimens, of which about 10,000 are on view at any given time and about 1 million are cataloged in online databases. In 2008 it hosted 386,300 admissions and 63,000 school group visits. Museum education staff also actively engage in outreach by traveling to schools all around western Pennsylvania.\n\nThe museum gained prominence in 1899 when its scientists unearthed the fossils of \"Diplodocus carnegii\". Today its dinosaur collection includes the world's largest collection of Jurassic dinosaurs and its \"Dinosaurs in Their Time\" exhibition offers the third largest collection of mounted, displayed dinosaurs in the United States (behind the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History). Notable specimens include one of the world's only fossils of a juvenile \"Apatosaurus\", the world's first specimen of a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", and a recently identified species of oviraptorosaur named \"Anzu wyliei\".\n\nResearch teams including former Carnegie scientists made critical discoveries such as \"Puijila darwini\", \"Castorocauda lutrasimilis\", and \"Hadrocodium wui\".\n\nOther major exhibits include Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, , Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, Benedum Hall of Geology, Dinosaurs in Their Time, and Powdermill Nature Reserve, established by the museum in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations.\n\nThe museum's active curatorial departments are: Anthropology, Birds, Botany, Herpetology (Amphibians & Reptiles), Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammals, Minerals, Mollusks (Malacology), and Vertebrate Paleontology. These departments work collaboratively under strategic centers created to re-frame how the museum leverages its research, exhibitions, and public programming to meet the challenges and issues of today. In late 2013, however, the museum's parent organization and interim administration eliminated multiple scientific positions, seriously affecting its capacity to conduct original research.\n\nCarnegie Museum of Natural History publishes scholarly journals and books including \"Annals of Carnegie Museum\", which offers peer-reviewed articles in organismal biology, earth sciences, and anthropology; \"Bulletin of Carnegie Museum of Natural History\", offering monographs or collections of related papers from symposia; and \"Special Publications\" of Carnegie Museum, documenting special topics or areas of research.\n\n\n"}

They serve as the latest and best of a model's portfolio and are used as a business card. A Z-CARD is also a folded leaflet format, typically used for marketing communications campaigns for example a loyalty programme or seasonal promotion.\n\nPeter Marlowe in London invented models composites in 1965, then printed on paper to A4 format. The format was changed in 1972 to A5 card format, for filing purposes, and a few other companies started publishing cards for the model industry under different trade names since Peter Marlowe had registered the trademark “Model Composite” in Europe and the USA. Amongst these was Sebastian Sed who traded under the name Sed Cards, which are sometimes mis-pronounced as Z (\"Zed\") or Set cards. The publishing house of Marlowe Press stopped trading in 1990 and the words \"models composites\" and \"comp cards\" became generic within the model industry. Comp card databases and creation tools have moved online in recent years.\n\nA comp card typically contains a minimum of two pages – a cover page with full size portrait and a second page with a selection of representative shots from the portfolio. It lists the model's basic stats – typically height, weight, three sizes (bust, waist, hips) for women, suit or chest size and waist and inseam sizes for men, plus shoe size, eye and hair color, nationality and contact information. It is printed on both sides of an 8.5\" x 5.5\" piece of card stock (12 pt stock) (US) or A5 on card weight (350/400 g/m stock in metric countries) which is between 300 and 450 µm thick depending on the card stock or quality chosen (Europe, Asia).\n\nComp cards have been around for many years as the essential marketing tool for a model and are likely to retain this standing because they are an inexpensive way to effectively and professionally showcase a model's ability. Composite cards are used on three major levels – they are used by models, agents and the agent's client\n\nCurrently, models have many different options of creating comp cards. They can ask their photographer or create their own on their computers using image editing or graphics software. In addition, with technology's increasingly strong influence in the digital market, many printing companies have looked to the internet to facilitate the ordering process. Comp card printing prices can vary depending on the number of pictures used on the card, the type of paper stock used, and the general printing quality. Different layout styles are available or can be created.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42044772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42044772", "title": "Comparison of association football and rugby union", "text": "Comparison of association football and rugby union\n\nComparison of association football rugby union is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins.\n\nRugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in association football. Association football aims at a more open kind of play, and there is not the same differentiation between forwards and backs. Another major difference is that rugby union, unlike association football, has no goal keeper.\n\nThe earliest forms of football comprise the common ancestry of both association football and of rugby union. Two of the earliest recorded football type games from Europe include Episkyros from Ancient Greece and the Roman version Harpastum, which similar to pre-codified \"Mob Football\" involved more handling the ball than kicking. Other competitive games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in a few countries throughout history, such as cuju in China.\n\nThe rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name \"association football\" was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The term \"soccer\" originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford \"-er\" abbreviation of the word \"association\".\n\nWithin the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called \"football\" in the United Kingdom, and mainly \"soccer\" in Canada and the United States. Other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, may use either or both terms.\n\nMost of the interplay between the two codes occurred in the nineteenth century, where the \"Associationists\" preferred a kicking game, and the \"Rugbeians\" preferred a handling/carrying game. The term \"soccer\" was formed by analogy to \"rugger\", a nickname for rugby football.\n\nOne of the early differences between the two codes, beyond playing style, was that of amateurism and professionalism. While rugby union football remained resolutely amateur until the 1990s (resulting in the split with rugby league), association football became professional very early on.\n\nThe \"penalty area\" is the large marked rectangular area. The smaller rectangle within it is the \"goal area\" (here the yellow-shirted goalkeeper is the only player in the goal area). The \"penalty arc\" is the curved line adjoining the \"top\" of the penalty area (here the red-shirted referee is standing near the arc).\n\nWhile an association football pitch makes use of arcs and circles, all of the lines in rugby union are straight. Examples of such features include the \"centre circle\" is marked at from the \"centre spot\". Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the \"centre spot\". During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle. The arcs in the \"corners\" denote the area (within 1-yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 10 yards away from the corner on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.\n\nThe field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of long by wide. In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area. There are several lines crossing it, notably the halfway line and the \"twenty two\", which is from the goal line.\n\nStricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least and the pitch must be at least wide.\n\nAnother key difference is the goal posts. Rugby union posts consists of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas association football goalposts consists of two posts with crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring only in rugby union, whereas in association football, only the area below the crossbar is used for scoring.\n\nThe goal posts in association football are narrower and the crossbar is lower. The goalposts of rugby union extend far above the crossbar.\n\nIn association football, the goal is the only method of scoring. It is also used to refer to the scoring structure. A deliberate attempt on goal is \nreferred to as a \"shot\". To score a goal, the ball must pass completely over the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar and no rules may be violated on the play (such as touching the ball with the hand or arm). See also offside. The goal structure is defined as a frame 24 feet (7.32 m) wide by 8 feet (2.44 m) tall. In most organised levels of play a net is attached behind the goal frame to catch the ball and indicate that a goal has been scored; but the Laws of the Game do not mandate the use of a net and only require that any net used not interfere with the goalkeeper.\n\nIn rugby union, the try is seen as the main method of scoring, with additional means being to kick the goal between the two bars for a drop goal or a conversion after a try.\n\nA goal is scored in either rugby code by place kicking or drop kicking a ball over a crossbar and between goal posts. In rugby union, a goal scored from the field either as a drop kick during normal play or a place kick after a foul scores three points. In rugby league, a goal scored from the field as a drop kick scores one point, and a goal from a place kick after a foul scores two points. In both codes, a goal scored by place kick after a try (a \"conversion\") scores two points. The kick is taken from a position that is back in line from where the try was scored giving an incentive for teams to try and score near to the centre such that the kick is more attainable. Rugby league goal posts are generally \"H\" shaped, 5.5 metres in width, with the cross bar three metres from the ground\n\nLaw 2 of the game specifies that the ball is an air-filled sphere with a circumference of , a weight of , inflated to a pressure of 0.6 to 1.1 atmospheres () \"at sea level\", and covered in leather or \"other suitable material\". The weight specified for a ball is the dry weight, as older balls often became significantly heavier in the course of a match played in wet weather. The standard ball is a Size 5, although smaller sizes exist: Size 3 is standard for team handball and Size 4 in futsal and other small-field variants. Other sizes are used in underage games or as novelty items.\n\nMost modern footballs are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is the spherical polyhedron corresponding to the truncated icosahedron; it is spherical because the faces bulge from the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in Denmark. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nThe familiar 32-panel football design is sometimes referenced to describe the truncated icosahedron Archimedean solid, carbon buckyballs or the root structure of geodesic domes.\n\nThere are a number of different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including: training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini/skills footballs.\n\nRugby union uses an oval ball (a prolate spheroid). This makes a difference in the variety and style of kicking. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles.\n\nThe ball used in rugby union, usually referred to as a rugby ball, is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. A regulation football is long and in circumference at its widest point. It weighs and is inflated to .\n\nIn 1980, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. The Gilbert Synergie was the match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\nA rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an international match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead – any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add stoppage time.\n\nIn both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly. In rugby union, this can be by hand (passing, or throw in) or by foot. In association football, this can only usually be done by foot (although the goalkeeper can handle the ball).\n\nThe term \"passing\" is used in association football to refer to a ball kicked to another player on the same team, whereas in rugby union it refers to when the ball is passed by hand to another player on the same team.\n\nBoth association football and rugby union have an offside rule. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction: a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be offside anyway. In association football, the ball can be passed backwards or forwards to a player on the same team, so long as the player passed to in front is onside.\n\nRugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas association football explicitly disallows tackling of that sort. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\n\nRugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.\n\nThere is no \"goalkeeper\" in rugby union, instead there is a \"fullback\", although the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks.\n\nRugby union allows a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time; in the instance of association football, a maximum of 11 players per side is allowed on the field at any one time. These numbers may be reduced through players being sent off, or injuries without replacements. (The latter only tends to occur in the lower levels of each sport)\n\nBoth international association football and international rugby union share at least one thing in common. The original international games of each code were between Scotland and England in the early 1870s.\n\nRugby union has been an international game since 1871, when beat at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The Rugby World Cup (RWC) itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since.\n\nThe first official international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. The FIFA World Cup, often simply the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.\n\nVariants of association football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. Five-a-side football), for play in non-field environments (i.e. Beach soccer, Indoor soccer, and Futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. Paralympic association football).\n\nVariants of rugby union have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. rugby sevens, rugby tens), for youth training (i.e. mini rugby) for play in non-field environments (i.e. beach rugby and snow rugby) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. quad rugby).\n\nRugby league is a separate code from rugby union, but arose from the same game due to disputes over payment. Both rugby league and rugby union still share many elements in common, and may be confused by a casual spectator.\n"}

By 1922 Earl had unearthed and shipped more than 700,000 pounds of material including nearly 20 complete skeletons of Jurassic dinosaurs such as Diplodocus, Dryosaurus, Stegosaurus, Barosaurus, Camarasaurus and Brontosaurus.\n\nDouglass was born on October 28, 1862 in Medford, Minnesota, the son of Fernando and Abigail Louisa Carpenter Douglass. He married Pearl Charlotte Goetschius on October 20, 1905 and a few years later they had a son, Gawin Earl Douglass. Douglass died on January 13, 1931 in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nDouglass's early education was in the Medford public schools and the Pillsbury Academy in Owatonna, Minnesota, where he studied geology, paleontology, osteology, and mammalian anatomy. Later at the Shaw School of Botany at Washington University, he studied systematic botany and plant histology. Douglass received his master's of Science at the University of Montana in 1899. The following year at Princeton University he held a fellowship in biology, and he was granted a fellowship in geology.\n\nIn 1899, Douglass taught geology and physical geography at the University of Montana. In 1902, Douglass was hired at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History to work in the field of paleontology and worked there for 15 years. From 1923 to 1924, he worked with the National Museum and University of Utah to obtain dinosaur fossils and discovered a large part of a skeleton known as \"Barosaurus lentus\". The following year, he was employed by the University of Utah to excavate dinosaur bones.\n\nAfter a botanical trip to Mexico in 1890, Douglass became assistant to Professor William Trelease at the Missouri Botanical Garden. Because he did notable research on oil, oil shale, asphalts, and other mineral deposits, he became consulting geologist for companies engaged in these fields in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Texas. His final years were spent as a geologist.\n\nDouglass played a central role in one of the most important fossil finds in North America. In 1905, he was sent to Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho to collect vertebrate and invertebrate fossils. Additionally, he obtained data to solve certain geological problems and conduct geological explorations. In 1907, Douglass traveled to the Uintah Basin in northeastern Utah to explore fossiliferous strata. Later in 1908, he explored the hills along the Green River near Jensen, Utah and came upon with the tail section of an Apatasaurus in the Morrison Formation. The following year while searching fossils for the Carnegie Museum, he discovered a formation layered with prehistoric plant and animal fossils. In the summer of 1909, Earl traveled to Utah to search for dinosaur skeletons , where he discovered his famous dinosaur at the Utah quarry. The dinosaur was formally named \"Apatosaurus louisae\", after Carnegie’s wife Louise. In the same year, while climbing the Split Mountain near Jenson, Utah he found eight large vertebrae partially embedded in the rock, which turned out to be the entire body of a brontosaur nearly 70 feet long.\n"}

Eur.) is a major regional pharmacopoeia which provides common quality standards throughout the pharmaceutical industry in Europe to control the quality of medicines, and the substances used to manufacture them. It is a published collection of monographs which describe both the individual and general quality standards for ingredients, dosage forms, and methods of analysis for medicines. These standards apply to medicines for both human and veterinary use.\n\nThe \"European Pharmacopoeia\" has a legally binding character. It is used as an official reference to serve public health, and is part of the regulatory requirements for obtaining a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for a medicinal (human or veterinary) product. The quality standards of the European Pharmacopoeia apply throughout the entire life-cycle of a product, and become legally binding and mandatory on the same date in all thirty-eight (38) signatory states, which include all European Union member states.\n\nSeveral legal texts make the \"European Pharmacopoeia\" mandatory in Europe. The Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia (CETS 50) which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1964, laid the groundwork for the development of the \"European Pharmacopoeia\". In 1994, a Protocol (ETS No. 134) was adopted, amending the Convention to prepare for the accession of the European Union (EU), and defining the respective powers of the European Union and its Member States within the European Pharmacopoeia Commission.\n\nEuropean Union Directive 2001/82/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC, (as amended) state the legally binding character of \"European Pharmacopoeia\" texts for Marketing Authorisation Applications (MAA). All manufacturers of medicines or substances for pharmaceutical use therefore must apply the \"European Pharmacopoeia\" quality standards in order to be able to market and use these products in Europe.\n\nAs of September 2018, thirty-eight (38) member states and the European Union are signatories to the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia. Twenty-eight (28) countries from all continents are part of its observers, as is the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA).\n\nWhile the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM), a directorate of the Council of Europe, provides scientific and administrative support for the \"European Pharmacopoeia\", the governing body is the European Pharmacopoeia Commission. The European Pharmacopoeia Commission determines the general principles applicable to the elaboration of the European Pharmacopoeia. It also decides the work programme, sets up and appoints experts to the specialised groups responsible for preparing monographs, adopts these monographs, and recommends dates for the implementation of its decisions within the territories of the contracting parties.\n\nThis Commission meets in Strasbourg, France, three times a year, to adopt texts proposed by its groups of experts, and to decide on its programme of work and general policies. Items are added to the work programme in response to requests received by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare from the Member States and their national authorities, industry or experts from around the world, based on current scientific and health issues. Each national delegation has one vote. In all technical questions, the decisions of the Commission are taken by a unanimous vote of the national delegations that cast a vote. Member States' representatives mostly come from health authorities, national pharmacopoeia authorities and universities; and are appointed by the national authorities on the basis of their expertise. Representatives of the thirty (30) observers are invited to attend the sessions, but cannot vote.\n\nThe current Chair of the Commission is Dr Tobias Gosdschan, who was elected in March 2016. Dr Gosdschan's term for Chair is three years, and runs in parallel with other members of the Commission's Presidium.\n\nThe first edition of the \"European Pharmacopoeia\" was published in 1969, and consisted of 120 texts. The ninth edition, currently applicable, was published in July 2016. The Ph. Eur. is applicable in 38 European countries and used in over 100 countries worldwide. Nowadays it contains almost 3000 texts (the monographs), covering all therapeutic areas and consisting of:\n\nPh. Eur. texts contain detailed analytical methods to identify the substance or product and control its quality and quantitative strength. \n\nPh. Eur. texts also address the issue of impurities in medicinal products, which do not offer any therapeutic benefit for the patient and sometimes are potentially toxic. Impurities are present at every stage of the manufacture of medicines: in starting materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), reagents, intermediates, excipients and primary packaging materials. But the Ph. Eur. texts’s section on impurities is perhaps the most essential part of a quality standard of an active substance.\n\nA new edition of the European Pharmacopoeia is published every three years: in both English and French, by the Council of Europe. It is made available in print and electronic (online and downloadable) versions; the online version is also accessible from smartphones and tablet computers.\n\nTranslations into other languages are published by the Member States themselves.

The Storm Worm (2007) is one of the first malware variants to make use of this technique.\n\nThe basic idea behind Fast flux is to have numerous IP addresses associated with a single fully qualified domain name, where the IP addresses are swapped in and out with extremely high frequency, through changing DNS records.\n\nInternet users may see fast flux used in phishing attacks linked to criminal organizations, including attacks on social network services.\n\nWhile security researchers have been aware of the technique since at least November 2006, the technique only received wider attention in the security trade press starting from July 2007.\n\nThe simplest type of fast flux, named \"single-flux\", is characterized by multiple individual nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single DNS name. This combines round robin DNS with very short—usually less than five minutes (300s) -- TTL (time to live) values to create a constantly changing list of destination addresses for that single DNS name. The list can be hundreds or thousands of entries long.\n\nA more sophisticated type of fast flux, referred to itself as \"double-flux\", is characterized by multiple nodes within the network registering and de-registering their addresses as part of the DNS Name Server record list for the DNS zone. This provides an additional layer of redundancy and survivability within the malware network.\n\nWithin a malware attack, the DNS records will normally point to a compromised system that will act as a proxy server. This method prevents some of the traditionally best defense mechanisms from working — e.g., IP-based access control lists (ACLs). The method can also mask the systems of attackers, which will exploit the network through a series of proxies and make it much more difficult to identify the attackers' network. The record will normally point to an IP where bots go for registration, to receive instructions, or to activate attacks. Because the IPs are proxified, it is possible to disguise the originating source of these instructions, increasing the survival rate as IP-based block lists are put in place.\n\nThe most effective measure against fast flux is to take down the domain name it uses. Registrars are, however, reluctant to do so because domain owners are legitimate customers for them and there's no worldwide-enforced policy of what constitutes an abuse. In addition to this, cybersquatters, including fast flux operators (who typically register new names on demand), are their main source of income. Security experts keep working on measures to ease this process.\n\nOther measures can be taken by local network administrators. A network admin can force endpoints within their network to only be able to use local DNS servers by blocking all egress DNS traffic, and then blackhole requests for malicious domains at the DNS level. Alternatively, administrators with network devices capable of doing inspection and intervention can set up policies that reset connections that attempt to resolve or make HTTP requests involving malicious domains.\n\n\n"}

Thompson's novel of the same name. It was co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benicio del Toro as Dr. Gonzo. The two embark on an initially assigned journey with journalistic purpose which turns out to be an exploration of the Las Vegas setting under the effect of psychoactive substances.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and was a financial failure, but has since become a cult film due in large part to its release on DVD, including a Special Edition released by The Criterion Collection.\n\nIn 1971, Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo speed across the Nevada desert. Duke, under the influence of mescaline, complains of a swarm of giant bats, before going through the pair's inventory of psychoactive drugs. Shortly afterward, the duo stop to pick up a young hitchhiker, and explain what they are doing. Duke has been assigned by an unnamed magazine to travel to Las Vegas and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. However, they have also decided to take advantage of the trip by purchasing a large number of drugs and renting a red Chevrolet Impala convertible. The young man soon becomes terrified of the antics of the duo and flees on foot. Trying to reach Vegas before the hitchhiker can go to the police, Gonzo gives Duke part of a sheet of Sunshine Acid, then informs him that there is little chance of making it before the drug kicks in. By the time they reach the strip, Duke is in the full throes of his trip, and barely makes it through the check-in, all the while hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel, and that his fellow bar patrons are lizards in the depths of an orgy.\n\nThe next day, Duke arrives at the race, and heads out with his photographer, a man by the name of Lacerda. During the coverage, Duke becomes irrational and believes that they are in the middle of a battlefield, so he fires Lacerda and returns to the hotel. After consuming more mescaline, as well as huffing diethyl ether, Duke and Gonzo arrive at the Bazooko Circus casino, but leave shortly afterwards, the chaotic atmosphere frightening Gonzo. Back in the hotel room, Duke leaves a knife-wielding Gonzo unattended, and tries his luck at a quick round of Big Six. When Duke returns, he finds that Gonzo, after consuming a full sheet of LSD, has trashed the room, and is sitting fully clothed in the bathtub, attempting to pull the tape player in with him, as he wants to hear the song better. He pleads with Duke to throw the machine into the water when the song \"White Rabbit\" peaks. Duke agrees, but instead throws a grapefruit at Gonzo's head before running outside. Gonzo later confronts him violently, but claims to have only wanted to mutilate, rather than murder, Duke.\n\nThe next morning, Duke awakens to an exorbitant room service bill, and no sign of Gonzo (who has returned to Los Angeles while Duke slept), and attempts to leave town. As he nears Baker, California, a highway patrolman pulls him over for speeding, and advises him to sleep at a nearby rest stop. Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning that he has a suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy he has brought with him. Gonzo explains that Lucy has come to Las Vegas to meet Barbra Streisand, and that he gave her LSD on the plane not realizing she had never taken it before. Sensing the trouble this could get them into, Duke convinces Gonzo to ditch Lucy in another hotel before her trip wears off.\n\nGonzo accompanies Duke to the D.A.'s convention, and the pair discreetly snort cocaine as the guest speaker delivers a comically out-of-touch speech about \"marijuana addicts\" before showing a brief film. Unable to take it, Duke and Gonzo flee back to their room, only to discover that Lucy has called. Their trips mostly over, Gonzo deals with Lucy over the phone (pretending that he is being savagely beaten by thugs), as Duke attempts to mellow out by trying some of Gonzo's stash of adrenochrome. However, the trip spirals out of control, and Duke is reduced to an incoherent mess before he blacks out.\n\nAfter an unspecified amount of time passes, Duke wakes up to a complete ruin of the once pristine suite. After discovering his tape recorder, he attempts to remember what has happened. As he listens, he has brief memories of the general mayhem that has taken place, including a heated encounter with a waitress at a diner, convincing a distraught cleaning woman that they are police officers investigating a drug ring, and attempting to buy an orangutan.\n\nDuke drops Gonzo off at the airport, after missing the entrance, driving across the tarmac and pulling up right next to the plane, before returning to the hotel one last time to finish his article. Duke then speeds back to Los Angeles.\n\nAnimator/filmmaker Ralph Bakshi tried to convince a girlfriend of Thompson's to let him do \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" as an animated film, done in the style of Ralph Steadman's illustrations for the book. Bakshi is quoted as saying:\nHunter had given the rights to a girlfriend of his. I spent three days with her trying to talk her into me animating it – she wanted to make a live-action of it – I kept telling her that a live-action would look like a bad cartoon but an animated version would be a great one. She had a tremendous disdain for animators because it wasn't considered the top of Hollywood. Hunter also could not make her change her mind. So she made the pic with Johnny Depp (who is a great actor), and got the film I told her she would get – it would have been more real in a cartoon using Steadman's drawings.\n\nIn January 1976, \"Texas Monthly\" announced that Larry McMurtry had signed a contract to write a screenplay for a film adaptation.\nMartin Scorsese and Oliver Stone each tried to get the film off the ground, but were unsuccessful and moved on.\n\nRhino Films began work on a film version as early as 1992. Head of Production and the film's producer Stephen Nemeth originally wanted Lee Tamahori to direct, but he wasn't available until after the January 1997 start date. Depp wanted Bruce Robinson to direct, but he was \"unavailable... by choice\". Rhino appealed to Thompson for an extension on the film rights but the author and his lawyers denied the extension. Under pressure, Rhino countered by green-lighting the film and hiring Alex Cox to direct within a few days. According to Nemeth, Cox could \"do it for a price, could do it quickly and could get this movie going in four months.\"\n\nRhino hired Terry Gilliam and was granted an extension from Thompson but only with the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino did not want to commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out. Thompson remembers, \"They just kept asking for more [time]. I got kind of agitated about it, because I thought they were trying to put off doing it. So I began to charge them more... I wanted to see the movie done, once it got started.\" The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans. Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.\n\nDuring the initial development to get the film made, Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando were originally considered for the roles of Duke and Gonzo but they both grew too old. Afterward, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were considered for the duo, but that fell apart when Belushi died. John Malkovich was later considered for the role of Duke, but he grew too old as well. At one point John Cusack was almost cast (Cusack had previously directed the play version of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", with his brother playing Duke). However, after Hunter S. Thompson met with Johnny Depp he became convinced that no one else could play him. When Cox and Davies started writing the screenplay, Depp and del Toro committed to starring in the film.\n\nGilliam said in an interview that his films are actor-led, the performance of the two characters in \"Fear and Loathing\" is hyper realistic but truthful: \"I am interested in real people in bizarre, twisted environments that force them to act... to react against.\"\n\nDr. Gonzo is based on Thompson's friend Oscar Zeta Acosta, who disappeared sometime in 1974. Thompson changed Acosta's ethnic identity to \"Samoan\" to deflect suspicion from Acosta, who was in trouble with the Los Angeles County Bar Association. He was the \"Chicano lawyer\" notorious for his party binges.\n\nThe lead actors undertook extraordinary preparations for their respective roles. Del Toro gained more than 45 pounds (18 kg) in nine weeks before filming began, eating 16 donuts a day, and extensively researched Acosta's life. In the spring of 1997, Depp moved into the basement of Thompson's Owl Farm home and lived there for four months, doing research for the role as well as studying Thompson's habits and mannerisms. The actor went through Thompson's original manuscript, mementos and notebooks that he kept during the actual trip. Depp remembers, \"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.\" Depp even traded his car for Thompson's red Chevrolet Caprice convertible, known to fans as The Great Red Shark, and drove it around California during his preparation for the role. Many of the costumes that Depp wears in the film are genuine articles of clothing that Depp borrowed from Thompson, and the writer himself shaved Depp's head to match his own natural male pattern baldness. Other props, such as Duke's cigarette filter (a TarGard Permanent Filter System), Hawaiian shirts, hats, a patchwork jacket, a silver medallion (given to him by Oscar Acosta) and IDs, belonged to Thompson.\n\nCox started writing the screenplay with Tod Davies, a UCLA Thompson scholar. During pre-production, Cox and producer Laila Nabulsi had \"creative differences\" and she forced Rhino to choose between her and Cox. She had an arrangement with Thompson to produce the film and the studio fired Cox and paid him $60,000 in script fees. Thompson's disapproval of the Cox/Davies script treatment is documented in the film \"Breakfast with Hunter.\"\n\nThe decision was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another. Gilliam has stated in an interview \"When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book.\" The director enlisted the help of Tony Grisoni and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, \"I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk and talk and I'd keep typing.\" One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, \"This is two guys who have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable – that scene, it's ugly. My approach, rather than to throw it out, was to make that scene the low point.\"\nInitially, the studio wanted Gilliam to update the book for the 1990s, which he considered, \"And then I looked at the film and said, 'No, that's apologizing. I don't want to apologize for this thing. It is what it is.' It's an artifact. If it's an accurate representation of that book, which I thought was an accurate representation of a particular time and place and people.\" Terry Gilliam, while speaking to \"Sight & Sound\" magazine, highlighted if he had updated the movie to the 1990s it would just \"be a story about two people going to excess\". By keeping it set in the 70's, using the backdrop of the Vietnam War and a perceived loss of the American dream, offers reasoning to the characters actions.\n\nWhen the film approached release, Gilliam learned that the Writers Guild of America (WGA) would not allow Cox and Davies to be removed from the credits even though none of their material was used in the production of the film. According to WGA rules, Gilliam and Grisoni had to prove that they wrote 60% of their script. The director said, \"But there have been at least five previous attempts at adapting the book, and they all come from the book. They all use the same scenes.\" Gilliam remarked in an interview, \"The end result was we didn't exist. As a director, I was automatically deemed a 'production executive' by the guild and, by definition, discriminated against. But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair.\" David Kanter, agent for Cox and Davies, argued, \"About 60 percent of the decisions they made on what stays in from the book are in the film – as well as their attitude of wide-eyed anarchy.\" According to the audio commentary by Gilliam on the Criterion Collection DVD, during the period where it appeared that only Cox and Davies would be credited for the screenplay, the film was to begin with a short scene in which it is explained that no matter what is said in the credits, no writers were involved in the making of the film. When this changed in early May 1998 after the WGA revised its decision and gave credit to Gilliam and Grisoni first and Cox and Davies second, the short was not needed. Angered over having to share credit, Gilliam publicly burned his WGA card at a May 22 book signing on Broadway.\n\nAccording to Gilliam, there was no firm budget in place when filming started. He felt that it was not a well-organized film and said, \"Certain people didn't... I'm not going to name names but it was a strange film, like one leg was shorter than the other. There was all sorts of chaos.\" While Depp was on location in Los Angeles, he got a phone call from comedian Bill Murray who had played Thompson in \"Where the Buffalo Roam\". He warned Depp, \"Be careful or you'll find yourself ten years from now still doing him… Make sure your next role is some drastically different guy.\"\n\nShooting on location in Las Vegas began on August 3, 1997 and lasted 56 days. The production ran into problems when they wanted to shoot in a casino. They were only allowed to film between two and six in the morning, given only six tables to put extras around and insisted that the extras really gamble.\" Exterior shots of the Bazooko Casino were filmed in front of the Stardust hotel/casino with the interiors constructed with a Warner Bros. Hollywood soundstage. To get the period look of Vegas in the 1970s, Gilliam and Pecorini used rear-projection footage from the old television show, \"Vega$\". According to the cinematographer, this footage heightened the film's \"already otherworldly tone an extra notch.\"\n\nNicola Pecorini was hired based on an audition reel he sent Gilliam that made fun of the fact that he had only one eye (he lost the other to retinal cancer). According to Pecorini, the look of the film was influenced by the paintings of Robert Yarber that are \"very hallucinatory: the paintings use all kinds of neon colors, and the light sources don't necessarily make sense.\" According to Gilliam, they used him as a guide \"While mixing our palette of deeply disturbing fluorescent colors.\"\n\nFor the desert scenes, Pecorini wanted a specific, undefined quality without a real horizon to convey the notion that the landscape never ended and to emphasize \"a certain kind of unreality outside the characters' car, because everything that matters to them is within the Red Shark.\" For the scene where Duke hallucinates a lounge full of lizards, the production was supposed to have 25 animatronic reptiles but they only received seven or eight. The production used motion-control techniques to make it look like they had a whole room of them and made multiple passes with the cameras outfitting the lizards with different costumes each time.\n\nDuring production, it was Gilliam's intention that it should feel like a drug trip from beginning to end. He said in an interview, \"We start out at full speed and it's WOOOO! The drug kicks in and you're on speed! Whoah! You get the buzz – it's crazy, it's outrageous, the carpet's moving and everybody's laughing and having a great time. But then, ever so slowly, the walls start closing in and it's like you're never going to get out of this fucking place. It's an ugly nightmare and there's no escape.\" To convey the effects of the various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of \"phases\" that detailed the \"cinematic qualities\" of each drug consumed. For ether, Pecorini said they used a \"loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined\"; for adrenochrome, \"everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens\"; mescaline was simulated by having \"colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures\"; for amyl nitrite, the \"perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots\"; and for LSD, \"everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound.\"\n\nPecorini and Gilliam decided they wanted the film to be shot wide-angle but because of the small budget they couldn't afford the downfalls of anamorphic lenses so they paired the Arriflex 535, Arri BL-4S and the Arri 35-iii with a set of Zeiss Standard Primes and Kodak's 250D Vision 5246 filmstock in order to achieve the saturated look the film has.\n\nThe music belongs to the psychedelic rock and classic rock genre. The soundtrack contains songs used in the film with sound bites of the film before each song. Most of the music is present in the soundtrack with a few exceptions: the Lennon Sisters' version of \"My Favorite Things\" from \"The Sound of Music\" which plays at the beginning of the picture, Jefferson Airplane \"Somebody to Love\" which is heard during a flashback, Debbie Reynolds \"Tammy\", Perry Como \"Magic Moments\", Beck, Bogert & Appice \"Lady\", Tom Jones \"It's Not Unusual\", Frank Sinatra \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me\", Combustible Edison \"Spy vs Spy\", the Out-Islanders \"Moon Mist\" from \"Polynesian Fantasy\", Robert Goulet \"My Love, Forgive Me\", and a recording of \"Ball and Chain\" by Janis Joplin.\n\nThe Rolling Stones song \"Jumping Jack Flash\" is heard at the conclusion of the film as Thompson drives out of Las Vegas. Gilliam could not pay $300,000 (half of the soundtrack budget) for the rights to \"Sympathy for the Devil\" by the Rolling Stones, which plays a prominent role in the book.\n\nThe Dead Kennedys rendition of \"Viva Las Vegas\" is heard at the very end of the closing credits.\n\n\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" underwent preview test screenings – a process that Gilliam does not enjoy. \"I always get very tense in those (test screenings), because I'm ready to fight. I know the pressure from the studio is, 'somebody didn't like that, change it! The filmmaker said that it was important to him that Thompson like the film and recalls the writer's reaction at a screening, \"Hunter watched it for the first time at the premiere and he was making all this fucking noise! Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a roller coaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAMN BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it!\" Thompson himself stated, \"Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but I appreciated it. Depp did a hell of a job. His narration is what really held the film together, I think. If you hadn't had that, it would have just been a series of wild scenes.\"\n\n\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" debuted at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and Gilliam said, \"I'm curious about the reaction... If I'm going to be disappointed, it's because it doesn't make any waves, that people are not outraged.\"\n\nBy the time \"Fear and Loathing\" was released as a Criterion Collection DVD in 2003, Thompson showed his approval of the Gilliam version by recording a full-length audio commentary for the film and participating in several DVD special features.\n\nOn an audio commentary track in the Criterion edition of the DVD, Gilliam expresses great pride in the film and says it was one of the few times where he did not have to fight extensively with the studio during the filming. Gilliam chalks this up to the fact that many of the studio executives read Thompson's book in their youth and understood it could not be made into a conventional Hollywood film. However, he does express frustration with the advertising campaign used during its initial release, which he says tried to sell it as wacky comedy. The film was later released by Universal Studios on HD DVD and, subsequently, Blu-ray; Criterion released the film on Blu-ray on April 26, 2011.\n\nThe film opened in wide release on May 22, 1998 and grossed $3.3 million in 1,126 theaters on its first weekend. The film went on to gross $10.6 million, well below its budget of $18.5 million. However, the movie reignited interest in Thompson's novel. Vintage Press reported an initial reprint of 100,000 copies to tie in with the film's release, but demand was higher than expected and forced the novel to go back to print a further five times.\n\nGilliam wanted to provoke strong reactions to his film as he said in an interview, \"I want it to be seen as one of the great movies of all time, and one of the most hated movies of all time.\" \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" polarized critics; it currently has a 49% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's critical consensus reading, \"Visually creative, but also aimless, repetitive, and devoid of character development.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", Stephen Holden wrote, \"Even the most precise cinematic realizations of Mr. Thompson's images don't begin to match the surreal ferocity of the author's language.\" Stephen Hunter, in his review for the \"Washington Post\", wrote, \"It tells no story at all. Little episodes of no particular import come and go...But the movie is too grotesque to be entered emotionally.\" Mike Clark, of \"USA Today\", found the film, \"simply unwatchable.\" In \"The Guardian\", Gaby Wood wrote, \"After a while, though, the ups and downs don't come frequently enough even for the audience, and there's an element of the tedium usually found in someone else's druggy experiences.\" Roger Ebert found the film disgraceful, giving it one star out of four and calling it \"a horrible mess of a movie, without shape, trajectory or purpose–a one joke movie, if it had one joke. The two characters wander witlessly past the bizarre backdrops of Las Vegas (some real, some hallucinated, all interchangeable) while zonked out of their minds. Humor depends on attitude. Beyond a certain point, you don't have an attitude, you simply inhabit a state.\"\n\nGene Siskel's \"thumbs-up\" review at the time also noted the film successfully captured the book's themes into film, adding \"What the film is about and what the book is about is using Las Vegas as a metaphor for – or a location for – the worst of America, the extremes of America, the money obsession, the visual vulgarity of America.\" Michael O'Sullivan gave the film a positive review in the \"Washington Post\". \"What elevates the tale from being a mere drug chronicle is the same thing that lifted the book into the realm of literature. It's the sense that Gilliam, like Thompson, is always totally in command of the medium, while abandoning himself utterly to unpredictable forces beyond his control.\" \"Empire\" magazine voted the film the 469th greatest film in their \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list.\n\nSince the film's release on home media, including The Criterion Collection Special Edition, the film had attained cult status. This led to the film being re-screened at various cinemas such as The Prince Charles Cinema in Leicester Square, London and a special screening from original VHS tape at Swordtail Studio London in 2016.\n\nThe increased attention for the film has also led to some news outlets to reconsider the mixed original reception of the film; Joe Queenan of \"The Guardian\" remarked that for many, \"No, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" is not breathtakingly self-indulgent and just plain awful; it is actually jaw-droppingly great. Those of you who do not share this opinion are idiots.\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club argued in his more recent review of the film that \"the film would have had a greater impact had it been produced at the time, when \"Brewster McCloud\" proved that anything was possible, but short of a time machine, Gilliam does what he can to bring the era back to life.\".\n\nThe film was nominated for a variety of awards that both praised and condemned it. Terry Gilliam was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival 1998 while Johnny Depp won the best foreign actor award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics in 1998.\n\nHowever Depp and Del Toro were also nominated by the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for worst on-screen couple, and during the same awards Del Toro's portrayal of Dr. Gonzo was also nominated for the worst supporting actor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1323106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1323106", "title": "Gremlins 2: The New Batch", "text": "Gremlins 2: The New Batch\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch is a 1990 American comedy horror film, and the sequel to the 1984 film \"Gremlins\". It was directed by Joe Dante and written by Charles S. Haas, with creature designs by Rick Baker. It stars Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, John Glover, Robert Prosky, Haviland Morris, Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph, Robert Picardo and Christopher Lee; additionally, the film features Tony Randall and Frank Welker providing the voices for two gremlins. The story continues the adventures of the creature Gizmo (once again voiced by Howie Mandel), who spawns numerous small monsters when wet. In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town. In \"Gremlins 2\", Gizmo multiplies within a skyscraper in New York City. The new creatures thus pose a serious threat to the city should they be able to leave the building, and much of the story involves the human characters' efforts to prevent this disaster.\n\nAs with the first film, \"Gremlins 2\" is a live action horror comedy film; however, Dante put effort into taking the sequel in new anarchistic directions. The film is meant to be more cartoon-like and less dark than the original, and the violence is fairly slapstick. There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, most notably \"Gremlins\" itself, as well as the \"Rambo\" films, \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Marathon Man\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\". As with the first film, critical response varied. Some critics who thought the first film was too dark gave \"Gremlins 2\" better reviews, but it received a colder reception from fans who thought otherwise.\n\nAfter the death of his owner Mr. Wing, the mogwai Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of scientists at the Clamp Center, a state-of-the-art highrise building in Manhattan, owned by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his friend Billy Peltzer and his fiancée Kate, both of whom work for the company. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head and spawns four new mogwai (George, Lenny, Mohawk and Daffy) who then lock Gizmo in the vents. They eat after midnight, turning into gremlins.\n\nAfter Gizmo finds a way out of the vent, Mohawk tortures him by beating him, shocking him with an electrical wire, putting him in the photocopier, putting Velcro strips on him and ripping them off, and finally ramming him with a toy train while the other gremlins cause the fire sprinklers to go off and spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs Clamp on gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins devour serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, who plans to use a \"genetic sunblock\" serum to immunize them to sunlight. One gremlin turns into a female, while a third becomes pure electricity which he kills Dr. Catheter and is trapped in Clamp's answering machine by Billy. All the while \"Grandpa Fred\" films the chaos on camera with help from a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.\n\nMurray Futterman, Billy's neighbor from Kingston Falls who is visiting New York City, encounters a bat-hybrid gremlin and covers it with cement, effectively turning it into a gargoyle. Murray realizes that he is not crazy and that he has to help; when Clamp escapes the building using his secret route, Murray uses it to sneak inside to aid Billy. Billy and chief of security Forster team up, but Forster is stalked and chased off by the female gremlin. Mohawk finishes torturing Gizmo and devours a spider serum, transforming into a monstrous half-gremlin, half-spider hybrid. He attacks Kate and Marla, but Gizmo confronts Mohawk and kills him with an ignited bottle of white-out. Outside, a rainstorm frustrates Clamp's plan as the gremlins gather in the building's foyer, singing \"New York, New York\".\n\nBilly formulates a plan to kill the Gremlin army: Mr. Futterman sprays the army with water while Billy releases the electric gremlin, electrocuting them. Clamp charges in with the police and press, but sees the battle is over; he is so thrilled by the end result that he gives Billy, Kate, Fred, and Marla promotions and hires Mr. Katsuji as a cameraman. Billy and Kate then return home with Gizmo. Forster notifies Clamp that he is trapped at the highest floor of the building. The female gremlin corners him and entices him to marry her.\n\nThe film has various crew and guest cameos: Jerry Goldsmith as a yogurt customer, John Astin as a janitor, and Henry Gibson as an employee fired for smoking. Rick Ducommun cameos as a security guard, and Joe Dante as the director of Grandpa Fred's show. Dick Butkus and Bubba Smith cameo as themselves getting attacked at the salad bar. The cast of the PBS children's show \"Square One TV\" appear as themselves filming an episode in the lobby of the Clamp building. \n\nAlong with the main plot, there is animation by Chuck Jones in the film featuring the \"Looney Tunes\" characters Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig (who are now voiced by Jeff Bergman, due to the death of Mel Blanc, the original voice actor). Jones had actually quit animation before returning to work on \"Gremlins 2\". Dante explained the animation at the beginning of the film was meant to \"set the anarchic tone.\"\n\nThe first scene appears at the very beginning of the movie, and features the classic \"Looney Tunes\" opening card, causing people to assume it is the short cartoon that usually plays before a movie begins; however, when Bugs Bunny appears through the rings on top of the Warner Brothers shield, Daffy interrupts the intro, and steals the shield from Bugs. Daffy attempts to recreate the opening with himself in place of Bugs Bunny, but the shield overshoots, causing the entire title card to fall apart. Daffy surrenders the stardom, claiming that since he won't star in the cartoon, they might as well just skip straight to the movie. Bugs is willing to do so, and spins Daffy off screen like a spinning top for the movie title to appear.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray include a longer version of the cartoon short. In it, Daffy is informed by Bugs that he has been promoted to executive and is subsequently put in charge writing the title of the movie. When Daffy mistakenly writes the title \"Gremlins 2\" as \"Gremlin Stew\", Bugs corrects the error. Daffy then attempts to rename the film \"The Return of Super-Daffy Meets Gremlins 2 Part 6: The Movie\", but Bugs rejects this for being too long, changing it back to \"Gremlins 2\" (rendered in the font of the official logo). Daffy then quits his new job and Bugs decides to add in the subtitle, saying it looks \"a little skimpy\". This material was removed from the film because early audiences expected a live-action film and were bewildered by the lengthy animated sequence.\n\nThroughout the film's closing credits, Daffy pops into frame sporadically and spouts off sarcastic comments. The last scene appears after the credits, and again features the Looney Tunes rings. This time, Porky Pig comes out of the rings and says his usual \"Th-th-th-that's all, folks!\" However, Daffy Duck interrupts again and takes over. After Daffy says the slogan, the back of the Warner Bros. shield, with the words, \"Title Animation Written & Directed by Chuck Jones (with Chuck Jones' signature)\", smashes him. He peeks his head out to the left side and says, \"Fade out,\" and the segment ends.\n\nThe original \"Gremlins\" was a financial success, and Warner Bros. asked its director Joe Dante to make a sequel straight away. Dante declined, because he saw \"Gremlins\" as having a proper ending, and thus a sequel would only be meant to be profitable. Moreover, the original film was a taxing experience for Dante, and he wanted to move on. Work on \"Gremlins 2\" continued without him, as the studio approached various directors and writers. Storylines considered included sending the gremlins to cities like Las Vegas or even the planet Mars. After these ideas fell through, the studio returned to Dante, who agreed to make the sequel after receiving the rare promise of having complete creative control over the movie; he also received a budget triple that of the original film's. Dante later acknowledged that by this point too much time had passed between the films, thus possibly reducing \"Gremlins 2\"s appeal.\n\n\"Gremlins 2\" was shot in New York in June 1989, the film was released in 1990, and as the filmmakers later noted, this was a time when cable television, genetics, and frozen yogurt were becoming more common and influential. This left a mark on \"Gremlins 2\". \"Gremlins 2\" exaggerated what could be seen on cable television at the time, although as the filmmakers noted in 2002, that humour might be lost on present-day audiences. Cable television later grew to provide the same variety. Genetics in 1990 is reflected in the laboratory scene in \"Gremlins 2\", and frozen yogurt is what the mogwai eat after midnight.\n\nWith more control over the film, Dante engineered a project that he later referred to as \"one of the more unconventional studio pictures, ever.\" Dante included some material that he believed Warner Bros. would not have allowed had they not wanted a sequel to \"Gremlins\". Allowed to break a number of rules in filmmaking, he also later claimed it was the film into which he had put the most of his personal influence. Dante imagined \"Gremlins 2\" as a satire of \"Gremlins\" and sequels in general. Another basic description of \"Gremlins 2\" was that, as Dante said, an hour into the film it becomes \"extremely cartoony.\"\n\nThe recommended screenwriter, Charlie Haas, brought to the project the basic storyline of moving the gremlins to New York City, and he also imagined a corporate head (the character Clamp) being Billy's boss and at the center of the new disaster. When the Warner Bros. executives grew concerned about the expense of portraying the gremlins attacking an entire city, Haas came up with the idea of confining the action within Daniel Clamp's \"smart building\". Haas also included a great deal of material in his screenplay that proved too elaborate to produce, including having a cow–hamster hybrid running on a treadmill in the laboratory.\n\nIn keeping with Dante's desires to satirize the original film, the sequel has some meta-references and self-referential humor. These include a cameo appearance by film critic Leonard Maltin. He holds up a copy of the original \"Gremlins\" home video and denounces it, just as he had in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him. Partly for this scene, one academic called Dante \"one of contemporary cinema's great pranksters.\"\n\nAdditionally, when Billy is trying to explain the rules regarding the mogwai to staff in the building, the staff find them quite absurd and derisively interrogate Billy on their precise meaning; at one point considering the thought experiment of a mogwai in a plane which crosses a time zone. This scene originates from the fact that the filmmakers themselves saw the rules as irrational, and some questions in the scene were based upon those raised by fans of the original film.\n\nAt one point in the film, Dante attempted to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where \"Gremlins 2\" was showing. The film strip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in shadow puppetry over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film \"Volleyball Holiday\". Hulk Hogan then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of \"Gremlins 2\". This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in William Castle's film \"The Tingler\" (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene as one of the most widely enjoyed jokes in \"Gremlins 2\". When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of \"Chisum\", where John Wayne forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor Chad Everett was recommended by Wayne's son Patrick Wayne. Notably, a clip from \"Falling Hare\", a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured Paul Bartel; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).\n\nThe original version of the film was longer, but executive producer Steven Spielberg claimed that there were too many gremlins, and several scenes were cut as a result. One deleted scene portrayed three of the main gremlins, Daffy, Lenny, and George, sneaking into television host Grandpa Fred's studio and \"helping\" him host, acting on the premise that Grandpa Fred's show was intended to be scary (though this scene was later included in the tie-in novel).\n\nSeveral actors from the original film returned to make \"Gremlins 2\", including Galligan, Cates, and Dick Miller. Miller reprised his role as Billy's neighbor Mr. Futterman, who the gremlins severely injured (both physically and mostly mentally) in the first film, in an expanded role in this film. In the second, he plays a part in wiping out the creatures by dousing one in cement and using the building's fire hose against the others. Character actress Jackie Joseph returned to play Mr. Futterman's wife, and there were also brief reappearances in the movie theatre sequence from Belinda Balaski as a complaining mother and Kenneth Tobey as the projectionist. Keye Luke also returned to play Mr. Wing, Gizmo's original owner. When Luke heard his character would die in \"Gremlins 2\", he quipped, \"Remember, when you make \"Gremlins 3\", I'm a flashback!\". Hoyt Axton was meant to return as Billy's father, the inventor. He would have appeared at the end of the film, having designed special clothing for Gizmo that would ensure Gizmo would never come into contact with water again. At the last moment, the filmmakers decided not to shoot the scene to reduce time.\n\nNew performers included Robert Picardo, who had previously worked with Dante and producer Michael Finnell in films such as \"The Howling\" (1981). He plays Forster, one of Billy's crueler bosses. Robert Prosky played Grandpa Fred, a television host, and his character was based upon Al Lewis's character Grandpa Munster. Joe Dante has a brief cameo as the director of Grandpa Fred's show. John Glover played Clamp (character based upon Donald Trump and Ted Turner) and brought to the role an enthusiastic innocence that overrode the fact that his character had been written as a villain, which Dante thought lightened the film in general.\n\nChristopher Lee (who previously worked with Spielberg in \"1941\") played the mad scientist Dr. Catheter. Lee imagined his role as light-hearted; but Dante encouraged him to portray the scientist as evil to better match the atmosphere of the laboratory set. Lee was revered on the set for his experience. In a deleted scene, Dr. Catheter examines a bat injected with \"genetic sun-block\". He then says to his colleague, \"I'm told they sometimes feed on blood\"; this is a reference to Lee's performances as Count Dracula in the \"Hammer Horror\" films. Later, as the Bat Gremlin is transforming, Dr. Catheter experiences Deja-vu (the audience hears Dracula music).\n\nFor special effects, the original film relied on Chris Walas, who moved on to pursue a directing career. Dante turned to Academy Award-winner Rick Baker to create the effects for \"Gremlins 2\". Baker was not interested, as he saw \"Gremlins 2\" as too much work for a project in which he would not be the creator but rather a successor to Walas. He was eventually persuaded to accept the job when it was suggested he could make the gremlins and mogwai more diverse.\n\nIn the first film, when Gizmo multiplied, his off-spring closely resembled himself, except for the leader, Stripe. Here, the four mogwai Gizmo produces each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features. Additionally, each mogwai has a name, although the names were used in the script and never spoken aloud in the film. Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of Edward G. Robinson, and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in \"Of Mice and Men\", whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his mohawk hairstyle. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, Frank Welker also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker hit upon the idea of giving the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in \"Gremlins 2\", but the result was that Gizmo could convey more emotion.\n\nLater on, when the mogwai metamorphose into gremlins and multiply, they further diversify by running amok in the bio-lab and ingesting various drugs. One turns into a sunlight-resistant hybrid with a bat, thus becoming the Bat Gremlin. Mohawk becomes part-spider. One becomes part-vegetable (Vegetable Gremlin, as Dante named it), and another consumes a drug and turns into a female gremlin, referred to in at least one script as the \"Girl Gremlin\" and in the official trading card series and other promotional materials as \"Lady Gremlina\" with shiny red lips and mascara. Yet another has acid thrown onto his face, quickly presenting a mask of the Phantom of the Opera.\n\nAs with the first, puppetry was involved, and some of the puppets were mechanical. An actor holding a puppet would have to have wires strapped to him. \"Gremlins 2\" also includes more stop motion animation than the first film; the Bat Gremlin was portrayed through some stop motion animation. Film technology since the original had improved, and as a result the creatures can be seen walking more. Gizmo is able to dance, although this scene took the longest to make. Because there are more gremlins in \"Gremlins 2\" than the original, additional filming lasted five months. Many of the effects had to be completed after the actors had finished their work.\n\nFor the Gremlins' voices, Howie Mandel returned as the voice of Gizmo, while Tony Randall provided the voice of the Brain Gremlin, Frank Welker provided the voice for Mohawk, Mark Dodson provided voices for George, Lenny, and Daffy, Joe Dante provided voices for the Beanie Gremlin and the Witch Gremlin, Nancy McConnor provided the voice for the Bat Gremlin, while Kirk Thatcher provided voices for most of the Gremlins, alongside Welker.\n\nAs with the first film, the music in \"Gremlins 2\" was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, who also has a cameo in the film alongside his wife. In the latter half of the film, Gizmo, inspired by the \"Rambo\" films and tired of the abuse he has suffered at the hands of the gremlins, takes revenge on Mohawk. Gizmo shoots the Mohawk spider-gremlin with a makeshift bow and flaming arrow. For the scene in which Gizmo prepares for this move, Goldsmith – who had also authored the music in the \"Rambo\" films – employed a variant of Gizmo's theme in the style of the \"Rambo\" theme. The soundtrack was released August 31, 1990 through Varèse Sarabande and features twelve tracks of score at a running time just under forty minutes.\n\nThe scene featuring Mohawk transforming into a spider-like monster features a portion of the song \"Angel of Death\" by thrash metal band Slayer. In another scene, the Brain Gremlin leads hundreds of gremlins to sing \"New York, New York\". Dante claimed that \"The musical number is a shameless steal\" from the film \"Dames\" (1934).\n\nFilm critics varied in their reviews of \"Gremlins 2\", on Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.\" Roger Ebert, who had approved of the first film, observed that \"Gremlins 2\" was meant to satirize sequels. Nevertheless, he felt it did not manage to differentiate itself from the original enough and was not as good. He went on to claim that the film lacks a well-constructed plot, and once the Gremlins arrived the film simply becomes a \"series of gags.\" He thus gave the film two and a half stars, out of a possible four.\nHal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" caught on to how the \"Looney Tunes\" animation is meant to imply \"anarchic wit,\" but nevertheless felt both the cartoon short and the film itself are failures. He saw the beginning as too slow and, like Ebert, thought the film is too similar to the first. Hinson did, however, approve of the characterization of the gremlins and their version of \"New York, New York.\" He also noted that turning the gremlins against Clamp resembles anti-corporate \"poetic justice.\"\n\nIn contrast, while one reviewer for \"Films in Review\", like Ebert, argued the film resembles the original and abandons its plot when the gremlins arrive, he also felt the film's appeal could be found partly in its self-consciousness of these facts and its in-jokes and satire. He also complimented Cates as \"wholesomely bewitching,\" and Galligan as \"a suitably naive foil for the scaly fiends.\"\nDesson Howe of \"The Washington Post\" also approved of the film, including its special effects and the parodies of Trump, Turner, genetics labs, cable television, and the film \"Marathon Man\".\nSome critics thought the film has qualities the original lacked, such as wit. A critic for \"National Review\" called the film \"much freer and wittier than the first one,\" though he felt the sequel shies away from becoming an important piece of satire.\nThe cover of an issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\" in July 1990 also exclaimed that \"actor John Glover... and director Joe Dante made \"Gremlins 2\" wittier, better, and more subversive than the original.\" Some critics who found the first film too dark also gave \"Gremlins 2\" more positive reviews. Leonard Maltin, who appears in the film, gave it three out of four stars for its references to other films, Glover's imitation of Turner and Trump, and Lee's performance. \"VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever\" gave the film three-and-a-half bones out of four as opposed to the three bones given to the original, stating: \nAn Allmovie critic complimented the sequel by saying the \"original's violence and mean-spiritedness are gone, making this follow-up somewhat more kid-friendly.\" The film was nominated for several Saturn Awards, namely for Best Director, Best Fantasy Film, Best Music, and Best Special Effects. Glover and Picardo were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award.\n\nStill, the film did not perform as well at the box office. The trailer introduced the film to audiences by displaying a surface of water intercut with scenes from the original. A narrator goes over the rules regarding how to safely handle mogwai. After the narrator says, \"You didn't listen [to the rules],\" scenes from the sequel are shown, revealing the gremlins morphing into strange new creatures and then ending with the Brain Gremlin speaking. \"Gremlins 2\" was released into US theatres on June 15, 1990, the same day as \"Dick Tracy\". In its first weekend it made $9,702,804, and it ultimately made $41,482,207. It was thus only the thirty-first highest-grossing film of the year, behind a few other films in the comedy, horror or fantasy genre, such as \"Back to the Future Part III\" ($87,727,583), \"Edward Scissorhands\" ($56,362,352), and \"Arachnophobia\" ($53,208,180). It did, however, outperform \"Predator 2\" ($30,669,413), \"Child's Play 2\" ($28,501,605) and \"The Exorcist III\" ($26,098,824).\n\n\"Gremlins 2\" also played in other countries. Canadian audiences reportedly enjoyed one scene in which Billy and his boss meet at a Canadian-themed restaurant, where the waiters are dressed like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The film was released in Norway on July 5, Finland on July 6, Colombia on July 12, and much of Europe in the rest of July, including in the United Kingdom and Spain on July 27. It opened in France and Argentina in August and reached Australia on September 20. It earned £7,400,000 in the United Kingdom. Later, the film made an additional $20,800,000 in rental stores.\n\nIn 2015, comedy duo Key & Peele spoofed \"Gremlins 2\" with a sketch imagining what the writers' room for the movie was like.\n\nAs with the first film, merchandising accompanied \"Gremlins 2\". This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, \"it's a savvy, off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, yes, it is just one more silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film.\" One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.\n\nThe new merchandise released alongside the film included PVC figures, plush, and other collectibles by the now-defunct Applause company in 1990. Much later, action figures by the National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA Toys) based on characters such as the Brain and Mohawk Gremlins were released. NECA is also releasing mogwais and gremlins from the film in late 2011 and 2012; there will be mogwai and gremlin versions of Daffy, Lenny and George, as well as a mogwai version of Mohawk. The Electric gremlin, flasher gremlin and the Phantom of the Opera gremlin will also be released in action figure form by NECA. There are also newer versions of Gizmo being released, including his Rambo look. Greta, a newer version of Mohawk and Mohawk in Spider form are also being planned for the future.\n\nThere were also children's books like \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook\", by Michael Teitelbaum, published by Goldencraft in December 1990. Little Golden Books published \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Gizmo to the Rescue\" in July 1990. In the United Kingdom, William Heinemann Ltd. had published two tie-in picture books from Buzz Books in August 1990 which contains photographs and scenes taken from the film. They were titled \"Don't Get Wet\" and \"Midnight Feast\". Buzz Books had also released other picture books that are particularly suitable for children such as \"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends\", \"Fireman Sam\", \"TUGS\", \"The Flintstones\", \"The Animals of Farthing Wood\", \"Looney Tunes\", \"Bugs Bunny\", \"Joshua Jones\" and \"Rupert\". David Bischoff wrote a novel based on the film published by Avon Books in June 1990. A unique aspect of the novel is how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for a little bit to explain that the Gremlins take over at this point in the film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname \"Mr. Glasses\" instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of the bathroom with an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin. The novel then continues where the film picked up after the film break.\n\nThe Spanish company Topo Soft developed a side-scrolling \"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\" video game for Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, MSX, Amstrad CPC and the ZX Spectrum, distributed by Erbe Software in Spain and by Elite abroad, being the first time a Spanish video game company got an exclusive license from a Hollywood movie to make a videogame. Hi-Tech Expressions also released a DOS game at around the same time, but it was poorly received. Sunsoft released for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in 1990.\n\nIn January 2013, Vulture reported that Warner Bros. was negotiating with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment to reboot the \"Gremlins\" franchise. Seth Grahame-Smith was tapped to produce, alongside David Katzenberg. However, Grahame-Smith has since stated that the project has been put on hold. In November 2015 Zach Galligan confirmed that the third film will be a sequel and not a reboot.\n\nIn a December 2016 interview with \"Bleeding Cool\", Galligan again spoke about a third film saying that \"Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus wants to do it because he'd like to undo the \"Gremlins 2\" thing as he wasn't thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he's Spielberg – and why wouldn't he want to do it.\" He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed that there will be no remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that Columbus \"has been aggressively working on a \"Gremlins 3\"\" and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. \"Gremlins 3\" takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a \"\" type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between \"Gremlins\" and \"Gremlins 2\"; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was 'gremlins in Vegas'. They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I'm working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now.\" Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.\n\nIn a interview with \"/Film\" in 2017, a script was written by Chris Columbus. His script explored the idea that has been on the fans' minds for a long time: \"if all the gremlins come from getting Gizmo wet and feeding his mogwai offspring after midnight, should Gizmo be eliminated?\" He described his script as \"twisted and dark\".\n\n"}
{"id": "17106153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17106153", "title": "Herndon Building", "text": "Herndon Building\n\nThe Herndon Building was a contributing property in the Sweet Auburn Historic District of Atlanta, Georgia, located across Auburn Avenue from the Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium.\n\nBegun in 1924 and completed the following year, it was a three-story L-shaped brick building, \"easily recognized by the large H located on the front facade of the building\". It was used as a professional building by several different businessmen and women, including a doctor's office and a pharmacy.\n\nVacant and collapsing (shown on Google Maps and Street View), it was already fit for condemnation when it was seriously damaged in the 2008 Atlanta tornado (which also passed very close to the Herndon Home). It was demolished in late April 2008 as a direct result of this. Currently, the Butler Street YMCA, which owns the property (and is located to the southwest of it just across Jesse Hill Jr. Drive, formerly Butler Street), has no plans for the site.\n\nThe Herndon Building was one of three contributing properties in the historic district which were associated with the life of Alonzo Herndon. The Atlanta Life Insurance Company Building and the Rucker Building are the other two.\n\n"}
{"id": "16276669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16276669", "title": "Höcker Album", "text": "Höcker Album\n\nThe Höcker Album (or Hoecker Album) is a collection of photographs believed to have been collected by Karl-Friedrich Höcker, an officer for the SS during the Nazi regime in Germany. It contains over one hundred images of the lives and living conditions of the officers and administrators who ran the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp complex. The album is unique, and an indispensable document of the Holocaust; it is now in the archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to the museum, the photograph album was found by an unidentified American counterintelligence officer who was billeted in Frankfurt after Germany's surrender in 1945. This officer discovered the photo album in an apartment there, and when he returned to the United States, he brought the album with him.\n\nIn January 2007, the American officer donated the album to the USHMM, with the request that his identity not be disclosed. The captions of the photographs, and the people featured in the images, quickly confirmed that it depicts life in and around the Auschwitz camps. The very first photograph is a double portrait of Richard Baer, Auschwitz camp commandant between 1944 and 1945, and Baer's adjutant, Karl Höcker.\n\nThe album contains 116 photographs, all in black and white, almost all of them featuring German officers. It is believed to have been the property of Höcker because he appears in far more of the images than any other individual. On the title page underneath a picture of Höcker and Baer written is \"With the Commandant SS Stubaf. Baer, Auschwitz 21.6.44\", identifying Höcker as the owner of the album. He is also the only person in the album to appear alone in any of the images.\n\nSome of the images depict formal events, like military funerals and the dedication of a new hospital. They also include images of the camp officers relaxing at a staff retreat known as the \"Solahütte,\" a rustic lodge only around 20 miles away from the camp complex. These images are regarded as the most striking, because they show cheerful staff officers singing, drinking and eating while, in the camp itself, tremendous suffering is taking place.\n\nA number of the photographs show officers relaxing in the company of young women—stenographers and typists who were known generally as \"Helferinnen\", the German word for (female) \"helpers.\"\n\nBoth of the camp's most well-known commanders, Richard Baer and Rudolf Höss, are visible in the photographs. But possibly the most notorious Auschwitz figure who features in the album is Dr. Josef Mengele, known to camp prisoners as the \"Angel of Death.\" Mengele, a trained physician, directed the medical experiments on twin children in the camp. He regularly took part in the \"selection\" on the train arrival platform, judging which prisoners would be immediately executed and which would be permitted to live and perform slave labor.\n\nIn all, the album contains eight photographs in which Mengele appears. Before the donation of the album to the museum, no images were known to exist showing him within the camp grounds.\n\nThe photographs in the Höcker Album are viewed as especially chilling because of the time during which they were made, between June and December 1944. It has been noted by archivists and historians that this period overlaps with the mass extermination of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews in the spring and summer of 1944—an event known as \"the Hungarian Transport\". These Jews were gathered and shipped to Auschwitz after the March 1944 invasion by the Nazis of Hungary. So many Hungarian Jews were killed in the Auschwitz camps during that period that the crematoria were incapable of consuming all the bodies, and open pits for the purpose were dug. The contrast of these events with the singing, flirting and blueberry-eating in the Höcker album is particularly disturbing.\n\nAccording to Rebecca Erbelding, the museum archivist who received the album from its donor and first recognized its significance, \"the album reminds us that the perpetrators of the Holocaust were human beings, men and women with families, children and pets, who celebrated holidays and took vacations... These people were human beings... and these photographs remind us what human beings are capable of when they succumb to anti-Semitism, racism and hatred.\"\n\nHöcker married before the war and had a son and daughter during the war, with whom he was reunited after his release from 18 months in a British POW camp in 1946. Early in the 1960s he was apprehended by West German authorities in his hometown, where he was a bank official. It is not known why the bank rehired and promoted him after a long absence during which he had nothing to do with banking.\n\nAt his trial in Frankfurt, part of the noted Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, Höcker denied having participated in the selection of victims at Birkenau or having ever personally executed a prisoner. He further denied any knowledge of the fate of the approximately 400,000 Hungarian Jews who were murdered at Auschwitz during his term of service at the camp. Höcker was shown to have knowledge of the genocidal activities at the camp, but could not be proved to have played a direct part in them. In postwar trials, Höcker denied his involvement in the selection process. While accounts from survivors and other SS officers all but placed him there, prosecutors could locate no conclusive evidence to prove the claim.\n\nIn August 1965 Höcker was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for aiding and abetting in over 1,000 murders at Auschwitz.

{"id": "18630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18630", "title": "Lilith", "text": "Lilith\n\nLilith (; \"Lîlîṯ\") is a figure in Jewish mythology, developed earliest in the Babylonian Talmud (3rd to 5th centuries). Lilith is often envisioned as a dangerous demon of the night, who is sexually wanton, and who steals babies in the darkness. Lilith may be linked in part to a historically earlier class of female demons (\"lilītu\") in ancient Mesopotamian religion, found in cuneiform texts of Sumer, the Akkadian Empire, Assyria, and Babylonia.\n\nIn Jewish folklore,\"Alphabet of Sirach\" (c. 700–1000 CE) onwards, Lilith appears as Adam's first wife, who was created at the same time (Rosh Hashanah) and from the same clay as Adam—compare Genesis 1:27. (This contrasts with Eve, who was created from one of Adam's ribs: Genesis 2:22.) The legend developed extensively during the Middle Ages, in the tradition of Aggadah, the Zohar, and Jewish mysticism. For example, in the 13th-century writings of Isaac ben Jacob ha-Cohen, Lilith left Adam after she refused to become subservient to him and then would not return to the Garden of Eden after she had coupled with the archangel Samael.\n\nEvidence in later Jewish materials is plentiful, but little information has survived relating to the Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian view of this class of demons. While the connection is almost universally agreed upon, recent scholarship has disputed the relevance of two sources previously used to connect the Jewish \"lilith\" to an Akkadian \"lilītu\"—the Gilgamesh appendix and the Arslan Tash amulets. (See below for discussion of the two problematic sources.)\n\nIn Hebrew-language texts, the term \"lilith\" or \"lilit\" (translated as \"night creatures\", \"night monster\", \"night hag\", or \"screech owl\") first occurs in a list of animals in Isaiah 34:14, either in singular or plural form according to variations in the earliest manuscripts. In the Dead Sea Scrolls \"4Q510-511\", the term first occurs in a list of monsters. In Jewish magical inscriptions on bowls and amulets from the 6th century CE onwards, Lilith is identified as a female demon and the first visual depictions appear.\n\nThe resulting Lilith legend continues to serve as source material in modern Western culture, literature, occultism, fantasy, and horror.\n\nThe Semitic root L-Y-L served as derivative for the Hebrew \"layil\" and Arabic \"layl\", meaning \"night\". The Talmudic and Yiddish use of \"Lilith\" is cognate with the Hebrew.\n\nIn the Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia, the terms \"lili\" and \"līlītu\" mean spirits. Some uses of \"līlītu\" are listed in The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (CAD, 1956, L.190), in Wolfram von Soden's \"Akkadisches Handwörterbuch\" (AHw, p. 553), and \"Reallexikon der Assyriologie\" (RLA, p. 47).\n\nThe Sumerian female demons \"lili\" have no etymological relation to Akkadian \"lilu\", \"evening\".\n\nArchibald Sayce (1882) considered that Hebrew \"lilit\" (or \"lilith\") and the earlier Akkadian \"līlītu\" are from proto-Semitic. Charles Fossey (1902) has this literally translating to \"female night being/demon\", although cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia exist where \"Līlīt\" and \"Līlītu\" refers to disease-bearing wind spirits. Another possibility is association not with \"night\", but with \"wind\", thus identifying the Akkadian \"Lil-itu\" as a loan from the Sumerian \"lil\" \"air\" — specifically from \"Ninlil\", \"lady air\", goddess of the south wind (and wife of Enlil) — and \"itud\", \"moon\".\n\nSamuel Noah Kramer (1932, published 1938) translated \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" as \"Lilith\" in \"Tablet XII\" of the Epic of Gilgamesh dated c.600 BC. \"Tablet XII\" is not part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, but is a later Assyrian Akkadian translation of the latter part of the Sumerian poem of \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\". The \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" is associated with a serpent and a zu bird. In \"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\", a huluppu tree grows in Inanna's garden in Uruk, whose wood she plans to use to build a new throne. After ten years of growth, she comes to harvest it and finds a serpent living at its base, a Zu bird raising young in its crown, and that a \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" made a house in its trunk. Gilgamesh is said to have killed the snake, and then the zu bird flew away to the mountains with its young, while the \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" fearfully destroys its house and runs for the forest. Identification of \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" as \"Lilith\" is stated in \"Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible\" (1999). According to a new source from Late Antiquity, Lilith appears in a Mandaic magic story where she is considered to represent the branches of a tree with other demonic figures that form other parts of the tree, though this may also include multiple \"Liliths\".\n\nSuggested translations for the Tablet XII spirit in the tree include \"ki-sikil\" as \"sacred place\", \"lil\" as \"spirit\", and \"lil-la-ke\" as \"water spirit\". but also simply \"owl\", given that the \"lil\" is building a home in the trunk of the tree.\n\nA connection between the Gilgamesh \"ki-sikil-lil-la-ke\" and the Jewish Lilith was rejected by Dietrich Opitz (1932) and rejected on textual grounds by Sergio Ribichini (1978).\n\nKramer's translation of the Gilgamesh fragment was used by Henri Frankfort (1937) and Emil Kraeling (1937) to support identification of a woman with wings and bird-feet in the Burney Relief as related to Lilith, but this has been rejected by later sources, including the British Museum, which is in current possession of the piece.\nThe terracotta plaque depicts a beautiful, naked goddess-like sylph with bird-like features who stands atop two lions and between two owls. Although once believed to be the actual image of Lilith, it is now thought to possibly represent Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of love, fertility, beauty, war, and sexual desire. The depiction of the nocturnal and predatory owls, however, have led many to believe the relief is an affirmation of Lilith’s role as a demon who flies about the underworld, delivering night terrors to those who sleep.\n\nThe Arslan Tash amulets are limestone plaques discovered in 1933 at Arslan Tash, the authenticity of which is disputed. William F. Albright, Theodor H. Gaster, and others, accepted the amulets as a pre-Jewish source which shows that the name Lilith already existed in the 7th century BCE but Torczyner (1947) identified the amulets as a later Jewish source.\n\nThe only occurrence is in the Book of Isaiah 34:14, describing the desolation of Edom, where the Hebrew word \"lilit\" (or \"lilith\") appears in a list of eight unclean animals, some of which may have demonic associations. The word \"lilit\" (or \"lilith\") only appears once in the Hebrew Bible, while the other seven terms in the list appear more than once and thus are better documented. The reading of scholars and translators is often guided by a decision about the complete list of eight creatures as a whole. Quoting from Isaiah 34 (NAB):\nIn the Masoretic Text:\nIn the Dead Sea Scrolls, among the 19 fragments of Isaiah found at Qumran, the Great Isaiah Scroll (1Q1Isa) in 34:14 renders the creature as plural \"liliyyot\" (or \"liliyyoth\").\n\nEberhard Schrader (1875) and Moritz Abraham Levy (1885) suggest that Lilith was a goddess of the night, known also by the Jewish exiles in Babylon. Schrader's and Levy's view is therefore partly dependent on a later dating of Deutero-Isaiah to the 6th century BC, and the presence of Jews in Babylon which would coincide with the possible references to the \"\" in Babylonian demonology. However, this view is challenged by some modern research such as by Judit M. Blair (2009) who considers that the context indicates unclean animals.\n\nThe Septuagint translates the reference into Greek as \"onokentauros\", apparently for lack of a better word, since also the \"se'irim\", \"satyrs\", earlier in the verse are translated with \"daimon onokentauros\". The \"wild beasts of the island and the desert\" are omitted altogether, and the \"crying to his fellow\" is also done by the \"daimon onokentauros\".\n\nThe early 5th-century Vulgate translated the same word as \"lamia\".\n\nThe translation is, \"And demons shall meet with monsters, and one hairy one shall cry out to another; there the lamia has lain down and found rest for herself\".\n\nWycliffe's Bible (1395) preserves the Latin rendering \"lamia\":\n\nThe Bishops' Bible of Matthew Parker (1568) from the Latin:\n\nDouay–Rheims Bible (1582/1610) also preserves the Latin rendering \"lamia\":\n\nThe Geneva Bible of William Madison Whittington (1587) from the Hebrew:\n\nThen the King James Version (1611):\n\nThe \"screech owl\" translation of the King James Version is, together with the \"owl\" (', probably a water bird) in 34:11 and the \"great owl\" (', properly a snake) of 34:15, an attempt to render the passage by choosing suitable animals for difficult-to-translate Hebrew words.\n\nLater translations include:\n\nMajor sources in Jewish tradition regarding Lilith in chronological order include:\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls contain one indisputable reference to Lilith in \"Songs of the Sage\" (4Q510–511) fragment 1:\n\nAnd I, the Instructor, proclaim His glorious splendour so as to frighten and to te[rrify] all the spirits of the destroying angels, spirits of the bastards, demons, Lilith, howlers, and [desert dwellers] ... and those which fall upon men without warning to lead them astray from a spirit of understanding and to make their heart and their ... desolate during the present dominion of wickedness and predetermined time of humiliations for the sons of lig[ht], by the guilt of the ages of [those] smitten by iniquity – not for eternal destruction, [bu]t for an era of humiliation for transgression.\n\nAs with the Massoretic Text of Isaiah 34:14, and therefore unlike the plural \"liliyyot\" (or \"liliyyoth\") in the Isaiah scroll 34:14, \"lilit\" in 4Q510 is singular, this liturgical text both cautions against the presence of supernatural malevolence and assumes familiarity with Lilith; distinct from the biblical text, however, this passage does not function under any socio-political agenda, but instead serves in the same capacity as An Exorcism (4Q560) and Songs to Disperse Demons (11Q11). The text is thus, to a community \"deeply involved in the realm of demonology\", an exorcism hymn.\n\nJoseph M. Baumgarten (1991) identified the unnamed woman of \"The Seductress\" (4Q184) as related to female demon. However, John J. Collins regards this identification as \"intriguing\" but that it is \"safe to say\" that (4Q184) is based on the strange woman of Proverbs 2, 5, 7, 9:\n\nLilith does not occur in the Mishnah. There are five references to Lilith in the Babylonian Talmud in Gemara on three separate Tractates of the Mishnah:\n\nThe above statement by Hanina may be related to the belief that nocturnal emissions engendered the birth of demons:\n\nThe Midrash Rabbah collection contains two references to Lilith. The first one is present in Genesis Rabbah 22:7 and 18:4: according to Rabbi Hiyya God proceeded to create a second Eve for Adam, after Lilith had to return to dust. However, to be exact the said passages do not employ the Heb. word \"lilith\" itself and instead speak of \"the first Eve\" (Heb. \"Chavvah ha-Rishonah\", analogically to the phrase \"Adam ha-Rishon\", i.e. the first Adam). Although in the medieval Hebrew literature and folklore, especially that reflected on the protective amulets of various kinds, \"Chavvah ha-Rishonah\" was identified with Lilith, one should remain careful in transposing this equation to the Late Antiquity.\n\nThe second mention of Lilith, this time explicit, is present in Numbers Rabbah 16:25. The midrash develops the story of Moses' plea after God expresses anger at the bad report of the spies. Moses responds to a threat by God that He will destroy the Israelite people. Moses pleads before God, that God should not be like Lilith who kills her own children. Moses said:[God,] do not do it [i.e. destroy the Israelite people], that the nations of the world may not regard you as a cruel Being and say: ' The Generation of the Flood came and He destroyed them, the Generation of the Separation came and He destroyed them, the Sodomites and the Egyptians came and He destroyed them, and these also, whom he called My son, My firstborn (Ex. IV, 22), He is now destroying! As that Lilith who, when she finds nothing else, turns upon her own children, so Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land... He hath slain them’ (Num. XIV, 16)!\n\nAn individual Lilith, along with Bagdana \"king of the lilits\", is one of the demons to feature prominently in protective spells in the eighty surviving Jewish occult incantation bowls from Sassanid Empire Babylon (4th–6th century CE). These bowls were buried upside down in houses to trap the demon, and almost every Jewish house in Nippur was found to have such protective bowls buried. One bowl contains the following inscription commissioned from a Jewish occultist to protect a woman called Rashnoi and her husband from Lilith:\n\nThe pseudepigraphical 8th–10th centuries \"Alphabet of Ben Sira\" is considered to be the oldest form of the story of Lilith as Adam's first wife. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date the Alphabet between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. The work has been characterized as satirical.\n\nIn the text an amulet is inscribed with the names of three angels (Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof) and placed around the neck of newborn boys in order to protect them from the lilin until their circumcision. The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are, in fact, dated as being much older. The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to the Alphabet, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in Genesis Rabbah. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor may be exclusive to the Alphabet.\n\nThe idea in the text that Adam had a wife prior to Eve may have developed from an interpretation of the Book of Genesis and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\" The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that \"it is not good for man to be alone\"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way they were equal and she refuses to submit to him:\n\nAfter God created Adam, who was alone, He said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, \"I will not lie below,\" and he said, \"I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.\" Lilith responded, \"We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.\" But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.\n\nAdam stood in prayer before his Creator: \"Sovereign of the universe!\" he said, \"the woman you gave me has run away.\" At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to bring her back.\n\nSaid the Holy One to Adam, \"If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.\" The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, \"We shall drown you in the sea.\"\n\n\"Leave me!' she said. \"I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.\"\n\nWhen the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: \"Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.\" She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.\n\nThe background and purpose of \"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\" is unclear. It is a collection of stories about heroes of the Bible and Talmud, it may have been a collection of folk-tales, a refutation of Christian, Karaite, or other separatist movements; its content seems so offensive to contemporary Jews that it was even suggested that it could be an anti-Jewish satire, although, in any case, the text was accepted by the Jewish mystics of medieval Germany. In turn, other scholars argue that the target of the \"Alphabet's\" satire is very difficult to establish exactly because of the variety of the figures and values ridiculed therein: criticism is actually directed against Adam, who turns out to be weak and ineffective in his relations with his wife. Apparently, the first man is not the only male figure who is mocked: even God cannot subjugate Lilith and needs to ask his messengers, who only manage to go as far as negotiating the conditions of the agreement.\n\n\"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\" is the earliest surviving source of the story, and the conception that Lilith was Adam's first wife became only widely known with the 17th century \"Lexicon Talmudicum\" of German scholar Johannes Buxtorf.\n\nIn this folk tradition that arose in the early Middle Ages Lilith, a dominant female demon, became identified with Asmodeus, King of Demons, as his queen. Asmodeus was already well known by this time because of the legends about him in the Talmud. Thus, the merging of Lilith and Asmodeus was inevitable. The second myth of Lilith grew to include legends about another world and by some accounts this other world existed side by side with this one, \"Yenne Velt\" is Yiddish for this described \"Other World\". In this case Asmodeus and Lilith were believed to procreate demonic offspring endlessly and spread chaos at every turn. Many disasters were blamed on both of them, causing wine to turn into vinegar, men to be impotent, women unable to give birth, and it was Lilith who was blamed for the loss of infant life. The presence of Lilith and her cohorts were considered very real at this time.\n\nTwo primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates. These two aspects of the Lilith legend seemed to have evolved separately; there is hardly a tale where she encompasses both roles. But the aspect of the witch-like role that Lilith plays broadens her archetype of the destructive side of witchcraft. Such stories are commonly found among Jewish folklore.\n\nAlthough the image of Lilith of the \"Alphabet of Ben Sira\" is unprecedented, some elements in her portrayal can be traced back to the talmudic and midrashic traditions that arose around Eve:\n\n\nKabbalistic mysticism attempted to establish a more exact relationship between Lilith and the Deity. With her major characteristics having been well-developed by the end of the Talmudic period, after six centuries had elapsed between the Aramaic incantation texts that mention Lilith and the early Spanish Kabbalistic writings in the 13th century, she reappears, and her life history becomes known in greater mythological detail.\n\nHer creation is described in many alternative versions. One mentions her creation as being before Adam's, on the fifth day, because the \"living creatures\" with whose swarms God filled the waters included none other than Lilith. A similar version, related to the earlier Talmudic passages, recounts how Lilith was fashioned with the same substance as Adam was, shortly before. A third alternative version states that God originally created Adam and Lilith in a manner that the female creature was contained in the male. Lilith's soul was lodged in the depths of the Great Abyss. When God called her, she joined Adam. After Adam's body was created a thousand souls from the Left (evil) side attempted to attach themselves to him. However, God drove them off. Adam was left lying as a body without a soul. Then a cloud descended and God commanded the earth to produce a living soul. This God breathed into Adam, who began to spring to life and his female was attached to his side. God separated the female from Adam's side. The female side was Lilith, whereupon she flew to the Cities of the Sea and attacks humankind. Yet another version claims that Lilith emerged as a divine entity that was born spontaneously, either out of the Great Supernal Abyss or out of the power of an aspect of God (the Gevurah of Din). This aspect of God, one of his ten attributes (Sefirot), at its lowest manifestation has an affinity with the realm of evil and it is out of this that Lilith merged with Samael.\n\nAn alternative story links Lilith with the creation of luminaries. The \"first light\", which is the light of Mercy (one of the Sefirot), appeared on the first day of creation when God said \"Let there be light\". This light became hidden and the Holiness became surrounded by a husk of evil. \"A husk (klippa) was created around the brain\" and this husk spread and brought out another husk, which was Lilith.\n\nThe first medieval source to depict Adam and Lilith in full was the Midrash A.B.K.I.R. (c. 10th century), which was followed by the Zohar and Kabbalistic writings. Adam is said to be perfect until he recognizes either his sin or Cain's fratricide that is the cause of bringing death into the world. He then separates from holy Eve, sleeps alone, and fasts for 130 years. During this time Lilith, also known as Pizna, desired his beauty and came to him against his will.\n\nThe mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, which predates the Zohar by a few decades, states that Samael and Lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite. The two twin androgynous couples resembled each other and both \"were like the image of Above\"; that is, that they are reproduced in a visible form of an androgynous deity.\n\n19. In answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces.\n\nAnother version that was also current among Kabbalistic circles in the Middle Ages establishes Lilith as the first of Samael's four wives: Lilith, Naamah, Eisheth, and Agrat bat Mahlat. Each of them are mothers of demons and have their own hosts and unclean spirits in no number. The marriage of archangel Samael and Lilith was arranged by \"Blind Dragon\", who is the counterpart of \"the dragon that is in the sea\". Blind Dragon acts as an intermediary between Lilith and Samael:\n\nBlind Dragon rides Lilith the Sinful – may she be extirpated quickly in our days, Amen! – And this Blind Dragon brings about the union between Samael and Lilith. And just as the Dragon that is in the sea (Isa. 27:1) has no eyes, likewise Blind Dragon that is above, in the likeness of a spiritual form, is without eyes, that is to say, without colors. ... (Patai 81:458) Samael is called the Slant Serpent, and Lilith is called the Tortuous Serpent.\n\nThe marriage of Samael and Lilith is known as the \"Angel Satan\" or the \"Other God\", but it was not allowed to last. To prevent Lilith and Samael's demonic children \"Lilin\" from filling the world, God castrated Samael. In many 17th century Kabbalistic books, this mythologem is based on the identification of \"Leviathan the Slant Serpent and Leviathan the Torturous Serpent\" and a reinterpretation of an old Talmudic myth where God castrated the male Leviathan and slew the female Leviathan in order to prevent them from mating and thereby destroying the earth. After Samael became castrated and Lilith was unable to fornicate with him, she left him to couple with men who experience nocturnal emissions. A 15th or 16th century Kabbalah text states that God has \"cooled\" the female Leviathan, meaning that he has made Lilith infertile and she is a mere fornication.\n\nThe \"Treatise on the Left Emanation\" says that there are two Liliths, the lesser being married to the great demon Asmodeus.\n\nIn answer to your question concerning Lilith, I shall explain to you the essence of the matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition, it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces. The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.\n\nAnother passage charges Lilith as being a tempting serpent of Eve.\nAnd the Serpent, the Woman of Harlotry, incited and seduced Eve through the husks of Light which in itself is holiness. And the Serpent seduced Holy Eve, and enough said for him who understands. And all this ruination came about because Adam the first man coupled with Eve while she was in her menstrual impurity – this is the filth and the impure seed of the Serpent who mounted Eve before Adam mounted her. Behold, here it is before you: because of the sins of Adam the first man all the things mentioned came into being. For Evil Lilith, when she saw the greatness of his corruption, became strong in her husks, and came to Adam against his will, and became hot from him and bore him many demons and spirits and Lilin. (Patai81:455f)\nReferences to Lilith in the Zohar include the following:\n\nShe wanders about at night, vexing the sons of men and causing them to defile themselves (19b)\n\nThis passage may be related to the mention of Lilith in Talmud Shabbath 151b (see above), and also to Talmud Eruvin 18b where nocturnal emissions are connected with the begettal of demons.\n\nRaphael Patai states that older sources state clearly that after Lilith's Red Sea sojourn (mentioned also in Louis Ginzberg's \"Legends of the Jews\"), she returned to Adam and begat children from him. In the Zohar, however, Lilith is said to have succeeded in begetting offspring from Adam during their short-lived sexual experience. Lilith leaves Adam in Eden, as she is not a suitable helpmate for him. She returns, later, to force herself upon him. However, before doing so she attaches herself to Cain and bears him numerous spirits and demons.\n\nAccording to Gershom Scholem, the author of the Zohar, Rabbi Moses de Leon, was aware of the folk tradition of Lilith. He was also aware of another story, possibly older, that may be conflicting. According to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and Naamah — found Adam, desired his beauty which was like that of the sun disk, and lay with him. The issue of these unions were demons and spirits called \"the plagues of humankind\". The added explanation was that it was through Adam's own sin that Lilith overcame him against his will.\n\nA copy of Jean de Pauly's translation of the Zohar in the Ritman Library contains an inserted late 17th Century printed Hebrew sheet for use in magical amulets where the prophet Elijah confronts Lilith.\n\nThe sheet contains two texts within borders, which are amulets, one for a male ('lazakhar'), the other one for a female ('lanekevah'). The invocations mention Adam, Eve and Lilith, 'Chavah Rishonah' (the first Eve, who is identical with Lilith), also devils or angels: Sanoy, Sansinoy, Smangeluf, Shmari'el (the guardian) and Hasdi'el (the merciful). A few lines in Yiddish are followed by the dialogue between the prophet Elijah and Lilith when he met her with her host of demons to kill the mother and take her new-born child ('to drink her blood, suck her bones and eat her flesh'). She tells Elijah that she will lose her power if someone uses her secret names, which she reveals at the end: \"lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers hikpodu, ayalu, matrota ...\"\n\nIn other amulets, probably informed by \"The Alphabet of Ben-Sira\", she is Adam's first wife. (Yalqut Reubeni, Zohar 1:34b, 3:19)\n\nLilith is listed as one of the Qliphoth, corresponding to the Sephirah Malkuth in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. The demon Lilith, the evil woman, is described as a beautiful woman, who transforms into a blue, butterfly-like demon, and it is associated with the power of seduction.\n\nThe Qliphah is the unbalanced power of a Sephirah. Malkuth is the lowest Sephirah, the realm of the earth, into which all the divine energy flows, and in which the divine plan is worked out. However, its unbalanced form is as Lilith, the seductress. The material world, and all of its pleasures, is the ultimate seductress, and can lead to materialism unbalanced by the spirituality of the higher spheres. This ultimately leads to a descent into animal consciousness. The balance must therefore be found between Malkuth and Kether, to find order and harmony.\n\nIn the Latin Vulgate Book of Isaiah 34:14, Lilith is translated \"lamia\".\n\nAccording to Augustine Calmet, Lilith has connections with early views on vampire and sorcery:\n\nAccording to Siegmund Hurwitz the Talmudic Lilith is connected with the Greek Lamia, who, according to Hurwitz, likewise governed a class of child stealing lamia-demons. Lamia bore the title \"child killer\" and was feared for her malevolence, like Lilith. She has different conflicting origins and is described as having a human upper body from the waist up and a serpentine body from the waist down. One source states simply that she is a daughter of the goddess Hecate. Another, that Lamia was subsequently cursed by the goddess Hera to have stillborn children because of her association with Zeus; alternatively, Hera slew all of Lamia's children (except Scylla) in anger that Lamia slept with her husband, Zeus. The grief caused Lamia to turn into a monster that took revenge on mothers by stealing their children and devouring them. Lamia had a vicious sexual appetite that matched her cannibalistic appetite for children. She was notorious for being a vampiric spirit and loved sucking men's blood. Her gift was the \"mark of a Sibyl\", a gift of second sight. Zeus was said to have given her the gift of sight. However, she was \"cursed\" to never be able to shut her eyes so that she would forever obsess over her dead children. Taking pity on Lamia, Zeus gave her the ability to remove and replace her eyes from their sockets.\n\nThe Empusae were a class of supernatural demons that Lamia was said to have birthed. Hecate would often send them against travelers. They consumed or scared to death any of the people where they inhabited. They bear many similarities to lilim. It has been suggested that later medieval lore of the succubi or lilim is derived from this myth.\n\nLilith is not found in the Quran or Hadith. The Sufi occult writer Ahmad al-Buni (d. 1225), in his \"Sun of the Great Knowledge\" (), mentions a demon called \"the mother of children\", a term also used \"in one place\" in the \"Zohar\" and is therefore probably derived from Jewish mythology.\n\nLilith's earliest appearance in the literature of the Romantic period (1789–1832) was in Goethe's 1808 work \"\".\n\nAfter Mephistopheles offers this warning to Faust, he then, quite ironically, encourages Faust to dance with \"the Pretty Witch\". Lilith and Faust engage in a short dialogue, where Lilith recounts the days spent in Eden.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which developed around 1848, were greatly influenced by Goethe's work on the theme of Lilith. In 1863, Dante Gabriel Rossetti of the Brotherhood began painting what would later be his first rendition of \"Lady Lilith\", a painting he expected to be his \"best picture hitherto\". Symbols appearing in the painting allude to the \"femme fatale\" reputation of the Romantic Lilith: poppies (death and cold) and white roses (sterile passion). Accompanying his \"Lady Lilith\" painting from 1866, Rossetti wrote a sonnet entitled \"Lilith\", which was first published in Swinburne's pamphlet-review (1868), \"Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition\".\n\nThe poem and the picture appeared together alongside Rossetti's painting \"Sibylla Palmifera\" and the sonnet \"Soul's Beauty\". In 1881, the \"Lilith\" sonnet was renamed \"Body's Beauty\" in order to contrast it and \"Soul's Beauty\". The two were placed sequentially in \"The House of Life\" collection (sonnets number 77 and 78).\n\nRossetti wrote in 1870:\nThis is in accordance with Jewish folk tradition, which associates Lilith both with long hair (a symbol of dangerous feminine seductive power in Jewish culture), and with possessing women by entering them through mirrors.\n\nThe Victorian poet Robert Browning re-envisioned Lilith in his poem \"Adam, Lilith, and Eve\". First published in 1883, the poem uses the traditional myths surrounding the triad of Adam, Eve, and Lilith. Browning depicts Lilith and Eve as being friendly and complicitous with each other, as they sit together on either side of Adam. Under the threat of death, Eve admits that she never loved Adam, while Lilith confesses that she always loved him:\n\nBrowning focused on Lilith's emotional attributes, rather than that of her ancient demon predecessors.\n\nScottish author George MacDonald also wrote a fantasy novel entitled \"Lilith\", first published in 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present in the author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing at herself in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.\n\nAustralian poet and scholar Christopher John Brennan (1870–1932), included a section titled \"Lilith\" in his major work \"Poems: 1913\" (Sydney : G. B. Philip and Son, 1914). The \"Lilith\" section contains thirteen poems exploring the Lilith myth and is central to the meaning of the collection as a whole.\n\nC. L. Moore's 1940 story \"Fruit of Knowledge\" is written from Lilith's point of view. It is a re-telling of the Fall of Man as a love triangle between Lilith, Adam and Eve – with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.\n\nBritish poet John Siddique's 2011 collection \"Full Blood\" has a suite of 11 poems called \"The Tree of Life\", which features Lilith as the divine feminine aspect of God. A number of the poems feature Lilith directly, including the piece \"Unwritten\" which deals with the spiritual problem of the feminine being removed by the scribes from \"The Bible.\"\n\nLilith is also mentioned in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", by C.S.Lewis. The character Mr. Beaver ascribes the ancestry of the main antagonist, Jadis the White Witch, to Lilith.\n\nThe poem \"Lilith\" by the renowned 20th century Armenian writer Avetic Isahakyan is based on the Jewish legend. Isahakyan wrote \"Lilith\" in 1921 in Venice. His heroine was a creature who emerged from fire. Adam fell in love with Lilith, but Lilith was very indifferent, sympathy being her only feeling for the latter because Adam was a creature made of soil, not fire.\n\nIt is been argued that the term \"lullaby\" derives from \"Lilith-Abi\" (Hebrew for \"Lilith, begone\"). To guard against Lilith, Jewish mothers would hang four amulets on nursery walls with the inscription \"Lilith – abei\" [\"Lilith – begone\"].\n\nThe depiction of Lilith in Romanticism continues to be popular among Wiccans and in other modern Occultism. A few magical orders dedicated to the undercurrent of Lilith, featuring initiations specifically related to the arcana of the \"first mother\", exist. Two organizations that use initiations and magic associated with Lilith are the Ordo Antichristianus Illuminati and the Order of Phosphorus. Lilith appears as a succubus in Aleister Crowley's \"De Arte Magica.\" Lilith was also one of the middle names of Crowley’s first child, Nuit Ma Ahathoor Hecate Sappho Jezebel Lilith Crowley (1904–1906), and Lilith is sometimes identified with Babalon in Thelemic writings. Many early occult writers that contributed to modern day Wicca expressed special reverence for Lilith. Charles Leland associated Aradia with Lilith: Aradia, says Leland, is Herodias, who was regarded in stregheria folklore as being associated with Diana as chief of the witches. Leland further notes that Herodias is a name that comes from West Asia, where it denoted an early form of Lilith.\n\nGerald Gardner asserted that there was continuous historical worship of Lilith to present day, and that her name is sometimes given to the goddess being personified in the coven by the priestess. This idea was further attested by Doreen Valiente, who cited her as a presiding goddess of the Craft: \"the personification of erotic dreams, the suppressed desire for delights\". In some contemporary concepts, \"Lilith\" is viewed as the embodiment of the Goddess, a designation that is thought to be shared with what these faiths believe to be her counterparts: Inanna, Ishtar, Asherah, Anath and Isis. According to one view, Lilith was originally a Sumerian, Babylonian, or Hebrew mother goddess of childbirth, children, women, and sexuality who later became demonized due to the rise of patriarchy. Other modern views hold that Lilith is a dark moon goddess on par with the Hindu Kali.\n\nMany modern theistic Satanists consider Lilith as a goddess. She is considered a goddess of independence by those Satanists and is often worshipped by women, but women are not the only people who worship her. Lilith is popular among theistic Satanists because of her association with Satan. Some Satanists believe that she is the wife of Satan and thus think of her as a mother figure. Others base their reverence towards her based on her history as a succubus and praise her as a sex goddess. A different approach to a Satanic Lilith holds that she was once a fertility and agricultural goddess.\n\nThe western mystery tradition associates Lilith with the Qliphoth of kabbalah. Samael Aun Weor in The \"Pistis Sophia Unveiled\" writes that homosexuals are the \"henchmen of Lilith\". Likewise, women who undergo willful abortion, and those who support this practice are \"seen in the sphere of Lilith\". Dion Fortune writes, \"The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith\", and that Lilith is the source of \"lustful dreams\".\n\n\n\n"}

This article includes those fact-finding publications issued by the United Nations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/ civil society entities.\n\nThis article focuses on listing fact-finding reports, which distinguish themselves from other publications such as pamphlets, news articles, books, or journal articles, in that they are meant to aggregate information from multiple sources and provide a balanced, overall view of the topic covered for the non-commercial purpose of informing the general public and policy makers. These reports tend to rely more on the credibility of their publishing institutions than on their individual authors. Fact-finding reports are also distinct from policy briefs as the latter ground their analysis and recommendations on the facts laid out in the former. The inclusion is based on the notability (and not the concurrence to any particular view) of the publishing institutions to the inquiry and deliberations on the situation in North Korea.\n\nThis list lays out the evolution of the reporting efforts, with a first wave of reports by human rights NGOs just describing the general characteristics of the regime, followed by another wave of civil society and governmental reports with some more details, then prompting the United Nations to also exercise greater scrutiny and pursue its own investigations. \n\nThe vast majority of reports (except those published by the DPRK itself, also included in this article) point to a very grave situation, with human rights systematically violated by the North Korean government.\n\nEfforts to continue to investigate and document the situation of human rights in the DPRK are on-going, given that there are no indications of substantial improvements in the regime's policies, and despite the continued isolation of the regime that limits outside investigators' access to the country and to its general population.\n\nKorea had for centuries been a high-ranking tributary state within the Imperial Chinese tributary system, until in the late 19th century Japan began to assert greater control over the Korean peninsula, culminating in its annexation in 1910. It remained a colony of Japan, until Japan lost World War II in 1945.\n\nAt the end of WWII, with Japan stripped of its colonial territories, the Korean peninsula became a United Nations trusteeship, with the northern half administered by the Soviet Union, and the southern half administered by the United States. The ultimate stated plan was to allow Korea as a whole to become again a united and independent country. Disagreements among the parties on how and when to implement the united self-rule failed and the two territories established their own separate and rival governments. The Korean War (1950-1953) was the last attempt to reunify the peninsula by force, but it ended in stalemate and it entrenched two very different regimes. \n\nWithin the Soviet and American spheres respectively, the North became a communist authoritarian regime uninterruptedly led by the Kim family, and the South became a capitalist society that until 1987 included short periods of unstable democracy as well as longer periods of autocratic rule, including over 25 years of right-wing military rule.\n\nPropped by their allies, North and South experienced rapid economic growth after the Korean War, but in the 1970s the North's growth faltered while the South's accelerated. \n\nWhile South Korea had a period of authoritarian military rule, mass mobilizations of its citizens forced its end in 1987. This led to the modern South Korea being a young, more stable democracy with a prosperous free market economy. Meanwhile, North Korea's totalitarian regime kept a stronger grip on its society, which was never able to mobilize to demand reforms. Its planned economy stagnated in the 1970s, and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union it spiralled into crisis in the 1990s, leading to a massive famine. North Korea remains to this day as one of the most isolated countries in the world, with a struggling economy, within a communist, militaristic, and totalitarian regime.\n\nThe reporting of human rights in the DPRK follows the progression of the modern movement of human rights, which from the 1970s civil society and governmental efforts made violations more visible to the general public and in international politics. \n\nGiven the opacity of the DPRK's regime, especially before the 1990s, little was known about the situation of human rights. The few reports that were issued at that time made note of the lack of concrete information, mostly only being able to describe the general characteristics of the country's political system. Amnesty International, founded in 1961, began to issue some basic reports on the DPRK in 1977. In 1979 the US's Department of State also began to cover the DPRK in its \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\".\n\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent North Korean famine of the 1990s, a higher number of individuals began to flee the country, and more first-person accounts began to be collected by human rights organizations. That was also followed in the early 2000s by greater availability of satellite imagery. South Korea, having itself transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy in the late 1980s, began to publish reports in 1996 through its governmental think tank Korea Institute for National Unification. In the late 1990s and 2000s several NGOs specialized on North Korea emerged and began to publish their own research: Citizens' Alliance for North Korean Human Rights (1996), Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (2001), Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (2003), People for Successful Corean Reunification (2006). Around the same time some other world-wide human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Christian Solidarity Worldwide also began to publish reports on the DPRK.\n\nAs reports from NGOs and governments began to reveal more details on the human rights situation in the DPRK during the 1990s and 2000s, these concerns were elevated to the United Nations, where various UN bodies and parties also began to express a growing concern on the situation and opacity of the regime. The mounting evidence being collected and published by governments and civil society led in 2004 to the establishment of the mandate for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK, issuing reports annually. \n\nThe growing amount of information, and the grave situation it increasingly revealed, led the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) to repeatedly pass resolutions officially expressing their concerns and urging the DPRK's government to change its ways.\n\nTen years later, further joint efforts by the UN Special Rapporteur, governments, and NGOs led to the establishment of a special one-time investigation unprecedented in depth and breadth commissioned by the Human Rights Council, with a landmark report published in 2014. It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point. The report unequivocally concluded that the DPRK regime committed gross and systematic violations of human rights including freedom of thought, expression and religion; freedom from discrimination; freedom of movement and residence; and the right to food, as well as crimes against humanity entailing \"extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation\".\n\nThe UN's fact-finding process continues to yield periodical reports, which greatly rely on and are underpinned by the also on-going research and publishing conducted by NGOs and governmental agencies. \n\nIncreased awareness of human rights abuses has led to efforts in shaping policy and pressuring the North Korean regime. However the pursuit for the improvement of human rights in the DPRK has had to contend with the efforts of preventing a nuclear weapons escalation. Further, the isolationist and totalitarian nature of the regime has also meant that information and freedom of movement of its population as well as that of foreigners is still tightly controlled, making extremely challenging to document abuses on the ground, including having access to imagery (other than satellite imagery) that could inspire greater action.\n\nThe United Nations has issued four main kinds of reports on the human rights of North Korea. \n\nThe first are a series of documents intended to be recommendations from Treaty-based bodies, which are issued by those bodies to each country that is party to it (in contrast to charter-based bodies, which all UN members are part of). These treaty-based bodies that North Korea has decided to be a party to include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Committee on the Rights of the Child, and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The first document of this kind was issued in 1998 (Convention on the Rights of the Child); the second was in 2001 (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), after a 17-year delay in North Korea submitting the required information to the committee.\n\nPrompted by growing evidence provided by human rights NGOs, during the 1990s and 2000s various UN bodies and parties expressed greater concern on the situation of human rights in North Korea and the opacity of the country's government. That led to another series of reports that were started by the UN Commission on Human Rights (the predecessor of the UN Human Rights Council), which established the mandate for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK in 2004, issuing reports annually. They are issued in detail to the Human Rights Council, and in a more condensed form to the General Assembly.\n\nThe United Nations also conducts a Universal Periodic Review (every 3 or 4 years, in which all UN members are subject to a review on their human rights practices), with the first report on North Korea issued in 2010.\n\nFinally, the most notable one was the 2014 Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK, considered a landmark document resulting from a special in-depth, one-time investigation commissioned by the Human Rights Council, It was deemed the most authoritative report up to that point. \n\n\nSpecial Rapporteur annual reports to the Human Rights Council\n\nNorth Korea published a report on its own human rights situation, as a rebuttal to the 2014 United Nations report. It has also submitted reports to the United Nations.\n\n\n\nThe Korea Institute for National Unification (KINU; formerly the Research Institute for National Unification) opened the Center for North Korean Human Rights in 1994 to collect and manage systematically all source materials and objective data concerning North Korean human rights; and from 1996, KINU has been publishing every year the ‘White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea’ in Korean and in English. Other reports, including reports by the U.S. government, use South Korea KINU's reports as part of their sources. Another South Korean governmental institution publishing research on human rights in the DPRK is the National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK).\n\n\n\nThe United States government, through its Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor has published annually Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, that beginning in 1979 included North Korea. Also, two different bodies within the U.S. government have published reports on religious freedom: the Department of State (since 2001), and U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCRIF; since 2003). Finally, the DOS' Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons also publishes Trafficking in Persons Reports (TIP) that include some coverage of North Korea. The TIP reports series began in 2001, following the passing of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, with North Korea beginning to be briefly covered starting in the 2003 report, and more fully covered beginning in 2005.\n\nThe Country Reports on Human Rights Practices issued by the DOS noted every year the difficulty of having detailed an up-to-date information, and instead relying on sparse information collected over several years. This was especially the case in the during the 1970s and 80s, and began to change in the 1990s with more witness accounts, while continuing to note a lack of more detailed and more timely information. As more reports became available, the DOS and USCRIF reports have frequently cited reports from the United Nations, South Korea's \"Korea Institute for National Unification\" (starting in 1996), nonprofits (especially the \"Committee for Human Rights in North Korea\" and \"Data Center for North Korean Human Rights\", since their establishment in the 2000s), and from the press. \n\nAnnual general reports 2000-present\n\n\n\n\nThe Citizens' Alliance for North Korean Human Rights (NKHR; South Korea-based nonprofit founded in 1996) works in researching and disseminating information about the human rights violations in North Korea. It also runs assistance programs for North Korean defectors.\n\n\nThe Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB; South Korea-based nonprofit founded in 2003) specializes in collecting and analyzing and maintaining a database of human rights abuses, which as of 2017 included the accounts of over 40,000 individuals and 60,000 cases of human rights violations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK; U.S.-based non-profit established in 2001) is known for its original research based on its adept use of satellite imagery, defector accounts, and even information coming directly from inside the country. Its published research has been relied upon as sources in reports issued by the United Nations and governments. HRNK has issued three types of reports: reports analyzing the situation on prison camps, reports on other human rights issues in the country, and reports on North Korea's leadership and institutions, as well as policy briefings addressed at the international community. The first two types of reports are listed here. \n\n\n\n\nAmnesty International (AI; based in the United Kingdom, established in 1961) annual report \"The state of the world's human rights\" initially included a brief mention of most countries, growing in later years to devoting 1-2 pages to the analysis of the situation of human rights in each country, including North Korea in 1977. Through the 1970s, 1980s the organization noted that its ability to report on human rights in the country was severely hampered by the opacity of the regime, and only being able to recount some scant reports. This began to change in the 1990s when some more information became available. Also since that point AI has also issued other stand-alone reports specific to human rights issues in North Korea.\n\nAnnual general reports 2000-present\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch publishes annually a \"World Report\". Below are listed the sections of those annual reports that focus on the situation in North Korea. HRW has produced world reports since 1989 covering a limited number of countries, and it began to devote a section to the DPRK in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1426846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1426846", "title": "Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park", "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park\n\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park consists of several buildings in Atlanta, Georgia, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s boyhood home and the original Ebenezer Baptist Church, the church where King was baptized and both his father Martin Luther King Sr. and he were pastors. These places, critical to the interpretation of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy as a leader of the American Civil Rights Movement, were included in the park when it was established on October 10, 1980. Formerly a National Historic Site, the unit was redesignated as a National Historical Park on January 8, 2018.\n\nIn total, the buildings included in the site make up 35 acres (0.14 km²). The visitor center contains a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement and the path of Martin Luther King Jr. An 1894 firehouse (Fire Station No. 6) served the Sweet Auburn community until 1991, and now contains a gift shop and an exhibit on desegregation in the Atlanta Fire Department. The \"I Have a Dream\" International World Peace Rose Garden, and a memorial tribute to Mohandas K. Gandhi are part of the site, as is the \"International Civil Rights Walk of Fame\" which commemorates some of the courageous pioneers who worked for social justice.\n\nAnnual events celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January typically draw large crowds. Speakers have included Presidents of the United States, national and local politicians, and civil rights leaders. Remembrances are also held during Black History Month (February), and on the anniversary of King's April 4, 1968, assassination in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. Historic District, an area bounded roughly by Irwin, Randolph, Edgewood, Jackson, and Auburn avenues, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1974. The district included Ebenezer Baptist Church, King's grave site and memorial, Dr. King's birthplace, shotgun row houses, Victorian houses, the Alexander Hamilton House, the Atlanta Baptist Preparatory Institute site, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Colored Mission, Fire Station No. 6, and the Triangle Building at the intersection of Old Wheat Street and Auburn Avenue.\n\nMuch of the area was designated as a national historic landmark district on May 5, 1977. The Trust for Public Land purchased 5 single-family homes along Auburn Avenue in the late 1970s, the same block Martin Luther King Jr. grew up on. The Trust for Public Land purchased more than a dozen properties over the next 20 years to create a parking lot as well as a pedestrian greenway to link the King district to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Center. In 2008, The Trust for Public Land acquired one of the remaining historic properties in the neighborhood, on the corner of Auburn Avenue. \n\nBy U.S. Congressional legislation, the site with associated buildings and gardens was authorized as a national historic site on October 10, 1980; it is administered by the National Park Service (NPS). A area including 35 contributing properties was covered, including 22 previously included in the NRHP historic district. The area covered in the NRHP designation was enlarged on June 12, 2001. In 2018 it was redesignated as a national historical park, adding Prince Hall Masonic Temple to the protected area.\n\nThe King Birth Home is located at 501 Auburn Avenue in the Sweet Auburn historic district. Built in 1895, it sits about a block east of Ebenezer Baptist Church. King's maternal grandparents, Reverend Adam Daniel (A.D.) Williams, who was pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, and his wife, Jennie Williams, bought the house for $3,500 in 1909. In 1926, when King's father married Alberta Williams, the couple moved into the house, where King Jr. was born in 1929.\n\nThe King family lived in the house until 1941. It was then converted into a two-family dwelling. The Rev. A. D. Williams King, Dr. King's brother, lived on the second floor in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe first level includes the front porch, parlor, study, dining room, kitchen, laundry, bedroom and a bathroom. The second level includes four bedrooms and a bathroom. The visitor center offers free tours of the house led by National Park Service rangers, but with limited availability.\n\nIn 1968, after King's death, Coretta Scott King founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Since 1981 the Center has been housed in a building that is part of the King complex located on Auburn Avenue adjacent to Ebenezer Baptist Church.\nIn 1977, a memorial tomb was dedicated to King. His remains were moved to the tomb, on a plaza between the center and the church. King's gravesite and a reflecting pool are located next to Freedom Hall. After her death, Mrs. King was interred with her husband on February 7, 2006. An eternal flame is located nearby.\n\nFreedom Hall at 449 Auburn Avenue features exhibits about Dr. and Mrs. King, Mahatma Gandhi and American activist Rosa Parks. It hosts special events and programs associated with civil rights and social justice. It contains a Grand Foyer, large theater/conference auditorium, bookstore and resource center, and various works of art from across the globe. The Grand Foyer features art from Africa and Georgia. The paneling lining the staircase is from the sapeli tree, which grows in Nigeria.\n\nAs of 2006, the King Center is a privately owned inholding within the authorized boundaries of the park. The King family has debated among themselves as to whether they should sell it to the National Park Service to ensure preservation.\n\nThe visitor center at 449 Auburn Avenue was built in 1996 and features the multimedia exhibit \"Courage To Lead\", which follows the parallel paths of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. Visitors can also walk down a stylized \"Freedom Road\". The \"Children of Courage\" exhibit, geared towards children, tells the story of the children of the Civil Rights Movement with a challenge to our youth today. Video programs are presented on a continuing basis and there is a staffed information desk.\n\nThe statue of Mohandas Gandhi was donated by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, India, in collaboration with The National Federation of Indian American Associations and The Embassy of India, USA. The inscribed bronze plaque reads:\n\nThe \"International Civil Rights Walk of Fame\" was created in 2004 and honors some of the participants in the Civil Rights Movement. The walk along the Promenade, includes footsteps, marked in granite and bronze. According to the National Park Service, the Walk of Fame was created to \"pay homage to the \"brave warriors\" of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all.\" The new addition to the area is expected to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich cultural heritage, and augment tourist attractions.\n\nThe \"Walk of Fame\" is the brainchild of Xernona Clayton, founder and executive producer of the renowned Trumpet Awards and a civil rights activist in her own right. Ms. Clayton said, \"This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals.\"\n\nLocated at 332 Auburn Avenue, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple is where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) established its initial headquarters in 1957. This historic and distinguished civil rights organization was co-founded by Dr. King, who also served as its first president. Owned by the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Georgia, the building was included within the authorized boundary of the park in 2018.\n\n\n"}

The site describes itself as focusing on European culture, art, science, philosophy, and politics. It was officially launched on 26 October 2006 with the Swedish-language edition. The English edition was launched on 28 April 2007. The Hungarian edition has the most articles: 144,189 as of 27 September 2013.\n\nThe Swedish Metapedia was founded in 2006 by Anders Lagerström (born October 14, 1977), a neo-Nazi publisher from Linköping, Sweden.\n\nMetapedia does not mention Lagerström's connections to the Swedish far-right on any of its sites, instead stating it as an \"electronic encyclopedia which focuses on culture, art, science, philosophy and politics.\" \n\nSwedish historian Rasmus Fleischer wrote that:\n\nThe site's mission statement states one of its goals is \"to present a more balanced and fair image of the pro-European struggle for the general public as well as for academics, who until now have been dependent on strongly biased and hostile 'researchers' like \"Searchlight\", Anti-Defamation League, Southern Poverty Law Center, Simon Wiesenthal Centre, and such.\" The Metapedia logo features the head of a sculpture (\"Youth\") by the German artist Arno Breker, whose works were endorsed by the Nazi authorities as the antithesis of degenerate art.\n\nThe site has more than 20,000 articles in English; topics covered include European history, Norse mythology, and white nationalist music. \"The Register\" states that \"a good percentage of Metapedia's content seems to be dedicated to Woden, the White Order of Thule, runes, and other subject matter which would undoubtedly have found favour with Aryan hocus-pocus aficionado Heinrich Himmler.\" \"Crítica de la Argentina\" says Metapedia has glowing descriptions of Adolf Hitler and other Nazi figures. Daniel Goldhagen describes it as seeking \"to create (currently in 18 languages) an anti-Semitic informational universe.\"\n\nAccording to the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Metapedia's articles are characterized by historical negationism and lauding Nazi Germany. For this reason, the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons () started an indexing process, which would consider as to whether Metapedia is \"harmful to young people\".\n\nIn early 2007, within half a year of the launching of the original Swedish edition, Metapedia received much Swedish media attention for its similarity to Wikipedia and some of its contents, in particular for its positive characterization of many Nazi German personalities, for cataloguing Jews in Swedish media, and for characterizing Swedish companies as either \"Swedish-owned\" or \"Jewish-owned\". This led to an investigation by the Chancellor of Justice () to decide whether the site should be prosecuted for inciting hatred or for violating the Swedish Privacy Law (). After reviewing the site's contents, the Chancellor of Justice decided to terminate investigations, since nothing had been found that violated the Freedom of Speech Act () or the Privacy Law. In January 2009, in a response to further attention given to the site, the Swedish Chancellor of Justice opined that Metapedia presented a positive image of Adolf Hitler, but decided not to restart an investigation since this was not illegal.\n\nMetapedia runs on MediaWiki, a free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database.\n\nMetapedia is headed by Lagerström and Lennart Berg, who also runs the supporting NFSE Media AB.\n\n"}

{"id": "8337137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8337137", "title": "Minority influence", "text": "Minority influence\n\nMinority influence, a form of social influence, takes place when a member of a minority group influences the majority to accept the minority's beliefs or behavior. This occurs when a small group or an individual acts as an agent of social change by questioning established societal perceptions, and proposing alternative, original ideas which oppose the existing social norms. There are two types of social influence: majority influence (resulting in conformity and public compliance) and minority influence (resulting in conversion). Majority influence refers to the majority trying to produce conformity on the minority, while minority influence is converting the majority to adopt the thinking of the minority group. Unlike other forms of influence, minority influence is often thought of as a more innovative form of social change, because it usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. Without influential minorities challenging the majority view, there would be no new ideas or positive change in society. Examples of this are the Civil Rights movement in America and the suffragettes campaigning for votes for women.\n\nNearly all early research on minority influence focused on how the majority influenced the minority, based on the assumption of many psychologists that it would be very hard for the minority to have any influence on the majority. Moscovici had a different perspective, as he believed that it was possible for a minority influence to overcome majority influence. As a result, he conducted his own study on minority influence in 1969. Similar to Asch's (1951) 'blue-green' experiment, to see if a group of four participants were influenced by a minority. His research was important as it was one of the first studies to show that a minority was able to change the opinions of the majority. The research of Moscovici and his colleagues opened the door to more research on the subject.\n\nMoscovici's (1980, 1985) conversion theory outlines a dual process of social influence. When an individual's views differ from the majority view, this causes inner turmoil, motivating the individual to reduce conflict by using a comparison process, leading to compliance and public acceptance of the majority position to avoid ostracism and potential ridicule. Therefore, majority influence is seen as normative social influence because often it is generated by a desire to fit in and conform to the group, e.g. Asch's (1951) line study. \nConversely, a minority view is more distinctive, capturing attention and resulting in a validation process, where people carefully analyse the discrepancy between their own view and the minority view. This often results in attitude conversion, where the individual is convinced that the minority view is correct, which is much more likely to be private rather than public.\n\nMajority influence occurs when people conform to certain beliefs and behaviours in order to be accepted by others. Unlike majority influence, minority influence can rarely influence others through normative social influence because the majority is indifferent to the minority's perspective of them. To influence the majority, the minority group would take the approach of informational social influence (Wood, 1994). By presenting information that the majority does not know or expect, this new or unexpected information catches the attention of the majority to carefully consider and examine the minority's view. After consideration, when the majority finds more validity and merit in the minority's view, the majority group has a higher chance of accepting part or all of the minority opinion.\n\nAlthough the majority group may accept part or all of the minority view, that fact does not necessarily indicate that the majority has been completely influenced by the minority. A study by Elizabeth Mannix and Margaret Neale (2005) shows that having the support from the majority leader could prove the critical factor in getting the minority opinion to be heard and be accepted. The support of a leader gives the majority more confidence in the merit of the minority opinion, leading to an overall respect for the minority. The strength of the \"key people\" (Van Avermaet, 1996) comes from the reputation built from their consistency of behaviors and ideas. Involving key people will benefit the minority view because people are more open to hear from others whom they trust and respect. In minority influence, a few influential leaders can influence the opposing majority to the minority's way of thinking.\nIn the end, having a more supportive and active minority group could lead to innovative and better decision-making.\n\nMoscovici and Nemeth (1974) argue that a minority of one is more influential than a minority of more than one, as one person is more likely to be consistent over long periods of time and will not divide the majority’s attention. They explain that a person may question themself: \"How can they be so wrong and yet so sure of themselves?\", resulting in a tendency to reevaluate the entire situation, considering all possible alternatives, including the minority view. On the other hand, two people are more likely to be influential than one person as they are less likely to be seen as strange or eccentric. More recent research has supported the latter due to the belief that a minority with two or more, if consistent, has more credibility and is therefore more likely to influence the majority.\n\nThe social impact model (Latané & Wolf 1981) predicts that as the size of the majority grows, the influence of the minority decreases, both in public and in private attitude change. The social impact model further explains that social impact is the multiplicative effect of strength (power, status, knowledge), the immediacy (physical proximity and recency), and the number of group members, supporting the view that a minority will be less influential on a larger majority.\n\nClark and Maass (1990) looked at the interaction between minority influence and majorities of varying sizes, and found that, like Latané & Wolf's findings, the minority's influence decreases in a negatively accelerating power function as the majority increases. This is reflected in findings that minority support should decrease considerably with the first few members of the majority, but additional members will have a marginally declining impact on getting people to conform to the majority position.\n\nSimilarly, Latané and Wolf cite Solomon Asch's work with \"the magic number three\". After his experiments, Asch concludes that when the majority consists of just one or two individuals, there is very little conformity. The addition of a third majority member dramatically increases conformity, but increases \"beyond\" three did not result in increasing amounts of conformity.\n\nMinority influence is more likely to occur if the point of view of the minority is consistent, flexible, and appealing to the majority. Having a consistent and unwavering opinion will increase the appeal to the majority, leading to a higher chance of adaption to the minority view. However, any wavering opinions from the minority group could lead the majority to dismiss the minority's claims and opinions.\nSerge Moscovici and Nemeth (1974) argued that minority influence is effective as long as there is consistency over time and agreement among the members of the minority. If this consistency were lost, then the minority would lose its credibility. This can be the case if a member of the minority deserts and joins the majority, as this damages the consistency and unity of the minority. After this occurrence, members of the majority are less likely to shift their position to that of the minority.\nThe key to minority influence being successful is not just consistency, but how the majority interprets consistency. If the consistent minority are seen as too inflexible, rigid, and unwilling to change, they are unlikely to influence the majority. However, if they appear flexible and compromising, they will be seen as less extreme and more reasonable, having a better chance of changing majority views.\n\nResearch shows that individuals are more likely to listen to the minority and take on their ideas if they identify with them as being similar to themselves. Maass & Clark (1984) arranged for a group of heterosexual participants to hear a debate on gay rights. The results showed that the majority heterosexual group debating was easier for the heterosexual participants to relate to. Therefore, the minority homosexual group had less of an influence. Influence is more likely to occur if the minority (or majority) is part of our 'in-group' as we are more likely to be influenced by those who are similar to us. This research contradicts with Moscovici’s view that deviant minorities (or out-groups) are essential for minority influence to occur. In-group minorities are more likely to be successful, as they are seen as part of the group, and therefore their ideas are seen as more acceptable. On the other hand, out-groups are more likely to be discriminated, as they are not seen as part of the group, causing them to seem strange or unusual.\n\nIn addition, the decisions of others may affect the potency of minority influence. Asch (1952) conducted a study in which test subjects would be accompanied one of two \"partners\" during a series of questions posed to a group: a) a partner that would agree with the subject's minority view, or b) a partner that would be more extremely incorrect than the majority. Asch found that regardless of the role of the \"partner\", the fact that the consensus was broken – even if by just one individual (\"the magic number one\") – was enough to reduce conformity to a majority, and add credibility to the minority view.\n\nMost juries will elect a leader and then decide whether the voting for a verdict will be public or private. Using the Story Model Theory which suggests that cognitive processing of trial information is what drives jurors to mentally organize evidence in coherent, credible narratives, jurors will approach a verdict in one of two ways. The first, Verdict Driven jurors sort the evidence into categories of guilty and not guilty before deliberation. these types of juries feel the need to reach a verdict quickly, thus they may feel social pressure outside of the group to deliver the content in a time efficient manner. On the other hand, Evidence Based jurors will resist making a final decision on the verdict until they have reviewed all the evidence. These juries tend to explore their different options as a group and are less influenced by the social pressure outside of the group to reach a verdict quickly.\n\nThe verdicts favored by the majority on the first ballot becomes the jury's final decision in about 90% of all jury trials, but the minority convinces the majority to change in about one out of every ten trials. If the majority was always right, we reach the conclusion that minorities (in a jury setting) do not have influence at all, this is not the case. Often when a jury is hung, it is usually because one or two jurors are holding our/resisting the influence of the majority. If these jury members are consistent with their views, it is likely they will be able to convince another member of the jury to also side with their view. As time goes on, more and more juries may change their vote in favor of the original minority. It is however, extremely important the original jurors are consistent and confident in their opinions. The more unsteady they appear, the less likely they will be able to conquer the majority.\n\nMembers of a jury who have high prestige or status are usually more influential than members who are not. Members who are also of high socioeconomic status are also more likely to influential in the jury deliberation process. This is demonstrated by the correlation between private preliberation opinion and jury's final decision was .50 for rich members and .2 for laborers. However, in recent analysis, race and sex no longer determine influence in juries.\n\n\nAfter a number of members have shifted their opinion to agree with the minority group, that minority becomes a majority. This is known as the snowball effect. When a minority creates social change in society, the new view becomes an integral part of the society's culture. This results in the source of the minority influence that led to change being forgotten, which is known as social cryptoamnesia.\nMinority influence can be successful if people can dissociate between the socio-cognitive activities of resistance that are induced by the source and other activities of resistance that develop from the content of the message. The process of dissociation is explained by social cryptoamnesia: what was originally considered different is gradually constructed as an alternative (Perez, 1995).\n\nA person can be affected by minority influence whether directly or indirectly. However, if one is not aware of the influence, the minority ideas could be taken as one's own while disregarding where the original idea came from. Social cryptoamnesia explains that thoughts and ideas that challenge or shock are stored in latent memory without retaining the ownership of the idea. Ideas that were supposedly forgotten have reappeared in the person's mind as his or her own belief or thought. This major attitude change takes place when the zeitgeist has changed. In history, minorities have changed the attitudes of society, and the attitudes of society have changed the personal opinion of the majority in that society. Although minority influence may not affect a person immediately, one's beliefs and behaviors may change over time due to social cryptoamnesia.\n\nBy integrating the theory of minority influence in organizations, people may be more open to learning and change, benefiting the organization in the end.\n\nNot only is minority influence seen in social groups, but this type of social influence is also present in the workplace. Incorporating the concept of minority influence can encourage diversity and change in a corporate organization. Mannix and Neale (2005) performed a case study on a company that asked all the senior managers to mentor junior managers, preparing at least three younger managers to be ready and competent enough to replace the older managers. From this study, the firm realized that they were not achieving the extent of diversity that they intended. As a result, the company required at least one of the three junior managers in training to be a woman or underrepresented minority. This new requirement improved the intended diversity in the organization as well as the interaction between the senior manager mentor and the junior manager mentee.\n\nIn another study by Mannix and Neale, yearly performance evaluations were completed for Hispanic, African American, and Asian managers. Their performance reviews evaluated the managers on less tangible measures related to leadership, an essential factor that is considered for receiving a promotion. Upon reflection of the company's performance evaluations, a senior leader suggested that the criteria on which managers were assessed was biased toward a \"white, Anglo management style\" (Mannix, 2005). As a solution, the leadership performance and promotion criteria of the performance reviews were revised. From this change and inclusion of minority influence, managers were able to learn from their strengths and weaknesses and change. Along with changing the criteria of performance evaluations, the organization itself underwent a change in values and culture.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that it is possible for minority influence and majority influence to work together. A study by Clark (1994) uses a jury setting from the film \"12 Angry Men\" to investigate social influence. Some of the participants were asked to just read the arguments from one of the characters (who acted as the minority), while the other group were also told how he changed the opinion of the rest of the jury. Social influence was present in both groups, but was stronger in the group that was exposed to both the arguments (minority influence) and the knowledge that the jury conformed (majority influence).\n\n"}

Other members of the Shirazi family are Grand Ayatollah Mirza Hassan Shirazi, leader of Iran's constitutional movement, also known as the Tobacco Movement, a successful boycott of the British tobacco monopoly, and Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Shirazi, leader of the 1920 revolution in Iraq. His nephews, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi and Ayatollah Hadi al-Modarresi, are leading jurists. Al-Shirazi's father, Grand Ayatollah Mahdi Shirazi, was a leading scholar and the Marja'. He was subsequently able to assume the office of the Marje' at the early age of 33 in 1961.\n\nIn 1971 he was exiled from Iraq to Lebanon by the Ba'thist regime. From Lebanon Al-Shirazi moved to Kuwait where he was influential in the rise of religious radicalism, and also indirectly affecting religious discourse among Sunnis.\n\nAt the time Al-Shirazi came into conflict with other prominent Shia religious figures in Najaf. Perhaps the most prominent Shia religious leader of the time, Grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, sought to dismiss Al-Shirazi's status as a scholar.\n\nThrough personal charisma and intellectual arguments, Al-Shirazi built up a large following in Kuwait and Iraq. His followers became known as the 'Shiraziyyin' and tended to be critical of existing Shi'i religious establishments. In 1979, with fellow Shia Islamist clerics in power in Iran, Al-Shirazi moved to Iran and settled in Qom.\n\nHis brothers are Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi and Mujtaba Hussaini Shirazi.\n\nAl-Shirazi was a leading Islamist political theorist and devised the Hukumat al-Fuqaha' principle of theocratic rule. According to Cambridge University's Toby Matthiesen: \"The political theory of Muhammad al-Shirazi and the MVM [Movement of Vanguard Missions] was quite close to Khomeini’s notion of velayet-e faqih (the guardianship of the jurisprudent), although al-Shirazi favored the theory that not a single cleric, but a council of scholars should govern the Islamic State (hukumat al-fuqaha’/shurat al-fuqaha’).\"\n\nUnder Al-Shirazi's theory government would be in the form of a 'Consultative System of Leadership' composed of senior clerics, and he called for the establishment of the 'Leadership Council of Religious Authorities'. He argued for the establishment of a Universal Islamic Government to encompass all the Muslim countries run in accordance with Hukumat al-Fuqaha'.\n\nAl-Shirazi was initially an important figure within Iran's Islamic Republic with his supporters in key roles within the Iranian state in the 1980s. He was the spiritual guide of the Movement of Vanguard Missionaries, an umbrella group for Iran-based Islamist paramilitaries that included military groups like the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. Iran maintained support for these paramilitaries in the 1980s through the Office of Liberation Movements, part of the Revolutionary Guards. The Movement of Vanguard Missionaries operated as a military organisation and it was active in Bahrain and Iraq.\n\nHe has been critical of the Iranian government.\n\nAl-Shirazi expected a bigger role in the Islamic Revolution and this was a point of tension between him and Grand Ayatollah Khomeini. In addition, Al-Shirazi believed he was the senior cleric to Khomeini, as both competed for the position of marja al-taqlid. As the revolution progressed Al-Shirazi fell out with Ayatollah Khomeini and particularly his successor, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe Movement of Vanguard Missionaries was close to radicals in the Iranian government within the Revolutionary Guards. As the radicals were increasingly sidelined by the more moderate Sayyid ‘Ali Khamenei and ‘Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Al-Shirazi's influence waned. Al-Shirazi was highly critical of Khamenei's bid to become a marja and assumption of the position of Iranian supreme leader.\n\nWith the political ascendency of Khamenei and Rafsanjani, Al-Shirazi's followers were at times mistreated by the government of the Iranian authorities. In 1995, one of his sons Seyd Morteza Shirazi was imprisoned for 18 months after which \"reportedly escaped to Syria and has requested political asylum, the INP reported in Tehran.\"\n\nAmnesty International reports that in Iran:\nseveral followers of Grand Ayatollah Sayed Mohammad Shirazi were detained during [1998]. In January Sheikh Mohammad Amin Ghafoori, a well-known religious figure and writer, his wife, and Sayed Hossein Fali were arrested in Qom. There were reports that they were beaten during arrest and tortured in detention. Sayed Hossein Fali was reported to have been released in June. Sheikh Mohammad Amin Ghafoori was said to have been sentenced in July to two and a half years' imprisonment by the Special Court for the Clergy, whose procedures fell far short of international standards. In October, five other followers of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, including Reza Sultani, were reported to have been arrested and they remained held incommunicado at the end of the year. Sheikh Sadiq Za'eemiyan has also been harassed.\n\nSeven students arrested in November 1995, apparently on account of their links with Grand Ayatollah Shirazi (see Amnesty International Reports 1996 and 1997), were released in June. However, two of them, Aman Allah Bushehri and Sheikh Mohammad Qahtani, were reportedly rearrested in July and August respectively.\n\nAccording to reports, methods of torture used against some of these detainees have included beatings, prolonged sleep deprivation, electric shocks and threatened execution by electrocution after attaching electrodes to the body. Sheikh Ali Maash is said to have required medical treatment after his release for the effects of torture, including for a toe on his right foot which was broken and left untreated.\" \n\nDespite these differences, Al-Shirazi's followers were part of the most pro-Iranian political faction in the post-Saddam Iraq, the United Iraqi Alliance. The Shirazis' Islamic Action Organization contested parliamentary elections along with other pro-Iranian parties such as the Badr Organization and SCIRI as part of the United Iraqi Alliance. In 2006, the Islamic Action Organization had one minister in government in Iraq, the State Minister for Civil Society Affairs, Adil al-Asadi.\n\nAl-Shirazi has written on different subjects including science, ethics, politics, economics, sociology, law, human rights, etc. He has published over 1200 books, treatises and studies. Assad Ali, a poet and professor of Arabic literature, called him the \"King of Authors\", because of his prolific output. A bid by Assad Ali to get the Guinness World Records to recognise Muhammad al-Shirazi as the most prolific writer in Arabic was rejected by the publisher.\n\nAl-Shirazi believed in the fundamental and elementary nature of freedom including freedom of expression, political plurality, debate and discussion, tolerance and forgiveness. Regarding war and violence he advocated war as a last resort in response to an enemy who has forced the situation. He called for the Jizyah tax to be imposed on non-Muslims saying 'The obstinate person should become less obstinate in the face of what should return him gradually to the truth.' He believed in the \"Consultative System of Leadership\" and called for the establishment of the Leadership Council of Religious Authorities. He called for the establishment of the \"Universal Islamic Government\" to encompass all the Muslim countries. These and other ideas are discussed in detail in his books.\n\nHe had established many Islamic centers, medical and charitable financial services, educational, welfare and social foundations, libraries, and Hawzah's, or universities for Islamic Studies, in different regions of the world. Hundreds of individuals have graduated from his schools as scholars, lecturers, authors and intellectuals.\n\nShirazi died on December 17, 2001 in Qom, Iran. After his death, his legacy and school of thought were continued through the Hawzah'a which he had established. His brother Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi is at the helm of this school of thought and a leading religious authority in his own right.\n\n\n\n"}

The series began serial publication in the French magazine \"Pilote\" on July 22, 1965, before it eventually became an album series. (\"Pilote\" was a direct response to the Franco-Belgian weeklies \"Spirou\" and \"Journal de Tintin\", and sought to test more recent and dynamic strips on young and adolescent readers.) The general tone of the series is of fantastic realism, depicting the adventures of the young farmboy Philémon in surreal adventures featuring odd creatures in odd places, and it is considered one of the most poetic and original \"bande dessinée\" series of all time.\n\nPhilémon is a rural French teenager. His best friend is a donkey named Anatole. Philémon's father easily gets angry and he despairs at the \"tall stories\" his son tells him. \n\nPhilémon's early adventures begin when, by accident, Philémon fell down a well and ended up on a beach. This well was a \"portal\" and Philémon ended up in an odd world, reminiscent of \"Alice in Wonderland\" in its alterations of commonly accepted reality, with strange characters which varied from people with butterfly wings to centaurs. Philémon also met Barthélémy, a well digger who had gone through the same portal and ended up trapped on an island for forty years. The island was one of many which formed the letters of the Atlantic Ocean on maps and globes. In the course of their adventures Philémon and Mr. Barthélémy would travel from between their native countryside to the various islands, using Uncle Félicien's magic.\n\nPhilémon: a teenage farm boy who finds himself traveling to the various and fantastic islands that make up the letters \"Atlantic Ocean\" on maps and globes.\n\nBarthélémy: a well-digger who, while at work, found himself traveling through a portal and ending up on the first A island. Although he got to live in a beautiful palace he soon became homesick and sent messages in bottles in an attempt to get rescued from the island. This lasted 40 years before Philémon came across one such message and helped Barthélémy return home. Before long, however, Barthélémy became homesick for the island, and his desperate desire to return was the cause of many of their subsequent adventures.\n\nAnatole: Philémon's pet donkey and best friend.\n\nFélicien: Philémon's uncle whose studies of magic enable him to send Barthélémy and Philémon to and from the magical lands. No method of travel can be used twice, so Félicien's methods vary from a zipper hidden in the ground to a magical barrel of water. This constant travel does cause disturbances in the fabric of reality, causing Félicien problems with the islands' authorities.\n\nHector: Philémon's father, who refuses to believe his son's stories and maintains his disbelief in the fantasy islands, even when he happens to go there himself (see \"Le Voyage de l’incrédule\" (French for \"The Sceptic's Journey\")).\n\nIn a 2013 article for Variety, Max Films announced plans to adapt Philémon into an English-language, live-action film, directed by Julien Demers-Arsenault and Sebastien Denault.\n\n\nIn 2013, a sixteenth book, \"Le Train où vont les Choses\" was published shortly before Fred's death, bringing a coda to the series.\n\nThe first English-translated version of the book was published in 2014, a year after Fred's death.\n\n"}

{"id": "271971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271971", "title": "Sacred king", "text": "Sacred king\n\nIn many historical societies, the position of kingship carries a sacral meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a high priest and judge. The concept of theocracy is related, although a sacred king need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.\n\nSir James George Frazer identified - or invented - the concept of the sacred king in his study \"The Golden Bough\" (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the Rex Nemorensis. Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the myth and ritual school. However, \"the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory\" is disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other.\n\nAccording to Frazer, the notion has prehistoric roots and occurs worldwide, on Java as in sub-Saharan Africa, with shaman-kings credited with rainmaking and assuring fertility and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a human sacrifice, either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the Blót of Domalde).\n\nThe Ashanti flogged a newly-selected king (\"Ashantehene\") before enthroning him.\n\nFrom the Bronze Age in the Near East, the enthronement and anointment of a monarch is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles \"Messiah\" or \"Christ\", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus Sargon of Akkad described himself as \"deputy of Ishtar\", just as the modern Catholic Pope takes the role of the \"Vicar of Christ\".\n\nKings are styled as shepherds from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to Sumerian princes such as Lugalbanda in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of leadership and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.\n\nAs the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. Solomon or Gilgamesh) or vision (e.g. via oneiromancy).\n\nStudy of the concept was introduced by Sir James George Frazer in his influential book \"The Golden Bough\" (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in Romanticism and Esotericism (e.g. Julius Evola) and some currents of Neopaganism (Theodism).\nThe school of Pan-Babylonianism derived much of the religion described in the Hebrew Bible from cults of sacral kingship in ancient Babylonia.\n\nThe so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English \"myth and ritual school\" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian \"Uppsala school\" emphasized Semitological study.\n\nA sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of mythology developed by Frazer in \"The Golden Bough\" (published 1890), was a king who represented a solar deity in a periodically re-enacted fertility rite. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-European, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the Goddess was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine John Barleycorn. He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the winter solstice to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a \"dying and reviving god\". Osiris, Adonis, Dionysus, Attis and many other familiar figures from Greek mythology and classical antiquity were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a sacrifice, to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.\n\nEspecially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a cottage industry of amateurs looking for \"pagan survivals\" in such things as traditional fairs, maypoles, and folk arts like morris dancing. It was widely influential in literature, being alluded to by D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and in T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\", among other works.\n\nRobert Graves used Frazer's work in \"The Greek Myths\" and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in \"The White Goddess\", and in the fictional \"Seven Days in New Crete\" he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred King is revived. Margaret Murray, the principal theorist of witchcraft as a \"pagan survival,\" used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many Kings of England who died as kings, most notably William Rufus, were secret pagans and witches, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the human sacrifice that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth. An idea used by fantasy writer Katherine Kurtz in her novel \"Lammas Night\".\n\n\nMonarchies carried sacral kingship into the Middle Ages, encouraging the idea of kings installed \"by the Grace of God\". See:\n\nMany of Rosemary Sutcliff's novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer, depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice, including Sword at Sunset, The Mark of the Horse Lord, and Sun Horse, Moon Horse.\n\nIn addition to its appearance in her novel \"Lammas Night\" noted above, Katherine Kurtz also uses the idea of sacred kingship in her novel \"The Quest for Saint Camber\".\n\nGeneral\n\n\"English school\"\n\n\"Scandinavian school\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2524919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2524919", "title": "Serial number arithmetic", "text": "Serial number arithmetic\n\nMany protocols and algorithms require the serialization or enumeration of related entities. For example, a communication protocol must know whether some packet comes \"before\" or \"after\" some other packet. The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) attempts to define \"Serial Number Arithmetic\" for the purposes of manipulating and comparing these sequence numbers.\n\nThis task is rather more complex than it might first appear, because most algorithms use fixed size (binary) representations for sequence numbers. It is often important for the algorithm not to \"break down\" when the numbers become so large that they are incremented one last time and \"wrap\" around their maximum numeric ranges (go instantly from a large positive number to 0, or a large negative number). Unfortunately, some protocols choose to ignore these issues, and simply use very large integers for their counters, in the hope that the program will be replaced (or they will retire), before the problem occurs (see Y2K).\n\nMany communication protocols apply serial number arithmetic to packet sequence numbers in their implementation of a sliding window protocol. Some versions of TCP use protection against wrapped sequence numbers (PAWS). PAWS applies the same serial number arithmetic to packet timestamps, using the timestamp as an extension of the high-order bits of the sequence number.\n\nOnly addition of a small positive integer to a sequence number, and comparison of two sequence numbers are discussed.\nOnly unsigned binary implementations are discussed, with an arbitrary size in bits noted throughout the RFC (and below) as \"SERIAL_BITS\".\n\nAdding an integer to a sequence number is simple unsigned integer addition, followed by unsigned Modulo operation to bring the result back into range (usually implicit in the unsigned addition, on most architectures.)\n\nAddition of a value outside the range\n\nis undefined. Basically, adding values beyond this range will cause the resultant sequence number to \"wrap\", and (often) result in a number that is considered \"less than\" the original sequence number!\n\nA means of comparing two sequence numbers i1 and i2 (the unsigned integer representations of sequence numbers s1 and s2) is presented.\n\nEquality is defined as simple numeric equality.\nThe algorithm presented for comparison is very complex, having to take into account whether the first sequence number is close to the \"end\" of its range of values, and thus a smaller \"wrapped\" number may actually be considered \"greater\" than the first sequence number. Thus i1 is considered less than i2, only if:\n\nLikewise, i1 is considered greater than i2, only if:\n\nThe algorithms presented by the RFC have at least one significant shortcoming: \nthere are sequence numbers for which comparison is undefined.\nSince many algorithms are implemented independently by multiple, independent cooperating parties,\nit is often impossible to prevent all such situations from occurring.\n\nThe authors of simply punt:\n\nThus, it is often difficult or impossible to avoid all \"undefined\" comparisons of sequence numbers.\nHowever, a relatively simple solution is available. By mapping the unsigned sequence numbers onto signed Two's complement arithmetic operations, every comparison of any sequence number is defined, and the comparison operation itself is dramatically simplified. All comparisons specified by the RFC retain their original truth values; only the formerly \"undefined\" comparisons are affected.\n\nThe algorithm specifies that, for N-bit sequence numbers, there are 2−1 values considered \"greater than\", and 2−1 considered \"less than\". Comparison against the remaining value (exactly 2 distant) is deemed to be \"undefined\".\n\nMost modern hardware implements signed Two's complement binary arithmetic operations.\nThese operations are fully defined for the entire range of values for any operands they are given—since any N-bit binary number can contain 2 distinct values, and since one of them is taken up by the value 0, there are an odd number of spots left for all the non-zero positive and negative numbers.\nThere is simply one more negative number representable than there are positive.\nFor example, a 16-bit 2's complement value may contain numbers ranging from −32768 to +32767.\n\nSo, if we simply re-cast sequence numbers as 2's complement integers, and allow there to be one more sequence number considered \"less than\" than there are sequence numbers considered \"greater than\", we should be able to use simple signed arithmetic comparisons instead of the logically incomplete formula proposed by the RFC.\n\nHere are some examples (in 16 bits, again), comparing some random sequence numbers, against the sequence number with the value 0.\n\nIt is easy to see that the signed interpretation of the sequence numbers are in the correct order, so long as we \"rotate\" the sequence number in question so that its 0 matches up with the sequence number we are comparing it against. It turns out that this is simply done, using an unsigned subtraction, and simply interpreting the result as a signed two's complement number. The result is the signed \"distance\" between the two sequence numbers. Once again, if i1 and i2 are the unsigned binary representations of the sequence numbers s1 and s2, the distance from s1 to s2 is:\n\nIf distance is 0, the numbers are equal. If it is < 0, then s1 is \"less than\" or \"before\" s2.\nSimple, clean and efficient, and fully defined. However, not without surprises.\n\nAll sequence number arithmetic must deal with \"wrapping\" of sequence numbers; the number 2 is equidistant in both directions, in sequence number terms. In our math, they are both considered to be \"less than\" each other:\n\nThis is obviously true for any two sequence numbers with distance of 0x8000 between them.\n\nFurthermore, implementing serial number arithmetic using two's complement arithmetic implies serial numbers of a bit-length matching the machine's integer sizes; usually 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit. Implementing 20-bit serial numbers needs shifts (assuming 32-bit ints):\n\nSee the unit test cases in the example C++ implementation below for more examples.\n\n\n"}

Its most recent edition, the fourteenth, was published on 25 September 2014.\n\nThe first version of \"The Times Atlas of the World\" appeared as \"The Times Atlas\" in 1895; more printings followed up to 1900. It was published at the office of \"The Times\" newspaper in London, and contained 117 pages of maps with an alphabetical index of 130,000 names. The atlas was a reprint of Cassell & Co.’s \"Universal Atlas\", published in 1893. Cassell's atlas, in turn, used maps in English printed in Leipzig which were drawn from the second edition (with some maps of the third edition) of the German \"Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas\" from the publisher Velhagen & Klasing.\n\nThe second generation of the atlas was issued in 1920 as \"The Times Survey Atlas of the World\" and was prepared at the Edinburgh Geographical Institute under the direction of John George Bartholomew. It contained 112 double page maps with 200,000 names, and measured 47 cm × 33 cm.\n\nThe third generation, based on the second, was Bartholomew's famous five-volume set of 19\"×12\" elephant folio atlases with 120 plates in eight colors, most maps being double page, and over 200,000 names. The set was issued from 1955–59 as \"The Times Atlas of the World. Mid-Century Edition\" by The Times Publishing Company Ltd. in London, (Volume One: The World, Australasia & East Asia. Volume Two: South-West Asia & Russia. Volume Three: Northern Europe. Volume Four: Southern Europe & Africa. Volume Five: The Americas; however, volumes III-V were in fact published first.) A July, 1957 advertisement for The Americas volume suggested that the maps included the latest places of note: \"the St. Lawrence Seaway, the newest Federal and Interstate highway systems, ... rocket-launching sites and Atomic Energy installations.\"\n\nIn 1967, an edition in one volume (in which the maps were printed back-to-back – some on a fractionally smaller scale) was published as \"The Times Atlas of the World. Comprehensive Edition\" (with 123 leaves of maps in the 9th edition of 1992). This edition also appeared in a German, a Dutch and a French translation. Its introduction reads: \"The successor to [the Mid-Century Edition] in one volume, nevertheless, this work contains greater detail, as well as considerable additional material, with no loss of scale, this being achieved by printing on both sides of the paper, using narrower margins, and including a single index.

A number of glaciologists and climate scientists contested the claim.

Their blood and bodily fluids were purportedly poisonous to other humans, as was mentioned in the ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, \"Arthashastra\", written by Chanakya, an adviser and a prime minister to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BCE).\n\nA Hindu mythology text, the \"Kalki Purana\", mentions that they can kill a person just by looking at them, and talks about a Visha Kanya named Sulochana, the wife of a Gandharva, Chitragreeva.\n\nHowever, in time, \"poison damsel\" passed into folklore, became an archetype explored by many writers, resulting in a popular literary character that appears in many works, including classical Sanskrit texts such as \"Sukasaptati\".\n\nThe Poison Damsel (Sanskrit Viṣakanyā) is a literary figure that appears in Sanskrit literature as a type of assassin used by kings to destroy enemies. The story goes that young girls were raised on a carefully crafted diet of poison and antidote from a very young age, a practice referred to as mithridatism. Although many would not survive, those that did were immune to other poisons and their body fluids would be poisonous to others; sexual contact would thus be lethal to other humans. There also exists a myth that says a Visha Kanya can cause instant death with just a touch.\n\nAccording to Kaushik Roy, Visha Kanyas would kill their targets by seducing them and giving them poisoned alcohol.\n\nSome Sanskrit sources narrate that a \"Visha Kanya\" was sent by Nanda's minister Amatyarakshasa to kill Chandragupta Maurya and Chanakya diverted them to kill Parvatak.\n\n\"Visha Kanya\" has been a popular theme in Indian literature and folklore, and apart from appearing in classical Sanskrit texts, it has appeared repeatedly in various works like \"Vishkanya\" by Shivani and \"Ek Aur Vish Kanya?\" by Om Prakash Sharma, who use \"Visha Kanya\" as an archetype in their stories—a beautiful girl who kills when she comes too close. More recently, the archetype has taken a new hue in the HIV/AIDS era, for example in \"Vishkanya\", a 2007 novel, based on the AIDS epidemic in society. \"Vishakanya\"s have also been depicted as important characters in the book \"Chanakya's Chant\". In 2009, Vibha Rahi, a lower caste woman has written an autobiography 'Vishkanya: Untold Secrets' in Marathi, in which she portrays how upper caste women make intimate relationships with lower caste people of high profile and destroy their families and social relationships. \nOver the years, many Hindi films have been made on the subject. The first film, \"Visha Kanya\", was made in 1943, starring Leela Mishra, and more recently, \"Vishkanya\" (1991), starring Pooja Bedi in the lead role. Vishkanya Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani is a soap opera TV series which aired on Zee TV; it starred Aishwarya Khare as Aparajita Ghosh, a Visha Kanya, in the main role.\n\nIn \"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\" the author Nabokov treats his affair with Irina Guadanini through allusions to the myth of the poison damsel. In the 2015 novel, \"The Entropy of Bones\" by Ayize Jama-Everett, the main character fights a group of \"Visha Kanya\". The trope also appears in a set of Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories.\n\n\n"}

He also spent a further $108,000 refurbishing the restaurant.\n\nHowever, when it came time to renew the lease, NBH refused to renew the lease.\n\nAs a result, Young notified NBH's solicitors that he was going to apply to the court for relief under section 120 of the Property Law Act [1952], whereupon the solicitors advised them not to commence legal action until they had received instructions from their client.\n\nYoung resiled from filing for relief from the court, until many months later when NBH said that they could not apply for relief any longer, due to the fact that section 121 requires an application to the court within 3 months of the landlord's refusal.\n\nYoung applied for relief under promissory estoppel.\n\nThe judge ruled that promissory estoppel applied here, and granted a renewal of the lease. Randerson J said this was a \"straightforward application of the principles of promissory estoppel\".\n"}
