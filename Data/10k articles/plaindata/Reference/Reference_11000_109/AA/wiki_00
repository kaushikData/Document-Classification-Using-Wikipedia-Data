ABSAs typically arise in relation to bioprospecting where indigenous knowledge is used to focus screening efforts for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources. ABSAs recognise that bioprospecting frequently relies on indigenous or traditional knowledge, and that people or communities who hold such knowledge are entitled to a share of benefits arising from its commercial utilization.\n\nThe concept of ABSAs stems from the Convention on Biological Diversity which, among other objectives, seeks to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. However, the highly controversial principle of Access and Benefit Sharing of the CDB stirred up a virulent debat which left most stakeholders unsatisfied with the framework provided. \n\nThe Nagoya Protocol, a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, provides a legal framework for implementing that objective. Article 5 of the Nagoya Protocol requires that benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, as well as from subsequent applications and commercialization, to be shared in a fair and equitable way with the party providing such resources. Article 5 states that such sharing shall be upon mutually agreed terms. An ABSA can be used to specify the terms on which the benefits will be shared in a particular case.\n"}

{"id": "1400558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1400558", "title": "Behind the Laughter", "text": "Behind the Laughter\n\n\"Behind the Laughter\" is the twenty-second and final episode of \"The Simpsons\" eleventh season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 21, 2000. In the episode, which is a parody of the VH1 series \"Behind the Music\", the Simpson family are portrayed as actors on a sitcom, and their dramatic inner turmoil and struggles are detailed. Told in a narrative format, the episode tells a fictional story of how \"The Simpsons\" began.\n\nThe episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and written by Tim Long, George Meyer, Mike Scully and Matt Selman. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by Long, and the writers wrote the episode quickly without a draft. VH1 and the producers of \"Behind the Music\" allowed the crew to use the show's visual graphics package, and Jim Forbes, narrator for the show, also came in to record narrations for the episode. In addition, country musician Willie Nelson guest stars as himself.\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with many reviewers noting it as a highlight of the season and the series itself. The episode won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour) in 2000, beating the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Road to Rhode Island\". In addition, composer Alf Clausen won an Annie Award for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement for Music in an Animated Television Production\".\n\nIn May 2004, the BBC chose it as the last episode to be aired, having lost the broadcasting rights in February 2002, to Channel 4, who later aired the series in November 2004.\n\nThis episode is a parody of \"Behind the Music\", the VH1 biography show, even sharing the same narrator, Jim Forbes. It begins with the Simpson family history and how they got into show business. The first part of the fake documentary follows the family from their weak beginnings to their exceptional prosperity. A television show, a recording contract, a lot of awards, and countless wealth follow Homer's inadequate video \"pilot\".\n\nHowever, problems begin to arise as the Simpsons' fame continues. After a funny stunt causes him injury (the cliff plummet from \"Bart the Daredevil\", after a montage of Homer injury clips), Homer becomes addicted to prescription painkillers, Marge makes some senseless business investments, and Bart goes to rehab after attacking flight attendants, being replaced on the show by Richie Rich. The IRS examines soon after and takes away their house (called \"Homertime\" as a parody of MC Hammer's house, \"Hammertime\"). Then, the family gets into a big dispute and splits up at the Iowa State Fair.\n\nFox is forced to put the show on hiatus, since none of the Simpsons will talk to each other. The members go their independent ways: Homer follows a career in the legitimate theater; Bart replaces Lorenzo Lamas as the star of the syndicated action show \"Renegade\"; Marge makes a nightclub act performing Bob Marley's song \"I Shot the Sheriff\"; and Lisa writes a tell-all book about her experiences and how Homer would slip anti-growth hormones into her cereal, entitled \"Where Are My Residuals?\". Bringing the family back together seems hopeless until country singer Willie Nelson puts on a phony awards show in order to reconcile the family. They hug and forget past wrongs in a sensitive reunion. Again, they look with hope to the many years of episodes of the Simpsons to come...or not.\n\nThe episode ends with an epilogue, in which the narrator states, \"...the future looks brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky family.\" Following the epilogue, the Simpson family is shown in a video editing room, viewing a scene from an upcoming episode, which Homer claims will be in the last season. The scene shows the family talking about winning a trip to Delaware, and was later used as an actual scene in the episode, \"Simpsons Tall Tales\". The final scene shows a mock teaser for an \"upcoming episode\" of \"Behind the Laughter\" about Huckleberry Hound, in which he reveals that he is gay.\n\nGay Rosenthal, friend of executive producer Mike Scully, was producing the VH1 series \"Behind the Music\", which was very popular during the episode's production. Tim Long was the one to pitch the idea for the episode. The idea for the episode was a drastic departure for the series to try something so different. It took the writers a long time to conceptualize the show, as they were unsure whether to make Homer a filmmaker or make the characters unaware they were being filmed. Selman recalled that there was no draft for the episode, instead the writers just sat down and \"pounded it out.\" He noted that one of the disadvantages for producing an animated show that takes up to a year in advance to create was that many other comedy shows, most notably \"Saturday Night Live\" with their \"More cowbell\" sketch, had already done \"Behind the Music\" parodies. Although the final episode only features one bleeped curse word for Marge (for comedic effect), Meyer recalled the writers spent many weeks just \"pitching Marge filth.\"\nThe writers had particular fun writing over the top, melodramatic lines \"tortured metaphors,\" many of which were penned by producer David Mirkin. Although not credited, Scully has noted writers Tom Gammill and Max Pross for making significant contributions to the episode. The crew used actual early \"Simpsons\" promotional posters in the episode. VH1 and Gay Rosenthal Productions were both \"extremely cooperative\" regarding the episode, letting the team use the entire graphics package. Larina Adamson drove over to the VH1 headquarters in order to compile most of the video graphics package. Part of the imitating of \"Behind the Music\" was using the \"corny, stock interstitial footage to amp up the drama of the situation.\"\n\nIan Maxtone-Graham directed the voice actors during the recording sessions for the episode. Jim Forbes, narrator for \"Behind the Music\", came in to the studio and did the narrations, which George Meyer called \"fantastic\". When Scully went to the studio to record Willie Nelson's guest appearance, he was running late and had to wait, as Nelson was recording a duet with B.B. King. Meyer recalled that Nelson said to the producers that he enjoyed \"The Simpsons\", and watched it on his tour bus before he went to perform. Mark Kirkland called the episode one of the \"oddest he'd ever worked on.\" He attended the table reading for the episode with knowledge he was to direct the episode, and was surprised to find that the story was \"not a linear story […] it was all chopped up.\" In the direction aspect, the episode was very challenging, but also easy in the fact that the animation team were not looking for continuity errors as the episode \"jumped around so much.\" The animators and Kirkland watched multiple episodes of \"Behind the Music\" in order to get the feel of it, as did the writers.\n\nThe episode refers to the long-running joke of Springfield's unknown and unidentifiable location. The original version of Forbes' line at the end, \"The future looks brighter than ever for this Northern Kentucky family,\" was changed multiple times. Scully said the writers did not want to \"pin it down for the fans,\" and with knowledge that the episode would rerun twice, had Forbes record several alternate locations, which were indeed seen on Fox reruns. Each of the alternate locations, including the unused \"small island of Lanai,\" can be found as an easter egg on the eleventh season DVD set.\n\nThe episode contains many references and allusions to \"Behind the Music\", and one line the staff thought was humorous was pulled straight from the actual series. \n\n\nThe episode was ranked as the fourth best \"The Simpsons\" episode by askmen.com. In 2012, Johnny Dee of \"The Guardian\" listed the episode as one of his five favorite episodes in the history of \"The Simpsons\", noting \"The Simpsons\" is \"good at self-parody\". \"The Simpsons\" writing staff voted this in their list of Top 15 \"Simpsons\" episode becoming the newest episode in the list. In an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\" regarding the renewal of the show in season 23, showrunner Al Jean discusses what episodes that have previously aired might serve well as a series finale. He regards \"Behind the Laughter\" and \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" as the strongest candidates, and further elaborates: \"I don’t think we’re a serialized show and I don’t think we’re going to have a \"Lost\" finale where we reveal some truth about the world that nobody ever suspected. Whenever we do a last episode, we just hope that it would be sweet, true to the characters, funny, and give you a nice feeling for where the Simpsons would be headed.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "33647361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33647361", "title": "Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher", "text": "Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher\n\nCryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher was the process that enabled the British to read high-level German army messages during World War II. The British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park decrypted many communications between the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (OKW, German High Command) in Berlin and their army commands throughout occupied Europe, some of which were signed \"Adolf Hitler, Führer\". These were intercepted non-Morse radio transmissions that had been enciphered by the Lorenz SZ teleprinter rotor stream cipher attachments. Decrypts of this traffic became an important source of \"Ultra\" intelligence, which contributed significantly to Allied victory.\n\nFor its high-level secret messages, the German armed services enciphered each character using various online \"Geheimschreiber\" (secret writer) stream cipher machines at both ends of a telegraph link using the 5-bit International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). These machines were subsequently discovered to be the Lorenz SZ (SZ for \"Schlüssel-Zusatz\", meaning \"cipher attachment\") for the army, the Siemens and Halske T52 for the air force and the Siemens T43, which was little used and never broken by the Allies.\n\nBletchley Park decrypts of messages enciphered with the Enigma machines revealed that the Germans called one of their wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"Sägefisch\" (sawfish), which led British cryptographers to refer to encrypted German radiotelegraphic traffic as \"Fish\". \"Tunny\" (tunafish) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the cipher machines and their traffic.\n\nAs with the entirely separate cryptanalysis of the Enigma, it was German operational shortcomings that allowed the initial diagnosis of the system, and a way into decryption. Unlike Enigma, no physical machine reached allied hands until the very end of the war in Europe, long after wholesale decryption had been established. Initially, operator errors produced a number of pairs of transmissions sent with the same keys, giving a \"depth\", which often allowed manual decryption to be achieved. One long depth also allowed the complete logical structure of the machine to be worked out, a quite remarkable cryptanalytical feat on which the subsequent wholesale decrypting of Tunny messages relied.\n\nWhen depths became less frequent, decryption was achieved by a combination of manual and automated methods. The first machine to automate part of the decrypting process was called \"Heath Robinson\" and it was followed by several other \"Robinsons\". These were, however, slow and unreliable, and were complemented by the much faster and more flexible \"Colossus\", the world's first electronic, programmable digital computer, ten of which were in use by the end of the war, by which time some 90% of selected Tunny messages were being decrypted at Bletchley Park.\n\nAlbert W. Small, a cryptanalyst from the US Army Signal Corps who was seconded to Bletchley Park and worked on Tunny, said in his December 1944 report back to Arlington Hall that:\n\nThe Lorenz SZ cipher attachments implemented a Vernam stream cipher, using a complex array of twelve wheels that delivered what should have been a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number as a key stream. The key stream was combined with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext at the transmitting end using the exclusive or (XOR) function. At the receiving end, an identically configured machine produced the same key stream which was combined with the ciphertext to produce the plaintext, i. e. the system implemented a symmetric-key algorithm.\n\nThe right hand five wheels, the \"chi\" (formula_1) wheels, changed the five impulses (bits) of the incoming character, advancing one position every time. The left hand five, the \"psi\" (formula_2) wheels, further changed the result of the \"chi\" transform, but they did not always move on with each new character.\n\nThe central two \"mu\" (formula_3) or \"motor\" wheels determined whether or not the \"psi\" wheels rotated with a new character. The enhanced SZ42A and SZ42B machines had a more complex arrangement for advancing the \"psi\" wheels than the original SZ40.\n\nEach wheel had a number of cams that could be set in one of two positions. The numbers of cams on the set of wheels were co-prime with each other giving an extremely long period before the key sequence repeated. The process of working out which of the 501 cams were in the raised position was called \"wheel breaking\" at Bletchley Park. Deriving the start positions of the wheels for a particular transmission was termed \"wheel setting\" or simply \"setting\". The fact that the \"psi\" wheels all moved together, but not with every input character, was a major weakness of the machines that contributed to cryptanalytical success.\n\nElectro-mechanical telegraphy developed in the 1830s and 1840s, well before telephony, and operated worldwide by the time of the Second World War. An extensive system of cables linked sites within and between countries, with a standard voltage of −80 V indicating a \"mark\" and +80 V indicating a \"space\". Where cable transmission became impracticable or inconvenient, such as for mobile German Army Units, radio transmission was used.\n\nTeleprinters at each end of the circuit consisted of a keyboard and a printing mechanism, and very often a five-hole perforated paper-tape reading and punching mechanism. When used online, pressing an alphabet key at the transmitting end caused the relevant character to print at the receiving end. Commonly, however, the communication system involved the transmitting operator preparing a set of messages offline by punching them onto paper tape, and then going online only for the transmission of the messages recorded on the tape. The system would typically send some ten characters per second, and so occupy the line or the radio channel for a shorter period of time than for online typing.\n\nThe characters of the message were represented by the codes of the International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). The transmission medium, either wire or radio, used asynchronous serial communication with each character signaled by a start (space) impulse, 5 data impulses and 1½ stop (mark) impulses. At Bletchley Park mark impulses were signified by x and space impulses by •. For example, the letter \"H\" would be coded as ••x•x.\n\nThe figure shift (FIGS) and letter shift (LETRS) characters determined how the receiving end interpreted the string of characters up to the next shift character. Because of the danger of a shift character being corrupted, some operators would type a pair of shift characters when changing from letters to numbers or \"vice versa\". So they would type 55M88 to represent a full stop. Such doubling of characters was very helpful for the statistical cryptanalysis used at Bletchley Park. After encipherment, shift characters had no special meaning.\n\nThe speed of transmission of a radio-telegraph message was three or four times that of Morse code and a human listener could not interpret it. A standard teleprinter, however would produce the text of the message. The Lorenz cipher attachment changed the plaintext of the message into ciphertext that was uninterpretable to those without an identical machine identically set up. This was the challenge faced by the Bletchley Park codebreakers.\n\nIntercepting Tunny transmissions presented substantial problems. As the transmitters were directional, most of the signals were quite weak at receivers in Britain. Furthermore, there were some 25 different frequencies used for these transmissions, and the frequency would sometimes be changed part way through. After the initial discovery of the non-Morse signals in 1940, a Y-station was set up on a hill at the Ivy Farm Communications Centre at Knockholt in Kent, specifically to intercept this traffic. The centre was headed by Harold Kenworthy, had 30 receiving sets and employed some 600 staff. It became fully operational early in 1943.\n\nBecause a single missed or corrupted character could make decryption impossible, the greatest accuracy was required. The undulator technology used to record the impulses had originally been developed for high-speed Morse. It produced a visible record of the impulses on narrow paper tape. This was then read by people employed as \"slip readers\" who interpreted the peaks and troughs as the marks and spaces of ITA2 characters. Perforated paper tape was then produced for telegraphic transmission to Bletchley Park where it was punched out.\n\nThe Vernam cipher implemented by the Lorenz SZ machines utilizes the Boolean \"exclusive or\" (XOR) function, symbolised by ⊕ and verbalised as \"A or B but not both\". This is represented by the following truth table, where x represents \"true\" and • represents \"false\".\n\nOther names for this function are: exclusive disjunction, not equal (NEQ), and modulo 2 addition (without \"carry\") and subtraction (without \"borrow\"). Modulo 2 addition and subtraction are identical. Some descriptions of Tunny decryption refer to addition and some to differencing, i.e. subtraction, but they mean the same thing.\n\nReciprocity is a desirable feature of a machine cipher so that the same machine with the same settings can be used either for enciphering or for deciphering. The Vernam cipher achieves this, as combining the stream of plaintext characters with the key stream produces the ciphertext, and combining the same key with the ciphertext regenerates the plaintext.\n\nSymbolically:\n\nand\n\nVernam's original idea was to use conventional telegraphy practice, with a paper tape of the plaintext combined with a paper tape of the key at the transmitting end, and an identical key tape combined with the ciphertext signal at the receiving end. Each pair of key tapes would have been unique (a one-time tape), but generating and distributing such tapes presented considerable practical difficulties. In the 1920s four men in different countries invented rotor Vernam cipher machines to produce a key stream to act instead of a key tape. The Lorenz SZ40/42 was one of these.\n\nA monoalphabetic substitution cipher such as the Caesar cipher can easily be broken, given a reasonable amount of ciphertext. This is achieved by frequency analysis of the different letters of the ciphertext, and comparing the result with the known distribution of letters in the language of the plaintext. With a polyalphabetic cipher, however, there is a different substitution alphabet for each successive character. So a frequency analysis shows an approximately uniform distribution, such as that obtained from a (pseudo) random number generator. \n\nHowever, because one set of wheels turned with every character while the other did not, the machine did not disguise the pattern in the use of adjacent characters in the German plaintext. The Bletchley Park cryptanalysts discovered this weakness and invented the differencing technique described below to exploit it.\n\nThe total number of cams on the twelve wheels of the SZ machines was 501. Each cam could either be in a raised position, in which case it contributed x to the logic of the system, or in the lowered position, in which case it generated •. The total possible number of patterns of raised cams was 2 which is an astronomically large number. In practice, however, about half of the cams on each wheel were in the raised position. Later, the Germans realized that if the number of raised cams was not very close to half there would be runs of xs and •s, a cryptographic weakness. Indeed, this weakness was one of the two factors that led to the system being diagnosed.\n\nThe pattern of raised and lowered cams was changed daily on the motor wheels (formula_337 and formula_361). The \"chi\" wheel cam patterns were initially changed monthly. The \"psi\" wheel patterns were changed quarterly until October 1942 when the frequency was increased to monthly, and then to daily on 1 August 1944, when the frequency of changing the \"chi\" wheel patterns was also changed to daily.\n\nThe number of start positions of the wheels was 43×47×51×53×59×37×61×41×31×29×26×23 which is approximately 1.6×10 (16 billion billion), far too large a number for cryptanalysts to try an exhaustive \"brute-force attack\". As the numbers of positions of the wheels are co-prime with each other this number is also the period before the key repeated. Sometimes the Lorenz operators disobeyed instructions and two messages were transmitted with the same start positions, a phenomenon termed a \"depth\". The method by which the transmitting operator told the receiving operator the wheel settings that he had chosen for the message which he was about to transmit was termed the \"indicator\" at Bletchley Park.\n\nIn August 1942, the stereotyped starts to the messages, which were useful to cryptanalysts, were replaced by some irrelevant text, which made identifying the true message somewhat harder. This new material was dubbed \"quatsch\" (German for \"nonsense\") at Bletchley Park.\n\nDuring the phase of the experimental transmissions, the indicator consisted of twelve German forenames, the initial letters of which indicated the position to which the operators turned the twelve wheels. As well as showing when two transmissions were fully in depth, it also allowed the identification of partial depths where two indicators differed only in one or two wheel positions. From October 1942 the indicator system changed to the sending operator transmitting the unenciphered letters QEP followed by a two digit number. This number was taken serially from a code book that had been issued to both operators and gave, for each QEP number, the settings of the twelve wheels. The books were replaced when they had been used up, but between replacements, complete depths could be identified by the re-use of a QEP number on a particular Tunny link.\n\nThe first step in breaking a new cipher is to diagnose the logic of the processes of encryption and decryption. In the case of a machine cipher such as Tunny, this entailed establishing the logical structure and hence functioning of the machine. This was achieved without the benefit of seeing a machine—which only happened in 1945, shortly before the allied victory in Europe. The enciphering system was very good at ensuring that the ciphertext Z contained no statistical, periodic or linguistic characteristics to distinguish it from random. However this did not apply to which was the weakness that meant that Tunny keys could be solved.\n\nDuring the experimental period of Tunny transmissions when the twelve-letter indicator system was in use, John Tiltman, Bletchley Park's veteran and remarkably gifted cryptanalyst, studied the Tunny ciphertexts and identified that they used a Vernam cipher.\n\nWhen two transmissions (a and b) use the same key, i.e. they are in depth, combining them eliminates the effect of the key. Let us call the two ciphertexts Za and Zb, the key K and the two plaintexts Pa and Pb. We then have:\nIf the two plaintexts can be worked out, the key can be recovered from either ciphertext-plaintext pair e.g.:\n\nOn 31 August 1941, two long messages were received that had the same indicator HQIBPEXEZMUG. The first seven characters of these two ciphertexts were the same, but the second message was shorter. The first 15 characters of the two messages were as follows:\n\nJohn Tiltman tried various likely pieces of plaintext, i.e. a \"cribs\", against the Za ⊕ Zb string and found that the first plaintext message started with the German word \"SPRUCHNUMMER\" (message number). In the second plaintext, the operator had used the common abbreviation \"NR\" for \"NUMMER\". There were more abbreviations in the second message, and the punctuation sometimes differed. This allowed Tiltman to work out, over ten days, the plaintext of both messages, as a sequence of plaintext characters discovered in Pa, could then be tried against Pb and \"vice versa\". In turn, this yielded almost 4000 characters of key.\n\nMembers of the Research Section worked on this key to try to derive a mathematical description of the key generating process, but without success. Bill Tutte joined the section in October 1941 and was given the task. He had read chemistry and mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge before being recruited to Bletchley Park. At his training course, he had been taught the Kasiski examination technique of writing out a key on squared paper with a new row after a defined number of characters that was suspected of being the frequency of repetition of the key. If this number was correct, the columns of the matrix would show more repetitions of sequences of characters than chance alone.\n\nTutte thought that it was possible that, rather than using this technique on the whole letters of the key, which were likely to have a long frequency of repetition, it might be worth trying it on only one impulse (bit) on the grounds that \"\"the part might be cryptographically simpler than the whole\". Given that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the twelfth, he tried Kasiski's technique on the first impulse of the key characters using a repetition of 25 × 23 = 575. This did not produce a large number of repetitions in the columns, but Tutte did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal. He therefore tried again with 574, which showed up repeats in the columns. Recognising that the prime factors of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and \"got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions\"\".\n\nIt was clear, however, that the first impulse of the key was more complicated than that produced by a single wheel of 41 positions. Tutte called this component of the key formula_1 (\"chi\"). He figured that there was another component, which was XOR-ed with this, that did not always change with each new character, and that this was the product of a wheel that he called formula_2 (\"psi\"). The same applied for each of the five impulses—indicated here by subscripts. So for a single character, the key K consisted of two components:\nThe actual sequence of characters added by the \"psi\" wheels, including those when they do not advance, was referred to as the \"extended psi\", and symbolised by formula_2'\n\nTutte's derivation of the formula_2 component was made possible by the fact that dots were more likely than not to be followed by dots, and crosses more likely than not to be followed by crosses. This was a product of a weakness in the German key setting, which they later stopped. Once Tutte had made this breakthrough, the rest of the Research Section joined in to study the other impulses, and it was established that the five formula_2 wheels all moved together under the control of two formula_3 (\"mu\" or \"motor\") wheels.\n\nDiagnosing the functioning of the Tunny machine in this way was a truly remarkable cryptanalytical achievement, and was described when Tutte was inducted as Officer of the Order of Canada in October 2001, as \"one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II\".\n\nIn July 1942 Alan Turing spent a few weeks in the Research Section. He had become interested in the problem of breaking Tunny from the keys that had been obtained from depths. In July, he developed a method of deriving the cam settings (\"wheel breaking\") from a length of key. It became known as \"Turingery\" (playfully dubbed \"Turingismus\" by Peter Ericsson, Peter Hilton and Donald Michie) and introduced the important method of \"differencing\" on which much of the rest of solving Tunny keys in the absence of depths, was based.\n\nThe search was on for a process that would manipulate the ciphertext or key to produce a frequency distribution of characters that departed from the uniformity that the enciphering process aimed to achieve. Turing worked out that the XOR combination of the values of successive (adjacent) characters in a stream of ciphertext or key, emphasised any departures from a uniform distribution. The resultant stream was called the difference (symbolised by the Greek letter \"delta\" Δ) because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction. So, for a stream of characters S, the difference ΔS was obtained as follows, where underline indicates the succeeding character:\n\nThe stream S may be ciphertext Z, plaintext P, key K or either of its two components formula_1 and formula_2. The relationship amongst these elements still applies when they are differenced. For example, as well as:\n\nIt is the case that:\n\nSimilarly for the ciphertext, plaintext and key components:\n\nSo:\n\nThe reason that differencing provided a way into Tunny, was that although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the \"chi\" element of the key had been removed. This is because, where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the \"psi\" wheels did not move on, the differenced \"psi\" character (Δformula_2) would be the null character ('/' at Bletchley Park). When XOR-ed with any character, this character has no effect, so in these circumstances, The ciphertext modified by the removal of the \"chi\" component of the key was called the de-\"chi\" D at Bletchley Park, and the process of removing it as \"de-\"chi\"-ing\". Similarly for the removal of the \"psi\" component which was known as \"de-\"psi\"-ing\" (or \"deep sighing\" when it was particularly difficult).\n\nSo the delta de-\"chi\" ΔD was:\n\nRepeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common), and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters as their loss in an ordinary telegraph transmission could lead to gibberish.\n\nTo quote the General Report on Tunny:Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called ΔΚ, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This Δ principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.\n\nDifferencing was applied to each of the impulses of the ITA2 coded characters. So, for the first impulse, that was enciphered by wheels formula_1 and formula_2, differenced at one:\nAnd for the second impulse:\nAnd so on.\n\nThe periodicity of the \"chi\" and \"psi\" wheels for each impulse (41 and 43 respectively for the first impulse) is also reflected in the pattern of ΔK. However, given that the \"psi\" wheels did not advance for every input character, as did the \"chi\" wheels, it was not simply a repetition of the pattern every 41 × 43 = 1763 characters for ΔK, but a more complex sequence.\n\nTuring's method of deriving the cam settings of the wheels from a length of key obtained from a depth, involved an iterative process. Given that the delta \"psi\" character was the null character '/' half of the time on average, an assumption that ΔK = Δformula_1 had a 50% chance of being correct. The process started by treating a particular ΔK character as being the Δformula_1 for that position. The resulting putative bit pattern of x and • for each \"chi\" wheel, was recorded on a sheet of paper that contained as many columns as there were characters in the key, and five rows representing the five impulses of the Δformula_1. Given the knowledge from Tutte's work, of the periodicity of each of the wheels, this allowed the propagation of these values at the appropriate positions in the rest of the key.\n\nA set of five sheets, one for each of the \"chi\" wheels, was also prepared. These contained a set of columns corresponding in number to the cams for the appropriate \"chi\" wheel, and were referred to as a 'cage'. So the formula_1 cage had 29 such columns. Successive 'guesses' of Δformula_1 values then produced further putative cam state values. These might either agree or disagree with previous assumptions, and a count of agreements and disagreements was made on these sheets. Where disagreements substantially outweighed agreements, the assumption was made that the Δformula_2 character was not the null character '/', so the relevant assumption was discounted. Progressively, all the cam settings of the \"chi\" wheels were deduced, and from them, the \"psi\" and motor wheel cam settings.\n\nAs experience of the method developed, improvements were made that allowed it to be used with much shorter lengths of key than the original 500 or so characters.\"\n\nThe Testery was the section at Bletchley Park that performed the bulk of the work involved in decrypting Tunny messages. By July 1942, the volume of traffic was building up considerably. A new section was therefore set up, led by Ralph Tester—hence the name. The staff consisted mainly of ex-members of the Research Section, and included Peter Ericsson, Peter Hilton, Denis Oswald and Jerry Roberts. The Testery's methods were almost entirely manual, both before and after the introduction of automated methods in the Newmanry to supplement and speed up their work.\n\nThe first phase of the work of the Testery ran from July to October, with the predominant method of decryption being based on depths and partial depths. After ten days, however, the stereotyped opening of the messages was replaced by nonsensical \"quatsch\" making decryption more difficult. This period was a productive time, albeit each decryption took considerable time until, in September, a depth was received that allowed Turing's method of wheel breaking \"Turingery\" to be used, and current traffic started to be read. Extensive data about the statistical characteristics of the language of the messages was compiled, and the collection of cribs extended.\"\n\nIn late October 1942 the original, experimental Tunny link was closed and two new links (Codfish and Octopus) were opened. With these and subsequent links, the 12-letter indicator system of specifying the message key was replaced by the QEP system. This meant that only full depths could be recognised—from identical QEP numbers—which led to a considerable reduction in traffic decrypted.\n\nOnce the Newmanry became operational in June 1943, the nature of the work performed in the Testery changed, with decrypts, and wheel breaking no longer relying on depths.\n\nThe so-called \"British Tunny Machine\" was a device that exactly replicated the functions of the SZ40/42 machines. It was used to produce the German cleartext from a ciphertext tape, after the cam settings had been determined. The functional design was produced at Bletchley Park where ten Testery Tunnies were in use by the end of the war. It was designed and built in Tommy Flowers' laboratory at the General Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill by Gil Hayward, \"Doc\" Coombs, Bill Chandler and Sid Broadhurst. It was mainly built from standard British telephone exchange electro-mechanical equipment such as relays and uniselectors. Input and output was by means of a teleprinter with paper tape reading and punching. These machines were used in both the Testery and later the Newmanry. Dorothy Du Boisson who was a machine operator and a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service (Wren), described plugging up the settings as being like operating an old fashioned telephone exchange and that she received electric shocks in the process.\n\nWhen Flowers was invited by Hayward to try the first British Tunny machine at Dollis Hill by typing in the standard test phrase: \"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party\", he much appreciated that the rotor functions had been set up to provide the following Wordsworthian output:\n\nAdditional features were added to the British Tunnies to simplify their operation. Further refinements were made for the versions used in the Newmanry, the third Tunny being equipped to produce de-\"chi\" tapes.\n\nThe Newmanry was a section set up under Max Newman in December 1942 to look into the possibility of assisting the work of the Testery by automating parts of the processes of decrypting Tunny messages. Newman had been working with Gerry Morgan, head of the Research Section on ways of breaking Tunny when Bill Tutte approached them in November 1942 with the idea of what became known as the \"1+2 break in\". This was recognised as being feasible, but only if automated.\n\nNewman produced a functional specification of what was to become the \"Heath Robinson\" machine. He recruited the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, and Dr C.E. Wynn-Williams at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern to implement his idea. Work on the engineering design started in January 1943 and the first machine was delivered in June. The staff at that time consisted of Newman, Donald Michie, Jack Good, two engineers and 16 Wrens. By the end of the war the Newmanry contained three Robinson machines, ten Colossus Computers and a number of British Tunnies. The staff were 26 cryptographers, 28 engineers and 275 Wrens.\n\nThe automation of these processes required the processing of large quantities of punched paper tape such as those on which the enciphered messages were received. Absolute accuracy of these tapes and their transcription was essential, as a single character in error could invalidate or corrupt a huge amount of work. Jack Good introduced the maxim \"If it's not checked it's wrong\".\n\nW. T. Tutte developed a way of exploiting the non-uniformity of bigrams (adjacent letters) in the German plaintext using the differenced cyphertext and key components. His method was called the \"1+2 break in,\" or \"double-delta attack\". The essence of this method was to find the initial settings of the \"chi\" component of the key by exhaustively trying all positions of its combination with the ciphertext, and looking for evidence of the non-uniformity that reflected the characteristics of the original plaintext. The wheel breaking process had to have successfully produced the current cam settings to allow the relevant sequence of characters of the \"chi\" wheels to be generated. It was totally impracticable to generate the 22 million characters from all five of the \"chi\" wheels, so it was initially limited to 41 × 31 = 1271 from the first two.\n\nGiven that for each of the five impulses \"i\":\nand hence\nfor the first two impulses:\nCalculating a putative P ⊕ P in this way for each starting point of the formula_1 ⊕ formula_1 sequence would yield xs and •s with, in the long run, a greater proportion of •s when the correct starting point had been used. Tutte knew, however, that using the differenced (∆) values amplified this effect because any repeated characters in the plaintext would always generate •, and similarly ∆formula_2 ⊕ ∆formula_2 would generate • whenever the \"psi\" wheels did not move on, and about half of the time when they did - some 70% overall.\n\nTutte analyzed a decrypted ciphertext with the differenced version of the above function:\nand found that it generated • some 55% of the time. Given the nature of the contribution of the \"psi\" wheels, the alignment of \"chi\"-stream with the ciphertext that gave the highest count of •s from (∆Z ⊕ ∆Z ⊕ ∆formula_1 ⊕ ∆formula_1) was the one that was most likely to be correct. This technique could be applied to any pair of impulses and so provided the basis of an automated approach to obtaining the de-\"chi\" (D) of a ciphertext, from which the \"psi\" component could be removed by manual methods.\n\nHeath Robinson was the first machine produced to automate Tutte's 1+2 method. It was given the name by the Wrens who operated it, after cartoonist William Heath Robinson, who drew immensely complicated mechanical devices for simple tasks, similar to the American cartoonist Rube Goldberg.\n\nThe functional specification of the machine was produced by Max Newman. The main engineering design was the work of Frank Morrell at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in North London, with his colleague Tommy Flowers designing the \"Combining Unit\". Dr C. E. Wynn-Williams from the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern produced the high-speed electronic valve and relay counters. Construction started in January 1943, the prototype machine was in use at Bletchley Park in June.\n\nThe main parts of the machine were:\n\nThe prototype machine was effective despite a number of serious shortcomings. Most of these were progressively overcome in the development of what became known as \"Old Robinson\".\n\nTommy Flowers' experience with Heath Robinson, and his previous, unique experience of thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) led him to realize that a better machine could be produced using electronics. Instead of the key stream being read from a punched paper tape, an electronically generated key stream could allow much faster and more flexible processing. Flowers' suggestion that this could be achieved with a machine that was entirely electronic and would contain between one and two thousand valves, was treated with incredulity at both the Telecommunications Research Establishment and at Bletchley Park, as it was thought that it would be \"too unreliable to do useful work\". He did, however, have the support of the Controller of Research at Dollis Hill, W Gordon Radley, and he implemented these ideas producing Colossus, the world's first electronic, digital, computing machine that was at all programmable, in the remarkably short time of ten months. In this he was assisted by his colleagues at the Post Office Research Station Dollis Hill: Sidney Broadhurst, William Chandler, Allen Coombs and Harry Fensom.\n\nThe prototype Mark 1 Colossus (Colossus I), with its 1500 valves, became operational at Dollis Hill in December 1943 and was in use at Bletchley Park by February 1944. This processed the message at 5000 characters per second using the impulse from reading the tape's sprocket holes to act as the clock signal. It quickly became evident that this was a huge leap forward in cryptanalysis of Tunny. Further Colossus machines were ordered and the orders for more Robinsons cancelled. An improved Mark 2 Colossus (Colossus II) contained 2400 valves and first worked at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944, just in time for the D-day Normandy landings.\n\nThe main parts of this machine were:\n\nThe five parallel processing units allowed Tutte's \"1+2 break in\" and other functions to be run at an effective speed of 25,000 characters per second by the use of circuitry invented by Flowers that would now be called a shift register. Donald Michie worked out a method of using Colossus to assist in wheel breaking as well as for wheel setting. This was then implemented in special hardware on later Colossi.\n\nA total of ten Colossus computers were in use and an eleventh was being commissioned at the end of the war in Europe (VE-Day).\n\nAs well as the commercially produced teleprinters and re-perforators, a number of other machines were built to assist in the preparation and checking of tapes in the Newmanry and Testery. The approximate complement as at May 1945 was as follows.\nWorking out the start position of the \"chi\" (formula_1) wheels required first that their cam settings had been determined by \"wheel breaking\". Initially, this was achieved by two messages having been sent in depth.\n\nThe number of start positions for the first two wheels, formula_1 and formula_1 was 41×31 = 1271. The first step was to try all of these start positions against the message tape. This was Tutte's \"1+2 break in\" which involved computing (∆Z ⊕ ∆Z ⊕ ∆formula_1 ⊕ ∆formula_1)—which gives a putative (∆D ⊕ ∆D)—and counting the number of times this gave •. Incorrect starting positions would, on average, give a dot count of 50% of the message length. On average, the dot count for a correct starting point would be 54%, but there was inevitably a considerable spread of values around these averages.\n\nBoth Heath Robinson, which was developed into what became known as \"Old Robinson\", and Colossus were designed to automate this process. Statistical theory allowed the derivation of measures of how far any count was from the 50% expected with an incorrect starting point for the \"chi\" wheels. This measure of deviation from randomness was called sigma. Starting points that gave a count of less than 2.5 × sigma, named the \"set total\", were not printed out. The ideal for a run to set formula_1 and formula_1 was that a single pair of trial values produced one outstanding value for sigma thus identifying the start positions of the first two \"chi\" wheels. An example of the output from such a run on a Mark 2 Colossus with its five counters: a, b, c, d and e, is given below.\nWith an average-sized message, this would take about eight minutes. However, by utilising the parallelism of the Mark 2 Colossus, the number of times the message had to be read could be reduced by a factor of five, from 1271 to 255. Having identified possible formula_1, formula_1 start positions, the next step was to try to find the start positions for the other \"chi\" wheels. In the example given above, there is a single setting of formula_1 = 36 and formula_1 = 21 whose sigma value makes it stand out from the rest. This was not always the case, and Small enumerates 36 different further runs that might be tried according to the result of the formula_1, formula_1 run. At first the choices in this iterative process were made by the cryptanalyst sitting at the typewriter output, and calling out instructions to the Wren operators. Max Newman devised a decision tree and then set Jack Good and Donald Michie the task of devising others. These were used by the Wrens without recourse to the cryptanalysts if certain criteria were met.\n\nIn the above one of Small's examples, the next run was with the first two \"chi\" wheels set to the start positions found and three separate parallel explorations of the remaining three \"chi\" wheels. Such a run was called a \"short run\" and took about two minutes.\n\nSo the probable start positions for the \"chi\" wheels are: formula_1 = 36, formula_1 = 21, formula_1 = 01, formula_1 = 19, formula_1 = 04. These had to be verified before the de-\"chi\" (D) message was passed to the Testery. This involved Colossus performing a count of the frequency of the 32 characters in ΔD. Small describes the check of the frequency count of the ΔD characters as being the \"acid test\", and that practically every cryptanalyst and Wren in the Newmanry and Testery knew the contents of the following table by heart.\n\nIf the derived start points of the \"chi\" wheels passed this test, the de-\"chi\"-ed message was passed to the Testery where manual methods were used to derive the \"psi\" and motor settings. As Small remarked, the work in the Newmanry took a great amount of statistical science, whereas that in the Testery took much knowledge of language and was of great interest as an art. Cryptanalyst Jerry Roberts made the point that this Testery work was a greater load on staff than the automated processes in the Newmanry.\n\n\n"}

E2 is moderated for quality, but has no formal policy on subject matter. Writing on E2 covers a wide range of topics and genres, including encyclopedic articles, diary entries (known as \"daylogs\"), poetry, humor, and fiction.\n\nThe predecessor of E2 was a similar database called Everything (later labeled \"Everything1\" or \"E1\") which was started around March 1998 by Nathan Oostendorp and was initially closely aligned with and promoted by the technology-related news website Slashdot (by virtue of various key principals having attended the Holland Christian High School), even sharing (at the time) some administrators. The Everything1 software offered vastly more features, and the Everything1 data was twice incorporated into E2: once on November 13, 1999, and again in January 2000.\n\nThe Everything2 server used to be colocated with the Slashdot servers. However, some time after OSDN acquired Slashdot, and moved the Slashdot servers, this hosting was terminated on short notice. This resulted in Everything2 being offline from roughly November 6 to December 9, 2003. Everything2 was then hosted by the University of Michigan for a time. As the Everything2 site put it on October 2, 2006:\n\nNow, we have an arrangement with the University of Michigan, located in Ann Arbor. We exist thanks to their generosity (which is motivated by their academic curiosity, I suppose). They gave us some servers and act as our ISP, free of charge, and all they ask in exchange is that we not display advertisements.\n\nThe Everything2 servers were moved to the nearby Michigan State University in February 2007.\n\nE2 was privately owned by the Blockstackers Intergalactic company, but does not make a profit and is viewed by its long-term users as a collaborative work-in-progress. Until mid-2007 it accepted donations of money and, on occasion, of computer hardware but no longer does so. Some of its administrators are affiliated with Blockstackers, some are not. The site is not a democracy, and the degree to which users influence decisions depends on the nature of the decisions and the administrators making them. As of January 23, 2012, it was announced that the site had been sold to long-time user and coder Jay Bonci under the name Everything2 Media LLC.\n\nWriteups in E1 were limited to 512 bytes in size. This, plus the predominantly \"geek\" membership back then and the lack of chat facilities, meant the early work was often of poor quality and was filled with self-referential humor. As E2 has expanded, stricter quality standards have developed, much of the old material has been removed, and the membership has become broader in interest, although smaller in number. Many noders prefer to write encyclopedic articles similar to those on Wikipedia (and indeed some actively contribute to both E2 and Wikipedia). Some write fiction or poetry, some discuss issues, and some write daily journals, called \"daylogs.\" Unlike Wikipedia, E2 does not have an enforced neutral point of view. An informal survey of noder political beliefs indicates that the user base tends to lean left politically. There are conservative voices as well, however, and while debate nodes (of any kind, political or not) are rarely tolerated, well-formed points of view from any part of the political or cultural spectrum are.\n\nAccording to E2's \"Site Trajectory\", traffic has dropped from 9976 new write-ups created in the month of August 2000, down to 93 new write-ups in February 2017.\n\nSome of the management regard Everything2 as a publication, to which authors submit content. Although Everything2 does not seek to become an encyclopedia, a substantial amount of factual content has been submitted to Everything2.\n\nPolicy states that \"Everything2 is not a bulletin board.\" Writeups which exist as replies to other writeups, or which add a minor point to them or which otherwise do not stand well alone are discouraged, not least because the deletion of the original writeup orphans any replies. This policy helps to moderate flame wars on controversial topics.\n\nEverything2 is not a wiki, and there is no direct way for non-content editors to make corrections or amendments to another author's article. Avenues for correction involve discussing the writeup with its author; petitioning a content editor; adding a note in a special \"broken nodes\" section; or superseding the original writeup with an original, stand-alone follow-up.\n\nLike other online communities, E2 has a social hierarchy and code of behavior, to which it is sometimes difficult for a newcomer to adjust. Moreover, some people complain that new users are held to a different standard from established contributors, and that their writeups are singled out for deletion regardless of content. Another complaint is that all too often, site administrators remove articles that they do not agree with or which they do not see explicit value in, thus biasing the content of the database. Others dismiss such complaints as unjustified; they observe that few communities treat newcomers exactly like long-time members, and they claim that those who learn and obey the rules are usually—though not always—treated fairly.\n\nThere is no consistent, written site policy on acceptable behavior, although the usual intolerance for trolling or hatemongering remains, as is the case with most web-based communities. Bans have occurred for antisocial and/or insulting behaviour, albeit very rarely and only after a more personal approach to change the offender's behavior. Though these decisions are broadly accepted, some current and ex-members of the site believe that this amounts to mismanagement, and point to accumulation of disgruntled ex-users as evidence of a problem.\n\nRarely, a noder will request their E2 account be locked, preventing them from logging in. The causes for this are equally varied as the causes for disruptive noders being forcibly locked out, and happens about as often.\n\nE2 users called \"noders\" create entries called \"nodes\" and add information in multiple \"writeups.\" Only logged-in users can create writeups, and only the author of a writeup or an editor appointed by the site administrators can edit a writeup. E2 categorizes writeups into thirteen types: \"person\", \"place\", \"idea\", \"thing\", \"dream\", \"personal\", \"fiction\", \"poetry\", \"review\", \"log\", \"recipe\", \"essay\", and \"event\". Two additional writeup types, \"lede\" and \"definition\", are usable only by editors and are applied retroactively. Writeups are written in a simplified HTML dialect and do not contain images.\n\nThere are other types of nodes that do not contain writeups; for instance, the administrators can create \"superdoc\" nodes (similar to Wikipedia's ) such as Everything New Nodes and Page of Cool that allow interaction, and each user has a \"homenode\" where he or she can add a short autobiography or other text (or a picture, if the user has posted ten writeups—see Rewards, below).\n\nThe copyright in a writeup rests with the author, and no agreement to any kind of license is entered into by writing on E2 (except for giving the site permission to publish). Authors retain the right to place their work in the public domain, to release it under a copyleft license such as one of those offered by the GNU project or Creative Commons, or to request the removal of their work from the site at some later date.\n\nFor a long time, the posting of copyrighted song lyrics and poetry to the site without approval from the copyright holders, while certainly frowned upon, was not actually prohibited. E2 chose to only passively enforce copyright law, in a manner similar to an ISP (for which see OCILLA section 512(c)). This policy changed in August 2003 to a more active one where writeups containing copyrighted material had to either conform to fair use guidelines (length limits, proportion of quoted material to new text) or be posted with permission.\n\nThe administrators loosely based E2's incentive system on a dual currency system borrowed from many role-playing games. Users may earn experience points (\"XP\"), which count strictly toward level progress, or convertible currency (\"GP\"), which may be used to purchase lesser, temporary privileges. Every time a user creates a writeup, he or she earns five XP. Users with at least ten contributed writeups and 500 experience points can vote (up or down) on a writeup. A positive vote grants the writeup's author one experience point while also having a roughly ⅓ chance of giving one GP to the voter. After voting on a writeup, a noder can see the writeup's \"reputation,\" or number of positive and negative votes (staff do not need to vote in order to see a writeup's reputation). The site's editors may remove writeups that do not meet editorial standards from public view. Authors have the ability to withdraw their own writeups. In both cases the removed writeup is sent to its author's personal \"drafts\" space, where it may be prepared for re-submission or deleted. The only effect writeup deletion has on the author's account is that the five XP granted for creating the writeup is removed. Writeups deleted before March 2011 are visible to the author on a legacy page called \"Node Heaven\"; newer or more recently removed items become drafts.\n\nNew levels are attained by reaching a predefined, but arbitrary total of XP and writeups, which are given in the FAQ. The system grants special powers at certain experience levels, such as \"cool\", which rewards the author with 20 XP and sends the writeup to the \"cool user picks\" column on the front page; the ability to create basic chat rooms on the site; space for uploading a picture to a user's \"homenode\"; and the ability to hide one's self in the list of logged-in users.\n\nWebsite views used to be tracked, but due to a glitch this ability was removed. The glitch looped the view counter and crashed the site on more than one occasion.\n\nEverything2 provides two communication tools: the Chatterbox and the message system.\n\nThe Chatterbox is similar to an IRC channel. It is also nicknamed the catbox. It appears as a panel on the right side of the page that logged-in users can use to read conversations and participate in them. The site's administrators used to have the ability to \"borg\"—prevent from using the Chatterbox or message system—those users whose behavior violated the unwritten standards of politeness and decorum. This was done through a bot called EDB (short for \"Everything Death Borg\"), which announced when it had \"swallowed\" a user. This silencing lasted for five minutes, though persistent trolls were silenced for a longer period—sometimes permanently. , the EDB was no longer much used, only making mostly token appearances for humorous effect. Noders who consistently cause trouble (usually by trolling) can be silenced permanently and can be forbidden from noding altogether, though this is rarely done. This would be initiated by a chanops, (A staff member with a + by his or her username that monitors potential abuse ). There is also a utility called 'chatterlight', which provides the chatlog / message buffer with a larger portion of the screen.\n\nThe message system lets users send private messages to other users. The messages are stored in the user's mailbox to be read when he or she next logs in. The main use for the message system is giving constructive criticism to the author of a writeup; however, it can be and is used like any medium of private communication. Messages received can be archived or deleted at the receiver's discretion.\n\n\"Hard links\" in E2 are simply words or phrases surrounded by [square brackets]. Any words inside square brackets in a writeup will become a link to the E2 node of that title. If a node with that title does not yet exist, following the link will bring up the option to create it.\n\nFor the longest part of its existence, E2 did not permit links to third-party web sites in submitted content. In February 2009, a degree of support for linking external URLs was implemented. A hard linked URL will be clearly marked as an external link with the same link icon that Wikipedia uses. Heavy use of external URLs is discouraged as E2 content is expected to stand on its own within a largely self-supportive infrastructure.\n\n\"Pipe links\" are a variant form of hard links. While a hard link to the node \"Wikipedia\" would look like codice_1, the pipe link allows the author a greater degree of freedom without restricting what nodes can be linked to. For example, one could write \"codice_2\" The sentence looks like this to the reader: \"Online encyclopedias have started to become common sources in my students' research papers.\" Rolling over the phrase with the mouse (e.g. \"online encyclopedias\") shows the hidden content (in this case, \"Wikipedia\") as the link's title.\n\nNoders can link to a specific writeup within a node by appending \"(person)\", \"(place)\", \"(idea)\" or \"(thing)\" to a pipe link. For example, the pipe link codice_3 links directly to the writeup of the type \"thing\" within the \"Wiki\" node. If the node contains more than one writeup of the specified type, the pipe link returns a \"Duplicates Found\" page linking to every writeup of the specified type within the node.\n\nPipe links on E2 often add \"easter egg\" content, such as commentary, humor and hidden information.\n\nAt the bottom of every node, the system displays up to 64 \"soft links\", though each node can store an unlimited number thereof. \"Guest Users\"—any viewers not logged in—can see 24, a logged-in user can see up to 48, and the senior administrators (\"gods,\" though this term has fallen out of favour in recent years) can see up to 64. These are two-way links intended to approximate \"thought processes,\" similar in concept to Jason Rohrer's tangle proxy. Whenever a logged-in user moves from one node to another, be it through a hard link, another soft link, or through the title search box, the system creates (or strengthens) the bidirectional soft link between the two; however, some nodes—namely the special pages and the user profiles—will not display the soft links so created. By repeatedly moving from one node to another, users can and do deliberately create and increase the degree of integration of such soft links; some users will use these soft links to make anonymous comments on others' writing. The site's administrators have the ability to remove soft links at their discretion.\n\n\"Firm links\" are special, editor-created links that serve to redirect between nodes. Firm links are typically used to link multiple forms of a single name or title to aid searching and ensure that readers find the content that they are seeking. A typical use of firm links would be to permanently link the empty node titled 'USA' to a node titled 'United States of America' that contained writeups about the topic. Alternatively, automatic forwarding can be set up for the same thing, in much the same way as forwards exist on Wikipedia.\n\nE2 is run by the free Everything Engine (\"ecore\"), a Perl-based system; its data is stored in a MySQL database.\n\nIn 2001, \"The New York Times\" cited E2 as an example of an emerging class of autonomous, self-organizing sites. A 2001 column in \"The Japan Times\" called E2 \"awe-inspiring in its expansiveness and depth\" and \"a Sim City of knowledge management\". In 2003, Guardian Unlimited listed E2 as one of the best collaborative encyclopedias on the Web. E2 was nominated for a 2004 Webby Award for Technical Achievement.\n\n"}

{"id": "15641682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15641682", "title": "Gardens of Versailles", "text": "Gardens of Versailles\n\nThe Gardens of Versailles (; ) occupy part of what was once the \"Domaine royal de Versailles\", the royal demesne of the château of Versailles. Situated to the west of the palace, the gardens cover some 800 hectares of land, much of which is landscaped in the classic French Garden style perfected here by André Le Nôtre. Beyond the surrounding belt of woodland, the gardens are bordered by the urban areas of Versailles to the east and Le Chesnay to the north-east, by the National Arboretum de Chèvreloup to the north, the Versailles plain (a protected wildlife preserve) to the west, and by the Satory Forest to the south.\n\nAs part of \"le domaine national de Versailles et de Trianon\", an autonomous public entity operating under the aegis of the French Ministry of Culture, the gardens are now one of the most visited public sites in France, receiving more than six million visitors a year.\n\nIn addition to the meticulous manicured lawns, parterres of flowers, and sculptures are the fountains, which are located throughout the garden. Dating from the time of Louis XIV and still using much of the same network of hydraulics as was used during the \"Ancien Régime\", the fountains contribute to making the gardens of Versailles unique. On weekends from late spring to early autumn, the administration of the museum sponsors the \"Grandes Eaux\" – spectacles during which all the fountains in the gardens are in full play. Designed by Andre Le Notre, the Grand Canal is the masterpiece of the Gardens of Versailles. In the Gardens too, the Grand Trianon was built to provide Sun King with the retreat he wanted. Le Petit Trianon is associated with Marie-Antoinette who spent there many weeks with her closest relatives and friends.\n\nIn 1979, the gardens along with the château were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, one of thirty-one such designations in France.\n\nWith Louis XIII’s final purchase of lands from Jean-François de Gondi in 1632 and his assumption of the seigneurial role of Versailles in the 1630s, formal gardens were laid out west of the château. Records indicate that late in the decade Claude Mollet and Hilaire Masson designed the gardens, which remained relatively unchanged until the expansion ordered under Louis XIV in the 1660s. This early layout, which has survived in the so-called Du Bus plan of c.1662, shows an established topography along which lines of the gardens evolved. This is evidenced in the clear definition of the main east-west and north-south axis that anchors the gardens’ layout.\n\nIn 1661, after the disgrace of the finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, who was accused by rivals of embezzling crown funds in order to build his luxurious château at Vaux-le-Vicomte, Louis XIV turned his attention to Versailles. With the aid of Fouquet’s architect Louis Le Vau, painter Charles Le Brun, and landscape architect André Le Nôtre, Louis began an embellishment and expansion program at Versailles that would occupy his time and worries for the remainder of his reign.\n\nFrom this point forward, the expansion of the gardens of Versailles followed the expansions of the château. Accordingly, Louis XIV's building campaigns apply to the gardens as well. At every stage the prescribed tour was carefully managed, under the Sun King's directions.\n\nFirst building campaign\nIn 1662, minor modifications to the château were undertaken; however, greater attention was given to developing the gardens. Existing \"bosquets\" and \"parterres\" were expanded and new ones created. Most significant among the creations at this time were the \"Orangerie\" and the \"Grotte de Thétys\" (Nolhac 1901, 1925).\nThe Versailles Orangery, which was designed by Louis Le Vau, was located south of the château, a situation that took advantage of the natural slope of the hill. It provided a protected area in which orange trees were kept during the winter months (Nolhac 1899, 1902).\n\nThe \"Grotte de Thétys\", which was located to the north of the château, formed part of the iconography of the château and of the gardens that aligned Louis XIV with solar imagery. The grotto would be completed during the second building campaign (Verlet 1985).\n\nBy 1664, the gardens had evolved to the point that Louis XIV inaugurated the gardens with the \"fête galante\" called \"Les Plaisirs de l’Île Enchantée\". The event, which officially was to celebrate his mother, Anne d’Autriche, and his consort Marie-Thérèse but in reality celebrated Louise de La Vallière, Louis’ mistress, was held in May of that year. Guests were regaled with fabulous entertainments in the gardens over a period of one week. As a result of this \"fête\" – particularly the lack of housing for guests (most of them had to sleep in their carriages), Louis realized the shortcomings of Versailles and began to expand the château and the gardens once again (Verlet, 1961, 1985).\n\nSecond building campaign\nBetween 1664 and 1668, a flurry of activity was evidenced in the gardens – especially with regard to fountains and new \"bosquets\"; it was during this time that the imagery of the gardens consciously exploited Apollo and solar imagery as metaphors for Louis XIV. Le Vau’s \"enveloppe\" of the Louis XIII’s château provided a means by which, though the decoration of the garden façade, imagery in the decors of the \"grands appartements\" of the king and queen formed a symbiosis with the imagery of the gardens (Lighthart, 1997; Mâle, 1927).\n\nWith this new phase of construction, the gardens assumed the topographical and iconological design vocabulary that would remain in force until the 18th century. As André Félibien noted in his description of Versailles, solar and apollonian themes predominated with projects constructed at this time: \"Since the sun was the emblem of Louis XIV, and that poets join the sun and Apollo, there is nothing in this superb house that does not relation to this divinity.\" (Félibien, 1674).\n\nThree additions formed the topological and symbolic nexus of the gardens during this phase of construction: the completion of the \"Grotte de Thétys\", the \"Bassin de Latone\", and the \"Bassin d’Apollon\".\n\nGrotte de Thétys\n\nStarted in 1664 and finished in 1670 with the installation of the statuary by the Gilles Guérin, François Girardon, Thomas Regnaudin, Gaspard Marsy, and Balthazar Marsy, the grotto formed an important symbolic and technical component to the gardens. Symbolically, the \"Grotte de Thétys\" related to the myth of Apollo – and by that association to Louis XIV. It was as the cave of the sea nymph, Thetis, where Apollo rested after driving his chariot to light the sky. The grotto was a freestanding structure located just north of the château. The interior, which was decorated with shell-work to represent a sea cave, contained the statue group by the Marsy brothers depicting the sun god attended by nereids (central grouping) and his horses being groomed by attendants of Thetis (the two accompanying statue groups). Originally, these statues were set in three individual niches in the grotto and were surrounded by various fountains and water features (Marie 1968; Nolhac 1901, 1925; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nTechnically, the \"Grotte de Thétys\" played a critical role in the hydraulic system that supplied water to the garden. The roof of the grotto supported a reservoir that stored water pumped from the Clagny pond and which fed the fountains lower in the garden via gravity.\n\nBassin de Latone\n\nLocated on the east-west axis just west and below the \"Parterre d’Eau\", is the \"Bassin de Latone\". Designed by André Le Nôtre, sculpted by Gaspard and Balthazar Marsy, and constructed between 1668–1670, the fountain depicted an episode from Ovid’s \"Metamorphoses\". Latona and her children, Apollo and Diana, being tormented with mud slung by Lycian peasants, who refused to let her and her children drink from their pond, appealed to Jupiter who responded by turning the Lycians into frogs. This episode from mythology has been seen by historians in reference as an allegory to the revolts of the Fronde, which occurred during the minority of Louis XIV. The link between Ovid’s story and this episode from French history is emphasized by the reference to \"mud slinging\" in a political context. The revolts of the Fronde – the word \"fronde\" also means slingshot – have been regarded as the origin of the use of the term \"mud slinging\" in a political context (Berger, 1992; Marie, 1968, 1972, 1976; Nolhac, 1901; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1961, 1985; Weber, 1981).\n\nBassin d’Apollon\nFurther along the east-west axis is the \"Bassin d’Apollon\" – the Apollo Fountain. Occupying the site of \"Rondeau/Bassin des Cygnes\" of Louis XIII, the Apollo Fountain, which was constructed between 1668 and 1671, depicts the sun god driving his chariot to light the sky. The fountain forms a focal point in the garden and serves as a transitional element between the gardens of the \"Petit Parc\" and the \"Grand Canal\" (Marie 1968; Nolhac 1901, 1925; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nGrand Canal\nWith a length of 1,500 metres and a width of 62 metres, the \"Grand Canal\", which was built between 1668 and 1671, physically and visually prolongs the east-west axis to the walls of the \"Grand Parc\". During the \"Ancien Régime\", the \"Grand Canal\" served as a venue for boating parties. In 1674, as a result of a series of diplomatic arrangements that benefited Louis XIV, the king ordered the construction of \"Petite Venise\" – Little Venice. Located at the junction of the \"Grand Canal\" and the junction of the northern transversal branch, Little Venice housed the caravels and yachts that were received from The Netherlands and the gondolas and gondoliers received as gifts from the Doge of Venice, hence the name (Marie 1968; Nolhac 1901, 1925; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nAbove and beyond the decorative and festive aspects of this garden feature, the \"Grand Canal\" also served a practical role. Situated at a low point in the gardens, it collected water it drained from the fountains in the garden above. Water from the \"Grand Canal\" was pumped back to the reservoir on the roof of the \"Grotte de Thétys\" via a network of windmill-powered and horse-powered pumps (Thompson 2006).\n\nParterre d’Eau\nSituated above the Latona Fountain is the terrace of the château, known as the \"Parterre d’Eau\". Forming a transitional element from the château to the gardens below and placed on the north-south axis of the gardens, the \"Parterre d’Eau\" provided a setting in which the imagery and symbolism of the decors of the \"grands appartements\" synthesized with the iconography of the gardens. In 1664, Louis XIV commissioned a series of statues intended to decorate the water feature of the \"Parterre d’Eau\". The \"Grande Commande\", as the commission is known, comprised twenty-four statues of the classic quaternities and four additional statues depicting abductions from the classic past (Berger I, 1985; Friedman, 1988,1993; Hedin, 1981–1982; Marie, 1968; Nolhac, 1901; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1961, 1985; Weber, 1981).\n\nEvolution of the Bosquets\nOne of the distinguishing features of the gardens during the second building campaign was the proliferation of bosquets. Expanding the layout established during the first building campaign, Le Nôtre added or expanded on no fewer that ten bosquets: The \"Bosquet du Marais\" in 1670; the \"Bosquet du Théâtre d’Eau\", \"Île du Roi\" and \"Miroir d’Eau\", the \"Salle des Festins\" (\"Salle du Conseil\"), the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\" in 1671; the \"Labyrinthe\" and the \"Bosquet de l’Arc de Triomphe\" in 1672; the \"Bosquet de la Renommée\" (\"Bosquet des Dômes\") and the \"Bosquet de l’Encélade\" in 1675; and the \"Bosquet des Sources\" in 1678 (Marie 1972, 1976; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nIn addition to the expansion of existing bosquets and the construction of new ones, there were two additional projects that defined this era, the \"Bassin des Sapins\" and the \"Pièce d’Eau des Suisses\".\n\nBassin des Sapins\nIn 1676, the \"Bassin des Sapins\", which was located north of the château below the \"Parterre du Nord\" and the \"Allée des Marmousets\" was designed to form a topological pendant along the north-south axis with the \"Pièce d’Eau des Suisses\" located at the base of the Satory hill south of the château. Later modifications in the garden would transform this fountain into the \"Bassin de Neptune\" (Marie 1972, 1975; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nPièce d’Eau des Suisses\nExcavated in 1678, the \"Pièce d’Eau des Suisses\" – named for the Swiss Guard who constructed the lake – occupied an area of marshes and ponds, some of which had been used to supply water for the fountains in the garden. This water feature, with a surface area of more than 15 hectares, is the second largest – after the \"Grand Canal\" – at Versailles (Marie 1972, 1975; Nolhac 1901, 1925; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nThird building campaign\nModifications in the gardens during the third building campaign were distinguished by a stylistic change from the natural esthetic of André Le Nôtre to the architectonic style of Jules Hardouin Mansart. The first major modification to the gardens during this phase occurred in 1680 when the \"Tapis Vert\" – the expanse of lawn that stretches between the Latona Fountain and the Apollo Fountain – achieved its final size and definition under the direction of André Le Nôtre (Nolhac 1901; Thompson 2006).\n\nBeginning in 1684, the \"Parterre d’Eau\" was remodeled under the direction of Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Statues from the \"Grande Commande\" of 1674 were relocated to other parts of the garden; two twin octagonal basins were constructed and decorated with bronze statues representing the four main rivers of France. In the same year, Le Vau’s \"Orangerie\", located to south of the \"Parterrre d’Eau\" was demolished to accommodate a larger structure designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart. In addition to the \"Orangerie\", the \"Escaliers des Cent Marches\", which facilitated access to the gardens from the south, to the \"Pièce d’Eau des Suisses\", and to the \"Parterre du Midi\" were constructed at this time, giving the gardens just south of the château their present configuration and decoration. \n\nWith the construction of the \"Aile des Nobles\" (1685–1686), the \"Parterre du Nord\" was remodeled to respond to the new architecture of this part of the château. To compensate for the loss of the reservoir on top of the \"Grotte de Thétys\" and to meet the increased demand for water, Jules Hardouin-Mansart designed new and larger reservoirs situated due north of the \"Aile des Nobles\" (Thompson 2006). Construction for the ruinously expensive Canal de l'Eure was inaugurated in 1685; designed by Vauban it was intended to bring waters of the Eure over 80 kilometres, including aqueducts of heroic scale, but the works were abandoned in 1690: see \"The Problem of water\" below.\n\nBetween 1686 and 1687, the Bassin de Latone, under the direction of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, was rebuilt. It is this final version of the fountain that one sees today at Versailles (Hedin 1992; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985) .\n\nDuring this phase of construction, three of the garden’s major bosquets were modified or created. Beginning with the \"Galerie des Antiques\", this bosquet was constructed in 1680 on the site of the earlier and short-lived \"Galerie d’Eau\" (1678). This bosquet was conceived as an open-air gallery in which antique statues and copies acquired by the \"Académie de France\" in Rome were displayed. The following year, construction began on the \"Salle de Bal\". Located in a secluded section of the garden west of the \"Orangerie\", this bosquet was designed as an amphitheater that featured a cascade – the only one surviving in the gardens of Versailles. The \"Salle de Bal\" was inaugurated in 1685 with a ball hosted by the Grand Dauphin. Between 1684 and 1685, Jules Hardouin-Mansart built the \"Colonnade\". Located on the site of Le Nôtre’s \"Bosquet des Sources\", this bosquet featured a circular peristyle formed from thirty-two arches with twenty-eight fountains and was Hardouin-Mansart’s most architectural of the bosquets built in the gardens of Versailles (Marie 1972, 1976; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985)\n\nFourth building campaign\nDue to financial constraints arising from the War of the League of Augsburg and the War of the Spanish Succession, no significant work on the gardens was undertaken until 1704. Between 1704 and 1709, bosquets were modified, some quite radically, with new names suggesting the new austerity that characterized the latter years of Louis XIV’s reign (Marie 1976; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985)\n\nWith the departure of the king and court from Versailles in 1715 following the death of Louis XIV, the palace and gardens entered an era of uncertainty. In 1722, Louis XV and the court returned to Versailles. Seeming to heed his great-grandfather’s admonition not to engage in costly building campaigns, Louis XV did not undertake the costly building campaigns at Versailles that Louis XIV had. During the reign of Louis XV, the only significant addition to the gardens was the completion of the \"Bassin de Neptune\" (1738–1741) (Marie 1984; Verlet 1985).\n\nRather than expend resources on modifying the gardens at Versailles, Louis XV – an avid botanist – directed his efforts at Trianon. In the area now occupied by the \"Hameau de la Reine\", Louis XV constructed and maintained \"les jardins botaniques\" – the botanical gardens. In 1750, the year in which \"les jardins botaniques\" were constructed, the \"Jardinier-Fleuriste\", Claude Richard (1705–1784), assumed administration of the botanical gardens. In 1761, Louis XV commissioned Ange-Jacques Gabriel to build the Petit Trianon as a residence that would allow him to spend more time near the \"jardins botaniques\". It was at the Petit Trianon that Louis XV fell fatally ill with smallpox; on 10 May 1774, the king died at Versailles (Marie, 1984; Thompson, 2006).\n\nPlan of the gardens in 1746 \nUpon Louis XVI’s ascension to the throne, the gardens of the Versailles underwent a transformation that recalled the fourth building campaign of Louis XIV. Engendered by a change in outlook as advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the Philosophes, the winter of 1774-1775 witnessed a complete replanting of the gardens. Trees and shrubbery dating from the reign of Louis XIV were felled or uprooted with the intent of transforming the \"jardins français\" of Le Nôtre and Hardouin-Mansart into an English-style garden.\n\nThe attempt to convert Le Nôtre’s masterpiece into an English-style garden failed to achieve its desired goal. Owing largely to the topology of the land, the English esthetic was abandoned and the gardens replanted in the French style. However, with an eye on economy, Louis XVI ordered the \"palissades\" – the labour-intensive clipped hedging that formed walls in the bosquets – to be replaced with rows of lime trees or chestnut trees. Additionally, a number of the bosquets dating from the time of the Sun King were extensively modified or destroyed. The most significant contribution to the gardens during the reign of Louis XVI was the \"Grotte des Bains d’Apollon\". The rockwork grotto set in an English style bosquet was the masterpiece of Hubert Robert in which the statues from the \"Grotte de Thétys\" were placed (Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nIn 1792, under order from the National Convention, some of the trees in gardens were felled, while parts of the \"Grand Parc\" were parceled and dispersed. Sensing the potential threat to Versailles, Louis Claude Marie Richard (1754–1821) – director of the \"jardins botaniques\" and grandson of Claude Richard – lobbied the government to save Versailles. He succeeded in preventing further dispersing of the \"Grand Parc\" and threats to destroy the \"Petit Parc\" were abolished by suggesting that the \"parterres\" could be used to plant vegetable gardens and that orchards could occupy the open areas of the garden. Fortunately, these plans were never put into action; however, the gardens were opened to the public – it was not uncommon to see people washing their laundry in the fountains and spreading it on the shrubbery to dry (Thompson 2006).\n\nThe Napoleonic era largely ignored Versailles. In the château, a suite of rooms was arranged for the use of the empress Marie-Louise; but the gardens were left unchanged, save for the disastrous felling trees in the \"Bosquet de l’Arc de Triomphe\" and the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\". Massive soil erosion necessitated planting of new trees (Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nWith the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, the gardens of Versailles witnessed the first modifications since the Revolution. In 1817, Louis XVIII ordered the conversion of the \"Île du roi\" and the \"Miroir d’Eau\" into an English-style garden – the \"Jardin du roi\" (Thompson 2006).\n\nWhile much of the chateau’s interior was irreparably altered to accommodate the Museum to all the Glories of France (inaugurated by Louis-Philippe, 10 June 1837), the gardens, by contrast, remained untouched. With the exception of the state visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1855, at which time the gardens were a setting for a gala fête that recalled the \"fêtes\" of Louis XIV, Napoléon III ignored the château, preferring instead the château of Compiègne (Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nWith the arrival of Pierre de Nolhac as director of the museum in 1892, a new era of historical research began at Versailles. Nolhac, an ardent archivist and scholar, began to piece together the history of Versailles, and subsequently established the criteria for restoration of the château and preservation of the gardens, which are ongoing to this day (Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nOwing to the many modifications made to the gardens between the 17th and the 19th centuries, many of the bosquets have undergone multiple modifications, which were often accompanied by name changes.\nDeux Bosquets - Bosquet de la Girondole - Bosquet du Dauphin - Quinconce du Nord - Quinconce du Midi\nThese two bosquets were first laid out in 1663. Located north and south of the east-west axis, these two bosquets were arranged as a series of paths around four \"salles de verdure\" and which converged on a central \"room\" that contained a fountain. In 1682, the southern bosquet was remodeled as the \"Bosquet de la Girondole\", thus named due to spoke-like arrangement of the central fountain. The northern bosquet was rebuilt in 1696 as the \"Bosquet du Dauphin\" with a fountain that featured a dolphin. During the replantation of 1774-1775, both the bosquets were destroyed. The areas were replanted with lime trees and were rechristened the \"Quinconce du Nord\" and the \"Quinconce du Midi\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nLabyrinthe - Bosquet de la Reine\n\nIn 1665, André Le Nôtre planned a maze of unadorned paths in an area south of the Latona Fountain near the \"Orangerie\". (Loach, 1985) In 1669, Charles Perrault – author of the Mother Goose stories – advised Louis XIV to remodel the \"Labyrinthe\" in such a way as to serve the Dauphin's education (Perrault, 1669). Between 1672 and 1677, Le Nôtre redesigned the \"Labyrinthe\" to feature thirty-nine fountains that depicted stories from Aesop's Fables. The sculptors Jean-Baptiste Tuby, Étienne Le Hongre, Pierre Le Gros, and the brothers Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy worked on these thirty-nine fountains each of which was accompanied by a plaque on which the fable was printed, with verse written by Isaac de Benserade; from these plaques, Louis XIV's son learned to read. Once completed in 1677, the \"Labyrinthe\" contained thirty-nine fountains with 333 painted metal animal sculptures. The water for the elaborate waterworks was conveyed from the Seine by the Machine de Marly. The \"Labyrinthe\" contained fourteen water-wheels driving 253 pumps, some of which worked at a distance of three-quarters of a mile. Citing repair and maintenance costs, Louis XVI ordered the \"Labyrinthe\" demolished in 1778. In its place, an arboretum of exotic trees was planted as an English-styled garden. Rechristened \"Bosquet de la Reine\", it would be in this part of the garden that an episode of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, which compromised Marie-Antoinette, transpired in 1785 (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Perrault 1669; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet de la Montagne d'Eau - Bosquet de l'Étoile\nOriginally designed by André Le Nôtre in 1661 as a \"salle de verdure\", this bosquet contained a path encircling a central pentagonal area. In 1671, the bosquet was enlarged with a more elaborate system of paths that served to enhance the new central water feature, a fountain that resembled a mountain, hence the bosquets new name: \"Bosquet de la Montagne d’Eau\". The bosquet was completely remodeled in 1704 at which time it was rechristened \"Bosquet de l’Étoile\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet du Marais - Bosquet du Chêne Vert – Bosquet des Bains d’Apollon – Grotte des Bains d’Apollon\nCreated in 1670, this bosquet originally contained a central rectangular pool surrounded by a turf border. Edging the pool were metal reeds that concealed numerous jets for water; a swan that had water jetting from its beak occupied each corner. The center of the pool featured an iron tree with painted tin leaves that sprouted water from its branches. Because of this tree, the bosquet was also known as the \"Bosquet du Chêne Vert\". In 1705, this bosquet was destroyed in order to allow for the creation of the \"Bosquet des Bains d’Apollon\", which was created to house the statues had once stood in the \"Grotte de Thétys\". During the reign of Louis XVI, Hubert Robert remodeled the bosquet, creating a cave-like setting for the Marsy statues. The bosquet was renamed the \"Grotte des Bains d'Apollon\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nÎle du roi - Miroir d'Eau - Jardin du roi \nOriginally designed in 1671 as two separate water features, the larger – \"Île du roi\" – contained an island that formed the focal point of a system of elaborate fountains. The \"Île du roi\" was separated from the \"Miroir d'Eau\" by a causeway that featured twenty-four water jets. In 1684, the island was removed and the total number of water jets in the bosquet was significantly reduced. The year 1704 witnessed a major renovation of the bosquet at which time the causeway was remodeled and most of the water jets were removed. A century later, in 1817, Louis XVIII ordered the \"Île du roi\" and the \"Miroir d’Eau\" to be completely remodeled as an English-style garden. At this time, the bosquet was rechristened \"Jardin du roi\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nSalle des Festins - Salle du Conseil - Bosquet de l'Obélisque\nIn 1671, André Le Nôtre conceived a bosquet – originally christened \"Salle des Festins\" and later called \"Salle du Conseil\" – that featured a quatrefoil island surrounded by a channel that contained fifty water jets. Each lobe of the island contained simple fountain; access to the island was obtained by two swing bridges. Beyond the channel and placed at the cardinal points within the bosquet were four additional fountains. Under the direction of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the bosquet was completely remodeled in 1706. The central island was replaced by a large basin raised on five steps, which was surrounded by a canal. The central fountain contained 230 jets that, when in play, formed an obelisk – hence the new name \"Bosquet de l'Obélisque\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet du Théâtre d'Eau - Bosquet du Rond-Vert\nThe central feature of this bosquet, which was designed by Le Nôtre between 1671–1674, was an auditorium/theater sided by three tiers of turf seating that faced a stage decorated with four fountains alternating with three radiating cascades. Between 1680 and Louis XIV’s death in 1715, there was near-constant rearranging of the statues that decorated the bosquet. In 1709, the bosquet was rearranged with the addition of the \"Fontaine de l’Île aux Enfants\". As part of the replantation of the gardens ordered by Louis XVI during the winter of 1774-1775, the \"Bosquet du Théâtre d'Eau\" was destroyed and replaced with the unadorned \"Bosquet du Rond-Vert\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985). \"Bosquet du Théâtre d'Eau\" is being recreated in 2014, with South Korean businessman and photographer Yoo Byung-eun being the sole patron, donating million (~ million) to the project.\n\nBosquet des Trois Fontaines (Berceau d'Eau)\nSituated to the west of the \"Allée des Marmousets\" and replacing the short-lived \"Berceau d'Eau\" (a long and narrow bosquet created in 1671 that featured a water bower made by numerous jets of water), the enlarged bosquet was transformed by Le Nôtre in 1677 into a series of three linked rooms. Each room contained a number of fountains that played with special effects. The fountains survived the modifications that Louis XIV ordered for other fountains in the gardens in the early 18th century and were subsequently spared during the 1774-1775 replantation of the gardens. In 1830, the bosquet was replanted at which time the fountains were suppressed. Due to storm damage in the park in 1990 and then again in 1999, the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\" was restored and reinaugurated on 12 June 2004 (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet de l'Arc de Triomphe\nOriginally, this bosquet was planned in 1672 as a simple \"pavillon d'eau\" – a round open expanse with a square fountain in the center. In 1676, this bosquet, located to the east of the \"Allée des Marmousets\" and forming the pendant to the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\", was enlarged and redecorated along political lines that alluded to French military victories over Spain and Austria, at which time the triumphal arch was added – hence the name. As with the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\", this bosquet survived the modifications of the 18th century, but was replanted in 1830 at which time the fountains were removed. As of 2008, this bosquet is in the process of being restored (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet de la Renommée—Bosquet des Dômes\nBuilt in 1675, the \"Bosquet de la Renommée\" featured a fountain statue of Fame – hence the name of the bosquet. With the relocation of the statues from the \"Grotte de Thétys\" in 1684, the bosquet was remodeled to accommodate the statues and the Fame fountain was removed. At this time the bosquet was rechristened \"Bosquet des Bains d'Apollon\". As part of the reorganization of the garden that was ordered by Louis XIV in the early part of the 18th century, the Apollo grouping was moved once again to the site of the \"Bosquet du Marais\" – located near the Latona Fountain – which was destroyed and was replaced by the new \"Bosquet des Bains d'Apollon\". The statues were installed on marble plinths from which water issued; and each statue grouping was protected by an intricately carved and gilded baldachin. The old \"Bosquet des Bains d'Apollon\" was renamed \"Bosquet des Dômes\" due to two domed pavilions built in the bosquet (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet de l'Encélade\nCreated in 1675 at the same time as the \"Bosquet de la Renommée\", the fountain of this bosquet depicts \"Enceladus\", a fallen Giant who was condemned to live below Mt. Etna, being consumed by volcanic lava. From its conception, this fountain was conceived as an allegory of Louis XIV's victory over the \"Fronde\". In 1678, an octagonal ring of turf and eight \"rocaille\" fountains surrounding the central fountain were added. These additions were removed in 1708. When in play, this fountain has the tallest jet of all the fountains in the gardens of Versailles – 25 metres (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nBosquet des Sources - La Colonnade\nDesigned as a simple unadorned \"salle de verdure\" by Le Nôtre in 1678, the landscape architect enhanced and incorporated an existing stream to create a bosquet that featured rivulets that twisted among nine islets. In 1684, Jules Hardouin-Mansart completely redesigned the bosquet by constructing a circular arched double peristyle. The \"Colonnade\", as it was renamed, originally featured thirty-two arches and thirty-one fountains – a single jet of water splashed into a basin center under the arch. In 1704, three additional entrances to the \"Colonnade\" were added, which reduced the number of fountains from thirty-one to twenty-eight. The statue that currently occupies the center of the Colonnade – the Abduction of Persephone – (from the \"Grande Commande\" of 1664) was set in place in 1696 (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nGalerie d'Eau - Galerie des Antiques - Salle des Marronniers\nOccupying the site of the \"Galerie d'Eau\" (1678), the \"Galerie des Antiques\" was designed in 1680 to house the collection of antique statues and copes of antique statues acquired by the \"Académie de France\" in Rome. Surrounding a central area paved with colored stone, a channel was decorated with twenty statues on plinths each separated by three jets of water. The galerie was completely remodeled in 1704 when the statues were transferred to Marly and the bosquet was replanted with horse chestnut trees (\"Aesculus hippocastanum\") – hence the current name \"Salle des Marronniers\" (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nSalle de Bal\nLocated west of the \"Parterre du Midi\" and south of the Latona Fountain, this bosquet, which was designed by Le Nôtre and built between 1681–1683, features a semi-circular cascade that forms the backdrop for this \"salle de verdure\". Interspersed with gilt lead torchères, which supported candelabra for illumination, the \"Salle de Bal\" was inaugurated in 1683 by Louis XIV's son, the Grand Dauphin, with a dance party. The \"Salle de Bal\" was remodeled in 1707 when the central island was removed and an additional entrance was added (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).\n\nCommon to any long-lived garden is replantation, and Versailles is no exception. In their history, the gardens of Versailles have undergone no less than five major replantations, which have been executed for practical and aesthetic reasons.\n\nDuring the winter of 1774-1775, Louis XVI ordered the replanting of the gardens on the grounds that many of the trees were diseased or overgrown and needed to be replaced. Also, as the formality of the 17th-century garden had fallen out of fashion, this replantation sought to establish a new informality in the gardens – that would also be less expensive to maintain – of Versailles. This, however, was not achieved as the topology of the gardens favored the \"jardins français\" over an English-style garden. Then, in 1860, much of the old growth from Louis XVI's replanting was removed and replaced. In 1870, a violent storm struck the area damaging and uprooting scores of trees, which necessitated a massive replantation program. However, owing to the Franco-Prussian War, which toppled Napoléon III, and the \"Commune de Paris\", replantation of the garden did not get underway until 1883 (Thompson, 2006).\n\nThe most recent replantations of the gardens were precipitated by two storms that battered Versailles in 1990 and then again in 1999. The storm damage at Versailles and Trianon amounted to the loss of thousands of trees – the worst such damage in the history of Versailles. The replantations have allowed museum and governmental authorities to restore and rebuild some of the bosquets abandoned during the reign of Louis XVI, such as the \"Bosquet des Trois Fontaines\", which was restored in 2004. (Thompson, 2006).\n\nOwing to the natural cycle of replantations that has occurred at Versailles, it is safe to state that no trees dating from the time of Louis XIV are to be found in the gardens.\n\nThe marvel of the gardens of Versailles – then as now – is the fountains. Yet, the very element that animates the gardens – water – has proven to be the affliction of the gardens since the time of Louis XIV.\n\nThe gardens of Louis XIII required water, and local ponds provided an adequate supply. However, once Louis XIV began expanding the gardens with more and more fountains, supplying the gardens with water became a critical challenge.\n\nTo meet the needs of the early expansions of the gardens under Louis XIV, water was pumped to gardens from ponds near the château, with the Clagny pond serving as the principal source. Water from the pond was pumped to the reservoir on top of the \"Grotte de Thétys\", which fed the fountains in the garden by means of gravitational hydraulics. Other sources included a series of reservoirs located on the Satory Plateau south of the château (Verlet, 1985).\n\nBy 1664, increased demand for water necessitated additional sources. In that year, Louis Le Vau designed the \"Pompe\", a water tower built north of the château. The \"Pompe\" drew water from the Clagny pond using a system of windmills and horsepower to a cistern housed in the \"Pompe\"’s building. The capacity of the \"Pompe\" – 600 m of water per day – alleviated some of the water shortages in the garden (Thompson, 2006).\n\nWith the completion of the \"Grand Canal\" in 1671, which served as drainage for the fountains of the garden, water, via a system of windmills, was pumped back to the reservoir on top of the \"Grotte de Thétys\". While this system solved some of the water supply problems, there was never enough water to keep all of the fountains running in the garden in full-play all of the time (Thompson, 2006).\n\nWhile it was possible to keep the fountains in view from the château running, those concealed in the bosquets and in the farther reaches of the garden were run on an as-needed basis. In 1672, Jean-Baptiste Colbert devised a system by which the fountaineers in the garden would signal each other with whistles upon the approach of the king indicating that their fountain needed to be turned on. Once the king passed a fountain in play, it would be turned off and the fountaineer would signal that the next fountain could be turned on (Thompson, 2006).\n\nIn 1674, the \"Pompe\" was enlarged – hence referred to as the \"Grande Pompe\". Pumping capacity was increased via increased power and the number of pistons used for lifting the water. These improvements increased the water capacity to nearly 3,000 m of water per day; however, the increased capacity of the \"Grande Pompe\" often left the Clagny pond dry (Thompson, 2006).\n\nThe increasing demand for water and the stress placed on existing systems of water supply necessitated newer measures to increase the water supplied to Versailles. Between 1668 and 1674, a project was undertaken to divert the water of the Bièvre river to Versailles. By damming the river and with a pumping system of five windmills, water was brought to the reservoirs located on the Satory Plateau. This system brought an additional 72,000 m of water to the gardens (Thompson, 2006).\n\nDespite the augmentation of water from the Bièvre, the gardens needed still more water, which necessitated more projects. In 1681, one of the most ambitious water projects conceived during the reign of Louis XIV was undertaken. Owing to the proximity of the Seine to Versailles, a project was proposed to raise the water from the river to be delivered to Versailles. Seizing upon the success of a system devised in 1680 that raised water from the Seine to the gardens of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, construction of the \"Machine de Marly\" began the following year.\nThe \"Machine de Marly\" was designed to lift water from the Seine in three stages to the Louveciennes Aqueduct some 100 metres above the level of the river. A series of huge waterwheels was constructed in the river, which raised the water via a system of 64 pumps to a reservoir 48 metres above the river. From this first reservoir, water was raised an additional 56 metres to a second reservoir by a system of 79 pumps. Finally, 78 additional pumps raised the water to the aqueduct, which carried the water to Versailles and Marly.\n\nIn 1685, the \"Machine de Marly\" came into full operation. However, owing to leakage in the conduits and breakdowns of the mechanism, the machine was only able to deliver 3,200 m of water per day – approximately one-half the expected output. The machine was a must-see for visitors to France. Despite the fact that the gardens consumed more water per day than the entire city of Paris, the \"Machine de Marly\" remained in operation until 1817 (Thompson, 2006).\n\nDuring Louis XIV’s reign, water supply systems represented one-third of the building costs of Versailles. Even with the additional output from the \"Machine de Marly\", fountains in the garden could only be run \"à l’ordinaire\" – which is to say at half-pressure. With this measure of economy, fountains still consumed 12,800 m of water per day, far above the capacity of the existing supplies. In the case of the ‘‘Grandes Eaux\" – when all the fountains played to their maximum – more than 10,000 m of water was needed for one afternoon’s display. Accordingly, the ‘‘Grandes Eaux\" were reserved for special occasions such as the Siamese Embassy of 1685-1686 (Hedin, 1992; \"Mercure Galant\", 1685).\nOne final attempt to solve water shortage problems was undertaken in 1685. In this year it was proposed to divert the water of the Eure river, located 160 km. south of Versailles and at a level 26 m. above the garden reservoirs. The project called not only for digging a canal and for the construction of an aqueduct, it also necessitated the construction of shipping channels and locks to supply the workers on the main canal. Between 9,000-10,000 troops were pressed in service in 1685; the next year, more than 20,000 soldiers were engaged in construction. Between 1686 and 1689, when the War of the League of Augsburg began, one-tenth of France’s military was at work on the Canal de l'Eure project. With the outbreak of the war, the project was abandoned, never to be completed. Had the aqueduct been completed, some 50,000 m of water would have been sent to Versailles – more than enough to solve the water problem of the gardens (Thompson, 2006).\n\nToday, the museum of Versailles is still faced with water problems. During the \"Grandes Eaux\", water is circulated by means of modern pumps from the \"Grand Canal\" to the reservoirs. Replenishment of the water lost due to evaporation comes from rainwater, which is collected in cisterns that are located throughout the gardens and diverted to the reservoirs and the \"Grand Canal\". Assiduous husbanding of this resource by museum officials prevents tapping into the supply of potable water of the city of Versailles (Thompson, 2006).\n\nThe creation of the gardens of Versailles is the context for the film \"A Little Chaos\", directed by Alan Rickman and released in 2015, in which Kate Winslet plays a fictional landscape gardener and Rickman plays King Louis XIV.\n\n\nThe following are sources that have contributed to the above article.

{"id": "313822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313822", "title": "Haddock", "text": "Haddock\n\nThe haddock (\"Melanogrammus aeglefinus\") is a saltwater fish from the family Gadidae, the true cods, it is the only species in the monotypic genus \"Melanogrammus\". It is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and associated seas where it is an important species for fisheries, especially in northern Europe. It is also an important food fish and it is marketed fresh, frozen and smoked; smoked varieties include the Finnan haddie and the Arbroath smokie.\n\nThe haddock has the elongated, tapering body shape typical of members of the cod family. It has a relatively small mouth which does not extend to below the eye; with the lower profile of the face being straight and the upper profile slightly rounded, this gives its snout a characteristic wedge-shaped profile. The upper jaw projects beyond the lower more so than in the Atlantic cod. There is a rather small barbel on the chin. There are three dorsal fins, the first being triangular in shape and these dorsal fins have 14 to 17 fin rays in the first, 20 to 24 in the second, and 19 to 22 in the third. There are also two anal fins and in these there are 21 to 25 fin rays in the first and 20 to 24 fin rays in the second. The anal and dorsal fins are all separated from each other. The pelvic fins are small with an elongated first fin ray. The upper side of the haddock's body varies in colour from dark grey brown to nearly black while the lower part of the body is dull silvery white. It has a distinctive black lateral line contrasting with the whitish background colour and which curves slightly over the pectoral fins. It also has a distinctive oval black blotch or ‘thumbprint’, sometimes called the \"Devil's thumbprint\", which sits between the lateral line and the pectoral fin, a feature which leads to the name of the genus \"Melanogrammus\" which derives from Greek \"melanos\" meaning \"black\" and \"gramma\" meaning letter or signal. The dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins are dark grey in colour while the anal fins are pale matching the colour of the silvery sides, with black speckles at their bases. The pelvic fins are white with a variable amount of black spots. Occasionally there are differently coloured variants recorded which may be barred, golden on the back or lack the dark shoulder blotch. The longest haddock recorded was in length and weighed , however, haddock are rarely over in length and the vast majority of haddocks caught in the United Kingdom measure between and . In eastern Canadian waters haddock range in size from to in length and and in weight.\n\nThe haddock has populations on either side of the north Atlantic but it is more abundant in the eastern Atlantic than it is on the North American side. In the north-east Atlantic it occurs from the Bay of Biscay north to Spitzbergen, but it is most abundant north of the English Channel. The largest stocks are in the North Sea, off the Faroe Islands, off Iceland and the coast of Norway but these are discrete populations with little interchange between them. Off North America, the haddock is found from western Greenland south to Cape Hatteras, but the main commercially fished stock occurs from Cape Cod and the Grand Banks. It also occurs around Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea in the Arctic.\n\nThe haddock is a demersal species which occurs at depths from to , although it is most frequently recorded at to . It is found over substrates made up of rock, sand, gravel or shells and it prefers temperatures of between and . Off Iceland and in the Barents Sea haddock undergo extensive migrations but in the north western Atlantic its movements are more restricted, consisting of movements to and from their spawning areas. They reach sexual maturity at 4 years old in males and 5 years old in females, except for the population in the North Sea which matures at ages of 2 year in males and 3 years in females. The overall sex ratio is roughly 1:1 but in shallower area, females predominate, while the males show a preference for waters further offshore.\n\nThe fecundity of the females varies with size, a fish of length bears 55,000 eggs while a fish at has 1,841,000 eggs. Spawning takes place from depths of around down to . In the northwestern Atlantic spawning lasts from January to July, although it does not occur simultaneously in all areas, and in the northeastern Atlantic the spawning season runs from February to June, peaking in March and April. The eggs are pelagic with a diameter of to and they take one to three weeks to hatch. Following metamorphosis, the past larval fish remain pelagic until they attain a length of around , when they settle to a demersal habit. Their growth rate shows considerable regional variation and fish at one year old can measure to , at 2 years old to up to to at 13 years old. Their lifespan is around 14 years. The most important spawning grounds are in the waters off the central coast of Norway, off the southwest of Iceland, and over the Georges Bank. The fish which spawn in inshore waters are normally smaller and younger fish than those which occur in offshore areas. The younger fish have a spawning season which is less than half of that of the larger and older stock offshore. Once hatched the larvae do not appear to travel far from their spawning grounds, however some larvae spawning off the west coast of Scotland are transported into the North Sea through the Fair Isle-Shetland Gap or to the northeast of Shetland. \n\nIn their larval stages haddock mainly feed on the immature stages of copepods and the pelagic post-larvae up to 3-10 cm in length prey on krill, Larvaceans, decapod larvae, copepods and on small fish. Once they have reached the settled, demersal, post-larval stage, benthic invertebrates become increasingly important although they still feed on pelagic organisms such as krill, however the benthic invertebrates form an increasing part of their diet as they grow. Adults prey on fish such as sand eels, \"Trisopterus esmarkii\", \"Hippoglossoides platessoides\", gobies, European sprat, and Atlantic herring, as well as capelin, silver hake, American eels and argentines. When a number of fish taken at the same time have their stomach contents sampled, the majority of stomachs contain similar prey, this suggests that haddocks feed in shoals. Shellfish, sea urchins, brittlestars and worms are also important prey, especially in the winter. Juvenile haddock are an important prey for larger demersal fish, including other gadoids, while seals prey on the larger fish. \n\nThe recorded growth rates of haddock underwent significant change over the 30 to 40 years up to 2011. Growth has been more rapid in recent years, with haddock attaining adult size much earlier than was noted 30-40 years ago. However, the degree to which these larger, younger fish contribute to reproductive success of the population is unknown. The growth rates of haddock, however, have slowed in recent years. There is some evidence which indicates that these slower growth rates may be the result of an exceptionally large year class in 2003. The haddock stock periodically has higher than normal productivity; for example in 1962 and 1967, and to a lesser extent, 1974 and 1999. These result in a more southerly distribution of the fish and have a strong affect on the biomass of the spawning stock, but because of high fishing mortality, these revivals do not have any lasting effect on the population. In general, there was above average recruitment from the 1960s up to the early 1980s, similar to recruitment for Atlantic cod and whiting, this has been called the \"gadoid outburst\". There was strong recruitment in 1999 but since then, the recruitment rate has been very low.\n\nCod and related species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, \"Lernaeocera branchialis\", starts life as a copepod, a small, free-swimming crustacean larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker, which they capture with grasping hooks at the front of their bodies. They penetrate the lumpsucker with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the lumpsucker.\n\nThe female worm, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There, the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worm's body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host's heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod's blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod's gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.\n\nReaching sizes up to , haddock is fished year-round. Some of the methods used are Danish seine nets, trawlers, long lines and fishing nets. The commercial catch of haddock in North America had declined sharply in recent years, but is now recovering, with recruitment rates running around where they historically were from the 1930s to 1960s. In the eastern Atlantic haddock is mainly exploited by mixed fisheries, being targeted with cod and whiting, especially by light trawlers from Scottish ports as well as seiners and pair trawlers. In some fisheries for \"Nephrops norvegicus\" over muddy or sandy bottoms haddock is taken as a bycatch. These fisheries have high rates of discards of undersized haddock, up to 50% of the catch in weight. Haddock are also targeted by boats from England, Denmark and Norway but to a lesser extent and haddock is also taken as a bycatch by industrial fisheries. The main fishing grounds in the eastern Atlantic are located off the European coasts of Russia, around Iceland, in the Barents Sea, around the Faeroe Islands, off western Norway and western Scotland, in the Celtic Sea, off Ireland, in the North Sea and in the English Channel. The United Kingdom and Norway are the countries with the largest catches, the United Kingdom landed over in 1991 and Norway landed over . In the western Atlantic the eastern Georges Bank haddock stock is jointly assessed on an annual basis by Canada and the United States and the stock is collaboratively managed through the Canada-United States Transboundary Management Guidance Committee, this committee was established in 2000. There are around 1,000 licensed fishermen in Canada who participate in the haddock fisheries and the total allowable catch for the eastern Georges Bank area in 2009 was and in 2010. \n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the haddock to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\" Haddock populations on the offshore grounds of Georges Bank off New England and Nova Scotia have made a remarkable comeback with the adoption of catch shares management program, and are currently harvested at only a fraction of sustainable yields.\n\nHaddock is very popular as a food fish. It is sold fresh or preserved by smoking, freezing, drying, or to a small extent canned. Haddock, along with Atlantic cod and plaice, is one of the most popular fish used in British fish and chips.\n\nWhen fresh, the flesh of haddock is clean and white and its cooking is often similar to that of cod. A fresh haddock fillet will be firm and transluscent and hold together well but less fresh fillets will become nearly opaque. Young, fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as scrod in Boston, Massachusetts; this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes, i.e., scrod, markets, and cows. Haddock is the predominant fish of choice in Scotland in a fish supper. It is also the main ingredient of Norwegian fishballs (\"fiskeboller\").\n\nUnlike cod, haddock is not an appropriate fish for salting and preservation is more commonly effected by drying and smoking.\n\nThe smoking of haddock was highly refined in Grimsby. Traditional Grimsby smoked fish (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smokehouses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations. Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. These fishing grounds are sustainably managed and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.\n\nOne popular form of haddock is Finnan haddie which is named after the fishing village of Finnan or Findon in Scotland, where the fish was originally cold-smoked over smouldering peat. Finnan haddie is often poached in milk and served for breakfast. \n\nThe town of Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland produces the Arbroath smokie. This is a hot-smoked haddock which requires no further cooking before eating.\n\nSmoked haddock is naturally an off-white colour and it is frequently dyed yellow, as are other smoked fish. Smoked haddock is the essential ingredient in the Anglo-Indian dish \"kedgeree\", and also in the Scottish dish \"Cullen Skink\" (a 'chowder' like soup).\n\n"}

There have been numerous proposed explanations for this, ranging from Beethoven's uncertainty as to whether Johann's full name (Nikolaus Johann) should be used on this quasi-legal document, to his mixed feelings of attachment to his brothers, to transference of his lifelong hatred of the boys' alcoholic, abusive father (ten years dead in 1802), also named Johann.\n"}
{"id": "35410477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35410477", "title": "History of the Palace of Versailles", "text": "History of the Palace of Versailles\n\nThe Palace of Versailles is a royal château in Versailles, in the Île-de-France region of France. When the château was built, Versailles was a country village; today, however, it is a suburb of Paris, some 20 kilometres southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as well as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien Régime.\n\nThe earliest mention of the name of Versailles is found in a document which predates 1038, the Charte de l'abbaye Saint-Père de Chartres (Charter of the Saint-Père de Chartres Abbey), in which one of the signatories was a certain Hugo de Versailliis (Hugues de Versailles), who was seigneur of Versailles.\n\nDuring this period, the village of Versailles centred on a small castle and church, and the area was governed by a local lord. Its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought some prosperity to the village but, following an outbreak of the Plague and the Hundred Years' War, the village was largely destroyed, and its population sharply declined. In 1575, Albert de Gondi, a naturalized Florentine who gained prominence at the court of Henry II, purchased the seigneury of Versailles.\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, Gondi invited Louis XIII on several hunting trips in the forests surrounding Versailles. Pleased with the location, Louis ordered the construction of a hunting lodge in 1624. Designed by Philibert Le Roy, the structure, a small château, was constructed of stone and red brick, with a based roof. Eight years later, Louis obtained the seigneury of Versailles from the Gondi family and began to make enlargements to the château.\n\nA vignette of Versailles from the 1652 Paris map of shows a traditional design: an entrance court with a \"corps de logis\" on the far western end, flanked by secondary wings on the north and south sides, and closed off by an entrance screen. Adjacent exterior towers were located at the four corners, with the entire structure surrounded by a moat. This was preceded by two service wings, creating a forecourt with a grilled entrance marked by two round towers. The vignette also shows a garden on the western side of the château with a fountain on the central axis and rectangular planted \"parterres\" to either side.\n\nLouis XIV had played and hunted at the site as a boy. With a few modifications, this structure would become the core of the new palace.\n\nLouis XIII's successor, Louis XIV, had a great interest in Versailles. He settled on the royal hunting lodge at Versailles, and over the following decades had it expanded into one of the largest palaces in the world. Beginning in 1661, the architect Louis Le Vau, landscape architect André Le Nôtre, and painter-decorator Charles Lebrun began a detailed renovation and expansion of the château. This was done to fulfill Louis XIV's desire to establish a new centre for the royal court. Following the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678, he began to gradually move the court to Versailles. The court was officially established there on 6 May 1682.\n\nBy moving his court and government to Versailles, Louis XIV hoped to extract more control of the government from the nobility and to distance himself from the population of Paris. All the power of France emanated from this centre: there were government offices here, as well as the homes of thousands of courtiers, their retinues, and all the attendant functionaries of court. By requiring that nobles of a certain rank and position spend time each year at Versailles, Louis prevented them from developing their own regional power at the expense of his own and kept them from countering his efforts to centralise the French government in an absolute monarchy. The meticulous and strict court etiquette that Louis established, which overwhelmed his heirs with its petty boredom, was epitomised in the elaborate ceremonies and exacting procedures that accompanied his rising in the morning, known as the \"Lever\", divided into a \"petit lever\" for the most important and a \"grand lever\" for the whole court. Like other French court manners, \"étiquette\" was quickly imitated in other European courts.\n\nThe expansion of the château became synonymous with the absolutism of Louis XIV. In 1661, following the death of Cardinal Mazarin, chief minister of the government, Louis had declared that he would be his own chief minister. The idea of establishing the court at Versailles was conceived to ensure that all of his advisors and provincial rulers would be kept close to him. He feared that they would rise up against him and start a revolt and believed that if he kept all of his potential threats near him, they would be powerless. After the disgrace of Nicolas Fouquet in 1661 – Louis claimed the finance minister would not have been able to build his grand château at Vaux-le-Vicomte without having embezzled from the crown – Louis, after the confiscation of Fouquet's estate, employed the talents of Le Vau, Le Nôtre, and Le Brun, who all had worked on Vaux-le-Vicomte, for his building campaigns at Versailles and elsewhere. For Versailles, there were four distinct building campaigns (after minor alterations and enlargements had been executed on the château and the gardens in 1662–1663), all of which corresponded to Louis XIV's wars.\n\nThe first building campaign (1664–1668) commenced with the \"Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée\" of 1664, a fête that was held between 7 and 13 May 1664. The fête was ostensibly given to celebrate the two queens of France – Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, and Marie-Thérèse, Louis XIV's wife – but in reality honored the king's mistress, Louise de La Vallière. The celebration of the \"Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée\" is often regarded as a prelude to the War of Devolution, which Louis waged against Spain. The first building campaign (1664–1668) involved alterations in the château and gardens to accommodate the 600 guests invited to the party.\n\nThe second building campaign (1669–1672) was inaugurated with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of Devolution. During this campaign, the château began to assume some of the appearance that it has today. The most important modification of the château was Le Vau's envelope of Louis XIII's hunting lodge. The \"enveloppe\" – often referred to as the \"château neuf\" to distinguish it from the older structure of Louis XIII – enclosed the hunting lodge on the north, west, and south. The new structure provided new lodgings for the king and members of his family. The main floor – the \"piano nobile\" – of the \"château neuf\" was given over entirely to two apartments: one for the king, and one for the queen. The \"grand appartement du roi\" occupied the northern part of the château neuf and \"grand appartement de la reine\" occupied the southern part.\n\nThe western part of the \"enveloppe\" was given over almost entirely to a terrace, which was later enclosed with the construction of the Hall of Mirrors (\"Galerie des Glaces\"). The ground floor of the northern part of the \"château neuf\" was occupied by the \"appartement des bains\", which included a sunken octagonal tub with hot and cold running water. The king's brother and sister-in-law, the duke and duchesse d’Orléans occupied apartments on the ground floor of the southern part of the \"château neuf\". The upper story of the \"château neuf \"was reserved for private rooms for the king to the north and rooms for the king's children above the queen's apartment to the south.\n\nSignificant to the design and construction of the \"grands appartements\" is that the rooms of both apartments are of the same configuration and dimensions – a hitherto unprecedented feature in French palace design. It has been suggested that this parallel configuration was intentional as Louis XIV had intended to establish Marie-Thérèse d’Autriche as queen of Spain, and thus thereby establish a dual monarchy. Louis XIV's rationale for the joining of the two kingdoms was seen largely as recompense for Philip IV's failure to pay his daughter Marie-Thérèse's dowry, which was among the terms of capitulation to which Spain agreed with the promulgation of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which ended the war between France and Spain that began in 1635 during the Thirty Years’ War. Louis XIV regarded his father-in-law's act as a breach of the treaty and consequently engaged in the War of Devolution.\n\nBoth the \"grand appartement du roi\" and the \"grand appartement de la reine\" formed a suite of seven enfilade rooms. Each room is dedicated to one of the then known celestial bodies and is personified by the appropriate Greco-Roman deity. The decoration of the rooms, which was conducted under Le Brun's direction depicted the “heroic actions of the king” and were represented in allegorical form by the actions of historical figures from the antique past (Alexander the Great, Augustus, Cyrus, etc.).\n\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678, which ended the Dutch War, the third building campaign at Versailles began (1678–1684). Under the direction of the architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the Palace of Versailles acquired much of the look that it has today. In addition to the Hall of Mirrors, Hardouin-Mansart designed the north and south wings, which were used, respectively, by the nobility and Princes of the Blood, and the \"Orangerie\". Le Brun was occupied not only with the interior decoration of the new additions of the palace, but also collaborated with Le Nôtre's in landscaping the palace gardens. As symbol of France's new prominence as a European super-power, Louis XIV officially installed his court at Versailles in May 1682.\n\nSoon after the crushing defeat of the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–1697) and owing possibly to the pious influence of Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV undertook his last building campaign at Versailles. The fourth building campaign (1699–1710) concentrated almost exclusively on construction of the royal chapel designed by Hardouin-Mansart and finished by Robert de Cotte and his team of decorative designers. There were also some modifications in the \"appartement du roi\", namely the construction of the \"Salon de l’Œil de Bœuf\" and the King's Bedchamber. With the completion of the chapel in 1710, virtually all construction at Versailles ceased; building would not be resumed at Versailles until some twenty one years later during the reign of Louis XV.\n\nAfter the death of the Louis XIV in 1715, the five-year-old king Louis XV, the court, and the \"Régence\" government of Philippe d’Orléans returned to Paris. In May 1717, during his visit to France, the Russian czar Peter the Great stayed at the Grand Trianon. His time at Versailles was used to observe and study the palace and gardens, which he later used as a source of inspiration when he built Peterhof on the Bay of Finland, west of Saint Petersburg.\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XV, Versailles underwent transformation but not on the scale that had been seen during his predecessor's reign. When Louis XV and the court returned to Versailles in 1722, the first project was the completion of the Salon d'Hercule, which had been begun during the last years of Louis XIV's reign but was never finished due to the king's death.\n\nSignificant among Louis XV's contributions to Versailles were the \"petit appartement du roi\"; the \"appartements de Mesdames\", the \"appartement du dauphin\", the \"appartement de la dauphine\" on the ground floor; and the two private apartments of Louis XV – \"petit appartement du roi au deuxième étage\" (later transformed into the \"appartement de Madame du Barry\") and the \"petit appartement du roi au troisième étage\" – on the second and third floors of the palace. The crowning achievements of Louis XV's reign were the construction of the Opéra and the Petit Trianon.\n\nEqually significant was the destruction of the \"Escalier des Ambassadeurs\" (Ambassadors' Stair), the only fitting approach to the State Apartments, which Louis XV undertook to make way for apartments for his daughters.\n\nThe gardens remained largely unchanged from the time of Louis XIV; the completion of the \"Bassin de Neptune\" between 1738 and 1741 was the most important legacy Louis XV made to the gardens. \n\nTowards the end of his reign, Louis XV, under the advice of Ange-Jacques Gabriel, began to remodel the courtyard façades of the palace. With the objective revetting the entrance of the palace with classical façades, Louis XV began a project that was continued during the reign of Louis XVI, but which did not see completion until the 20th century.\n\nIn 1774, shortly after his ascension, Louis XVI ordered an extensive replanting of the bosquets of the gardens, since many of the century-old trees had died. Only a few changes to Le Nôtre's design were made: some bosquets were removed, others altered, including the Bains d'Apollon (north of the Parterre de Latone), which was redone after a design by Hubert Robert in \"anglo-chinois\" style (popular during the late 18th century), and the Labyrinthe (at the southern edge of the garden) was converted to the small Jardin de la Reine. In the interior of the palace, the library and the \"salon des jeux\" in the \"petit appartement du roi\" and the \"petit appartement de la reine\", redecorated by Richard Mique for Marie-Antoinette, are among the finest examples of the style Louis XVI.\n\nOn 6 October 1789, the royal family had to leave Versailles and move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, as a result of the Women's March on Versailles. During the early years of the French Revolution, preservation of the palace was largely in the hands of the citizens of Versailles. In October 1790, Louis XVI ordered the palace to be emptied of its furniture, requesting that most be sent to the Tuileries Palace. In response to the order, the mayor of Versailles and the municipal council met to draft a letter to Louis XVI in which they stated that if the furniture was removed, it would certainly precipitate economic ruin on the city. A deputation from Versailles met with the king on 12 October after which Louis XVI, touched by the sentiments of the residents of Versailles, rescinded the order.\n\nEight months later, however, the fate of Versailles was sealed: on 21 June 1791, Louis XVI was arrested at Varennes after which the \"Assemblée nationale constituante\" accordingly declared that all possessions of the royal family had been abandoned. To safeguard the palace, the \"Assemblée nationale constituante\" ordered the palace of Versailles to be sealed. On 20 October 1792 a letter was read before the National Convention in which Jean-Marie Roland de la Platière, interior minister, proposed that the furnishings of the palace and those of the residences in Versailles that had been abandoned be sold and that the palace be either sold or rented. The sale of furniture transpired at auctions held between 23 August 1793 and 30 nivôse an III (19 January 1795). Only items of particular artistic or intellectual merit were exempt from the sale. These items were consigned to be part of the collection of a museum, which had been planned at the time of the sale of the palace furnishings.\n\nIn 1793, Charles-François Delacroix deputy to the Convention and father of the painter Eugène Delacroix proposed that the metal statuary in the gardens of Versailles be confiscated and sent to the foundry to be made into cannon. The proposal was debated but eventually it was tabled. On 28 floréal an II (5 May 1794) the Convention decreed that the château and gardens of Versailles, as well as other former royal residences in the environs, would not be sold but placed under the care of the Republic for the public good. Following this decree, the château became a repository for art work seized from churches and princely homes. As a result of Versailles serving as a repository for confiscated art works, collections were amassed that eventually became part of the proposed museum.\n\nAmong the items found at Versailles at this time a collection of natural curiosities that has been assembled by the sieur Fayolle during his voyages in America. The collection was sold to the comte d’Artois and was later confiscated by the state. Fayolle, who had been nominated to the \"Commission des arts\", became guardian of the collection and was later, in June 1794, nominated by the Convention to be the first \"directeur du Conservatoire du Muséum national de Versailles\". The next year, André Dumont the people's representative, became administrator for the department of the Seine-et-Oise. Upon assuming his administrative duties, Dumont was struck with the deplorable state into which the palace and gardens had sunk. He quickly assumed administrative duties of the château and assembled a team of conservators to oversee the various collections of the museum.\n\nOne of Dumont's first appointments was that of Huges Lagarde (10 messidor an III (28 June 1795), a wealthy soap merchant from Marseille with strong political connections, as bibliographer of the museum. With the abandonment of the palace, there remained no less than 104 libraries which contained in excess of 200,000 printed volumes and manuscripts. Lagarde, with his political connections and his association with Dumont, became the driving force behind Versailles as a museum at this time. Lagarde was able to assemble a team of curators including sieur Fayolle for natural history and, Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau, the painter responsible for the ceiling painting in the Opéra, was appointed as curator for painting.\n\nOwing largely to political vicissitudes that occurred in France during the 1790s, Versailles succumbed to further degradations. Mirrors were assigned by the finance ministry for payment of debts of the Republic and draperies, upholstery, and fringes were confiscated and sent to the mint to recoup the gold and silver used in their manufacture. Despite its designation as a museum, Versailles served as an annex to the Hôtel des Invalides pursuant to the decree of 7 frimaire an VIII (28 November 1799), which commandeered part of the palace and which had wounded soldiers being housed in the \"petit appartement du roi\".\n\nIn 1797, the \"Muséum national\" was reorganised and renamed \"Musée spécial de l’École française\". The \"grands appartements\" were used as galleries in which the \"morceaux de réception\" submitted by artists seeking admission to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture during the 17th and 18th centuries, the series \"The Life of Saint Bruno\" by Eustache Le Sueur and the \"Life of Marie de Médicis\" by Peter Paul Rubens were placed on display. The museum, which included the sculptures in the garden, became the finest museum of classic French art that had existed.\n\nWith the advent of Napoléon and the First Empire, the status of Versailles changed. Paintings and art work that had previously been assigned to \"Muséum national\" and the \"Musée spécial de l’École française\" were systematically dispersed to other locations, and eventually the museum was closed. In accordance with provisions of the 1804 Constitution, Versailles was designated as an imperial palace for the department of the Seine-et-Oise.\n\nWhile Napoléon did not reside in the château, apartments were, however, arranged and decorated for the use of the empress Marie-Louise. The emperor chose to reside at the Grand Trianon. The château continued to serve, however, as an annex of the Hôtel des Invalides Nevertheless, on 3 January 1805, Pope Pius VII, who came to France to officiate at Napoléon's coronation, visited the palace and blessed the throng of people gathered on the \"parterre d'eau\" from the balcony of the Hall of Mirrors.\n\nThe Bourbon Restoration saw little activity at Versailles. Areas of the gardens were replanted but no significant restoration and modifications of the interiors were undertaken, despite the fact that Louis XVIII would often visit the palace and walk through the vacant rooms. Charles X chose the Tuileries Palace over Versailles and rarely visited his former home.\n\nWith the Revolution of 1830 and the establishment of the July Monarchy, the status of Versailles changed. In March 1832, the \"Loi de la Liste civile\" was promulgated, which designated Versailles as a crown dependency. Like Napoléon before him, Louis-Philippe chose to live at the Grand Trianon; however, unlike Napoléon, Louis-Philippe did have a grand design for Versailles.\n\nIn 1833, Louis-Philippe proposed the establishment of a museum dedicated to “all the glories of France,” which included the Orléans dynasty and the Revolution of 1830 that put Louis-Philippe on the throne of France. For the next decade, under the direction of Frédéric Nepveu and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, the château underwent irreversible alterations. The museum was officially inaugurated on 10 June 1837 as part of the festivities that surrounded the marriage of the Prince royal, Ferdinand-Philippe d’Orléans with princess Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and represented one of the most ambitious and costly undertakings of Louis-Philippe's reign. Over, the emperor at the king's home – Napoléon at Louis XIV's; in a word, it is having given to this magnificent book that is called French history this magnificent binding that is called Versailles\" (Victor Hugo).\n\nLater, Balzac characterised the effort in less laudatory terms as the “hospital of the glories of France”.\n\nThe southern wing (Aile du Midi) was given over to the Galerie des Batailles (Hall of Battles), which necessitated the demolition of most of the apartments of the Princes of the Blood who lived in this part of the palace during the Ancien Régime. The Galerie des Batailles was modeled on the Grande Galerie of the Louvre Palace and was intended to glorify French military history from the Battle of Tolbiac (traditionally dated 495) to the Battle of Wagram (5–6 July 1809). While a number of the paintings were of questionable quality, a few were masterpieces, such as the \"Battle of Taillebourg\" by Eugène Delacroix. Part of the northern wing (Aile du Nord) was converted to the Salle des Croisades, a room dedicated to famous knights of the Crusades and decorated with their names and coats of arms. The apartments of the dauphin and the dauphine as well as those of Louis XV’s daughters on the ground floor of the \"corps de logis\" were transformed into portrait galleries. To accommodate the displays, some of the \"boiseries\" were removed and either put into storage or sold. During the Prussian occupation of the palace in 1871, the \"boiseries\" in storage were burned as firewood.\n\nDuring the Second Empire, the museum remained essentially intact. The palace did serve as the backdrop for a number of state events including the visit by Queen Victoria.\n\nPierre de Nolhac arrived at the Palace of Versailles in 1887 and was appointed curator of the museum 18 November 1892. Upon his arrival, he planned to re-introduce historical galleries, organized scientifically, in contrast to the approach of Louis-Philippe, who had created the first galleries in a manner aimed at glorifying the history of France. At the same time, Nolhac began to restore the palace to its appearance before the Revolution. To achieve these two goals, Nolhac removed rooms, took down the artworks and gave the rooms some historical scenery. He explained in his memoirs, for example that \"the first room sacrificed was that of the kings of France which had walls lined with effigies, real and imaginary, of our kings since Clovis\". The revolution wrought by Nolhac produced a new awareness of the castle. Members of high society and nobility, such as the Duke of Aumale and the Empress Eugenie flocked to see new developments. Nolhac also working to bring in foreign personalities. On 8 October 1896, Czar Nicolas II and his wife Alexandra, arrived at Versailles. Nolhac also organized events aimed at raising the awareness of potential donors to the palace. The owner of the \"New York Herald\", Gordon Bennett, gave 25,000 francs for restructuring the 18th-century rooms. The development of private donations led to the creation of the Friends of Versailles in June 1907.\n\nUnder the aegis of , chief conservator of the museum from 1952 to 1980, the palace witnessed some of its most ambitious conservation and restoration projects: the Opéra (completed in 1957); the Grand Trianon (1965); the Chambre de la Reine (1975); the Chambre de Louis XIV and the Hall of Mirrors (1980). At this time, the ground floor of the northern wing was converted into a gallery of French history from the 17th century to the 19th century. Additionally, at this time, policy was established in which the French government would aggressively seek to acquire as much of original furniture and artwork that had been dispersed at the time of the Revolution of 1789 as possible.\n\nWith the past and ongoing restoration and conservation projects at Versailles, the Fifth Republic has enthusiastically promoted the museum as one of France's foremost tourist attractions. The palace, however, still serves political functions. Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the Sénat and the Assemblée Nationale meet in congress in Versailles to revise or otherwise amend the French Constitution, a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution. The Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles was created in 1995.\n\nChâteau de Versailles Spectacles organised the Jeff Koons Versailles exhibition, held from 9 October 2008 to 4 January 2009. Jeff Koons said that \"I hope the juxtaposition of today's surfaces, represented by my work, with the architecture and fine arts of Versailles will be an exciting interaction for the viewer.\" Elena Geuna and Laurent Le Bon, curators of the exhibition present it as follow: \"It is the city aspect that underlies this entire venture. In recent years, many a cultural institution has attempted a confrontation between a heritage setting and contemporary works. The originality of this exhibition seems to us somewhat different, as regards both the chosen venue and the way it has been laid out. Echo, dialectic, opposition, counterpoint... Not for us to judge!\"\n\nThe bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV (Statue équestre de Louis XIV), a sculpture created by both Pierre Cartellier (1757-1831) and Louis Petitot (1794-1862) and completed in 1836, was restored in 2009. On April 27, 2009, the statue, having previously been situated in the courtyard (Cour d'Honneur), was placed outside the gates on the Place d’Armes (intersection of Avenue Rockefeller and Avenue de Paris).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41058718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41058718", "title": "Japanese rebus monogram", "text": "Japanese rebus monogram\n\nA Japanese rebus monogram is a monogram in a particular style, which spells a name via a rebus, as a form of Japanese wordplay or visual pun. Today they are most often seen in corporate logos or product logos.\n\nThese symbols are particularly common for traditional food brands, notably soy sauce. An example is the logo for Yamasa soy sauce, which is a ∧ with a サ under it. This is read as \"Yama,\" for (symbolized by the ∧) + .\n\nThe monogram is composed of two parts: one a Japanese character, most often kanji, but also katakana or hiragana; the other a simple symbol, such as a circle or square. The symbol is pronounced according to its name, and together (in either order, but generally symbol first) these form a Japanese name.\n\nJapanese family names are generally two kanji characters, each usually of one or two morae – hence one or two hiragana or katakana if written that way – and thus can be represented as one symbol plus one kanji character, sometimes one hiragana or katakana. Only a few symbols are used, and thus only a few names can be written as a monogram this way. A name may be represented by a symbol that does not correspond to it but is homophonous – further punning – which is aided by the large degree of homophony in Japanese. For example, in a name may be represented by the symbol ┐, though this actually corresponds to ; or in a name may be represented by the symbol ○, though this actually corresponds to .\n\nThere are many variations on this basic design – only one character from the name may be used, the pronunciation need not correspond to an actual name, other typographical symbols can be used (like 〆 \"shime\"), two symbols (and no characters) may be used – for example, can be spelt as ○∧ – and unpronounceable or unpronounced symbols may also be incorporated decoratively.\n\nFor example, the Yamasa symbol was created as a modification of the boat emblem of the Kishū branch of the Tokugawa clan, which was composed as ∧ + キ, with キ for \"ki\" in Kishū and the ∧ purely decorative. The Yamasa variant turned the キ on its side and reinterpreted it as a サ \"sa;\" the resulting \"Yamasa\" reading does not correspond to an actual name (the family name is instead Hamaguchi), though it sounds like a family name and such a family name does exist (e.g., in form 山佐).\n\nThese readings are used for other symbols as well. Most commonly, a circled symbol is pronounced \"maru\" + (symbol reading), for ; circling a symbol is common, dating to circular seals. A notable example is the of the National Tax Agency, which uses a circled as their symbol. They are thus known colloquially as the \"Marusa,\" from 〇査 (\"maru\" + \"sa\"). This is notably present in the movie title . As katakana this would be written as ㋚; see Enclosed CJK Letters and Months for standard circled symbols.\nRarer variants exist, like for Kikkoman soy sauce (tortoises are said to live for 10,000 years), which uses a hexagon to symbolize a tortoise shell (亀甲), with inside.\n\nOnly a handful of symbols are commonly used, though some have different readings; these are:\n\nThere is no standard everyday Japanese term for these monograms. Rather, they are referred to by their use, such as , , etc., or generically as , , etc.\n\nAs designs and corporate symbols, these date at least to the mid-17th century, and early on were featured on noren, as the example of Yamasa indicates. They presumably come from the graphic tradition of the battlefield flags of the Warring States Period (Sengoku period, mid-15th to early 17th century), as seen in the simple clan name designs of Sashimono and Uma-jirushi. More broadly, these come from the same heraldic tradition as mon, where family emblems are pronounced according to the design, yielding the family name, as in \"Mitsu-ya\" (\"three arrows\"). Note that while many mon feature a kanji from the family name, the mon as a whole is not pronounceable as the full name.\n\nDuring the Edo period, pictorial rebuses known as were immensely popular, and involved similar wordplay; see Rebus#Japan. Today the most often seen of these pictorial symbols is a picture of a sickle, a circle, and the letter , read as , interpreted as , the old-fashioned form of . This is known as the , and dates to circa 1700, being used in kabuki since circa 1815.\n\n"}

Crockett. As a youth, he became a fan of pro wrestling, which had thrived during the 1920s with such grapplers as Strangler Lewis and Joe Stecher dominating the scene.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a dispute arose over the bookings of new wrestling sensation Jim Londos, so New York City promoter Jack Curley negotiated an alliance between various regional managers that enabled Londos to travel the country as champion while allowing the promoters to share profits evenly across the regions. As a result of this arrangement, new wrestling \"territories\" emerged across the U.S., and in 1935, a 25-year-old Crockett, who had also served as a concert promoter while also owning a theater and a restaurant, decided to set up a permanent wrestling shop based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The organization, known as Jim Crockett Promotions, scheduled wrestling events in both Carolinas, as well as in Virginia, under the banner of Eastern States Championship Wrestling. Over the next decade, ESCW featured some of the top wrestling stars of the day. Then in 1948, wrestling's top promoters gathered in Waterloo, Iowa to form the industry's first true governing body, known as the National Wrestling Alliance. As the dominant force representing the Carolina region, Jim Crockett Promotions soon became an important member of the NWA, with Crockett serving as a chief lieutenant under longtime NWA President and leading St. Louis promoter Sam Muchnick.\n\nOver the next 25 years, Crockett's Carolina territory reigned among the most successful regions in the NWA, as he regularly sold out the 16,000-seat Greensboro Coliseum featuring such stars as Johnny Weaver, Rip Hawk, Swede Hanson, and Gene & Ole Anderson on his Championship Wrestling program.\n\nThe championship trophy of the Southern Hockey League was named the James Crockett Cup.\n\nIn 1976, the Crockett family purchased the Asheville Orioles and renamed them the Charlotte Orioles. They also restored the deteriorating Calvin Griffith Park. It was renamed Jim Crockett Memorial Park, after Jim Crockett, Sr, in 1977. It would later be renamed Knights Park upon purchase by George Shinn.\n\nBy the early 1970s, an ailing Crockett was forced to retire, as his son-in-law John Rigley had begun to take over many of the territory's responsibilities. Crockett died on April 1, 1973, and control of the company was then ceded to his son, 28-year-old Jim Crockett, Jr., who took over the promotion and ultimately renamed it \"Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling.\"\n\nJim Crockett Promotions would eventually hold a tag team tournament from 1986 through 1988 in honor of him called the Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament.\n\nHe was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2015.\n\nHe was married to Elizabeth Jackson Eversole Crockett, with whom he had four children: James Allen Crockett, Jr., David Finley Crockett, Charles J. \"Jackie\" Crockett, and Frances Earl Crockett.\n\nEstablished in 1931, the Crockett Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to financially assist US military veterans who've returned home from service. The organization is named after Jim Crockett Sr. and maintains a strong association to professional wrestling and baseball. Various figures from the pro wrestling industry have endorsed Crockett Foundation.\n\n"}

{"id": "797380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797380", "title": "Living museum", "text": "Living museum\n\nA living museum, also known as a living history museum, is a type of museum which recreates historical settings to simulate past time period, providing visitors with an experiential interpretation of history. It is a type of museum that recreates to the fullest extent conditions of a culture, natural environment or historical period.\n\nA costumed historian has many roles and responsibilities at historical sites. In addition to conducting tours, interpreting a space, or portraying a historical character, they are also involved in the research process that aides the site interpretation. Full-time staff interpreters develop public programs, tours, and write scripts for interpretative panels, pamphlets, and videos. They often work closely with the curatorial and education staff to collaborate on ideas about collection tours, school tours, educational programs, and site interpretation. Supervisors are also responsible for the extensive training of new staff members, volunteers, and interns. Most historical interpretation positions do not require the applicant to have a specific degree or background. Perspective employers are looking for interpreters who have good communication skills and are comfortable speaking in front of large audiences. They should also possess strong research and writing skills. While a master's degree is not usually required, a background or degree in history, public history, museum studies, or education is beneficial. The U.S. Bureau of Labor projected the job growth for historical interpreters increasing by eight percent through 2022. The average salary for full-time interpretation staff was $24,310 in 2013. A large part of the competencies acquired by the interpreter are gained through experience and on-the-job-training at each individual site.\n\nThe main interpretative technique of living history museums, aside from exhibitions, are the use of costumed interpreters or historians. Costumed historians make history come alive through interactions that formulate social, cultural, and political connections with the past. There are two different types of costumed interpretation utilized at living history sites; first and third person. In first person interpretation, the costumed historian portrays a specific historical character, adopting speech patterns, mannerisms, worldviews, and attitudes of their character. Since the interpreters are representing a historical character during a particular time period, their knowledge and therefore how they interact with the public, is limited to their designated character and historic time period. For example, interpreters at the English Village at Plimoth Plantation are first person interpreters who portray some of the original residents of Plymouth Colony. Third person interpretation does not limit the costumed historian to a particular historical character or time period and maintain a working knowledge of both the past and present. Instead, they represent a gender, status, and occupation. Plimoth Plantation employs third person interpretation at the Wampanoag Homesite where, although dressed in historically accurate clothing, speak from a modern perspective about Wampanoag history and culture. Both first and third person costumed historians participate in demonstrating and performing daily tasks and crafts of the time period. Most interpreters at living history sites have a background in history, public history, museum studies, or education, and conduct significant historical research in order to effectively and accurately provide interpretation to the public.\n\nFreeman Tilden, a National Park Service Interpreter known as the father of interpretation, wrote Interpreting Our Heritage in 1957. His book is one of the first comprehensive instructional texts on the subject of interpretation and outlines six basic interpretative principles that are still taught today in interpretive training sessions nationwide. The six principles of interpretation are: (1) interpretation that does not somehow relate to what is on display or being described to enhance the visitor experience will be sterile, (2) information is not interpretation but all interpretation includes information, (3) interpretation is teachable art, (4) the main aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation, (5) interpretation should aim to present a whole instead of simply a part, and (6) interpretation geared toward children should follow a fundamentally different approach rather than a dilution of the presentation given to adults.\n\nScholars and museum professionals have done significant work exploring the different interpretation styles, how the museum presents and explains the role of the costumed historian, and how the interaction between visitor and costumed interpreter impacts the visitor’s overall museum experience. Jay Anderson, in his 1984 book, Time Machines: The World of Living History, defines living history as an “attempt by people to simulate life in another time” and stresses its importance within American culture. He argues that living history museums function as powerful “time machines” that transport visitors both mentally and emotionally into the past for a unique learning experience. Anderson divides the recreated historical experience enacted at living history museums into three categories based on their purpose and outcome: educational for museum purposes, research for archaeological inquiries, and recreation for entertainment.\n\nA major concern at living history museums is the idea of authenticity. Living historians define authenticity as perfect simulation between a living history activity and the piece of the past it is meant to re-create. A major difference between living history museums and other historical interpretation is that at living history sites, the interpretation is usually given in the first-person present, versus the third-person past narratives given at other sites. Living history museums seek to convey to visitors the experience of what it felt like to live in the past. Critics of living history museums argue that replication of past states of mind is impossible, and therefore living history is inherently inaccurate.\n\nThe relative authenticity of living history farms varies significantly. At its best, they most accurately reflect the past appropriate to the time period while at their worst they may portray gross inaccuracies in an attempt to portray a certain idealized image. One such example is Wichita’s Old Cowtown Museum, which in its small, rural representation of Wichita resembles Western movies and Wild West myths more than the bustling urban city that Wichita quickly became. This living history narrative developed because of the availability of small historical buildings and inaccurate replicas, prodding from the city, and the influence of Hollywood. Museum professionals must grapple with these issues of conflicting audience and institutional needs which impact the overall structure of living history. Living history museums have also been criticized for their ability to teach, particularly from those that believe \"living history is antiquarian, idyllic, or downright misleading.\" In response to this question, the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM) has stated that they distinguish between an unchanging past and an interpretation of a constantly changing past. It additionally was affirmed by the ALHFAM that they also support Dr. Scott Magelssen’s idea that living history museums produce history as others do, such as teachers in classrooms, authors in monographs, and even directors in film.\n\n"}
{"id": "7696324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7696324", "title": "Miskito language (typological overview)", "text": "Miskito language (typological overview)\n\nThis rather technical article provides a typological sketch of the Miskito language. Another related article outlines Miskito grammar in fuller detail. The distinctive purpose of the present article is to single out those specific features of Miskito linguistic structure that are relevant to this language's general typological classification and characterization, answering the question: What major features make this language similar to or different from other languages? This article is likely to be of most interest and use to readers interested in general linguistics, language typology, and related areas such as areal typology, and especially (though not exclusively) to professional linguists. Another possible use of this article is as a thumbnail sketch of the language, a checklist of its most salient points, serving as a brief guide to the fuller language description in the Miskito grammar article.\n\nThe Miskito phoneme inventory includes three vowels (\"a, i, u\"), apparently with phonemic length playing a part. Consonant series include voiced and voiceless plosives, voiced nasals and semivowels, two liquids and the fricative \"s\". Orthographic \"h\" apparently represents a suprasegmental feature.\n\nSyllables consist of a vowel nucleus preceded and followed by a maximum of two consonant: (C)(C)V(C)(C). Word stress is normally on the first syllable and not distinctive.\n\nInflectional and derivational morphology are of moderate complexity and predominantly suffixing, together with the use of infixes in the nominal paradigm.\n\nThe nominal morphological categories are ligature and person (but not number) of the possessor, the exponents of which have suffix and infix allophones, except for third person and first person inclusive possessor indices, which are preposed particles. Plural number is indicated by a postpositive particle.\n\nIn the verbal morphology, tense, mood and person (of the subject) are marked by suffixes (and sometimes fused into portmanteau suffix forms). Object indices of transitive verbs are represented by particles preceding the verb (third person is zero). Number is not marked in these subject and object indices, but a plural subject may be indicated through a verbal periphrasis serving this function.\n\nSentence order is predominantly SOV. Auxiliaries follow main verbs. Sentence particles are sentence-final. Within the noun phrase, most determiners precede the head, but articles follow it, as do quantifiers. Adjectives may either precede or follow the head noun. Possessors precede possessed, and relative clauses precede their head. The ligature morpheme generally occurs on the noun whenever this is preceded by one of the items mentioned, and also when it takes a possessive index. Postpositional structures are found.\n\nMiskito is consistently head-marking. There is pro-drop for both subject and object (i.e. subject and object pronouns are commonly omitted). The finite verb's subject argument is indexed for person (not for number) on the verb. Transitive verbs also index their object through pre-verbal particles (zero for third person). A maximum of one such object index is possible. If a transitive verb has both a patient and a recipient, the latter is not indexed and appears as a postpositional phrase (indirect object).\n\nThe expression of nominal possessive or genitive relations is similarly head-marking: the head (i.e. the possessed) is marked with indices indicating the person of the dependent (the possessor), the noun phrase expressing which is either omitted normally if pronominal (a pro-drop phenomenon) or precedes the head, e.g. \"arask-i\" 'my horse' (or \"yang arask-i\"), \"araska\" 'his horse' (zero-marked possessor), \"Juan araska\" 'Juan's horse' (cf. \"aras\" 'horse' without ligature).\n\nOther relations between a verb and its noun phrase complements or adjuncts are expressed by means of postpositional structures or relational constructions. Postpositions are invariable and follow the noun phrase, e.g. \"Nicaragua ra\" 'in/to Nicaragua'. A relational construction has the internal form of a possessive construction (above), except that the place of the head noun is occupied by a quasi-noun called a relational; the latter is often followed by a postpositon. E.g. \"nin-i-ra\" (or \"yang ninira\") 'behind me', \"nina-ra\" (or \"witin ninara\") 'behind him', \"Juan nina-ra\" 'behind Juan', where the relational \"nina\" imitates a possessed noun.\n\nThere is a copula with an irregular and defective conjugational paradigm.\n\nNegation is achieved through various constructions. One is the use of the verb's negative participle, which is invariable for person and tense; another is through use of a negative particle \"apia\" which follows verbs (in the future only), but precedes the copula. Yes-no questions have no special grammatical marking as such, but all kinds of questions are optionally followed by the sentence particle \"ki\". Other sentence particles express different modal nuances.\n\nVerbs or whole clauses may be conjoined by juxtaposition, all but the last verb in the chain adopting the form of a switch reference participle. These vary in form depending on whether the following verb has the same or a different subject, and also depending on certain tense or aspect relations, and on the person of the subject in the case of different-subject participles.\n\nBesides these widely used constructions, clauses may also be linked by coordinating conjunctions, and subordinate clauses may be marked by a clause-final subordinator.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18761143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18761143", "title": "Monument to Balzac", "text": "Monument to Balzac\n\nMonument to Balzac is a sculpture by Auguste Rodin in memory of the French novelist Honoré Balzac. According to Rodin, the sculpture aims to portray the writer's persona rather than a physical likeness. The work was commissioned in 1891 by the Société des Gens de Lettres, a full-size plaster model was displayed in 1898 at a Salon in Champ de Mars. After coming under criticism the model was rejected by the société and Rodin moved it to his home in Meudon. On July 2, 1939 (22 years after the sculptor's death) the model was cast in bronze for the first time and placed on the Boulevard du Montparnasse at the intersection with Boulevard Raspail.\n\nCasts and various studies of the sculpture are today in many different collections including Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum in Antwerp, The Norton Simon Museum of Art, the Musée Rodin in Meudon, the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Hirschhorn Sculpture Garden (Smithsonian) in Washington D.C, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, in front of the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands, in Caracas, Venezuela in the open spaces around the former Ateneo de Caracas, now UNEARTES and \"Balzac in the Robe of a Dominican Monk\" in Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. Today the artwork is sometimes considered the first truly modern sculpture.\n\nThe Société des Gens de Lettres (Paris, France) considered four different artists for the sculptural work before it was given to Rodin. The first was French neoclassical artist Henri Chapu, however, Chapu died in 1891 before the work could be finalized. Marquet de Vasselot was the next artist considered for the sculpture and provided a bust of the writer for the Societé. At the same time artists Millet and Coutan also applied for the commission.\n\nRodin was not initially considered for the work because at that point in time, around 1885, his career had not become as prominent. After the death of Chapu, the recently elected president of the Societé, Émile Zola strongly supported Rodin for the job and, so, the artist submitted a proposal to have a completed three-meter statue of the French novelist within an eighteen-month period which was approved.\n\nThe commission was in response to the elevated importance of Honoré de Balzac after his death. Balzac was one of the founders of the Societé as well as the second president of the organization. Upon his death in 1850 interest in creating a statue to commemorate the writer quickly developed under the leadership of Alexandre Dumas, père.\n\nInstead of the designated eighteen-month period of time, Rodin employed a lengthy seven years to finish the work. Rodin became infatuated with the literature of his subject as well as researched the character and personality of Balzac, similar to the writer's own approach to character development. In preparation for the sculpture, Rodin read the author's works as well as traveled numerous times to the author's hometown of Touraine France in order to sketch and model clay portrait studies from individuals with similar likeness to the novelist although Rodin never saw him in person. Rodin had clothes resembling those of the Balzac's made by the writer's former tailor, using a cloak similar to Balzac's writing cloak for his final statue. The studies ranged from portrait to muscular and elderly nude figures along with humorous and distorted representations with sexual emphasis. Rodin repeatedly studied the cloak as well as different facial features that he derived from his observational studies and limited references including a daguerreotype of Balzac. Each sketch evolved and transformed into a different representation of the novelist varying from phallic nudes to heavily clothed and hidden figures.\n\nIn 1894, the Societé threatened to step in legally with the commission, turn the job over to artist Alexandre Falguière and take away Rodin's payment. Yet Rodin continued to ask for extensions on time making over fifty studies and continuously distanced himself from a true physical portrayal, tending towards a more psychological representation. The artist became infatuated with capturing the essence of the author's strength. In a message to writer Charles Chincholle in May, 1898, Rodin explained his artistic pursuit:\n\n\"The only thing I realize today is that the neck is too strong. I thought I had to enlarge it because according to me, modern sculpture must exaggerate the forms form the moral point of view. Through the exaggerated neck I wanted to represent strength I realize that the execution exceeded the idea.\"\n\nThe \"Final Study for the Monument to Balzac\" is a smaller version study for the final statue.\n\nFinally in 1898, Rodin presented a plaster study of the Balzac statue in the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. The sculpture was not received well by the critics; Rodin took the negativity as a personal attack. Many disliked the grotesque stature of the figure while others criticized the work to be very similar to that of the Italian impressionist Medardo Rosso. As well, reports surfaced before the unveiling of the sculpture regarding anticipated dismay over the final outcome of the artwork. The Société des Gens de Lettres decided to disregard the commission to Rodin and not accept the sculpture.\n\nRegardless of rejection from his commissionaires, contemporaries such as Paul Cézanne, Toulouse-Lautrec and Claude Monet supported Rodin in his point of view. A backlash against the rejection along with a petition signed by supporters in the artistic community proceeded, yet in the end, Rodin decidedly declined any bids for the work and placed the plaster artwork in his home at Meudon.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on \"Fox News Sunday\", \"They went, in that one instance, I think, overboard. But the point they were trying to make was still valid.\" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on \"Meet The Press\", \"I don't condone anything like that, and I have voted against those who would impugn the patriotism and the service of the people who wear the uniform of our country\".\n\nSeveral other Democratic Senators and Representatives distanced themselves from the ad. Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said \"I would have preferred that they not do such an ad.\" \"The New York Times\" has stated that \"Democrats acknowledge that the MoveOn advertisement was a distraction and illustrated the difficulties of working with liberal advocacy groups\".\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton criticized what he called the \"disingenuous\" \"feigned outrage\" of the Republicans on CNN's The Situation Room. Minnesota Senatorial candidate Al Franken argued in a \"Star Tribune\" editorial \"It is, of course, ridiculous that the United States Senate spent a day debating and voting on a resolution condemning an advertisement while our troops remained in Iraq, fighting a war with no end.\"\n\nLinguist George Lakoff argued that the \"ad has raised vital questions that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed the trust of the troops and the American people.\" Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that \"Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the jugular? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot.\" Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that \"I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to come with us farther.\"\n\nCouncil of Foreign Relations fellow Peter Beinart argued that \"It is terribly unfortunate that MoveOn.org is essentially calling Petraeus a Republican hack, but it’s the logical result of the position the Bush administration has put him in.\" Fellow Max Boot accused Moveon.org of \"desperate attempts to besmirch one of the most admired soldiers in the entire American armed forces\" and argued that the ad will \"backfire\".\n\nPete Hegseth, an Iraq War veteran and executive director of Vets for Freedom, published an article in the \"Weekly Standard\" calling the ad \"utterly shameful.\" He argued that \"It shows contempt for America's military leadership, as well as for the troops who have confidence in him, as our fellow soldiers in Iraq certainly do.\" \"Time\" magazine blogger Joe Klein posted that \"It is no small thing to accuse a military man of betraying his country. It is also palpably untrue in this case. Whoever cooked up this ad is guilty of a disgraceful act of malicious puerility.\" He also posted that \"This is a distraction from the main event.\"\n\nMoveOn.org stood by their ad, stating that the General \"offered a twisted version of the truth designed to support prolonging the war\" and that \"the public needs to know that Petraeus is neither objective nor trustworthy when it comes to assessing progress in Iraq\". The organization also stated that the ad had been targeted by a \"concerted right-wing smear campaign\". \"The Politico\" has stated that Moveon.org \"welcomes the controversy.\" Eli Pariser has said, \"Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade, even if it’s a respected general\". They have since deleted all reference to the ad from their web site.\n\nOn September 20, the Senate passed an amendment by Republican John Cornyn of Texas designed to \"strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus\". All 49 Republican Senators and 22 Democratic Senators voted in support. Democratic Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Chris Dodd voted against the amendment while Barack Obama and Joseph Biden did not vote. Obama issued a statement calling the resolution, put forward by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, \"a stunt. By not casting a vote, I registered my protest against these empty politics.\" The House passed an amendment to a continuing budget resolution which condemned the ad \"in the strongest terms\" by a 341-79 vote on September 26.\n\nDemocratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California drafted a similar amendment on September 20. The text condemned the Petraeus ad as well as a 2002 ad attacking then-Senator Max Cleland of Georgia during the 2002 midterm elections and the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth ads attacking John Kerry during the 2004 Presidential election. Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said, \"They're all disgraceful ads and we ought to treat them the same way\". The vote was 50-47 in favor, but since 60 votes were required to pass it, the amendment did not carry.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" wrote on September 20 that \"Democrats blamed the group MoveOn.org for giving moderate Republicans a ready excuse for staying with Bush and for giving Bush and his supporters a way to divert attention away from the war\". Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action, stated that \"It is unconscionable and outrageous that instead of doing the people's work and ending this war, Congress chooses meaningless and distracting gestures.\n\nA Rasmussen Reports survey found that 23% of Americans approve of the ad while 58% disapprove. \"The Economist\" stated on September 27 that \"the group had raised $500,000 the day the Senate voted, its biggest one-day fundraising total all year. Over four days, in the midst of the row, it took in $1.6m[illion].\"\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani ran his own full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" on September 14. Giuliani asked for and received a similar reduced fee as Moveon.org, paying $65,000.\nConservative nonprofit lobbying organization Freedom's Watch created two video ads in response to MoveOn.org's ad. On September 24, Freedom's Watch ran a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" attacking former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — calling him a \"terrorist\". The ad asserted that Ahmadinejad \"has supported attacks on our soldiers and our allies\".\n\nMoveOn hosted pages on its website about the ad and their reasons behind it from 2007 to June 23, 2010. On June 23, 2010, MoveOn erased these webpages and any reference to them from its website. The change took place in the aftermath of President Obama's nomination of Petraeus to be the new top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan upon General Stanley McChrystal's retirement. Commentator Jon Bershad of Mediaite stated, \"Since MoveOn is an advocacy group with no claims to unbiased content, there’s nothing unethical about scrubbing the site.\"\n\n"}

Intended for use by libraries and other cultural organizations such as museums and archives, RDA is the successor to \"Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, Second Edition\" (AACR2).\n\nRDA emerged from the International Conference on the Principles & Future Development of AACR held in Toronto in 1997. It is published jointly by the American Library Association, the Canadian Federation of Library Associations, and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) in the United Kingdom. Maintenance of RDA is the responsibility of the RDA Steering Committee (RSC). As of 2015, RSC is undergoing a transition to an international governance structure, expected to be in place in 2019.\n\nRDA instructions and guidelines are available through RDA Toolkit, an online subscription service, and in a print format.\n\nRDA training materials and texts are available online and in print.\n\nRDA is a package of data elements, guidelines, and instructions for creating library and cultural heritage resource metadata that are well-formed according to international models for user-focussed linked data applications. The underlying conceptual models for RDA are the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD), and Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) maintained by IFLA, and will be compliant with the IFLA Library Reference Model that consolidates them.\n\nRDA Vocabularies is a representation of the RDA entities, elements, relationship designators, and controlled terms in RDF (Resource Description Framework). The Vocabularies are intended to support linked data applications using RDA. They are maintained in the Open Metadata Registry, a metadata registry, and released via GitHub and the RDA Registry.\n\nThe human-readable labels, definitions, and other textual annotations in the Vocabularies are known as RDA Reference. The RDA Reference data are used in the production of RDA Toolkit content.\n\nThe RDA Vocabularies and RDA Reference are available under an open licence.\n\nRDA is in step with the Statement of International Cataloguing Principles published by IFLA in 2009, and updated in 2016.\n\nThe Committee of Principals for RDA, now the RDA Board, announced its commitment to internationalization of RDA in 2015. This is reflected in the new governance structure with representation based on the United Nations Regional Groups, comprising, Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, and Oceania.\n\nAs of May 2017, the RDA Toolkit has been translated from English into Catalan, Chinese, Finnish, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. RDA Reference is currently being translated into these languages as well as others including Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Greek, Hebrew, Swedish, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn March 2012 the Library of Congress announced that it would fully implement RDA cataloging by the end of March 2013. Library and Archives Canada fully implemented the standard in September 2013. British Library, National Library of Australia, and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek and other national libraries have since implemented RDA.\n\nIn the United States, the cataloguing community expressed reservations about the new standard in regard to both the business case for RDA in a depressed economy and the value of the standard's stated goals. Michael Gorman, one of the authors of AACR2, was particularly vocal in expression of his opposition to the new guidelines, claiming that RDA was poorly written and organized, and that the plan for RDA unnecessarily abandoned established cataloging practices. Others felt that RDA was too rooted in past practices and therefore was not a vision for the future. In response to these concerns, the three United States national libraries (Library of Congress, National Library of Medicine, and the National Agricultural Library) organized a nationwide test of the new standard.\n\nOn 13 June 2011, the Library of Congress, the National Agricultural Library, and the National Library of Medicine released the results of their testing. The test found that RDA to some degree met most of the goals that the JSC put forth for the new code and failed to meet a few of those goals. The Coordinating Committee admitted that they \"wrestled with articulating a business case for implementing RDA\", nevertheless the report recommended that RDA be adopted by the three national libraries, contingent on several improvements being made. The earliest possible date for implementation was given as January 2013, as the consensus emerging from the analysis of the test data showed that while there were discernible benefits to implementing RDA, these benefits would not be realized without further changes to current cataloging practices, including developing a successor to the MARC format.\n\nSeveral other institutions were involved in the RDA test. Many of these institutions documented their findings in a special issue of \"Cataloging & Classification Quarterly\".\n\n\n"}

It gives a medical classification into minor, moderate, major, and extreme.

Patients with higher SOI (e.g. major or extreme) are more likely to consume greater healthcare resources and stay longer in hospitals than patients with lower SOI in the same DRG.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, also known as CMS, considered the 3M APR-DRG and SOI system as a potential evolution to the DRG system in 2006, but received such negative feedback from the industry that in March 2007 decided to adopt another internally developed system evolved from the [Diagnosis-related group] DRG . SOI is still commonly used throughout the United States to adjust for patient complexity, so that physicians and other groups can compare resource utilization, complication rates, and length of stay.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7254135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7254135", "title": "The Brus", "text": "The Brus\n\nThe Brus, also known as The Bruce, is a long narrative poem, in Early Scots, of just under 14,000 octosyllabic lines composed by John Barbour which gives a historic and chivalric account of the actions of Robert the Bruce and the Black Douglas in the Scottish Wars of Independence during a period from the circumstances leading up the English invasion of 1296 through to Scotland's restored position in the years between the Truce of 1328 and the death of Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray in 1332.\n\nThe poem's centre-piece (literally) is an extensive account of the Battle of Bannockburn of 1314. Barbour's poetic account of these events is a keystone in Scotland's national story. The description of the battle is Barbour’s masterpiece.\n\nThe poem was written about 1375, \"...to throw behind the new king, Robert II (who gave Barbour a pension) the weight of his grandfather's (Bruce's) achievements and reputation.\" Barbour's work is a romance based upon a lost life of Douglas and a chronicle or chronicles which told of King Robert and his times. At the beginning of the poem, he conflates three Bruces into the single person of the hero, probably by design. Archie Duncan notes Barbour's fondness for exaggerated numbers for the size of any army. Here and there the order of events is transposed. Despite this, it has been regarded from his own time as, in all details, a trustworthy source for the history of the period.\n\nThroughout the piece, Bruce overshadows all his associates. In book nine, in recounting Edward Bruce's victories in Galloway, Barbour does not relate the whole story, but sums up his worthiness by remarking that \"he might have rivaled any of his contemporaries \"excepting only his brother\"\". The king is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance; freedom is a \"noble thing\" to be sought and won at all costs; the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require; but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind. The lines do not lack vigour; and there are passages of high merit, notably the oft-quoted section beginning \"A! fredome is a noble thing\".\n\nDespite a number of errors of fact, the account has a greater degree of historical veracity than is usually associated with the verse-chronicle genre (for instance, Blind Harry's Wallace composed in the following century). But it is much more than a rhyming chronicle; it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the praises of freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe. No one has doubted Barbour's authorship of the Brus, but argument has been attempted to show that the text as we have it is an edited copy, perhaps by John Ramsay, a Perth scribe, who wrote out the two extant texts, one preserved in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh, and the other in the library of St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nBarbour's influence on later Scottish writers can be seen in Walter Scott's \"Lord of the Isles\" and \"Castle Dangerous\".\n\nText from \"The Brus\"<br>\nby Barbour (1375 Transcribed by Ramsay in 1489)<br>\n(a) THE POET’S PROEM.\n\nStoryß to rede ar delitabill,<br>\nsuppoß þat þai be nocht bot fabill,<br>\nþan suld storyß þat suthfast wer,<br>\nAnd þai war said on gud maner,<br>\nHawe doubill plesance in heryng.<br>\nþe fyrst plesance is þe carpyng,<br>\nAnd þe toþir þe suthfastnes,<br>\nþat schawys þe thing rycht as it wes;<br>\nAnd suth thyngis þat ar likand<br>\nTyll mannys heryng ar plesand.<br>\nþarfor I wald fayne set my will,<br>\nGiff my wyt mycht suffice þartill,<br>\nTo put in wryt a suthfast story,<br>\nþat it lest ay furth in memory,<br>\nSwa þat na length of tyme it let,<br>\nna ger it haly be forȝet.<br>\nFor auld storys þat men redys,<br>\nRepresentis to þaim þe dedys<br>\nOf stalwart folk þat lywyt ar,<br>\nRycht as þai þan in presence war.<br>\nAnd, certis, þai suld weill hawe pryß<br>\nþat in þar tyme war wycht and wyß,<br>\nAnd led thar lyff in gret trawaill,<br>\nAnd oft in hard stour off bataill<br>\nWan [richt] gret price off chewalry,<br>\nAnd war woydit off cowardy.<br>\nAs wes king Robert off Scotland,<br>\nþat hardy wes off hart and hand;<br>\nAnd gud Schyr Iames off Douglas,<br>\nþat in his tyme sa worthy was,<br>\nþat off hys price & hys bounte<br>\nIn fer landis renoenyt wes he.<br>\nOff þaim I thynk þis buk to ma;<br>\nNow god gyff grace þat I may swa<br>\nTret it, and bryng it till endyng,<br>\nþat I say nocht bot suthfast thing!\n\n\n"}

The effigy is of the French knight, Sir Jacquelin de Ferrière, who was from Montargis, near Sens in northern France. The effigy is dated between 1275-1300 CE. It is long, wide, and deep, and crafted from limestone and encased in a wooden frame. Effigies were often commissioned by the nobles or their families, as a means of remembrance. They would likely be found covering the sarcophagi of the knight, or installed in or near a church that the family were patrons of. Although the inscriptions on this effigy is not clear, most effigies contained similar inscriptions that would include the name and title, dates of birth and death–or approximates, a link between the date of death and a notable holy figure or day, and petitions of prayer that would offer pardons to those that prayed for the depicted soul–largely an attempt to create a tangible link between the nobility and divinity.\n\nThe age and imagery of this effigy, and most others during this period, represent the ideals of nobility during the 13th century as they wanted to be remembered. It was important for knights to be remembered as religious, of certain social status, and conforming to ideas of gender. This is why many are depicted as armed and armored, with heraldry and symbolic imagery included. These images were highly stylized and idealized, and rarely represented what the actual person looked like, instead portraying what a knight was expected to look like. The age of representation was also important. Although Jacquelin de Ferrière died while older, he is depicted, as most nobles during this period, around the age of thirty three. This age not only represented the ideal age of knights, but was also the supposed age of Jesus Christ when he was crucified.\n\nChainmail was the prominent form of armor during the 13th century. A precursor to plate armor, chainmail protected its wearer from opponents while allowing mobility, and was extremely effective against edged weapons and thrust attacks.\n\nThe shield was an important part of a knights armament. While chainmail offered protection against thrusting and edged attacks, it offered little protection against the force blunt strike from a sword or lance. The long, tapered shield offered the knight's body protection from forceful blows while on horseback or on foot. The shield was also a place for knights to signify their loyalty or identity with displays of heraldry. On the shield of Jacquelin de Ferrière, horseshoes can be seen across the top of the shield.\n\nThe sword depicted is unique from other swords of this period. \"Thirteenth-century pommels mostly had the shape either of a disk or a more or less pointed oval... If in an exceptional case, such as the sword on the incised tomb slab of Jaquelin de Ferriere, a trilobate pom- mel can be found, it is clearly only a scalloped variant of the disk-shaped pommel and is invariably associated with a guard of long, straight quillons.\"\n\nWhen a squire became a knight, a formal ceremony would take place to welcome the newly dubbed knight. This would include an all night prayer vigil, the girding–or hanging of his sword, a blow to the cheek from the flat part of the sword by an elder, and the bestowal of his spurs. In iconography, the spurs distinguished the noble knights from other armored soldiers, such as infantrymen.\n\nThe horseshoes on the shield are an example of puns in heraldry. The pun lies within the last name, Ferrière, which is a derivative of farrier, or a smith who shoes horses.\n\nAnimals were often included symbolically on effigies in the Late Middle Ages. In this effigy, two dogs can be seen flanking Jacquelin de Ferrière. The dog mostly symbolized loyalty and faithfulness, letting those who would see the effigy that person accompanied by the dogs was faithful and loyal to his family, religion, and liege lord. \n"}

He is also known for his contributions to paleontology, which brought the fossils of the La Brea Tar Pits to the attention of the scientific community.\n\nOrcutt was born in Dodge County, Minnesota on February 14, 1869. His family moved west and settled in Ventura, California, when he was 12 years old. After graduating from Stanford University with a degree in geology and engineering in 1895, he was employed as a civil and hydraulic engineer and as a United States Deputy Surveyor until 1899. That year he joined the Union Oil Company of California as superintendent of its San Joaquin Valley Division; he would stay with Unocal, eventually becoming a Vice-President and a member of the board, until he retired in 1939. In 1901, when he was made manager of the geological, land, and engineering departments of the company, he moved to Los Angeles. In 1904 Unocal instructed him to create a town to house the growing workforce needed for the booming Santa Maria oil field in Santa Barbara County, California. Over Orcutt's objections the company insisted on naming the new town, Orcutt, California, after him. \n\nBefore Orcutt, oil production in the Western U.S. had made little use of geological science; his work, which included making the first geological maps of the Coalinga, Kern River, Lompoc, and Santa Maria oils fields and the application of geologic science and engineering principles to problems with oil production, changed this. Unocal became the first oil company operating in the state of California to have a department of geology, and his efforts led to the use of geology being a standard part of oil production in the West. In 1923 Orcutt wrote a paper tracing the history of oil production in California, which he presented to the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Orcutt served in the California National Guard from 1895-97, was a Reserve Engineer during WWI, and during WWII served on the local draft board from 1940 until he died in 1942.\n\nOrcutt discovered fossils embedded in the asphalt deposits on the Hancock Ranch shortly after he moved to Los Angeles in 1901. Fossils found in the La Brea Tar Pits had been mentioned in the scientific literature as early as 1875, but it was not until Orcutt collected saber-toothed cat, dire wolf, ground sloth and other fossils from the site that the scientific community recognized the value of the La Brea Tar Pits in understanding the late Pleistocene fauna and flora of North America. Orcutt eventually gave his fossil collection to John Campbell Merriam of the University of California.\n\nBecause of his important role in developing the oil industry in the Western United States, in addition to Orcutt in California, the town of Orcutt in Colorado was also named in his honor. Paleontologists named the prehistoric La Brea Coyote, \"Canis orcutti\", in honor of his discoveries at the La Brea tar pits.\n\nThe 1920s residence, gardens, and orchards on the San Fernando Valley ranch he and his wife Mary used for vacations and their retirement estate was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, and bequeathed to the city of Los Angeles as the Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center. \n"}
