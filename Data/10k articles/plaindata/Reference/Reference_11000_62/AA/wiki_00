The demon has no mouth, lips or ears. It roams at night and terrifies people while they sleep, and possession by Alû results in unconsciousness and coma; in this manner it resembles creatures such as the mara, and incubus, which are invoked to explain sleep paralysis. In Akkadian and Sumerian mythology, it is associated with other demons like Gallu and Lilu.\n\nStephen Herbert Langdon (1864) cites a translation of a cuneiform script by Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson. From v Pl. 50, A, line 42: \nWhom in his bed the wicked Alû covered,\nWhom the wicked ghost by night overwhelmed.\n\nLangdon (364) stated that Alû is androgynous and \"attacks a man's breast\".\n\nThe following passage quoted by Langdon shows the modus operandi of the Utukku:\nThe wicked Utukku who slays man alive on the plain.\n\n\n"}

It is the oldest extant kosha. The author himself mentions 18 prior works, but they have all been lost. There have been more than 40 commentaries on the \"Amarakosha\".\n\nThe word \"Amarakosha\" derives from the Sanskrit words \"amara\" (\"immortal\") and \"kosha\" (\"treasure, casket, pail, collection, dictionary\").\nThe actual name of the book \"Namalinganushasanam\" means \"instruction concerning nouns and gender\".\n\nAmarasimha is said to have been one of the Navaratnas (\"nine gems\") at the court of Chandragupta II, a Gupta king who reigned around AD 400. Some sources indicate that he belonged to the period of Vikramaditya of 7th century.\n\nMirashi examines the question of the date of composition of \"Amarakosha\". He finds the first reliable mention in Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of Amoghavarsha(814-867CE)\n\nThe \"Amarakosha\" consists of verses that can be easily memorized. It is divided into three s or chapters. The first, ' (\"heaven and others\") has words pertaining to gods and heavens. The second, ' (\"earth and others\") deals with words about earth, towns, animals and humans. The third, \"\" (\"common\") has words related to grammar and other miscellaneous words.\n\n\"Svargadhikanda\", the first Kanda of the \"Amarakosha\" begins with the verse 'Svaravyam swarganakathridivatrishalaya..' describing various names of Heaven viz. Sva, Avya, swarga, Naka, Tridiva, Tridasalaya etc. The second verse 'Amara, nirjara, deva,’ describes various words that are equivalent to word God. The fifth and sixth verses give various names of Gautama Buddha. The following verses give the different names of Brahma, Vishnu, Vasudeva, Balarama, etc. All these names are treated with great reverence which makes it difficult to ascertain Amara Sinha's theological bent.\n\nThe second Kanda, \"Bhuvargadhikanda\", of the \"Amarakosha\" is divided into ten Vargas or parts. The ten Vargas are \"Bhuvarga\" (Earth), \"Puravarga\" (Towns or Cities), \"Shailavarga\" (Mountains), \"Vanoshadivarga\" (Forests and medicines), \"Simhadivarga\" (Lions and other animals), \"Manushyavarga\" (Mankind), \"Bramhavarga\" (Brahmin), \"Kshatriyavarga\" (Kshatriyas), \"Vysyavarga\" (Vysyas) and \"Sudravarga\" (Sudras).\n\nThe Third Kanda, \"Samanyadhikanda\" contains Adjectives, Verbs, words related to prayer and business etc. The first verse \"Kshemankaroristatathi Shivathathi Shivamkara\" gives the Nanarthas of the word Shubakara or propitious as Kshemankara, Aristathathi, Shivathathi and Shivamkara.\n\n\n\"Gunaratha\" of Ujjain translated it to Chinese in the 7th century.\n\nThe Pali thesaurus \"Abhidhānappadīpikā\", composed in the twelfth century by the grammarian Moggallāna Thera, is based on the \"Amarakosha\".\n\n"}

The AHC campus is 33-acres and features historic gardens and houses located on the grounds, including Swan House, Tullie Smith Farm, and Wood Family Cabin. The AHC's research arm, the Kenan Research Center, includes 3.5 million resources and a reproduction of historian Franklin Garrett's (1906–2000) office. The AHC holds one of the largest collections of Civil War artifacts in the United States.\n\nThe Atlanta History Center operates three types of exhibitions - permanent, temporary, and traveling. The six permanent exhibitions include:\n\n\nThe Kenan Research Center includes 3.5 million resources and a reproduction of historian Franklin Garrett's office.\n\n\nThe Atlanta History Center was founded in 1926 as the Atlanta Historical Society (AHS). Initially, the society operated as an institution for historical discussion and appreciation but, by the next year, began publishing the \"Atlanta Historical Bulletin\". The AHS was first led by Walter McElreath (1867–1951), an Atlanta lawyer, legislator, and author for whom the Center's McElreath Hall is named. The periodical was later named \"\"; it was published until 2006.\n\nIn 1986 the still relatively small group received the DuBose Collection of Civil War artifacts, donated by Mrs. Beverly M. DuBose Jr. In 1989, the Atlanta Historical Society built the current museum to house the DuBose collection.\n\nIn 1990, the Atlanta Historical Society was renamed the Atlanta History Center. The $15,000,000 museum opened in 1993 with five exhibitions, including its first signature Atlanta history exhibition, \"Metropolitan Frontiers\". An $11,000,000 expansion, finished in 1996, added two new permanent exhibitions, \"Shaping Traditions: Folk Arts in a Changing South\" and \"Turning Point: The American Civil War\". The Kenan Research Center library was later expanded and the gardens reorganized, with a fourth permanent exhibition added, \"Down the Fairway with Bobby Jones\". In 2006, the \"Centennial Olympic Museum\" was completed.\n\nIn 2014, the city of Atlanta announced its intentions to relocate the Atlanta Cyclorama and its artifacts to the Atlanta History Center, including the antebellum Western & Atlantic locomotive, the \"Texas\". The museum plans to construct an expansion to house the 360-degree panoramic painting of the Civil War, the \"Battle of Atlanta\", as well as the \"Texas\" locomotive, and other pieces in the Cyclorama collection. The expanded history center is planned to be completed in 2018.\n\nPaved pathways through the historic gardens connect to the Swan House and the Tullie Smith Farm, but most paths are unpaved. Large-print books are available for a few exhibitions in the Atlanta History Museum and videos have subtitles. Maps are available in English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish.\n\n"}

{"id": "8796005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8796005", "title": "Chirograph", "text": "Chirograph\n\nA chirograph is a medieval document, which has been written in duplicate, triplicate or very occasionally quadruplicate (four copies) on a single piece of parchment, with the Latin word \"chirographum\" (occasionally replaced by some other term) written across the middle, and then cut through to separate the parts. The term also refers to a papal decree whose circulation is limited to the Roman curia.\n\nThe Latin word \"chirographum\", often spelled \"cirographum\" or \"cyrographum\" in the medieval period, is derived from the Greek χειρόγραφον, and simply means \"handwritten\".\n\nThe intention of the chirograph was to produce two (or more) identical written copies of a legal agreement, that could be retained by each party to the transaction, and if necessary verified at a later date through comparison with one another. The cut itself would generally be made with a wavy or serrated edge, running through the word \"chirographum\", to allow the copies to be matched physically as a safeguard against forgery. The earliest surviving portion of a chirograph in England dates from the middle of the ninth century.\n\nThe practice of separating the copies with an irregular cut also gave rise to the description of the documents as \"indentures\", since the edges would be said to be \"indented\". In the post-medieval period, as legal documents grew in length and complexity, it became impractical to fit two duplicate texts onto a single sheet of parchment. It therefore became more usual to make the two copies on two or more separate sheets, the top edges of which were still cut with a symbolic or matching wavy line.\n\nA more restricted use of the term is to describe a papal decree whose circulation—unlike an encyclical—is limited to the Roman curia.\n\nPope Francis on June 26, 2013 used a chirograph to set up a Commission to investigate the decisions and underlying investments of the Institute for the Works of Religion (the so-called \"Vatican Bank\"). The document was \"an instrument under canon law giving the commission legal force, and expressing its broad aim to help ensure that 'the principles of the Gospel also permeate activities of an economic and financial nature.'\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1722436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1722436", "title": "Churchill War Rooms", "text": "Churchill War Rooms\n\nThe Churchill War Rooms is a museum in London and one of the five branches of the Imperial War Museum. The museum comprises the \"Cabinet War Rooms\", a historic underground complex that housed a British government command centre throughout the Second World War, and the \"Churchill Museum\", a biographical museum exploring the life of British statesman Winston Churchill.\n\nConstruction of the Cabinet War Rooms, located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, began in 1938. They became fully operational on 27 August 1939, a week before Britain declared war on Germany. The War Rooms remained in operation throughout the Second World War, before being abandoned in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. \n\nAfter the war, the historic value of the Cabinet War Rooms was recognised. Their preservation became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public in April 1984. The museum was reopened in 2005 following a major redevelopment as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, but in 2010 this title was shortened to the Churchill War Rooms.\n\nIn 1936 the Air Ministry, the British government department responsible for the Royal Air Force, believed that in the event of war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered that key government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site for a temporary emergency government centre. The Office concluded the most suitable site was the basement of the New Public Offices (NPO), a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.\n\nAs ultimate authority lay with the civilian government the Cabinet, or a smaller War Cabinet, would require close access to senior military figures. This implied accommodation close to the armed forces' Central War Room. In May 1939 it was decided that the Cabinet would be housed within the Central War Room. In August 1939, with war imminent and protected government facilities in the suburbs not yet ready, the War Rooms became operational on 27 August 1939, only days before the invasion of Poland on 1 September, and Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 3 September.\n\nDuring its operational life two of the Cabinet War Rooms were of particular importance. Once operational, the facility's Map Room was in constant use and manned around the clock by officers of the Royal Navy, British army and Royal Air Force. These officers were responsible for producing a daily intelligence summary for the King, Prime Minister and the military Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe other key room was the Cabinet Room. Until the opening of the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's war cabinet met at the War Rooms only once, in October 1939. Following Winston Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister, Churchill visited the Cabinet Room in May 1940 and declared: 'This is the room from which I will direct the war'. In total 115 Cabinet meetings were held at the Cabinet War Rooms, the last on 28 March 1945, when the German V-weapon bombing campaign came to an end.\n\nOn 22 October 1940, during the Blitz bombing campaign against Britain, it was decided to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed over the course of the war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and rooms for typists or telephone switchboard operators.\n\nTwo other notable rooms include the Transatlantic Telephone Room and Churchill's office-bedroom. From 1943, a SIGSALY code-scrambling encrypted telephone was installed in the basement of Selfridges, Oxford Street connected to a similar terminal in the Pentagon building. This enabled Churchill to speak securely with American President Roosevelt in Washington, with the first conference taking place on 15 July 1943. \n\nLater extensions were installed to both 10 Downing Street and the specially constructed Transatlantic Telephone Room within the Cabinet War Rooms. Churchill's office-bedroom included BBC broadcasting equipment; Churchill made four wartime broadcasts from the Cabinet War Rooms. Although the office room was also fitted out as a bedroom, Churchill rarely slept underground, preferring to sleep at 10 Downing Street or the No.10 Annexe, a flat in the New Public Offices directly above the Cabinet War Rooms. His daughter Mary Soames often slept in the bedroom allocated to Mrs Churchill.\n\nAfter the end of the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became redundant and were abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of public access to the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.\n\nWhile the Rooms were not open to the general public, they could be accessed by appointment, with access being restricted to small groups. Even so, by the 1970s (with responsibility for the Rooms having passed to the Department for the Environment in 1975) tens of thousands of requests to visit the Rooms were being received every year, of which only 5,000 were successful. Meanwhile, the atmospheric conditions of the site, being dry and dusty, were having a detrimental effect on the rooms' furnishings and historic maps and other documents. The prospect was raised of decanting the contents of the Rooms to an established museum, with the National Army Museum and Imperial War Museum being suggested as candidates. In the event, £7,000 was secured to conserve the material in situ.\n\nIn 1974 the Imperial War Museum was approached by the government and asked to consider taking over the administration of the site. A feasibility study was prepared but came to nothing, the museum feeling it did not have sufficient resources to commit to the War Rooms. In 1981 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, known as an admirer of Winston Churchill, expressed the hope that the Rooms could be opened before the next general election. The Imperial War Museum was again approached. Initially still reluctant, the museum's trustees decided in January 1982 that the museum would take over the site, on the understanding that the government would make the necessary resources available. The initial costs were to be met by the Department for the Environment and the War Rooms intended to be self-supporting thereafter. \n\nThe Rooms were opened to the public by Mrs Thatcher on 4 April 1984 in a ceremony attended by Churchill family members and former Cabinet War Rooms staff. At first the Rooms were administered by the museum on behalf of Department for the Environment; in 1989 responsibility was transferred to the Imperial War Museum.\n\nFollowing a major expansion in 2003, a suite of rooms used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, was added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which after the war had been stripped of furnishings and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life, the development of which cost a further £6 million raised from private funds. The museum makes extensive use of audiovisual technology. The centrepiece is a 15-metre interactive table that enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The Churchill Museum won the 2006 Council of Europe Museum Prize. During 2009-2011 the museum received over 300,000 visitors a year. In May 2010 the name of the museum was shortened to Churchill War Rooms.\n\nIn June 2012 the museum's entrance was redesigned by Clash Architects with consulting engineers Price & Myers. Intended to act as a 'beacon' for the museum, the new external design included a faceted bronze entranceway, and the interior showed the cleaned and restored Portland stone walls of the Treasury building and Clive Steps. The design was described as 'appropriately martial and bulldog-like' and as 'a fusion of architecture and sculpture'.\n"}

In former British Colonies and certain British extraterritorial courts the title is (or was) used by the senior government advocate. In modern-day Britain the title is used for entry level prosecution counsel employed by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the role of a Crown Advocate is to analyse, review, prepare and present a wide range of cases in the Crown Court and the Court of Appeal, including as a junior advocate in the more serious and complex cases. Crown Advocates will be expected to have an up-to-date knowledge of all criminal offences and will maintain a high volume of casework, which will include the review of more serious and complex cases.\nThere are also Senior and Principal Crown Advocates.\n\nThe position of Crown Advocate was created in the British Supreme Court for China and Japan in 1878. The first holder of the position was Nicholas John Hannen. The position was similar to the position of an Attorney General in a colony. The Crown Advocate was not a full-time employee of the Foreign Office but received payment for acting as Crown Advocate. The Crown Advocate was allowed to accept cases from private clients that did not conflict with his role as Crown Advocate.\n\nThe position of Crown Advocate was created in 1839 to replace the office of Attorney General. The position was abolished in 1922 and taken over by the Treasury Counsel. In 1936, the role of Treasury Counsel was taken over by the newly re-created office of Attorney General.\n\nThe Crown Advocate is appointed under the provisions of the Crown Advocate Act, 1979 (Act No.59).\n\nThe Crown Advocate advises the Attorney General, particularly on questions arising under the criminal law, and appears for the NSW Government in criminal proceedings of special significance Under the Act the Crown Advocate assists the Solicitor General in respect of the exercise or discharge by the Solicitor General of any powers, authorities, duties or functions delegated by the Attorney General under section 4 of the Solicitor General Act, 1969.\n\nThe Crown Advocate is responsible for the conduct of the State’s major civil and commercial litigation, and will act as senior trial counsel in more complex matters.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1986 the senior government prosecutor in Tasmania was known as the Crown Advocate. The title was changed to Director of Public Prosecutions in 1986.\n"}
{"id": "33679195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33679195", "title": "Diana (Saint-Gaudens)", "text": "Diana (Saint-Gaudens)\n\nDiana – also known as Diana of the Tower – is an iconic statue by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Once a famous New York City landmark, the second version stood atop the tower of Madison Square Garden from 1893 to 1925. Since 1932, it has been in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe statue represents the goddess Diana.\n\n\"Diana\" was commissioned by architect Stanford White as a weather vane for the tower of Madison Square Garden, a theater-and-dining complex at 26th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. He talked his friend Saint-Gaudens into creating it at no charge, and picked up the cost of materials. Model Julia \"Dudie\" Baird posed for the body of the statue. Its face is that of Davida Johnson Clark, Saint-Gaudens's long-time model and mother of his illegitimate son Louis.\n\nThe first version – built by the W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company in Salem, Ohio – was tall and weighed . Saint-Gaudens's design specified that the figure appear to delicately balance on its left toe atop a ball. However, the Ohio metal shop was unable to pass the rotating rod through the toe, so the design was altered and the figure instead was poised (less-gracefully) on its heel.\n\n\"Diana\" was unveiled atop Madison Square Garden's tower on September 29, 1891. The 304-foot (92.66 m) building had been completed a year earlier, and was the second-tallest in New York City. But the addition of the statue made it the city's tallest, by 13 feet (3.96 m). The figure's billowing copper foulard (scarf) was intended to catch the wind, but the statue did not rotate smoothly because of its weight. \"Diana\"s nudity offended moral crusader Anthony Comstock and his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. To placate Comstock and to increase the likelihood of its catching the wind, Saint-Gaudens draped the figure in cloth, but the cloth blew away.\nSoon after installation, both White and Saint-Gaudens concluded that the figure was too large for the building, and decided to create a smaller, lighter replacement. Following less than a year atop the tower, the statue was removed and shipped to Chicago to be exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. New Yorker W. T. Henderson wrote a tongue-in-cheek poetic tribute – \"Diana Off the Tower\" – a play on both the statue's name and situation.\n\nSaint-Gaudens served as head of the Chicago exposition's sculpture committee. His initial plan had been to place \"Diana\" atop the Women's Pavilion, but the city's Women's Christian Temperance Union protested and insisted that the controversial nude figure be clothed. Instead, it was placed atop the Agricultural Building.\n\nThe original \"Diana\" does not survive. In June 1894, eight months after the exposition's closing, a major fire tore through its buildings. The lower half of the statue was destroyed; the upper half survived the fire, but was later lost or discarded.\n\n\"Diana\" was completely redesigned by Saint-Gaudens – with a more elegant pose, a different thrust to the body, a thinner figure, smaller breasts and a more graceful angle to the leg. To better fit the proportions of Madison Square Garden's tower, the statue's height was scaled down to 14.5 feet (4.4 m). The second version was made of hollowed copper, and weighed 700 lb (318 kg) – more than 60% less than the first version – light enough to rotate with the wind. As Saint-Gaudens originally envisioned, the figure was balanced on its left toe atop a ball. The statue was hoisted to the top of the tower on November 18, 1893.\n\nDuring the day, the gilded figure caught the sun and could be seen from all over the city and as far away as New Jersey. Electric lights, then a novelty, illuminated it at night; it was the first statue in history to be lit by electricity.\n\nMadison Square Garden was slated to be demolished in 1925, to make way for construction of the New York Life Building. Prior to the building's demolition, \"Diana\" was removed and put in storage. The intention was for the statue to remain in New York City, however a seven year search to find a place to display it proved futile. In 1932, the New York Life Insurance Company presented \"Diana\" to the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a gift. It remains there today, displayed on the balcony of the museum's Great Stair Hall.\n\nWhen \"Diana\" was removed from Madison Square Garden in 1925, much of its gilded exterior was gone, having eroded away over three decades of exposure to the elements. The Philadelphia Museum of Art cleaned and repaired the statue in 1932, but the gold leaf was not replaced.\n\nIn 2013, scaffolding was constructed around the statue in the museum's Great Stair Hall for a year-long restoration. Conservators carefully cleaned its copper surface with chemicals and steam, removing nearly a century of dirt and grime. Samples of the small patches of remaining gold leaf on the statue were taken in an effort to match the carat, weight and color with its replacement. The statue's surface was then repaired and regilded with 180 square feet of gold leaf. Because it was known from contemporary sources that Saint-Gaudens did not like the look of bright gold at eye level, the conservators matted the gilding to reduce the glare and museum lighting designers adjusted the display lights for the interior display.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, the restored statue was unveiled and rededicated.\n\nIn the popular 1975 novel \"Ragtime\", author E.L. Doctorow suggests in a single line that showgirl Evelyn Nesbitt had posed for the second version of the \"Diana\" statue. Having grown up poor in the streets of a Pennsylvania coal town, Nesbitt had risen up to become “the Gaudens statue Stanny White had put at the top of the tower of Madison Square Garden, a glorious bronze nude Diana, her bow drawn, her face in the skies.”\n\nThe 1981 film version of \"Ragtime\" expanded upon this incident as the cause of a major conflict between Stanford White and Nesbitt's millionaire husband Harry K. Thaw. In the film, Thaw demands that the statue be taken down from the top of the Garden as it is an embarrassment to him. The character is seen glaring angrily at the statue before shooting White to death at the Rooftop Theatre at Madison Square Garden on June 25, 1906.\n\nBoth situations are completely fictional. The second version of \"Diana\" was placed atop the tower in 1893, when Nesbitt was only about nine years old, and eight years before she was introduced to White.\n\nStanford White was so pleased with the 1893 second version that he asked Saint-Gaudens to create a half-sized copy in cement. This was installed in 1894 in the garden of White's Long Island estate, Box Hill, where it stood for many years. For the half-sized copy, Saint-Gaudens poised the figure on a half-ball. White's cement statue later was used to produce two bronze casts in 1928, and six bronze casts in 1987. The cement statue is now in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. \n\nThe Smithsonian American Art Museum owns a bronze statuette of Saint-Gaudens's first version of \"Diana\".\n\nCapitalizing on the popularity of the second version, Saint-Gaudens modeled statuettes in two sizes: 31 inches (78 cm), with the figure poised on a half-ball, and 21 inches (53 cm), with the figure poised on a full ball. These were cast in bronze beginning in 1899, and vary in the configuration of bow, arrow, string, hair, patination, and base.\n\nIn 1908, the sculptor's widow authorized a posthumous casting of nine busts based on Saint-Gaudens's 31-inch (78 cm) statuette. A 7-3/8 in (18.7 cm) plaster bust is at Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site. Bronze busts are at the Carnegie Museum of Art, and in private collections.\n\nBronze casts of \"Diana\" 's head are at Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site; Harvard University; and elsewhere.\n\n"}
{"id": "18025626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18025626", "title": "Document automation", "text": "Document automation\n\nDocument automation (also known as document assembly) is the design of systems and workflows that assist in the creation of electronic documents. These include logic-based systems that use segments of pre-existing text and/or data to assemble a new document. This process is increasingly used within certain industries to assemble legal documents, contracts and letters. Document automation systems can also be used to automate all conditional text, variable text, and data contained within a set of documents.\n\nAutomation systems allow companies to minimize data entry, reduce the time spent proof-reading, and reduce the risks associated with human error. Additional benefits include: time and financial savings due to decreased paper handling, document loading, storage, distribution, postage/shipping, faxes, telephone, labor and waste.\n\nThe basic functions are to replace the cumbersome manual filling in of repetitive documents with template-based systems where the user answers software-driven interview questions or data entry screen. The information collected then populates the document to form a good first draft'. Today's more advanced document automation systems allow users to create their own data and rules (logic) without the need for programming.\n\nWhile document automation software is used primarily in the legal, financial services, and risk management industries, it can be used in any industry that creates transaction-based documents. A good example of how document automation software can be used is with commercial mortgage documents. A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including:\nSome of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Established companies in this field includes the likes of Contract Express from Thomson Reuters\n\nSimpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.\n\nThere are many documents used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, bill of lading (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially with the increase of e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and mail order shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: ERP, WMS, TMS, legacy middleware and most accounting packages.\n\nA number of research projects have looked into wider standardization and automation of documents in the freight industry.\n\nThe role of automation technology in the production of legal documents has been widely recognised. For example, Richard Susskind’s book ‘The End of Lawyers’ looks at the use of document automation software that enables clients to generate employment contracts and Wills with the use of an online interview or decision tree. Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 'disruptive technologies' that are altering the face of the legal profession. In large law firms document assembly systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements.\n\nWith the liberalisation of the UK legal services market spearheaded by the Legal Services Act 2007 large institutions have broadened their services to include legal assistance for their customers. Most of these companies use some element of document automation technology to provide legal document services over the Web. This has been seen as heralding a trend towards commoditisation whereby technologies like document automation result in high volume, low margin legal services being ‘packaged’ and provided to a mass-market audience.\n\nIn United States, companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer automated document production for individuals and small businesses..\n\nCompanies like Contract Express by Thomson Reuters, HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext) and HelpSelf Legal also provide document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents. These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.\n\nInsurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured. Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents:\n\nA lot of work can go into putting one packet together. In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.\n\n"}
{"id": "5648807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5648807", "title": "Execration texts", "text": "Execration texts\n\nExecration texts, also referred to as Proscription Lists, are ancient Egyptian hieratic texts, listing enemies of the Pharaoh, most often enemies of the Egyptian state or troublesome foreign neighbors. The texts were most often written upon statuettes of bound foreigners, bowls, or blocks of clay or stone, which were subsequently destroyed. The ceremonial process of breaking the names and burying them was intended to be a sort of sympathetic magic that would affect the persons or entities named in the texts. The fragments were usually placed near tombs or ritual sites. This practice was most common during times of conflict with the Asiatic neighbours of Egypt.\n\nExecration texts are attested from the late Old Kingdom (ca. 2686–2160 BCE) up into the New Kingdom (ca. 1550–1069).\n\nThe earliest execration texts date to the 6th dynasty (24th–22nd century BCE) during Egypt's Old Kingdom. They are statuettes made from unbaked clay and fashioned into the shape of bound foreigners with name labels inscribed on their chests, sometimes in red ink. Over 400 of these statuettes were excavated from the cemetery at Giza, while a few others have been unearthed at the settlements of Elephantine and Balat.\n\nIn the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2055–1650), Egyptians continued to use statuettes as execration texts. For example, a group of both large and small figurines dating to the end of the 12th dynasty was excavated at the necropolis of Saqqara. Middle Kingdom Egyptians also began to use pottery vessels for execration texts, which is evidenced by an excavation of over 175 vessels outside the Egyptian fortress at Mirgissa in Lower Nubia. These vessels, dating to the middle of the 12th dynasty, were inscribed with lengthy execration texts and appear to have been deliberately broken, likely as part of the execration ritual.\n\nOnly a few examples of execration texts dating to the Second Intermediate Period (ca. 1700–1550) and New Kingdom (ca. 1550–1069) have been found.\n\nThere have been over 1,000 execration deposits found, with sites at Semna, Uronarti, Mirgissa, Elephantine, Thebes, Balat, Abydos, Helwan, Saqqara, and Giza. Because the execration jars, figurines, vases, and statues were almost destroyed during the rituals, archaeologists have to put all the pieces they find from execration pits back together to learn about the rituals. Four deposits have been uncovered at Giza, which contained figurines packed into pottery jars.\n\nAt the Middle Kingdom fortress of Mirgissa, execration remains included 200 broken inscribed red vases, over 400 broken uninscribed red vases, nearly 350 mud figurines, four limestone figures, small traces of beeswax dyed red-probably the remnants of melted figurines, and one human-whose head was ritually severed. Other evidence of human sacrifice and execration victims, as well as animal sacrifice was found at Avaris, probably from the Eighteenth Dynasty. Two execration pits were found: one containing skulls and fingers while the other had two full male skeletons.\n\nGeorges Posener published his findings from Saqqara in 1940, which later became known as the Brussels texts. Figurines there name over 60 enemy cities, people, and tribes.\n\nThe execration ritual was the process by which one could thwart or eradicate one's enemies. Usually the ritual object(s) would be bound (usually a small figurine, but sometimes human sacrifice was practiced), then the object was smashed, stomped on, stabbed, cut, speared, spat on, locked in a box, burned, saturated in urine, and finally buried. But not every execration included all of the previous components. A full rite could use any of these actions numerous times with numerous figures. One recorded rite gave instructions to \"spit on him four times...trample on him with the left foot...smite him with a spear...slaughter him with a knife...place him on the fire...spit on him in the fire many times\"\n\nThe presence of foreign names of cities and tribes has long been a source for researchers to learn more about the dates and influence of these sites. The first two groups of Execration Texts published, the Berlin and Brussels texts, contain numerous mentions of Canaanite and Phoenician cities. The Berlin and Brussels texts date approximately from the end of the 20th century BCE to midway through the 18th century BCE. From an archaeological standpoint, these execration texts range from MB I to MB IIB. Archaeological remains from this period have not been found in all of the sites mentioned on Egyptian Execration texts.\n\nPlaces mentioned in Execration Texts for which there is substantial archaeological remains from MB IIA:\n\n\nPlaces mentioned in execration texts with little or no archaeological remains from MB IIA:\n\nThe site Beit She'an may also have been mentioned in these sets of execration texts, but this site has not been identified with certainty. Byblos was mentioned as the name of a tribe in Execration Texts, but not as a site.\n\nMost scholars claim that the Šu-tu mentioned in Execration Texts and other Egyptian texts may refer to the land and people of Moab due to the text in Numbers 24:17 which refers to the \"sons of Sheth\" as the Moabites. However, it is also possible that the term Šu-tu may refer to all people living in eastern Palestine, an area ranging from Wadi al-Hassa to Nahr ez-Zerqa, instead of exclusively referring to Moab.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush in Nubia is also mentioned in execration texts.\n\nThe Execration texts are an important resource for researchers in the field of ancient Near Eastern history of the 20th–18th centuries BCE and Bible studies. The first group of Execration Texts were published by Kurt Sethe in 1926, known as the Berlin texts. Georges Posener published a second group of texts in 1957, known as the Brussels texts.\n\nThe first collection are inscribed on pottery sherds, and contain the names of approximately 20 places in Canaan and Phoenicia, and over 30 rulers of the period. These texts contain what is possibly the first known mention of Jerusalem, from the beginning of the second millennium BCE, the end of the Eleventh dynasty to the Twelfth dynasty.\n\nThe second group of texts are inscribed on figurines of bound prisoners discovered in Saqqara. This group contains the names of 64 places, usually listing one or two rulers. Seven known Asian countries are listed. This group has been dated to the end of the Twelfth dynasty.\n\nAn additional group of texts, the Mirgissa texts, was published by Yvan Koenig in 1990.\n\nThe interpretation of historians as to the meaning of execration texts has been well established thanks to documents that detail the ritual creation of the texts and the manner in which they were to be destroyed in order to invoke a form of magic to protect Egypt and the Pharaoh, in earlier cases, but especially in the Ptolemaic period they began to be utilized by more and more Egyptians for their own personal use.\n\nBecause many of the early execration texts are found on pottery, some historians believe that the ritual smashing of execration figures originated from the smashing of clay vessels used in funerary preparations so as to prevent their use for other purposes and to relinquish any magical power that may have resided in the vessel after having been used for funerary washings.\n\nExecration texts deal with kings and cities who the Egyptians felt threatened by; some of whom lived in the Canaanite and Syrian lands. Execration texts including the Berlin, Brussels, and Migrissa groups contain curses targeting over 100 Syro-Palestinian kings and villages.\n\nNubian kings such as Segersenti were mentioned in execration texts, as well as over 200 other Nubian kings.\n\nBiblical connections to execration texts:\nEgyptian sources are important when wanting to understand the history of Canaan. Their relationship with Egyptian Pharaohs is brought to life by some execration texts Some execration texts refer to the people living on both sides of the Jordan River as “su-tu”. Scholars make a connection with the su-tu and the “sons of Sheth” or “bene-set”, referred to in the book of Numbers 24:17 of the Bible:\n\n\"I shall see him, but not know: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.\"\n\nIt is widely accepted that the “sons of Sheth” are those who dwelt in Moab, or the Moabites, on the borders of the Hebrews’ lands.\n\nDr. A. Bentzen in the 1950s advanced his thesis that the first and second chapters of the book of Amos in the Old Testament “is modelled on cultic patterns, resembling the ritual behind the Egyptian Execration Texts.” Many have taken this theory and interpreted it wrongly by saying there is evidence that Amos’ speech is influenced by Egyptian execration texts. Bentzen is simply stating that the influences for Amos’ speech resemble (are not influenced by) Egyptian execration texts. They are similar, but there is no connection. Other books of the Bible share this same similarity; Daniel 11:41; Isaiah 11:14; Jeremiah 48-49; Zephaniah 2:8-9; Ezekiel 25:1-14 and Nehemiah 13:1-2:23.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20646497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646497", "title": "Fan death", "text": "Fan death\n\nFan death is a well-known superstition in Korean culture, where it is thought that running an electric fan in a closed room with unopened or no windows will prove fatal. Despite no concrete evidence to support the concept, belief in fan death persists to this day in Korea.\n\nWhere the idea came from is unclear, but fears about electric fans date almost to their introduction to Korea, with stories dating to the 1920s and 1930s warning of the risks of nausea, asphyxiation, and facial paralysis from the new technology.\n\nOne conspiracy theory is that the South Korean government created or perpetuated the myth as propaganda to curb the energy consumption of South Korean households during the 1970s energy crisis, but \"Slate\" reports that the myth is much older than that – dating almost as far back as the introduction of electric fans in Korea, and cites a 1927 article about \"Strange Harm from Electric Fans\".\n\nAir movement will increase sweat evaporation, which cools the body. But in extreme heat – when the blown air is warmer than the body's temperature – it will increase the heat stress placed on the body, potentially speeding the onset of heat exhaustion and other detrimental conditions. The American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discourages people from using fans in closed rooms without ventilation when the heat index is above . The EPA does, however, approve of using a fan if a window is open and it is cooler outside, or when the heat index in a closed room is lower.\n\nHypothermia is abnormally low body temperature caused by inadequate thermoregulation. As the metabolism slows down at night, one becomes more sensitive to temperature, and thus supposedly more prone to hypothermia. People who believe this theory think a fan operating in a closed room all night can lower temperature to the point of causing hypothermia.\n\nIt is alleged that fans may cause asphyxiation by oxygen displacement and carbon dioxide intoxication. In the process of human respiration, inhaled fresh air is exhaled with a lower concentration of oxygen gas (O) and higher concentration of carbon dioxide gas (CO), causing a gradual reduction of O and buildup of CO in a completely unventilated room.\n\nThis belief bears a similarity to a once-popular misconception which claimed that a person in a closed room with plants would asphyxiate if the room was not kept ventilated, as the plant's respiratory processes would supposedly consume all the oxygen in the room.\n\nDuring the summer, mainstream South Korean news sources regularly report alleged cases of fan death. A typical example is this excerpt from the July 4, 2011, edition of \"The Korea Herald\", an English-language newspaper:\n\nThis article also noted there was \"no evidence\" the fan caused the death, however. University of Miami researcher Larry Kalkstein says a misunderstanding in translation resulted in his accidental endorsement of the fan death theory, which he denies is a real phenomenon.\n\nKen Jennings, writing for \"Slate\", says that based on \"a recent email survey of contacts in Korea\", opinion seems to be shifting among younger Koreans: \"A decade of Internet skepticism seems to have accomplished what the preceding 75 years could not: convinced a nation that Korean fan death is probably hot air.\"\n\nThe Korea Consumer Protection Board (KCPB), a South Korean government-funded public agency, issued a consumer safety alert in 2006 warning that \"asphyxiation from electric fans and air conditioners\" was among South Korea's five most common summer accidents or injuries, according to data they collected. The KCPB published the following:\n\nIf bodies are exposed to electric fans or air conditioners for too long, it causes [the] bodies to lose water and [causes] hypothermia. If directly in contact with [air current from] a fan, this could lead to death from [an] increase of carbon dioxide saturation concentration and decrease of oxygen concentration. The risks are higher for the elderly and patients with respiratory problems. From 2003 [to] 2005, a total of 20 cases were reported through the CISS involving asphyxiations caused by leaving electric fans and air conditioners on while sleeping. To prevent asphyxiation, timers should be set, wind direction should be rotated, and doors should be left open.\n\n"}

The term is most commonly used to describe topological spaces on which every continuous mapping has a fixed point. But another use is in order theory, where a partially ordered set \"P\" is said to have the fixed point property if every increasing function on \"P\" has a fixed point.\n\nLet \"A\" be an object in the concrete category C. Then \"A\" has the \"fixed-point property\" if every morphism (i.e., every function) formula_1 has a fixed point.\n\nThe most common usage is when C=Top is the category of topological spaces. Then a topological space \"X\" has the fixed-point property if every continuous map formula_2 has a fixed point.\n\nIn the category of sets, the objects with the fixed-point property are precisely the singletons.\n\nThe closed interval [0,1] has the fixed point property: Let \"f\":[0,1] → [0,1] be a continuous mapping. If \"f\"(0) = 0 or \"f\"(1) = 1, then our mapping has a fixed point at 0 or 1. If not, then \"f\"(0) > 0 and \"f\"(1) − 1 < 0. Thus the function \"g\"(\"x\") = \"f\"(\"x\") − x is a continuous real valued function which is positive at \"x\" = 0 and negative at \"x\" = 1. By the intermediate value theorem, there is some point \"x\" with \"g\"(\"x\") = 0, which is to say that \"f\"(\"x\") − \"x\" = 0, and so \"x\" is a fixed point.\n\nThe open interval does \"not\" have the fixed-point property. The mapping \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" has no fixed point on the interval (0,1).\n\nThe closed interval is a special case of the closed disc, which in any finite dimension has the fixed-point property by the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.\n\nA retract \"A\" of a space \"X\" with the fixed-point property also has the fixed-point property. This is because if formula_3 is a retraction and formula_1 is any continuous function, then the composition formula_5 (where formula_6 is inclusion) has a fixed point. That is, there is formula_7 such that formula_8. Since formula_7 we have that formula_10 and therefore formula_11\n\nA topological space has the fixed-point property if and only if its identity map is universal.\n\nA product of spaces with the fixed-point property in general fails to have the fixed-point property even if one of the spaces is the closed real interval.\n\nThe FPP is a topological invariant, i.e. is preserved by any homeomorphism. The FPP is also preserved by any retraction.\n\nAccording to Brouwer fixed point theorem every compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space has the FPP. Compactness alone does not imply the FPP and convexity is not even a topological property so it makes sense to ask how to topologically characterize the FPP. In 1932 Borsuk asked whether compactness together with contractibility could be a sufficient condition for the FPP to hold. The problem was open for 20 years until the conjecture was disproved by Kinoshita who found an example of a compact contractible space without the FPP.\n\n"}
{"id": "379742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379742", "title": "Frank Gotch", "text": "Frank Gotch\n\nFrank Alvin Gotch (April 27, 1877 – December 16, 1917) was an American professional wrestler.\n\nGotch was the first American professional wrestler to win the world heavyweight free-style championship, and credited for popularizing professional wrestling in the United States. He competed back when the contests were largely legit (see catch wrestling), and his reign as World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion (from 1908 to 1913) is one of the ten longest in the history of professional wrestling. He became one of the most popular athletes in America from the 1900s to the 1910s. \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" described Gotch as \"arguably the best North American professional wrestler of the 20th century\".\n\nThe son of Frederick Rudolph and Amelia Gotch, and of German ancestry, he was born and raised on a small farm three miles south of Humboldt, Iowa. He took up wrestling in his teens, earning a reputation by beating locals. He adopted the toe hold as his signature finishing move.\n\nGotch wrestled and won his first match against Marshall Green in Humboldt on April 2, 1899, but his first important match was in Lu Verne, Iowa on June 16, 1899, against a man claiming to be a furniture dealer from a neighboring town. Gotch held his own for nearly two hours, but lost the hard-fought contest. Only later when he received the impressed man's visiting card, he did learn that his opponent had actually been reigning American Heavyweight Champion Dan McLeod. On December 18, 1899, Gotch challenged another former American Heavyweight Champion, \"Farmer\" Martin Burns, losing in 11 minutes, but impressing Burns as well, who offered to train Gotch. Under the guidance of Burns, Gotch won a series of matches in Iowa and later Yukon. While in the Yukon, Gotch wrestled under the name Frank Kennedy and won the title of \"Champion of the Klondike\". During his time in the Yukon, Gotch tried his hand at boxing, but failed miserably against the heavyweight Frank \"Paddy\" Slavin.\n\nGotch returned to Iowa and instantly challenged the reigning American Heavyweight Champion Tom Jenkins. Gotch lost their first match in 1903, before defeating Jenkins in a rematch on January 27, 1904, to take the championship. After trading the title with Jenkins and Fred Beell, Gotch set his sights on the World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship, then held by the undefeated Estonian George Hackenschmidt. The opponent, called the \"Russian Lion\", had gained undisputed title recognition by defeating Jenkins in New York in 1905. Upon defeating Jenkins, however, Hackenschmidt ignored Gotch's challenge and sailed home to England.\nGotch and Hackenschmidt finally met on April 3, 1908, at the Dexter Park Pavilion in Chicago. Showing his contempt for Gotch and for American wrestling in general, Hackenschmidt was not in the best condition, unlike Gotch, who used his speed, defense and rough tactics to wear Hackenschmidt down and then assume the attack. The wrestlers stood on their feet for two full hours before Gotch was able to get behind Hackenschmidt and take him down. While on their feet, Gotch made sure to lean on Hackenschmidt to wear him down. He bullied him around the ring, and his thumbing and butting left Hackenschmidt covered in blood. Hackenschmidt complained to the referee of Gotch's foul tactics and asked that Gotch be forced to take a hot shower to rid his body of an abundance of oil, but the referee ignored the complaints and told Hackenschmidt he should have noticed the oil before the match began. The match continued until the two-hour mark, when Hackenschmidt was forced against the ropes. Gotch tore him off the ropes, threw Hackenschmidt down and rode him hard for three minutes, working for his dreaded toe hold. Hackenschmidt had trained to avoid this hold, which he did, but the effort took his last remaining strength. Hackenschmidt quit the fall. \"I surrender the championship of the world to Mr. Gotch\", he said, and stood up and shook Gotch's hand. The wrestlers then retired to their dressing rooms before coming out for the second fall, but Hackenschmidt refused to return to the ring, telling the referee to declare Gotch the winner, thereby relinquishing his title to him.\n\n\"He is the king of the class, the greatest man by far I ever met\", Hackenschmidt said. \"After going nearly two hours with him, my muscles became stale. My feet also gave out. I had trained constantly against the toe hold and had strained the muscles of my legs. When I found myself weakening, I knew there was no use continuing and that I had no chance to win. That was the reason I conceded the championship to him. I have no desire to wrestle him again. A return match would not win back my title\". Hackenschmidt later reversed his opinion of Gotch and Americans in general, claiming to have been fouled by Gotch and victimized in America, and calling for a rematch in Europe.\n\nAs undisputed free-style heavyweight champion of the world, Gotch spent the next three years establishing his dominance over the sport, defeating the likes of Jenkins, Dr. Ben Roller, and Stanislaus Zbyszko, who was believed to have won over 900 matches before falling to Gotch on June 1, 1910. The victory over Zbyszko was particularly spectacular, as Gotch took both falls in slightly less than half an hour, and thoroughly dominated Zbyszko. He took the first fall in just six seconds with a surprise move and quick pin, and won the second fall in only 27 minutes. Gotch outmaneuvered and outclassed Zbyszko every second of the match.\n\nGotch became a national sensation, and he was in demand everywhere for public appearances. He starred in a play called \"All About A Bout\", and whenever he walked on stage he was greeted by a standing ovation. He was invited to the White House by United States President Theodore Roosevelt, and wrestled a Japanese ju-jitsu expert in the East Hall, making his opponent submit. The night before his second match with Hackenschmidt, he attended a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field with his wife and in-laws and took his seat down front. After the game, nearly every member of the Cubs team came to his private box and asked for his autograph. When he traveled overseas with his play, Gotch was a huge hit, as it seemed that everywhere he went, fans wanted to see him. Everywhere he went, he made wrestling \"big time\".\n\nGotch met Hackenschmidt again on September 4, 1911, at the newly opened Comiskey Park in Chicago, which drew a crowd of nearly 30,000 spectators and a record gate of $87,000. The rematch is one of the most controversial and talked about matches in professional wrestling history, as Hackenschmidt injured his knee against Roller, his chief training partner. Years later, wrestler Ad Santel told Lou Thesz that he was paid $5,000 by Gotch's backers to cripple Hackenschmidt in training, and make it look like an accident. However, according to Hackenschmidt himself, the injury was accidentally inflicted by his sparring partner, Dr. Roller, when trying to hold Hackenschmidt down onto his knees and Roller's right foot striking Hackenschmidt's right knee. According to Hackenschmidt, his sparring partners were Americus (Gus Schoenlein), Jacobus Koch, Wladek Zbyszko and Dr. Roller. Ad Santel is not mentioned in any account of Hackehschmidt's training by either Hackenschmidt or Roller, both of whom offered their insights and accounts. Whatever the case may be, if the injury was real, Dr. Roller did not consider it serious and referee Ed Smith dismissed it as inconsequential. Hackenschmidt himself ignored it completely in declaring, the day before the match, that he was \"fit to wrestle for my life\" and was \"satisfied with my condition and confident of the outcome\". If there was a knee injury, Gotch discovered it quickly and took advantage of it, so Hackenschmidt was easy prey for Gotch, losing in straight falls in only 30 minutes. Gotch clinched the match with his feared toe hold, which forced Hackenschmidt to quit.\n\nGotch reigned as the World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion from his first victory over Hackenschmidt in 1908 until he retired in 1913 after defeating Estonian Georg Lurich April 1, 1913, in Kansas City, Missouri. Gotch is one of the longer reigning world champions in the history of professional wrestling, with a reign that spanned nearly five years; the only other champions to have longer reigns than Gotch are Bruno Sammartino, who held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship for a record of seven years and eight months, Lou Thesz, whose fifth NWA World Heavyweight Championship lasted seven years and seven months, and Verne Gagne who held the AWA World Heavyweight Title for seven years and three months.\n\nGotch competed in an era when a championship wrestling match was the same as a championship prize fight: i.e., it was a major event for which the wrestlers went into training and which promoters publicized for weeks. Thus, he did not have a long career in terms of the number of matches wrestled. His mentor Farmer Burns, and later champions Ed Lewis, the \"Strangler\", as well as Lou Thesz, each engaged in more than 6,000 matches in their careers. Gotch engaged in only 160, finishing with a record of 154 wins and only 6 losses. Of those six losses, however, two were in the first year of his career – to Dan McLeod and Farmer Burns – and three were to Tom Jenkins. His last defeat was to Fred Beell on December 1, 1906, when he had crashed head-first into an uncovered turnbuckle and been rendered nearly unconscious. He defeated Beell in seven rematches and never lost again by the time of his retirement in 1913.\n\nGotch was, by all accounts, a superior professional wrestler possessing tremendous strength, lightning quickness, genuine agility, cat-like reflexes, impeccable technique, superb ring generalship, a mastery of the use of leverage, and a full knowledge of professional wrestling holds, counterholds and strategy. He was always in the best of condition and possessed both enormous courage and an indomitable will to win, ever ready to match his heart, his gameness, against any man in the world. He was highly aggressive, but always kept his cool. Critics saw in him both the strength of the old school of professional wrestling and the skill of the new, \"as agile as a cat in his manoeuvers\" and having \"the grappling sport down to such science that he had assumed a rank all by himself\". Gotch's measurements for his 1911 victory over Hackenschmidt were: age – 33; weight – 204 pounds; height – 5'11\"; reach – 73\"; biceps – 17.5\"; forearm – 14\"; neck – 18\"; chest – 45\"; waist – 34\"; thigh – 22\"; calf – 18\".\n\nThere is another side to this story that, when Lou Thesz was just starting out in the early 1930s, there were a good many professional wrestlers still active who had known Gotch and were not reluctant to talk about him. \"The picture that emerged of Gotch from those conversations\", Thesz recalled, \"was of a man who succeeded at his business primarily because he was, for lack of a kinder description, a dirty wrestler. That's not to say that he wasn't competent, because everyone I ever talked with said he was one of the best. But those same people described him as someone who delighted in hurting or torturing lesser opponents, even when they were supposed to be working out, and he was always looking for an illegal edge when he was matched against worthy ones. One of the old-timers I met was a fine man named Charlie Cutler, who knew Gotch very well and succeeded him as world champion; according to Cutler, Gotch would gouge, pull hair and even break a bone to get an advantage in a contest, and he was unusually careful to have the referee in his pocket, too, in case all else failed\". Referee Ed Smith, who officiated several of Gotch's bouts, including both of the Gotch-Hackenschmidt contests, had observed after the second match that \"to my mind... he wasn't just exactly through one hundred percent on the courageous side. Two or three times I saw needless acts of absolute cruelty on his part that I did not like. Always will I think that the really courageous man, no matter how ferocious and filled with the killing instinct and eager to win he may be, is willing to let up on a beaten foe and not punish needlessly or wantonly\".\n\nFor years one of America's most eligible bachelors, Gotch married Gladys Oestrich on February 11, 1911. They had one son, Robert Frederick Gotch.\n\nWhile in retirement, Gotch joined Sells-Floto Circus where he would pay any man $250.00 if they could last 15 minutes in a match against him without being pinned or conceding. Not once did he have to pay. He grew tired of touring and moved back to Humboldt. After a year of health troubles, Gotch died at home in 1917 of what was rumored to be syphilis, but the official cause of death was uremic poisoning. He left behind his wife Gladys and their son, Robert Friedrich. All are entombed together in the Gotch mausoleum in the Union Cemetery in Humboldt.\n\n\"The story of American Wrestling at its greatest\", Nat Fleischer wrote in 1936, \"is the story of the career of its most illustrious champion—Frank Gotch... Gotch was to wrestling history in this country what John L. Sullivan was to boxing. He dominated the field. Through his extraordinary ability, he gained for wrestling many converts and brought the sport into such favor that it became as big in the promotorial field as boxing\".\n\nAs Mark Palmer pointed out, \"For starters, George Hackenschmidt and Frank Gotch were major sports superstars of the early 20th century. Fans of all ages collected cabinet cards and postcards with their images, read their books, and devoured articles about them in newspapers. Their epic matches were front-page news around the world—akin to today's Super Bowl or soccer's World Cup in terms of garnering global attention—and helped to launch organized amateur wrestling in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. In fact, a large number of high school and college wrestling programs can trace their roots back to the 1910s and 1920s—the era when Hackenschmidt and Gotch were still household names, and highly respected athletes\".\n\nGotch was also a major sports superstar, often called the Hulk Hogan of his day, who lifted professional wrestling to new heights of popularity. When he became world champion, there were not many sports competing with wrestling for public attention. Horse racing remained a favorite sport and major league baseball was growing in popularity, but was not yet the national pastime. Automobile racing was in its infancy; golf was still the province of the wealthy; basketball had just been invented and was vying for attention; boxing offered a man a chance at fame and fortune, but was at this time riddled with scandals; the National Hockey League was formed the same year; and college football—the Ivy League game—was on the verge of being outlawed because it was too rough and too dangerous. Wrestling at the higher professional levels was still a legit sport with the added bonus that it was popular on every continent of the globe. A number of great professional wrestlers were competing for top honors. In India, The Great Gama was already a legendary champion, and in Europe George Hackenschmidt had reigned supreme with Stanislaus Zbyszko coming along. However, in the United States Tom Jenkins had been rather easily beaten by Hackenschmidt, so there was no American to capture the nation's fancy until Gotch; and none of the other great professional wrestlers had either the amazing physical attributes or the gift for self-promotion that Gotch possessed. Furthermore, the United States was beginning to dominate some of the world's major sports. Americans already dominated boxing and within a decade would begin to dominate golf. When Gotch defeated Hackenschmidt, the domination of professional wrestling passed to the Americans. In addition, many matches had still been conducted under Greco-Roman wrestling rules, but this match caused Greco-Roman to be forever replaced by the more exciting catch-as-catch-can style.\n\nBecause of both his superior ability and his gift for self-promotion, Gotch became one of America’s greatest sports idols. He achieved a level of popularity similar to that formerly held by boxer John L. Sullivan and harness racehorse Dan Patch, and enjoyed later by such sports heroes of the Golden Age of Sports as boxing's Jack Dempsey, baseball's Babe Ruth, tennis's Bill Tilden and golf's Bobby Jones. This in turn made professional wrestling mainstream. Mac Davis wrote in \"100 Greatest Sports Heroes\", \"As the idol of millions in the United States, Canada and Mexico, Gotch made [professional] wrestling a big-time sport in his day. He drew larger audiences than did the heavyweight champion of boxing when defending his title\".\n\nGotch's first match against Hackenschmidt also remains perhaps the most famous professional wrestling encounter of all time.\n\nGotch was among the first elected to the Iowa Sports Hall of Fame (1951), and was the first inductee to both the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum (2002) in Amsterdam, New York and the George Tragos & Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (1999) in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nThere is a 67-acre camping park named the Frank A. Gotch State Park, four miles south of Humboldt near his childhood farm, in homage to Gotch.\n\nThe Humboldt Community School District sponsors the annual Frank Gotch Wrestling Tournament. Because of Gotch's legacy, Iowa remains a professional wrestling stronghold at the high school and collegiate levels to this day. Gotch's success and fame is credited with playing a part in the creation of the Iowa High School Wrestling Tournament in 1921.\n\nOn July 4, 2012, an eight-foot tall bronze statue of Gotch was unveiled in Bicknell Park in Humboldt, the site of his outdoor training camp where as many as 1,000 people watched him train before his second Hackenschmidt match. In December 2011, a street running along the park was renamed Frank Gotch Boulevard.\n\nThere is an extensive Gotch collection in the Dan Gable Wrestling Museum in Waterloo, Iowa. On display are the wrestling shoes he wore into the ring in 1911 against Hackenschmidt, his Mason's sword and leather scabbard, the roll-top desk that sat in his living room in Humboldt, and many other rare items.\n\nIn addition, an independent film company acquired the rights to the book \"Gotch: An American Hero\" in 2008, a biography written by Mike Chapman published in 1999, and is listed as \"in pre-production\" on its official website, yet still does not appear on the film company's IMDB credits page as in production as of April 2015.\n\nIn February 2015, WHO-TV news of Des Moines aired \"Iowa Icon: Gotch Up There with Feller, Warner, Gable\" with quotes from University of Iowa wrestling coach Tom Brands, among others, with the five-minute feature's title recognizing Gotch as one of Iowa's sports icons alongside Bob Feller, Kurt Warner, and professional wrestling legend Dan Gable. The video and story is archived on its website.\n\nKarl Gotch and Simon Gotch both took their professional wrestling names as a tribute to him.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Gotch was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a \"Legacy\" member.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Raised by a literate family, Dostoyevsky discovered literature at an early age, beginning when his mother introduced the Bible to him. Nannies near the hospitalsin the grounds of which he was raisedintroduced Dostoyevsky to fairy tales, legends and sagas. His mother's subscription to the \"Library of Reading\" gave him access to the leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. After his mother's death, Dostoyevsky moved from a boarding school to a military academy and despite the resulting lack of money, he was captivated by literature until his death.\n\nDostoyevsky started his writing career after finishing university. He started translating literature from Frenchwhich he learnt at the boarding schoolinto Russian, and then wrote short stories. With the success of his first novel, \"Poor Folk\", he became known throughout Saint Petersburg and Russia. Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Herzen and others praised \"Poor Folk\"s depiction of poverty, and Belinsky called it Russia's \"first social novel\". This success did not continue with his second novel, \"The Double\", and other short stories published mainly in left-wing magazines. These magazines included \"Notes of the Fatherland\" and \"The Contemporary\".\n\nDostoyevsky's renewed financial troubles led him to join several political circles. Because of his participation in the Petrashevsky Circle, in which he distributed and read several Belinsky articles deemed as anti-religious and anti-government, he and other members were sentenced to capital punishment. He was pardoned at the last minute, but they were imprisoned in SiberiaDostoyevsky for four years. During his detention he wrote several works, including the autobiographical \"The House of the Dead\". A New Testament booklet, which had been given shortly before his imprisonment, and other literature obtained outside of the barracks, were the only books he read at that time.\n\nFollowing his release, Dostoyevsky read a myriad of literature and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies and increasingly sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including \"Crime and Punishment\", \"The Idiot\", \"The Gambler\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov\". With the help of his brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazines\"Vremya\" and \"Epoch\"in which some of his stories appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued in the conservative \"The Russian Messenger\" until the introduction of \"A Writer's Diary\", which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, remain unfinished.\n\n \"Diary\" articles\n\nDostoyevsky wrote 221 \"Diary\" articles (excluding short stories listed in the respective section above) within two periods. The initial 1873 works were published in \"The Citizen\", the editor of which was Dostoyevsky, and from 1876 – 1877 the \"Diary\" was self-published. The English titles of the following list of works are extracted from Kenneth Lantz's two-volume translations.\n\n\"A Writer's Diary\" is a collection mainly of essays and articles, which also include, for example, answers to readers, introductions, etc., making the \"Diaries\" a journal-like book written and mostly edited by Dostoyevsky.\n\nList of initial \"Diary\" articles, issued in 1873:\n\n\nOther articles and essays\n\nDostoyevsky wrote articles and essays outside the \"Diaries\" collection. These include the 1863 travelogue \"Winter Notes on Summer Impressions\", in which he satirised and criticised European life. Other articles were written in response or as a criticism to a literary work, a person's view, requests to the military during the imprisonment period, announcements, notes and explanations. Some of them were written for different journals or almanacs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Force (December 25, 1876August 28, 1948) was an American art museum administrator and director.\n\nForce was born Julianna Reiser in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, on December 25, 1876. She became known as \"Juliana\". She was a twin and had seven other siblings besides her twin sister. Force's last name was spelled Reiser; she later changed the spelling to Rieser. Her father was a grocer and a hatter. The Rieser family moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1886. As a child Force attended a Christian boarding school for girls. For a short time in 1908 Force taught at a secretarial business school in Manhattan, downtown New York City. At the age of 35 Force married Willard Force, a dentist, then becoming known as \"Juliana Rieser Force\" or \"Juliana Reiser Force\" or \"Juliana R.

Whitney, an art sculptress and art collector, had inherited a Vanderbilt fortune. Whitney gave as Force's first duty an assignment to help organize art exhibitions at the Colony Club, an exclusive conservative social club for wealthy socialite women in New York City. Here Force showed off Whitney's art and a different kind of new unusual art by creative artists of a group called The Eight. Whitney was making a statement that all kinds of art, including different styles of art from new artists, should be represented to the public. Whitney was interested in displaying her collection of work as well as other art from modernist artists, especially living Americans.\n\nWhitney assigned Force in 1929 to contact the Metropolitan Museum of Art to prepare a plan for a gift of Whitney's collection. Whitney's art collection gift was to be displayed in a new wing, partly financed by her. The museum turned down the gift. Whitney then displayed her work in her own studios and galleries, that were under her name. Force managed these art enterprises and then in 1930 became director of the new Whitney Museum of American Art that developed from these art studio and gallery enterprises. Force was not trained as an art historian. She hired Lloyd Goodrich, an art historian, to be curator of the Whitney Museum of American Art, best known throughout the United States for displaying new kinds and unusual styles of modern art from living artists. Force's passion for new styles of art and her organizational traits made her an administrative director of the nationally known art museum notable for twentieth and twenty-first century art.\n\nForce initiated the first display of American folk art in a gallery in the United States, the \"Early American Art\" collection. On February 9, 1924 she began a presentation of folk art in a Whitney gallery that she administered, intending to bring folk art attractiveness closer to the level of contemporary art. Because of her passion for folk art, this initial display led to the first official public exhibition of folk art in a public showing presentation.\n\nAlthough her interactions with artists at the Whitney Studio Club inspired her to personally collect modern art, her collections of nineteenth-century and older folk art and decorative arts were larger and more significant. Her Eighth Street apartment was decorated in a Victorian style, contrary to contemporary tastes, and her home at Barley Sheaf Farm in Doylestown was filled with her folk art collection. Primarily acquired from rural antique dealers, her collection included portraits by early American limners, theorem paintings on velvet, and eclectic objects like cigar store Indians and toys.\n\nForce became chair of the American Art Research Council in 1942. The United States government did a national tour show of German art in 1946 of war booty. Force shortly thereafter undertook a course of action to return the art to its rightful owner.\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art directed by Force did art shows between 1946 and 1948 on Albert Pinkham Ryder, Robert Feke and Winslow Homer to promote public awareness of these artists.\n\nForce died in New York City on August 28, 1948, and buried at the Doylestown Cemetery in Pennsylvania. The museum held a memorial exhibition in her honor in 1949.\n\nJuliana Reiser married Willard Force in 1911. Her husband died in 1928, and they had no children.\n\n"}

Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life. Her Roman equivalent was Decima. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters (Atropos and Clotho) were the daughters of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of Zeus and Themis. Lachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the \"Republic\" of Plato as the daughter of Necessity.

{"id": "2733375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2733375", "title": "Mari Lwyd", "text": "Mari Lwyd\n\nThe Mari Lwyd () is a wassailing folk custom found in South Wales. The tradition entails the use of an eponymous hobby horse which is made from a horse's skull mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \"hooded animal\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout Great Britain.\n\nThe custom was first recorded in 1800, with subsequent accounts of it being produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry through the medium of song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.\n\nAlthough the custom was given various names, it was best known as the \"Mari Lwyd\"; the etymology of this term remains the subject of academic debate. The folklorist Iorwerth C. Peate believed that the term meant \"Holy Mary\" and thus was a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, while fellow folklorist E. C. Cawte thought it more likely that the term had originally meant \"Grey Mare\", thus referring to the heads' equine appearance. A number of earlier folklorists to examine the topic, such as Peate and Ellen Ettlinger, believed that the tradition had once been a pre-Christian religious rite, although scholarly support for this interpretation has declined amid a lack of supporting evidence.\n\nAlthough the tradition declined in the early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, in the work of the painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd itself consists of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; to the back of the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented not by a skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd custom was performed during winter festivities, specifically around the dates of Christmas and New Year. However, the precise date on which the custom was performed varied between villages, and in a number of cases the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.\n\nThe custom used to begin at dusk and often lasted late into the night. The Mari Lwyd party consisted of four to seven men, who often had coloured ribbons and rosettes attached to their clothes and sometimes wore a broad sash around the waist. There was usually a smartly dressed \"Leader\" who carried a staff, stick, or whip, and sometimes other stock characters, such as the \"Merryman\" who played music, and Punch and Judy (both played by men) with blackened faces; often brightly dressed, Punch carried a long metal fire iron and Judy had a besom.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd party would approach a house and sing a song in which they requested admittance. The inhabitants of the house would then offer excuses for why the team could not enter. The party would sing a second verse, and the debate between the two sides – known as the \"pwnco\" – would continue until the house's inhabitants ran out of ideas, at which time they were obliged to allow the party entry and to provide them with ale and food. An account from Nantgarw described such a performance, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a noise, with Punch tapping the ground to the rhythm of the music and rapping on the door with a poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house walls, and windows with a broom. The householders had to make Punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered the building, otherwise it was the local custom that before he left he would rake out the fire with his poker. In the case from Llangynwyd, however, there was no interplay between the householders and troupe, but rather the latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing the first verse of their song.\n\nOnce inside, the entertainment continued with the Mari Lwyd running around neighing and snapping its jaws, creating havoc, frightening children (and perhaps even adults) while the Leader pretended to try to restrain it. The Merryman played music and entertained the householders. The folklorist Iorwerth Peate believed that in recorded examples from Glamorgan it was apparent that the Mari Lwyd custom had become \"indistinguishable\" from the practice of wassailing, although added that there were still some examples of wassailing that did not involve the Mari Lwyd. He added that links between Mari Lwyd and wassailing were also apparent from recorded examples in other part of Wales, thus opining that Mari Lwyd represented a variant of the wider wassailing custom that was found throughout Britain.\n\nThe Mary Lwyd was part of a wider \"hooded animal\" tradition that the folklorist E. C. Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. A related example is the hoodening custom of East Kent in southeastern England.\n\nMost recorded sources term this particular custom \"Mari Lwyd\". Jones considered this to be a translation of \"Blessed Mary\", and thus a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, a key religious figure in the Catholic Church. Although translating it slightly differently, as \"Holy Mary\", Peate endorsed this viewpoint. Although some of his acquaintances later suggested that the use of \"Mari\" for Mary was unknown in Wales prior to the Protestant Reformation, he countered these criticisms with the observation that the term \"Mari\" was being used in reference to the Virgin in the mid-14th century \"Black Book of Carmarthen\", thus attesting to its early usage in Welsh. He nevertheless accepted that during the medieval period the term might have been restricted largely to poets, given that there is no evidence of its usage among the common dialect in this period.\n\nGiven that \"llwyd\" is the usual word for \"grey\" in the Welsh language and that Welsh speakers would have been exposed to the English word \"mare\", an alternative suggestion considered by Peate was that the term \"Mari Lwyd\" had originally meant \"Grey Mare\". This etymological explanation would have parallels with the name of a similar hooded horse tradition found in Ireland and the Isle of Man, which is known in Irish as the \"Láir Bhán\" and in Manx as the \"Laare Vane\", in both cases meaning \"White Mare\". Initially believing that \"there is much to be said for this suggestion\", Peate later embraced it fully. Cawte similarly believed that \"Grey Mare\" was the most likely original meaning of the term, noting that the Mari Lwyd appeared to represent a horse and that similar hobby horse customs in neighbouring England, such as the hoodening tradition of East Kent, also made reference to horses with their name. Peate suggested that even if the term \"Mari Lwyd\" had originally referred to a \"Grey Mare\", it could still have come to be associated with Mary in popular folk culture following the Reformation, thus explaining why Mary is referred to in the lyrics of some surviving Welsh wassailing songs.\n\nA further suggestion is that \"Mari Lwyd\" derives from the English term \"Merry Lude\", referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then the result would be \"merri-liwt\" or \"merri-liwd\". Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term \"Mari\" in this context had derived from \"Morris\", a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea is that there is no known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.\n\nIn other recorded instances, the \"Mary Lwyd\" custom is given different names, with it being recorded as \"y Wasail\" \"The Wassail\" in parts of Carmarthenshire. In the first half of the 19th century it was recorded in Pembrokeshire under the name of \"y March\" \"The Horse\" and \"y Gynfas-farch\" \"The Canvas Horse\". One account from West Glamorgan has the head termed the \"aderyn bee\" [\"bi\"?] \"y llwyd\", meaning the \"Grey Magpie\", although this may be due to an error on the part of the recorder, who could have confused the horse's head for the \"aderyn pica llwyd\", an artificial bird in a tree that was carried by wassailers in the same area.\n\nPositing the custom to be \"the survival of some ancient popular rite or ceremony\", in 1888 David Jones suggested that its origins were Christian, and that it had once been part of the festivities of the Feast of the Ass, a commemoration of the flight into Egypt of Mary and Saint Joseph that was historically marked on 14 January. According to Jones' idea, the Mari Lwyd itself represented the donkey on which Mary rode during the story.\n\nPeate was of the opinion that the Mari Lwyd was \"no doubt a survival of a pre-Christian tradition\" that had once been spread across Britain and other parts of Europe, and which – having survived the Christianisation of Britain – had been renamed \"Mari Lwyd\" in reference to the Virgin Mary during the Middle Ages. He expressed the view that the original custom had been \"horrific in origin and intention\" and that from an early date it had been connected to wassailing. Cawte concurred that it was \"reasonable to accept\" that the Mari Lwyd head had become attached to an independent wassailing tradition, but said that the connection to the Virgin Mary was unnecessary. Pearce also suggested the possibility that in parts of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire the Mari Lwyd tradition came under the influence of mystery plays, thus explaining why later recorded examples from those counties contained characters known as \"the Sergeant\" and the \"Merryman\".\n\nThe folklorist Trefor M. Owen also suggested that the Mari Lwyd was a practice \"which probably had a religious (if pre-Christian) origin\", adding that by the time it had been recorded, it had become \"emptied of its religious content\". Also embracing Peate's suggestion of ancient origins, Ellen Ettlinger believed that the Mari Lwyd represented a \"death horse\", as symbolised by the white cloth worn by its carrier, suggesting that it was originally employed in a pre-Christian ritual to mark the festival of Samhain. The folklorist Christina Hole suggested that this \"ancient character\" was once \"a bringer of fertility\". However, after 1970 the folkloric trend for interpreting such hobby horse traditions as pre-Christian survivals had ended, as scholars came to express greater caution about proposing origins for such customs.\n\nIn mapping the distribution of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noted that it was principally a custom associated with Glamorgan, with two-thirds of instances falling within that county. The custom stretched east into the industrial valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly account coming from Monmouth itself; this account is also one of the earliest. A number of examples were also found in Carmarthenshire, with a single example found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a single record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in an example from Wrexham, which Cawte believed was the result of a Glamorgan man bringing the custom with him as he moved north. Previously, Peate had cautioned that the comparative absence of recorded examples from Mid and North Wales was not proof that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been present in those areas.\n\nCawte opined that there was \"no clear reason\" for the distribution of the Mari Lwyd custom, which cut through various local cultural features. Those areas where it was found did not correlate with any distinction between English-speaking and Welsh-speaking areas in South Wales. He acknowledged however that there was a \"reasonable correspondence\" between the areas in which the Mari Lwyd was recorded and the areas which were used for mineral production in the 14th century. He therefore suggested the possibility that it might have been performed by coal and iron miners in western Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, and western Monmouthshire, and that from there it could have spread into those villages where goods were manufactured using those minerals.\n\nThe earliest published account of the Mari Lwyd appeared in 1800 in J. Evans' \"A Tour through Part of North Wales, in the year 1798, and at Other Times\". Although the book itself focused on North Wales, the chapter in which the passage was included discussed the language and customs of Wales more generally. In this section, Evans related that:\n\nEvans returned to the custom in his 1804 work \"Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times\". Here he provided a clearer discussion than before, making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured the local area from Christmas until after Twelfth Day, and that they were given food or money to leave the householders alone.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd next appeared in an 1819 account from West Glamorgan, where the Mari Lwyd itself was termed an \"Aderyn Bee y llwyd\" (roughly \"Grey Magpie\") and was accompanied by \"three or four partners in the profits of the expedition, who are by turns horse, groom, or attendants\".\n\nIt has been suggested that the Welsh Methodist revival contributed to the decline of both the Mari Lwyd and a number of other Welsh folk customs. In 1802, the harpist Edward Jones of Merionethshire published a book in which he lamented the destructive impact that Christian preachers were having on Welsh folk customs, which they were criticising as sinful. In his view, \"the consequence is, Wales, which was formerly one of the merriest and happiest countries in the World, is now becoming one of the dullest\". Reflecting such a view, in 1852 the Reverend William Roberts, a Baptist minister at Blaenau Gwent, condemned the Mari Lwyd and other related customs as \"a mixture of old Pagan and Popish ceremonies... I wish of this folly, and all similar follies, that they find no place anywhere apart from the museum of the historian and antiquary.\"\n\nOwen suggested that the custom's decline was also a result of changing social conditions in South Wales. He argued that the Mari Lwyd wassailing custom \"gave an approved means of entering the houses of neighbours in a culture in which there were few public assemblies – at least in the heart of winter – in which the convivial spirit of the season could be released\". Further, he suggested that the gifts of food, drink, and sometimes money \"no doubt helped to further the feeling of community among country folk while at the same time manifesting it\". He argued that the changing social conditions altered the ways that people in southern Wales celebrated Christmas, hence contributing to the folk custom's decline.\n\nIn a 1935 article on the subject of the Mari Lwyd, Peate stated that the tradition \"is still met with; it is practised in the Cardiff district, Bridgend, Llangynwyd, Neath and other Glamorgan districts\". He highlighted an example from Christmas Eve 1934, in which a Mari Lwyd was observed performing alongside at least twelve singers in a chemist's shop in the Mumbles, Swansea. Ettlinger subsequently expressed the view that \"Dr. Peate deserves the sincerest gratitude of all folk-lore students for having so valiantly penetrated the mysteries surrounding the Mari Lwyd.\"\n\nThe historian Ronald Hutton stated that the Mari Lwyd tradition appeared to have become defunct in the early 20th century. In the middle of that century it was revived in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake published a letter in the journal \"English Dance and Song\" in which she noted that the Mari Lwyd appeared each Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, near Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for the past sixty years. Blake also explained that she believed that the custom was still performed at several villages in the Maesteg area of Glamorgan. During the 1970s, Hole commented that the tradition was still found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire.\n\nDuring the 1980s, further revived forms of the Mari Lwyd tradition emerged in Caerphilly, Llantrisant, and St Fagans, all of which are in the same borderland between Vale and mountains. Commenting on the example of Llantrisant, which was inaugurated in 1980, Mick Tems noted that the custom had \"re-established herself so strongly that there are complaints if she misses any of her regular calls\". He noted that in 1991 the Llantrisant Mari Lwyd was taken to Yn Chruinnaght, a Pan-Celtic festival on the Isle of Man, and that it had also been taken to the Lowender Peran festival at Perranporth in Cornwall. Hutton believed that the custom re-emerged in the borderlands between Vale and the mountains in part because people in Glamorgan sought to reaffirm their sense of cultural identity during the termination of their traditional industries, and partly because the Welsh Folk Museum was located in the area. More widely, he believed that the revival of the Mari Lwyd was in large part due to the \"forces of local patriotism\", noting that a similar situation had resulted in the resurrection of the hoodening tradition in East Kent.\n\nThe town council of Aberystwyth organised \"The World's Largest Mari Lwyd\" for the Millennium celebrations in 2000.\nA mixture of the Mari Lwyd and Wassail customs occurs in the border town of Chepstow, South Wales, every January. A band of English Wassailers meet with the local Welsh Border Morris Side, The Widders, on the bridge in Chepstow.\n\nThe Mari Lwyd has prompted responses from the arts in Wales. The poet Vernon Watkins published his \"Ballad of the Mari Lwyd\" in 1941. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has written that this, \"one of the outstanding poems of the century, draws together the folk-ritual of the New Year, the Christian Eucharist, the uneasy frontier between living and dead, so as to present a model of what poetry itself is — frontier work between death and life, old year and new, bread and body.\"\n\nThe Mari Lwyd was utilised by the artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins in a series of drawings from around 2000 that focused on a metamorphosing horse/man as a nightmarish harbinger of his father's death. Catriona Urquhart wrote a sequence of poems titled \"The Mare's Tale\" which were published alongside Hicks-Jenkins' images in 2001. In her 1977 novel \"Silver on the Tree\", the author Susan Cooper included an appearance from the Mari Lwyd.\n\nIn 1919, H. W. Evans recorded the existence of a similar custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire circa 1840, during his mother's childhood. He stated that this custom entailed the use of what he termed a \"Mari Lwyd\", furthermore providing a drawing of it using his mother's recollections as a basis, although was unaware of how this costume had been used. According to Evans' description, this Mari Lwyd consisted of a sheet that had been sewn together along two adjacent sides to make a cone, which was then stuffed with hay and decorated with buttons for eyes and harvest gloves for ears, thus resembling an animal's snout. An individual could conceal themselves under the sheet and use a hay fork inserted into the hay to hold it up. A similar custom appears in an account from 1897, in which an entity known as the \"Bwca Llwyd\" (\"Grey Bogy\") was described; it involved an imitation horse's head being made from canvas and stuffed with hay, being carried about using a hay fork on All Hallow's Eve.\n\nCawte also noted the example of other Welsh folk customs featuring the head of a horse, however he opined that these \"so not seem to be closely related to the mari lwyd\". A horse's head was prepared in a manner akin to the Mari Lwyd for a spring festival known as the \"mynwenta\" or \"pynwenta\", which took place in Pembrokeshire circa 1820. As part of this festival, young men and women gathered at a mill for a night's entertainment.\nIn the late nineteenth century, a tradition was recorded in North Wales that was known as \"giving a skull\", in which the skull of a horse or donkey was placed over the front door of a woman's house on May Day as a sign of contempt.\nIn parts of Wales a horse's head – sometimes with horns attached – was featured as part of the \"charivari\" processions designed to shame those who were deemed to have behaved in an immoral manner.\n\n\n"}

Located on an plot across the street from the Governor's mansion at 800 Nazih Zuhdi Drive in Oklahoma City, the museum opened in 2005 and is operated by the Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS). It preserves the history of Oklahoma from ancient Native American tribal nations to the present day.\n\nThe Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 10:00 AM until 5:00 PM. It is closed on:New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. The OHC Research Center is open to the public Tuesday through Saturday. It is closed on Sunday, Monday and all state holidays. The hours are 10:00 AM to 4:45 PM each day.\n\nThe Learning Center covers . The OHC is affiliated with the Smithsonian and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nThe Inasmuch Foundation Gallery is located on the south end of the first floor. The gallery explores the breadth of Oklahoma’s artistic achievements as well as the impact of an extremely diverse immigrant population. Visitors will enjoy a broad range of subjects, including our entertainment value as a land of Cowboys and Indians, our pioneering innovations in broadcasting, and the dramatic and unifying impact sports and sporting events have made on our communities.\n\nThe sections of the Inasmuch Foundation Gallery include: culture and the arts; cultural diversity; images of Oklahoma; sports; voice; radio and television; vacuum tubes; and Wild West shows. Additionally, this gallery houses rotating exhibits on cultural diversity and the arts.\n\nThe ONEOK Gallery is located on the north end of the first floor. Representing all 39 American Indian tribes currently associated with Oklahoma, the ONEOK Gallery offers visitors the opportunity to explore the traditional historic past of native peoples of Oklahoma as well as experience contemporary Indian cultures. Using modern-day Indian experience as a bridge between the past and the present, the exhibit offers artifacts, tribal music, photographic images, Indian art, and oral histories from the Indian tribes of Oklahoma.\n\nThe ONEOK Gallery topics include: dwellings; Indian lives; languages; living ways; origins; sovereignty; spirituality; and tribes.\n\nThe Kerr-McGee Gallery is located on the south end of the third floor. The gallery offers a rich history of Oklahoma from our oil and gas exploration to our military contributions since the first expeditions by the Spanish in the 16th century. Visitors can enjoy numerous artifacts including items from an 1830s riverboat recently excavated from the Red River, examples of Oklahoma’s entrepreneurial history, and a 3-D reconstruction of an oil derrick.\n\nThe Kerr-McGee Gallery sections include: African American experience; business; military matters; natural resources; the oil and gas industry; people and pathways; and transportation.\n\nThe Noble Foundation Gallery is located on the north end of the third floor. Land runs and lotteries have played an enormous role in our development and settlement as a state. Through artifacts, images, and first-hand accounts of participants, visitors can relive the lives of those brave souls who settled our great plains and turned homesteads into farms and cities. It was their survival of and adaptation to the extremes of weather, economics, and politics that enabled them to create this magnificent state.\n\nThe Noble Foundation Gallery sections include: education; farming and ranching; fashions; government and politics; kitchens; the Dust Bowl; land runs; law and order; urban frontiers; and weather.\n\nRock & Roll Exhibit - In 2009, The Oklahoma History Center hosted \"Another Hot Oklahoma Night: A Rock & Roll Exhibit\", a title that comes from the lyrics of a song by Oklahoma-born musician Michael Been. This exhibit explored the rock and roll artists, radio stations, personalities, venues, and fans that have called Oklahoma home. Beyond the facts of each story, the exhibit showed how growing up in Oklahoma affected the music. These were displayed in an innovative style to encourage visitor participation and to ensure that the visitor would take away a new perspective on the history of rock and roll in Oklahoma. The exhibit was located in the E. L. & Thelma Gaylord Gallery on the extreme north end of the first floor. Additional exhibit components were located in the Inasmuch Foundation, Noble Foundation, and Kerr-McGee Galleries. This exhibit closed in 2011.\n\nTierra De Mi Familia - On November 22, 2008, the Oklahoma History Center opened a museum exhibit sharing the Latino experience in Oklahoma. The interactive exhibit used interviews, artifacts, documents, photographs, film, and music to explore both the impact of Latinos on the state of Oklahoma and the impact of the state of Oklahoma on the lives of Latinos. The exhibit integrated two story lines; the historical immigration of Latinos to Oklahoma, from territorial days to present, and the cultural folkways that Oklahoma’s Latino people have brought with them from Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America.\n\nOklahoma is home to cultures from all over the world, a unique blend of people that call Oklahoma their home. This exhibit provided a place to tell these immigration stories, a place to share and begin to understand and learn about the diversity of the state of Oklahoma. This exhibit closed in 2012.\n\nOklahoma's Apollo 11 Moon Rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock- Rose Niang-Casey, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, and a participant in the “Moon Rock Project”, was assigned the task of hunting down the Oklahoma Apollo 11 Moon rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock; two moon rocks the Nixon Administration gifted to the people of Oklahoma. In both cases she discerned these moon rocks were properly on display at the Oklahoma History Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She advised this is an exception to the rule, as most of these unique gifts that were given to the states and nations of the world have been poorly handled over the years.\n\nOklahoma State Level History Day Competition- Each year, the Oklahoma History Center hosts the 2nd stage of a 3-stage (district, state, and national) competition called National History Day. National History Day is a competition where middle school and high school students create projects about certain events in history. Students can enter documentaries, historical papers, websites, exhibit boards, or performances on a topic that the students choose that relate to each year's theme. Students' projects are judged and advance to the National competition if they place 1st or 2nd in their category.

{"id": "5544594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5544594", "title": "Papal brief", "text": "Papal brief\n\nA papal brief is a formal document emanating from the Pope, in a somewhat simpler and more modern form than a papal bull.\n\nThe introduction of briefs, which occurred at the beginning of the pontificate of Pope Eugenius IV (3 March 1431 – 23 February 1447), was prompted for the same desire for greater simplicity and expedition that had already been responsible for the disappearance of the greater bulls and the general adoption of the less cumbersome \"mandamenta\". A brief (from the Latin \"breve\" for \"short\") was a compendious papal letter which dispensed with some previous formalities.\n\nA brief was written on vellum, generally closed, i. e., folded, and sealed in red wax with the papal ring of the fisherman. The Pope's name appears first and at the top, normally written in capital letters, e. g.: \"PIUS PP III\", and instead of the formal salutation in the third person used in papal bulls, the brief at once adopts a direct form of address, e. g., \"\"Dilecte fili—Carissime in Christo fili\", the phrase being adapted to the dignity and character of the addressee. The letter begins by way of preamble with a statement of the case and cause of writing and is followed by certain instructions without minatory clauses or other formulae. At the end the date is expressed by the day of the month and year with a mention of the seal, for example in this form: \"Datum Romae apud Sanctum Petrum, sub annulo Piscatoris die V Marii, MDLXXXXI, pont. nostri anno primo\"\". The year here specified, which is used in dating briefs, is probably to be understood in any specific instance as the year of the Nativity, beginning 25 December. However, this is not an absolute rule, and the sweeping statements sometimes made in this matter are not to be trusted, for it is certain that in some instances the years meant are ordinary calendar years, i. e., years beginning with the first of January.\nA similar want of uniformity is generally observed in the dating of bulls from the middle of the eleventh century to the end of the eighteenth: Papal bulls were dated by the years of the Incarnation, commencing on 25 March, the Solemnity of the Annunciation. After the institution of briefs by Pope Eugenius IV, the use of even lesser bulls, in the form of \"mandamenta\", became notably less frequent. Still, for many purposes, bulls continued to be employed, for example in canonizations, in which case special forms are observed, the Pope by exception signing his own name, under which is added a stamp imitating the \"rota\" as well as the signatures of several cardinals, as also in the nominations of bishops, promotions to certain benefices, some marriage dispensations, et cetera. But the choice of the precise form of instrument was often arbitrary. For example, in granting the dispensation which enabled King Henry VIII of England to marry his brother's widow, Catherine of Aragon, 2 forms of dispensation were issued by Pope Julius II, one a brief, seemingly expedited in great haste, and the other a bull which was sent on afterwards. Similarly we may notice that, while the English Catholic hierarchy was restored in 1850 by a brief, Pope Leo XIII in the first year of his reign used a bull to establish the Catholic episcopate of Scotland. So also the Society of Jesus, suppressed by a brief in 1773, was restored by a bull in 1818. \n\nSince the sixteenth century the briefs have been written in a very legible Roman hand upon a sheet of vellum of convenient size, while even the wax with its guard of silk and the impression of the fisherman's ring was replaced in 1842 by a stamp which affixed the same devices in red ink. The bulls, on the other hand, to the death of Pope Pius IX retained many medieval features apart from great size, leaden seal, and Roman mode of dating. In particular, although from about 1050 to the Reformation the writing employed in the \"Cancellaria Apostolica\" did not noticeably differ from the ordinary bookhand familiar throughout Christendom, the engrossers of papal bulls, even after the sixteenth century, continued using an archaic and very artificial type of writing known as \"scrittura bollatica\", with manifold contractions and an absence of any punctuation, which was practically undecipherable by ordinary readers. It was the custom in issuing a bull to accompany it with a \"transsumption\" (copy) in ordinary manuscript. This state of things was ended by a motu proprio of Pope Leo XIII shortly after his election: bulls were written in the same, legible Roman script that was used for briefs, and in view of the difficulties arising from transmission by post, the old leaden seal was replaced in many cases by a simple stamp bearing the same device in red ink.\nThe \"minutanti\", being specialized Roman curials, employed in the preparation of briefs form a separate department under the presidency of a palatine cardinal styled the \"Cardinal Secretary of Briefs\" with the \"Secretary of Latin Briefs and Briefs to the Princes\", which office carried the dignity of prelate, as his substitute.\n\nWhen in the early 20th century the Secretariate of Briefs to Princes and of Latin Letters was placed under the direction of the Cardinal Secretary of State, the offices of this great department were transferred to the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City and established in the unoccupied halls of the old picture gallery, all on the same floor. The extent of business transacted there is evidenced by the archives.\n"}

It is a translation of the Biblical Hebrew phrase גר תושב (\"ger toshav\").\n\n\"Proselyte\" also has the more general meaning in English of a new convert to any particular religion or doctrine.\n\nThe Law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into Israel's community of such as were not born Israelites.\n\nThe New Testament makes mention of proselytes in synagogues. The name \"proselyte\" occurs in the New Testament only in Matthew and Acts. The name by which they are commonly designated is that of \"devout men\", or men \"fearing God\", or \"worshipping God\", or \"Godfearers\".\n\nOn the historical meaning of the Greek word, in chapter 2 of the apocryphal gospel Acts of Pilate (roughly dated from 150 to 400 CE), Annas and Caiaphas define \"proselyte\" for Pilate:\n\nThere are two kinds of proselytes in Rabbinic Judaism; \"ger tzedek\" (righteous proselytes, proselytes of righteousness, religious proselyte, devout proselyte) and \"ger toshav\" (resident proselyte, proselytes of the gate, limited proselyte, half-proselyte)\n\nA \"righteous proselyte\" is a gentile who has converted to Judaism, is bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish religion, and is considered a full member of the Jewish people. The proselyte is circumcised as an adult (\"milah l'shem giur\"), if male, and immerses in a \"mikvah\" to formally effect the conversion.\n\nA \"gate proselyte\" is a resident alien who lives in the Land of Israel and follows some of the customs. They are not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the whole of the Torah. They are bound only to conform to the Seven Laws of Noah (do not worship idols, do not blaspheme God's name, do not murder, do not commit fornication (immoral sexual acts), do not steal, do not tear the limb from a living animal, and do not fail to establish rule of law) to be assured of a place in the world to come.\n\nThe \"religious proselytes\" spoken of in Early Christian writings were likely righteous proselytes rather than gate proselytes. There is some debate however as to whether proselytes known as Godfearers (Phoboumenoi) and/or Worshippers (Sebomenoi), who were baptized but not circumcised, fall into the righteous or gate category. A dispute over this subject is recorded in the Council of Jerusalem c. 50. (See also Circumcision in the Bible.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5440166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5440166", "title": "Rocky Steps", "text": "Rocky Steps\n\nThe 72 stone steps before the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have become known as the \"Rocky Steps\" as a result of the scene from the film \"Rocky\". Tourists often mimic Rocky's famous climb, a metaphor for an underdog or an everyman rising to a challenge. A bronze \"Rocky\" statue was briefly situated at the top of the steps for the filming of \"Rocky III\". This statue, now located at the bottom right of the steps, is a popular photo opportunity for visitors. The top of the steps offers a commanding view of Eakins Oval, the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and Philadelphia City Hall.\n\nIn 2006, Rocky creator Sylvester Stallone recounted the genesis of the iconic scene: (while filming the 1976 movie) the film crew, bound by a tight budget, identified the steps one night while searching for filming locations around the city. Stallone first thought Rocky should carry his dog Butkus up the steps, but the big bull mastiff proved too heavy for the scene to work. Still, the view from the top of the stairs inspired him to reshoot the scene without the dog. Also in \"Rocky Balboa\", Rocky lifts his dog Punchy when he reaches the top of the steps. The closing credits of \"Rocky Balboa\" show a montage of dozens of people running up the steps.\n\nThis scene was one of the first uses in a major film of the Steadicam, a stabilized camera mount that allows its operator to walk and even climb steps while smoothly filming.\n\nBefore \"Rocky III\", released in 1982, Stallone commissioned A. Thomas Schomberg to create a bronze statue of Rocky. Three 2-ton, 10-foot-tall copies were to be cast. One was installed atop the steps for the filming of \"Rocky III\", and was ultimately relocated at the bottom of the steps. The second \"Rocky\" is in the San Diego Hall of Champions Sports Museum in San Diego, California. The third was planned, but was not cast at the time.\n\nA third casting of the statue was put up for auction to raise funds for charities. The third was listed on eBay three separate times between 2002-2005, with a starting bid of US$5,000,000, then US$3,000,000, and finally US$1,000,000 to raise funds for the International Institute for Sport and Olympic History. In 2006, Schomberg studios realized the casting mold for the statue was beginning to decay, and had a third and final edition of the statue cast in bronze. The third statue is currently exhibited at the Schomberg's gallery in Colorado \n\nAfter filming was complete, a debate arose between the Art Museum and Philadelphia's Art Commission over the meaning of \"art\". City officials, who argued that the \"Rocky\" statue was not \"art\" but a \"movie prop\", eventually moved it to the front of the Philadelphia Spectrum.\n\nIt was later returned to the Art Museum for the filming of \"Rocky V\", then brought back to the Spectrum. The statue was replaced with a bronze inlay of Converse sneaker footprints with the name \"Rocky\" above them.\n\nOn September 8, 2006, the \"Rocky\" statue was returned to the Art Museum and placed on a pedestal in a grassy area near the foot of the steps to the right of the Museum. The unveiling ceremony included live music, the debut of the first full trailer for \"Rocky Balboa,\" and a free showing of the first \"Rocky\" movie. At the ceremony, Philadelphia Mayor John Street said that the steps were one of Philly's biggest tourist attractions, and that Stallone, a native New Yorker, had become \"the city's favorite adopted son\".\n\nThe \"Rocky\" film scene has become a cultural icon. Many tourists visit the steps to recreate the scene themselves. E! Channel ranked it No. 13 in its \"101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment\". During the 1996 Olympic Torch Relay, Philadelphia native Dawn Staley was chosen to run up the museum steps. The steps are the backdrop for the annual Independence Day celebration, and have often been featured in large concerts such as Live 8. Two journalists from the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" spent a year interviewing people who ran the steps, and published a book in 1996 called \"Rocky Stories: Tales of Love, Hope, and Happiness at America's Most Famous Steps\". The 2017 NFL Draft was held from the steps, the first time the NFL draft was held outdoors.\n\nThe scene has inspired homages and parodies since Rocky was released in 1976.\n\n"}
{"id": "14200488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14200488", "title": "Scrambling (linguistics)", "text": "Scrambling (linguistics)\n\nScrambling is a common term for pragmatic word order. In the Chomskyan tradition, every language is assumed to have a basic word order which is fundamental to its sentence structure, so languages which exhibit a wide variety of different orders are said to have \"scrambled\" them from their \"normal\" word order. The notion of scrambling has spread beyond the Chomskyan tradition and become a general concept that denotes many non-canonical word orders in numerous languages. Scrambling often (but not always) results in a discontinuity; the scrambled expression appears at a distance from its head in such a manner that crossing lines are present in the syntactic tree. Scrambling discontinuities are distinct from topicalization, wh-fronting, and extraposition discontinuities. Scrambling does not occur in English, but it is frequent in languages with freer word order, such as German, Russian, Persian and Turkic languages.\n\nThe following examples from German illustrate typical instances of scrambling:\n\nThese examples illustrate typical cases of scrambling in the midfield of a subordinate clause in German. All six clauses are acceptable, whereby the actual order that appears is determined by pragmatic considerations such as emphasis. If one takes the first clause (clause a) as the basic order, then scrambling has occurred in clauses b–f. The three constituents \"der Mann\", \"der Frau\", and \"die Bohnen\" have been scrambled.\n\nScrambling in German is associated with the midfield, i.e. the part of the sentence that appears between the finite verb and a non-finite verb in main clauses and between the subordinator (= subordinating conjunction) and the finite verb in an embedded clause (= subordinate clause). There is a clear tendency for definite pronouns to appear to the left in the midfield. In this regard, definite pronouns are frequent candidates to undergo scrambling, e.g.\n\nThe canonical position of the object in German is to the right of the subject. In this regard, the object pronouns \"mich\" in the first example and \"uns\" in the second example have been scrambled to the left, so that the clauses now have OS (object-subject) order. The second example is unlike the first example insofar as it, due to the presence of the auxiliary verb \"wird\" 'will', necessitates an analysis in terms of a discontinuity.\n\nStandard instances of scrambling in German occur in the midfield, as stated above. There are, however, many non-canonical orderings whose displaced constituents do not appear in the midfield. One can argue that such examples also involve scrambling:\nThe past participle \"erwähnt\" has been topicalized in this sentence. Its object, the pronoun \"das\", appears, however, on the other side of the finite verb. There is no midfield involved in this case, which means the non-canonical position in which \"das\" appears in relation to its governor \"erwähnt\" cannot be addressed in terms of midfield scrambling. The position of \"das\" also cannot be addressed in terms of extraposition, since extraposed constituents are relatively heavy, much heavier than \"das\", which is a very light definite pronoun. Given these facts, one can argue that a scrambling discontinuity is present. The definite pronoun \"das\" has been scrambled rightward out from under its governor \"erwähnt\". Hence the example suggests that the scrambling mechanism is quite flexible.\n\nScrambling is like extraposition (but unlike topicalization and \"wh\"-fronting) in a relevant respect; it is clause-bound. That is, one cannot scramble a constituent out of one clause into another, e.g.\nThe first example has canonical word order; scrambling has not occurred. The second example illustrates what happens when one attempts to scramble the definite pronoun \"das\" out of the embedded clause into the main clause. The sentence becomes strongly unacceptable. Extraposition is similar. When one attempts to extrapose a constituent out of one clause into another, the result is unacceptable.\n\nClassical Latin and Ancient Greek were known for a more extreme type of scrambling known as \"hyperbaton\", defined as a \"violent displacement of words\". This involves the scrambling (extraposition) of individual words out of their syntactic constituents. Perhaps the most well-known example is \"magnā cum laude\" \"with great praise\" (lit. \"great with praise\"). This was possible in Latin and Greek because of case-marking: For example, both \"magnā\" and \"laude\" are in the ablative case.\n\nHyperbaton is found in a number of prose writers, e.g. Cicero:\n\nMuch more extreme hyperbaton occurred in poetry, often with criss-crossing constituents. An example from Ovid is\n\nAn interlinear gloss is as follows:\n\nThe two nouns (subject and object) are placed side-by-side, with both corresponding adjectives extraposed on the opposite side of the verb, in a non-embedding fashion.\n\nEven more extreme cases are noted in the poetry of Horace, e.g.\n\nGlossed interlinearly, the lines are as follows:\n\nBecause of the case, gender and number marking on the various nouns, adjectives and determiners, a careful reader can connect the discontinuous and interlocking phrases \"Quis ... gracilis ... puer\", \"multā ... in rōsā\", \"liquidīs ... odoribus\" in a way that would be impossible in English.\n\nThe theoretical analysis of scrambling can vary a lot depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. Constituency-based theories (phrase structure theories) that prefer strictly binary branching structures are likely to address most cases of scrambling in terms of movement (or copying). One or more constituents is assumed to move out of its base position into a derived position. Many other theories of sentence structure, for instance those that allow n-ary branching structures (such as all dependency grammars), see many (but not all!) instances of scrambling involving just shifting; a discontinuity is not involved. The varying analyses are illustrated here using trees. The first tree illustrates the movement analysis of the example above in a theory that assumes strictly binary branching structures. The German subordinate clause \"weil mich die anderen oft einladen\" is used, which translates as \"because the others often invite me\":\n\nThe abbreviation \"Sub\" stands for \"subordinator\" (= subordinating conjunction), and \"SubP\" stands for \"subordinator phrase\" (= embedded clause). The tree on the left shows a discontinuity (= crossing lines) and the tree on the right illustrates how a movement analysis deals with the discontinuity. The pronoun \"mich\" is generated in a position immediately to the right of the subject; it then moves leftward to reach its surface position. The binary branching structures necessitate this analysis in terms of a discontinuity and movement.\n\nA theory of syntax that rejects the subject-predicate division of traditional grammar (S → NP+VP) and assumes relatively flat structures (that lack a finite VP constituent) instead will acknowledge no discontinuity in this example. Instead, a shifting analysis addresses many instances of scrambling. The following trees illustrate the shifting-type analysis in a dependency-based grammar. The clause from above is again used (\"weil mich die anderen oft einladen\" 'because the others often invite me'):\n\nThe tree on the left shows the object in its canonical position to the right of the subject, and the tree on the right shows the object in the derived position to the left of the subject. The important thing to acknowledge about the two trees is that there are no crossing lines. In other words, there is no discontinuity. The absence of a discontinuity is due to the flat structure assumed (which, again, lacks a finite VP constituent). The point, then, is that the relative flatness/layeredness of the structures that one assumes influences significantly the theoretical analysis of scrambling.\n\nThe example just examined can be, as just shown, accommodated without acknowledging a discontinuity (if a flat structure is assumed). There are many other cases of scrambling, however, where the analysis must acknowledge a discontinuity, almost regardless of whether relatively flat structures are assumed or not. This fact means that scrambling is generally acknowledged as one of the primary discontinuity types (in addition to topicalization, \"wh\"-fronting, and extraposition).\n\n"}

Most of the doctor's films were confiscated, though the rooms in which they were developed and screened were never found.\n\nAround thirty years later, the asylum is being used as the set of \"Silent Creek\", a film based on the murders committed in it. While doing recordings, two soundmen hear disembodied voices, and find a hidden room. The chamber contains Andersson's undiscovered work, and while the bulk of the cast and crew of \"Silent Creek\" are disgusted by the snuff films, they decide not to call the police, since doing so would shut down production. Steven, the director of \"Silent Creek\", becomes obsessed with Andersson's films (which he is drawn to one night by an apparition) and begins acting deranged, claiming that \"Silent Creek\" is \"not real enough\".\n\nAfter finding Andersson's camera among the snuff films, Steve tricks Bruce (the actor playing Andersson) into killing an actress with a drill (which he said was just a prop) while he films it. The next day, the rest of the cast and crew find a note on Andersson's projector telling them to turn it on. The projector shows Steven (dressed like Andersson) disemboweling Mari while ranting about how he is \"The Auteur\". Steven then cuts a restrained Bruce in half with a chainsaw, which is shown through a television in the break room. Since the telephones and vehicles all fail to work, the remaining employees decide to make a run for it, after they look for the missing Mike. During the search, Klasu is taken after drinking drugged liquor.\n\nIn the previously sealed attic the rest of the group find a Moviola showing \"Skeleton Crew\" itself, everything up until that very moment. As everyone theorizes that it is like reality itself has become blurred and they are inside a horror film, the machinery shows Klasu in a pit with Mike. Steven throws two spiked clubs into the hole, and has Klasu and Mike fight for their freedom. The former wins, but Steven goes back on his word, and burns Klasu to death with spotlights. The next to die is Erno, who is locked in the attic and bombarded with sound, causing a fatal aneurysm.\n\nWhile he, Lisa, and Anna are looking for another way out due to the main doors being sealed, Darius is captured, strung up, and impaled by a spear attached to a camera set on a dolly. Steven then takes Anna, severs her right arm and left leg, and leaves her for Lisa to find. Anna begs for death, and Lisa comes close to mercy killing her, but upon realizing that this scenario is almost an exact recreation of the opening of \"Silent Creek\", fakes passing out. When an angered Steven approaches her, Lisa shoots him several times with a dead crew member's gun. Steven survives being shot, and upon realizing he cannot be killed due to the supernatural presence in the asylum, Lisa shoots herself in the mouth to spite Steve and ruin his film. However, Lisa survives the suicide attempt, and wakes up tied to chair, with Steven about to torture her with a blowtorch.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Steven is shown watching \"Skeleton Crew\" in a theatre. A viewer yells out \"Ah, mate, that really sucked. Weren't even any fucking tits!\"\n\n\nLightning Media released \"Skeleton Crew\" on DVD 21 July 2009.\n\nDavid Johnon of DVD Verdict wrote that it was well put together and \"different and cool\". Bill Gibron of DVD Talk rated the film 1.5/5 stars and called it \"a crime, the kind of waste of effort affront that makes you rethink your love of the genre in the first place.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "27745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27745", "title": "Standard conditions for temperature and pressure", "text": "Standard conditions for temperature and pressure\n\nStandard conditions for temperature and pressure are standard sets of conditions for experimental measurements to be established to allow comparisons to be made between different sets of data. The most used standards are those of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), although these are not universally accepted standards. Other organizations have established a variety of alternative definitions for their standard reference conditions.\n\nIn chemistry, IUPAC changed the definition of standard temperature and pressure (STP) in 1982: \n\nSTP should not be confused with the standard state commonly used in thermodynamic evaluations of the Gibbs energy of a reaction.\n\nNIST uses a temperature of 20 °C (293.15 K, 68\n °F) and an absolute pressure of 1 atm (14.696 psi, 101.325 kPa). This standard is also called normal temperature and pressure (abbreviated as NTP).\n\nThe International Standard Metric Conditions for natural gas and similar fluids are and 101.325 kPa.\n\nIn industry and commerce, standard conditions for temperature and pressure are often necessary to define the standard reference conditions to express the volumes of gases and liquids and related quantities such as the rate of volumetric flow (the volumes of gases vary significantly with temperature and pressure) – standard cubic meters per second (sm3/s), and normal cubic meters per second (nm3/s). However, many technical publications (books, journals, advertisements for equipment and machinery) simply state \"standard conditions\" without specifying them, often leading to confusion and errors. Good practice always incorporates the reference conditions of temperature and pressure.\n\nBefore 1918, many professionals and scientists using the metric system of units defined the standard reference conditions of temperature and pressure for expressing gas volumes as being and . During those same years, the most commonly used standard reference conditions for people using the imperial or U.S. customary systems was and 14.696 psi (1 atm) because it was almost universally used by the oil and gas industries worldwide. The above definitions are no longer the most commonly used in either system of units.\n\nMany different definitions of standard reference conditions are currently being used by organizations all over the world. The table below lists a few of them, but there are more. Some of these organizations used other standards in the past. For example, IUPAC has, since 1982, defined standard reference conditions as being 0 °C and 100 kPa (1 bar), in contrast to its old standard of 0 °C and 101.325 kPa (1 atm).\n\nNatural gas companies in Europe, Australia, and South America have adopted 15 °C (59 °F) and 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi) as their standard gas volume reference conditions, used as the base values for defining the standard cubic meter. Also, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) each have more than one definition of standard reference conditions in their various standards and regulations.\n\nNotes:\n\nIn aeronautics and fluid dynamics the \"International Standard Atmosphere\" (ISA) is a specification of pressure, temperature, density, and speed of sound at each altitude. The International Standard Atmosphere is representative of atmospheric conditions at mid latitudes. In the USA this information is specified the U.S. Standard Atmosphere which is identical to the \"International Standard Atmosphere\" at all altitudes up to 65,000 feet above sea level.\n\nDue to the fact that many definitions of standard temperature and pressure differ in temperature significantly from standard laboratory temperatures (e.g., 0 °C vs. ~25 °C), reference is often made to \"standard laboratory conditions\" (a term deliberately chosen to be different from the term \"standard conditions for temperature and pressure\", despite its semantic near identity when interpreted literally). However, what is a \"standard\" laboratory temperature and pressure is inevitably geography-bound, given that different parts of the world differ in climate, altitude and the degree of use of heat/cooling in the workplace. For example, schools in New South Wales, Australia use 25 °C at 100 kPa for standard laboratory conditions.\nASTM International has published Standard ASTM E41- Terminology Relating to Conditioning and hundreds of special conditions for particular materials and test methods. Other standards organizations also have specialized standard test conditions.\n\nIt is equally as important to indicate the applicable reference conditions of temperature and pressure when stating the molar volume of a gas as it is when expressing a gas volume or volumetric flow rate. Stating the molar volume of a gas without indicating the reference conditions of temperature and pressure has very little meaning and can cause confusion.\n\nThe molar volume of gases around STP and at atmospheric pressure can be calculated with an accuracy that is usually sufficient by using the ideal gas law. The molar volume of any ideal gas may be calculated at various standard reference conditions as shown below:\n\nTechnical literature can be confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the ideal gas constant \"R\", or the specific gas constant \"R\". The relationship between the two constants is \"R\" = \"R\" / \"m\", where \"m\" is the molecular mass of the gas.\n\nThe US Standard Atmosphere (USSA) uses 8.31432 m·Pa/(mol·K) as the value of \"R\". However, the USSA,1976 does recognize that this value is not consistent with the values of the Avogadro constant and the Boltzmann constant.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3198971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3198971", "title": "Urban Dictionary", "text": "Urban Dictionary\n\nUrban Dictionary is a crowdsourced online dictionary for slang words and phrases, operating under the motto \"Define Your World.\" The website was founded in 1999 by Aaron Peckham.\n\nThe site was founded in 2000 by Aaron Peckham while he was a freshman computer science major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. He launched the site to compare urban slang used by university students in different parts of California. He had previously created a spoof version of the Ask Jeeves web search engine while studying at Cal Poly but closed the website after he received an infringement letter. He created Urban Dictionary initially as a parody of actual dictionaries, which he thought tended to be \"stuffy\" and \"take themselves too seriously\".\n\nFor the first five years, the site generated revenue without making a profit, but did not appear to incur any costs. In 2003, the website gained wider attention after a news article revealed that United Kingdom (UK) high court judges had used Urban Dictionary to assist them in a case involving two rappers (the judges unsuccessfully attempted to comprehend slang language that the rappers used).\n\nBy 2009, the site listed around 4 million entries and received about 2,000 new submissions per day. In April 2009, the site registered 15 million unique visitors, while 80 percent of its monthly users were younger than 25. In July 2009, Peckham explained to the \"New York Times\" that Urban Dictionary is the \"anti-Wikipedia\", and its goal of neutrality, as \"Every single word on here [Urban Dictionary] is written by someone with a point of view, with a personal experience of the word in the entry.\"\n\nThe website was referenced in a 2011 District Court complaint by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents to document the meaning of the vulgarism \"murk\", as used in a criminal threat.\n\nOver a 30-day period in March and April 2011, 67,000 people wrote 76,000 new definitions for Urban Dictionary, while 3,500 volunteer editors were registered. In an April 2011 \"Guardian\" article titled \"In praise of urban dictionaries\", Peckham revealed an overview of 10 rules that he had devised for the site's content: \"Publish celebrity names, but reject 'real life' names. Reject nonsense, inside jokes or anything submitted in capital letters. Racial and sexual slurs are allowed, racist and sexist entries are not.\"\n\nAt the start of 2014, 32-year-old Peckham resided in San Francisco, U.S., and, while he did not reveal exact figures, he informed the media that the site was \"stable and growing\", and generated enough profit for both him and the site's maintenance. Peckham continued as the site's sole employee and maintained that he was not interested in venture funding or an IPO: \"It is weird to be in Silicon Valley and want to be independent and not be on track to I.P.O. or want an acquisition ... But I think something special would be sacrificed if that were to happen.\" The site's audience at this stage was predominantly male and aged between 15 and 24.\n\nAs of January 5, 2014, 50% of the site’s traffic was mobile, the iPhone app had been downloaded nearly three million times. Although English entries were by far the most common prior to the multilingual transition, some words from languages that have been incorporated or assimilated into English-speaking societies were published, including those from Swahili, Arabic, and the Fula languages.\n\nIn the context of Urban Dictionary, \"definitions\" include not only literal definitions, but also descriptions. As such, \"to define\" a word or phrase on Urban Dictionary does not necessarily entail providing a strict definition; merely a description of some aspect of the word or phrase could suffice for inclusion in the dictionary.\n\nOriginally, Urban Dictionary was intended as a dictionary of slang, or cultural words or phrases, not typically found in standard dictionaries, but it is now used to define any word or phrase. Words or phrases on Urban Dictionary may have multiple definitions, usage examples, and tags. Some examples include, but are not limited to \"Angry Hitler\" or \"Russian Candy Cane.\"\n\nVisitors to Urban Dictionary may submit definitions without registering, but they must provide a valid email address.\n\nBy default, each definition is accepted or rejected based on the number of \"Publish\" or \"Don't Publish\" votes it receives from volunteer editors. The editors are not bound by any criteria for the approval or rejection of definitions. Editors previously needed a valid email address, but it is no longer required, as three options are provided for new words: \"Add It!,\" \"Keep Out!,\" and \"I Can't Decide.\" However, a Facebook or Gmail account is required to post a new definition. Editors are not allowed to edit entries for spelling, wording or punctuation.\n\nOne objection about content is that the very name \"Urban Dictionary\" misleadingly implies that urbanites in different cities share a common vocabulary. A more serious objection is that definitions can be trumped up for the sole purpose of embarrassing people.\n\nAlthough the explicit nature of many definitions on the site has led to objections, the site contains many non-explicit definitions. For example, the word \"massive\" is Jamaican in origin and is used to describe a group or collective. Peckham responded to the issue, stating that people may not be able to understand the meaning of such words without the aid of Urban Dictionary.\n\nAt the start of 2014, the dictionary had over seven million definitions, while 2,000 new entries were being added daily.\n\nIn November 2014, the Advertise page of the website stated that, on a monthly basis, Urban Dictionary averages 72 million impressions and 18 million unique readers. According to Peckham in January 2014, just under 40% of the site’s traffic is international, while the site's audience was predominantly male and aged between 15 and 24.\n\nAs of 2013, Urban Dictionary has been used in several court cases to define slang terms that are not found in dictionaries. For example, the slang term \"jack\" was used in order to define the name the defendant on trial used for their team, \"the jack boys.\" Urban Dictionary was also used in a District Court complaint where a man posted a threat on a gun exchange Facebook page. The crowd-sourced dictionary was also used in a sexual harassment court case in Tennessee to define the phrase \"to nut\" as \"to ejaculate\".\n\nThe dictionary is also used for fun in various cases across the globe. The background score of a 1996 Tamil movie named Coimbatore Mappillai starring Vijay had a vocal theme music using the term, 'Shrooov' for the villain of the movie played by actor Karan. Decades after the movie was released, fans started to troll Karan for his infamous facial expressions and screen presence. At that time, 'Shrooov' was added to the dictionary to troll Karan in a very sarcastic way.\n\nIn the United States, some state Departments of Motor Vehicles refer to Urban Dictionary in determining if certain license plates are appropriate or not. For example, a man in Las Vegas was allowed to keep \"HOE\" as his license plate after managing to convince the state, with the use of Urban Dictionary, that it meant \"TAHOE\", as in the vehicle made by Chevrolet, since that was already taken.\n\nIBM had programmed Watson to use Urban Dictionary. After having all the words and definitions incorporated into Watson, it began responding to researchers' questions with profanity, leading the programmers to remove it from its memory and adding an additional filter to prevent it from swearing in the future.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "319632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319632", "title": "Verisign", "text": "Verisign\n\nVerisign, Inc. is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure, including two of the Internet's thirteen root nameservers, the authoritative registry for the , , and generic top-level domains and the and country-code top-level domains, and the back-end systems for the , , and top-level domains. Verisign also offers a range of security services, including managed DNS, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation and cyber-threat reporting.\n\nIn 2010, Verisign sold its authentication business unit – which included Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, public key infrastructure (PKI), Verisign Trust Seal, and Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) services – to Symantec for $1.28 billion. The deal capped a multi-year effort by Verisign to narrow its focus to its core infrastructure and security business units. Symantec later sold this unit to DigiCert in 2017.\n\nVerisign's former chief financial officer (CFO) Brian Robins announced in August 2010 that the company would move from its original location of Mountain View, California, to Dulles in Northern Virginia by 2011 due to 95% of the company's business being on the East Coast. The company is incorporated in Delaware.\n\nVerisign was founded in 1995 as a spin-off of the RSA Security certification services business. The new company received licenses to key cryptographic patents held by RSA and a time-limited non-compete agreement. The new company served as a certificate authority (CA) and its initial mission was \"providing trust for the Internet and Electronic Commerce through our Digital Authentication services and products\". Prior to selling its certificate business to Symantec in 2010, Verisign had more than 3 million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications, making it the largest CA in the world.\n\nIn 2000, Verisign acquired Network Solutions, which operated the , and TLDs under agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the United States Department of Commerce. Those core registry functions formed the basis for Verisign's naming division, which is now the company's largest and most significant business unit. In 2002, Verisign was charged with violation of the Securities Exchange Act. Verisign divested the Network Solutions retail (domain name registrar) business in 2003, retaining the domain name registry (wholesale) function as its core Internet addressing business.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2010, Verisign reported revenue of $681 million, up 10% from $616 million in 2009. Verisign operates two businesses, Naming Services, which encompasses the operation of top-level domains and critical Internet infrastructure, and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services, which encompasses DDoS mitigation, managed DNS and threat intelligence.\n\nOn August 9, 2010, Symantec completed its approximately $1.28 billion acquisition of Verisign's authentication business, including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate Services, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Services, the Verisign Trust Services, the Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) Authentication Service, and the majority stake in Verisign Japan. The deal capped a multi-year effort by Verisign to narrow its focus to its core infrastructure and security business units. Following ongoing controversies regarding Symantec's handling of certificate validation, which culminated in Google untrusting Symantec-issued certificates in its Chrome web browser, Symantec sold this unit to DigiCert in 2017.\n\nVerisign's share price tumbled in early 2014, hastened by the U.S. government's announcement that it would \"relinquish oversight of the Internet's domain-naming system to a non-government entity\". Ultimately the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers chose to continue VeriSign's role as the root zone maintainer and the two entered into a new contract in 2016.\n\nVerisign's core business is its naming services division. The division operates the authoritative domain name registries for two of the Internet's most important top-level domains, and . It is also the contracted registry operator for the .name and .gov top-level domains as well as the country code top-level domains (Cocos Islands) and (Tuvalu). In addition, Verisign is the primary technical subcontractor for the , and top-level domains for their respective registry operators, which are non-profit organizations; in this role Verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and hosts the domains from their domain servers. Registry operators are the \"wholesalers\" of Internet domain names, while domain name registrars act as the “retailers”, working directly with consumers to register a domain name address.\n\nVerisign also operates two of the Internet's thirteen \"root servers\" which are identified by the letters A-M (Verisign operates the “A” and “J” root servers). The root servers form the top of the hierarchical Domain Name System that supports most modern Internet communication. Verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by ICANN via IANA and approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the A root server, but now they are distributed to all thirteen servers via a separate distribution system which Verisign maintains. Verisign is the only one of the 12 root server operators to operate more than one of the thirteen root nameservers. The A and J root servers are \"anycasted” and are no longer operated from any of the company's own datacenters as a means to increase redundancy and availability and mitigate the threat of a single point of failure. In 2016 the Department of Commerce ended its role in managing the Internet's DNS and transferred full control to ICANN. While this initially negatively impacted VeriSign's stock, ICANN eventually chose to contract with Verisign to continue its role as the root zone maintainer.\n\nVeriSign's naming services division dates back to 1993 when Network Solutions was awarded a contract by the National Science Foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the Internet's domain name registrations. Network Solutions was the sole registrar for all of the Internet's non governmental generic top-level domains until 1998 when ICANN was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented. As a result of these new policies, Network Solutions divided itself into two divisions. The NSI Registry division was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate and was separated from the customer-facing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars. The divisions were even geographically split with the NSI Registry moving from the corporate headquarters in Herndon, Virginia, to nearby Dulles, Virginia. In 2000, VeriSign purchased Network Solutions taking over its role in the Internet DNS. The NSI Registry division eventually became VeriSign's naming services division while the remainder of Network Solutions was later sold by Verisign in 2003 to Pivotal Equity Group.\n\nVerisign also offers trust seal products for e-commerce sites, competing in this space with TrustE, BBB Online, and WebTrust.\n\nFollowing the sale of its authentication services division in 2010, Verisign relocated from its former headquarters in Mountain View, California, to the headquarters of the naming division in Sterling, Virginia (originally NSI Registry's headquarters). Verisign began shopping that year for a new permanent home shortly after moving. They signed a lease for 12061 Bluemont Way in Reston, the former Sallie Mae headquarters, in 2010 and decided to purchase the building in September 2011. They have since terminated their lease of their current space in two buildings at Lakeside@Loudoun Technology Center. The company completed its move at the end of November 2011. The new headquarters is located in the Reston Town Center development which has become a major commercial and business hub for the region. In addition to its Reston headquarters, Verisign owns three data center properties. One at 22340 Dresden Street in Dulles, Virginia not far from its corporate headquarters (within the large Broad Run Technology Park), one at 21 Boulden Circle in New Castle, Delaware, and a third in Fribourg, Switzerland. Their three data centers are mirrored so that a disaster at one data center has a minimal impact on operations. Verisign also leases an office suite in downtown Washington, D.C., on K street where its government relations office is located. It also has leased server space in numerous internet data centers around the world where the DNS constellation resolution sites are located, mostly at major internet peering facilities. One such facility is at the Equinix Ashburn Datacenter in Ashburn, Virginia, one of the world's largest datacenters and internet transit hubs.\n\nIn January 2001, Verisign mistakenly issued two Class 3 code signing certificates to an individual claiming to be an employee of Microsoft. The mistake was not discovered and the certificates were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit. Because Verisign code-signing certificates do not specify a Certificate Revocation List Distribution Point, there was no way for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked, placing Microsoft's customers at risk. Microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent.\n\nIn 2002, Verisign was sued for domain slamming – transferring domains from other registrars to themselves by making the registrants believe they were merely renewing their domain name. Although they were found not to have broken the law, they were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or claim that a transfer was actually a renewal.\n\nIn September 2003, Verisign introduced a service called Site Finder, which redirected Web browsers to a search service when users attempted to go to non-existent or domain names. ICANN asserted that Verisign had overstepped the terms of its contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce, which in essence grants Verisign the right to operate the DNS for and , and Verisign shut down the service. Subsequently, Verisign filed a lawsuit against ICANN in February 2004, seeking to gain clarity over what services it could offer in the context of its contract with ICANN. The claim was moved from federal to California state court in August 2004. In late 2005 Verisign and ICANN announced a proposed settlement which defined a process for the introduction of new registry services in the registry. The documents concerning these settlements are available at ICANN.org. The ICANN comments mailing list archive documents some of the criticisms that have been raised regarding the settlement. Additionally Verisign was involved in the matter decided by the Ninth circuit.\n\nIn keeping with ICANN's charter to introduce competition to the domain name marketplace, Verisign agreed to give up its operation of top-level domain in 2003 in exchange for a continuation of its contract to operate , which, at the time had more than 34 million registered addresses.\n\nIn mid-2005, the existing contract for the operation of expired and five companies, including Verisign, bid for management of it. Verisign enlisted numerous IT and telecom heavyweights including Microsoft, IBM, Sun Microsystems, MCI, and others, to assert that Verisign had a perfect record operating . They proposed Verisign continue to manage the DNS due to its critical importance as the domain underlying numerous \"backbone\" network services. Verisign was also aided by the fact that several of the other bidders were foreign based, which raised concerns in national security circles. On June 8, 2005, ICANN announced that Verisign had been approved to operate until 2011. More information on the bidding process is available at ICANN. On July 1, 2011, ICANN announced that VeriSign's approval to operate .net was extended another six years, until 2017.\n\nIn February 2012 Verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in 2010. Verisign stated that the breach did not impact the Domain Name System (DNS) that they maintain, but would not provide details about the loss of data. Verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an October 2011 SEC filing.\n\nBecause of the lack of details provided by Verisign, it was not clear whether the breach impacted the Certificate Signing business, acquired by Symantec in late 2010. According to Oliver Lavery, the Director of Security and Research for nCircle \"Can we trust any site using Verisign SSL certificates? Without more clarity, the logical answer is no”.\n\nOn November 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (U.S. ICE) issued seizure orders against 82 web sites with Internet addresses that were reported to be involved in the illegal sale and distribution of counterfeit goods. As registry operator for , Verisign performed the required takedowns of the 82 sites under order from law enforcement. \"InformationWeek\" reported that \"Verisign will say only that it received sealed court orders directing certain actions to be taken with respect to specific domain names\". The removal of the 82 websites was cited as an impetus for the launch of \"the Dot-P2P Project\" in order to create a decentralized DNS service without centralized registry operators. Following the disappearance of WikiLeaks during the following week and its forced move to wikileaks.ch, a Swiss domain, the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned of the dangers of having key pieces of Internet infrastructure such as DNS name translation under corporate control.\n\n"}

It is calculated using a points system and published following major World Archery tournaments.\n\nThe ranking system was first developed in 2001, and calculation method updated in 2010. At present, rankings are maintained for:\n\nFrom 2006, rankings were calculated for Field Archery, but since 2012 are no longer maintained.\n\nEach archer or team earns a ranking score for each competition. The ranking scores are calculated through a combination of the ranking factor of the tournament (\"Ranking Factor\") and points based on the competitor's final position in the competition (\"Ranking Score\"). The archer's four highest ranking scores are then combined to form their total score (\"Added Ranking Score\"), which forms the basis of the ranking list.\n\nOnly results achieved at official ranking events can count towards the overall rankings. These events include the major World Archery Federation tournaments (Olympics, World Archery Championships, World Cup), and other international, regional and national events that have applied and been approved for ranking status.\n\nThe tournament ranking factor is calculated on the basis of three sub-factors, Quality, Quantity and Period, which are multiplied together to produce the overall tournament factor. The factor can vary between disciplines at the same event (e.g., the recurve and compound disciplines at the World Championships may have different Ranking Factors).\n\nFor instance, the Ranking Factor of a tournament for individuals with 60 archers, of whom 10 are in the top 50, that took place 18 months ago, would be:\n\n2.5 \"(\"Quality\": 9-12 top 50 archers)\" x\n\n0.9 \"(\"Quantity\": 33-64 archers)\" x\n\n0.5 \"(\"Period\": other tournament 12-24 months ago)\" =\n\n1.125\n\nThe Quality sub-factor takes into account the level of competition at the tournament. A score is assigned based on the prestige of the event, for the major World Archery Federation tournaments, and the number of top archers or teams at other competitions (defined as individuals ranked in the top 50 or teams ranked in the top 16). The quality factor points are assigned as follows:\n\nIndividual\n\nTeam\n\nThe Quantity sub-factor assigns a score based on the number of archers competing as follows:\n\nIndividual\nTeam\n\nThe Period sub-factor is dependent on when the competition took place, allowing the Ranking Factor to emphasise the most recent tournaments as follows:\n\nRanking Points are awarded based on the team or competitor's final position at the competition. This is then multiplied by the Ranking Factor to produce the overall Ranking Score for that team or competitor at that tournament. For instance, an archer who finished 4th in the competition used in the example above would receive the following Ranking Score:\n\n1.125 \"(\"Ranking Factor\")\" x\n\n12 \"(\"Ranking Points\": 4th place)\" =\n\n13.5\n\nA team or competitor's best four Ranking Scores are then combined to produce the Added Ranking Score, which forms the basis of the rankings list. No more than two Ranking Scores whose period factor is lower than 1 may be used to calculate the Added Ranking Score.\n\nRanking Points are awarded as follows:\n\nIndividual\nTeam\n\n\nRankings at 21 NOV 2018\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nRankings at 18 July 2016\n\nThe following archers have achieved the number one individual position since the inception of the rankings in 2001:\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n"}

It was compiled in 1621 by Mao Yuanyi (茅元儀 \"Máo Yuányí\"; 1594–1640?), an officer of waterborne troops in the Ming Dynasty. The \"Wubei Zhi\" contains 240 volumes, 10405 pages, and more than 200,000 Chinese characters, which makes it the longest book in Chinese history regarding military affairs.\n\n\"Wubei Zhi\" consists of five sections, \"Bing Jue Ping\", \"Zhan Lue Kao\", \"Zhen Lian Zhi\", \"Jun Zi Sheng\", and \"Zhan Du Zai\".\n\nContaining 18 chapters, this section includes military theories such as those of Sun Tzu, some dating back to the last years of Eastern Zhou Dynasty, more than 1,800 years before the editor.\n\nThis section comprises 31 chapters, and describes more than 600 specific examples of battle that took place between the Eastern Zhou Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty. Among those are Battle of Maling, Battle of Red Cliffs, which is a classic example of defeating overpowering enemy.\n\nThis section of the book, of 41 chapters, introduces different ways of training troops including infantry, cavalry and chariots, as well as individual martial arts training with different weapons such as the spear and Dao.\nThis section is divided into 55 categories, covering a variety of contents related to wartime logistics, such as marching, encamping, troops arraying, transmitting orders, attacking and defending cities, and provision of food, weapons, health care and transportation, to name but a few.\n\nIn this section, with 96 chapters, the author introduces aspects of weather and geographic features that are related to war fighting, as well as traditional Chinese methods of divination, formation, and finally marine navigation. Included into this section is the so-called \"Mao Kun map\", the unique surviving map representing the Pacific and Indian Ocean shipping routes used by the fleets of Zheng He.\n\nBeing known as \"a military encyclopedia in ancient China\", \"Wubei Zhi\" is one of the most influential works in Chinese history on warfare. It is a rare source of some compass maps and designs and some weapons has contributed enormously to corresponding areas, and it also gives an account of ancient Chinese military theories and Chinese militarists' thoughts.\n\n\n\n"}
