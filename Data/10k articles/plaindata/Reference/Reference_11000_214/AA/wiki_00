Bod-inc. stands out among incunabula catalogues for its detailed listing of the contents of each edition being described. It was published on 7 July 2005 by Oxford University Press in six volumes.\n\nL. A. Sheppard began work on a catalogue of Bodleian incunabula in 1955 but he left Oxford in 1971 before the work could be completed; his slip catalogue was bound into seven volumes and served as a base of information for the Bod-inc. project. In the mid-1980s, Kristian Jensen, as the Bodleian Library's specialist in early printed books, decided that a new catalogue was needed and that its descriptions should follow the standards of detail expected in catalogues of medieval manuscripts. Early in the project, Jensen was assisted by Bettina Wagner and Alan Coates beginning in 1992. Work on Bod-inc. was undertaken over the thirteen-year period between January 1992 and January 2005 by a team of cataloguers. From 1992 to 1999, Jensen headed the cataloguing team; he was succeeded by Alan Coates who headed the project from 2000 to its completion, during which time Jensen served as a consultant. Bod-inc. was published in the 400th anniversary year of the publication of the first catalogue of the Bodleian Library in 1605.\n\nThe aims of Bod-inc. are summarized in the catalogue's introduction:\n\nBod-inc. is divided into six volumes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a non-profit publication whose sales benefit the Greek charity Boroume (\"we can!\"), supporting food supplies both to refugees in Greece and to Greeks suffering poverty due to the country's economic crisis. The idea of publishing a book of this kind originated with the founder of Boroume, Xenia Papastavrou, according to Maria Karamitsos. Daisy Dunn, reviewing \"A Taste of Greece\" in \"The Spectator\", commented that \"Greece’s food crisis has wrought such feelings of exclusion and isolation as can only exist in a culture that has always placed food at the centre of civilisation. Over 17 per cent of the population of Greece is said to be suffering from food insecurity.\"\n\nThe book is a collection of favourite Greek recipes contributed by 41 celebrities, chefs and food writers, all of them connected with Greece in different ways. Contributors are arranged alphabetically, but the list includes celebrities such as Arianna Huffington, Jim Gianopulos of 20th Century Fox, writers Margaret Atwood, Victoria Hislop and Sofka Zinovieff, conductor Zubin Mehta, broadcasters Bob Costas and Nikos Aliagas, photographer Robert McCabe, actresses Rita Wilson and Olympia Dukakis; design and food entrepreneurs such as Carole Bamford, Dan and Dean Caten, Tatiana Casiraghi; chefs Michel Roux, Nobu Matsuhisa, Cat Cora and Nikos Ntanos who worked on recipes for several other contributors; food writers Diana Farr Louis (who edited the book), Diane Kochilas, Laurie Constantino, Rachel and Andrew Dalby, Peter Minaki. Among the contributors are several members of the ousted Greek royal family now once again living in Greece: Queen Anne-Marie, her sister-in-law Princess Irene, her son Prince Nikolaos and his wife Princess Tatiana who coordinated the project. When she was still Tatiana Blatnik she had worked for Diane von Furstenberg, who is a contributor to the book alongside other contacts from the fashion world, Mary Katrantzou, Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti, as noted by Sharon Edelson writing in \"WWD\".\n\n\"A Taste of Greece\" was published internationally in July 2016 by TeNeues Media, based in Germany, with branches in the United States, United Kingdom and France.\n\n"}

Several meta-analyses have shown contradictory results between experimenter’s allegiance (EA) and assessment effect sizes in favor of the preferred conclusions.\n\nAlso, we should not include meta-analysis that examines a combination of psychotherapy and non-psychotherapy treatments (e.g., medication) if it was directly compared with another type of psychotherapy or meta-analysis evaluating direct comparisons between different types of psychotherapy. Meta-analysis assessing non-verbal techniques, web-based treatments and non-specific or miscellaneous treatments (e.g., yoga, dietary advice, recreation, biofeedback, etc.) should also be excluded.\n\nMost often forensic experts indulge in having formed a biased opinion of the assessment in favor of the party retaining their services as opposed to having it objective by means of the evidence available.\n\nThe analysis on direct comparisons did not address the quality of studies and neither did it have any significant association between allegiant and non-allegiant studies; whereas significant differences were observed in cases where treatment \"integrity\" was not evaluated.\n\nIn legal cases, evaluator attitudes and other attributes may systematically influence from whom evaluators are willing to accept a referral. Filtering and selection effects in adversarial settings have been assumed to exist, but with few empirical tests of the hypothesis to date. Current studies demonstrate that these experts have \"preexisting\" biases that may affect for whom they are willing to work in the adversarial system–thus, likely amplifying the effects of the system-induced biases when layered with preexisting expert biases.\n\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analysis are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users.\n\nSince the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported.\n\nRealizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analysis of evaluations of health care interventions.\n\nThe PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, they have explained the meaning and rationale for each checklist item & have include an example of good reporting, while also where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Tsarist era, it was the room from which imperial processions through the state rooms began. The double doors were designed to be on a straight axis through the principal state rooms and ultimately the Jordan Staircase, forming an enfilade. Thus it was here the Romanov family often assembled, in private, before state receptions and occasions. The privacy of the room was not compromised by the small private courtyard (\"see plan\") from which windows, which once led to the , admitted light.\n\nDesigned by Alexander Briullov following the Winter Palace fire of 1837, the room is decorated in the neoclassical style fashionable in the early 19th century, known as Pompeian. A ceiling, with a low segmental barrel vault with bands of shallow coffering stuccoed with classical motifs, is seemingly supported by a colonnade of engaged fluted Greek Doric columns with enriched echinus molding and no bases. A Greek key fret enriches the entablature that runs without a break round the room. The only furnishings were the dining chairs of Greek klismos type, formally ranged round the walls. When the Imperial family were to dine here, dining tables would be brought in, covered and laid, then removed afterwards.\n\nThe various geographically confused names of the Arabian Hall derive, not from any peculiar contents, but from the four official pseudo-bodyguards of the Tsar who travelled from palace to palace with the Imperial family. They were four \"massive Negroes\" fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes. Wherever the Tsar was, they guarded the doors between the private and official world. They had no other function other than to open and close doors; their sudden, but silent appearance into a room was the signal that heralded the immediate appearance of the Tsar or Tsaritsa.\n\nAlthough the guards were referred to as the Ethiopians or Blackamoors, from 1896, at least one was an American. Jim Hercules holidayed in the USA and always returned with jars of guava jelly for the Imperial children.\n\nToday, the empty hall is occasionally used for special exhibitions held by the State Hermitage Museum.\n\n\n"}

Its site, which overlooks one of four public squares platted in Austin in 1839, was obtained from the Texas Legislature in 1913 for construction of a public library. The Renaissance Revival structure, completed in 1933, was designed by local architect J.

The building also contains work by several Austin craftsmen, including ironworker Fortunat Wiegl, wood-carver Peter Mansbendel, and fresco artist Harold \"Bubi\" Jessen.\n\nThe Austin History Center celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2005. As of 2008 it houses thousands of documents, photographs, maps, artifacts, and personal histories.

{"id": "151461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151461", "title": "Austin Powers in Goldmember", "text": "Austin Powers in Goldmember\n\nAustin Powers in Goldmember is a 2002 American spy action comedy film directed by Jay Roach, and the third installment in the \"Austin Powers\" film series. It stars Mike Myers in the title role, and was co-written by him and Michael McCullers. Myers also plays the roles of Dr. Evil, Goldmember, and Fat Bastard. The movie co-stars Beyoncé in her theatrical film debut, as well as Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Michael York, Verne Troyer, Michael Caine, Mindy Sterling and Fred Savage. There are a number of cameo appearances including Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey, Britney Spears, Quincy Jones, Tom Cruise, Danny DeVito, Katie Couric, Gwyneth Paltrow, John Travolta, Nathan Lane, and The Osbournes.\n\nIn a self-parody of the \"Austin Powers\" series, there is a film within the film in the opening. Austin Powers is featured in a bio-pic called \"Austinpussy\" (a parody of the James Bond film \"Octopussy\") directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise as Austin Powers, Gwyneth Paltrow as Dixie Normous, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny DeVito as Mini-Me, and John Travolta as Goldmember.\n\n\"Goldmember\" is a loose parody of the James Bond films \"Goldfinger\" and \"You Only Live Twice\", also incorporating elements of \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", \"Live and Let Die\", \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"GoldenEye\". The film grossed $296.6 million at the box office internationally.\n\nIn his new headquarters behind the famous Hollywood sign, Dr. Evil plans to travel back in time to 1975 and bring back Johan van der Smut, aka \"Goldmember\", who developed a cold fusion unit for a tractor beam which Dr. Evil names \"Preparation H\". He intends to use the tractor beam to pull a meteor into the Earth, striking the polar ice caps and causing a global flood. Moments after this plan is revealed, Austin Powers and the British Secret Service attack the base and arrest Dr. Evil. Austin is knighted for his services, but is disappointed when his father, the famous super-spy Nigel Powers, does not attend the event. Basil Exposition later informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped, and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their genitalia painted gold.\n\nAustin visits the imprisoned Dr. Evil, who tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction. Time-travelling to 1975, Austin infiltrates Goldmember's roller disco club and is reunited with his former lover, FBI agent Foxxy Cleopatra, who is undercover as a disco singer. With Foxxy's help, Austin locates his father, but is unable to rescue him. Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine into the present day. Foxxy wants revenge on Goldmember for murdering her partner, and accompanies Austin in his pursuit. In the present, Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence mole named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near Tokyo. Austin and Foxxy travel to Tokyo and confront Fat Bastard, who is now a sumo wrestler, but still does work for Dr. Evil. Fat Bastard explains that a Japanese business man, Mr. Roboto, is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember.\n\nAustin and Foxxy later meet with Mr. Roboto, who pleads ignorance about Nigel's whereabouts. Unconvinced, Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto hands Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes with the command unit and flees to Dr. Evil's submarine. Unable to settle their differences, Nigel and Austin part ways when they disagree on how to deal with the situation. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil's son, Scott Evil, has become increasingly evil in an attempt to prove himself to his father, to the point that he too is going bald. Scott presents his father with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads, a request that had gone unfulfilled in . Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son; the rejected Mini-Me defects and joins Austin.\n\nAustin, Foxxy and Mini-Me (now a miniature version of Austin) infiltrate the submarine, but Austin is captured. Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy has stolen the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are both his sons, telling them that when they were babies, he and their mother took them to Belgium for a family holiday and he stepped out of the car to have a tinkle in the bushes when their car exploded. Dr. Evil tells him that his parents died in that car accident, but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought at first that only Austin survived and didn't know that Dr. Evil survived too until after the two Belgians made him evil. Dr. Evil and Austin embrace, enraging Scott, who flees to pursue his own vengeance, whilst Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his pants to reveal his gold-covered genitals to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world. The heroes arrest Goldmember, who turns to the camera to reveal the entire string of events was adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg, starring Tom Cruise as Austin, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny DeVito as Mini-Me, and John Travolta as Goldmember. Austin, Foxxy, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Nigel are in the audience of a Hollywood theater watching the film. Upon exiting the theater they run into Fat Bastard, now thinner but flabby, thanks to the Subway diet. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, in Dr. Evil's Hollywood lair, Scott – now completely bald, dressed like and laughing in a manner similar to his father – declares he will get his revenge on Austin and begins dancing like Michael Jackson.\n\n\nThe title of the film, \"Goldmember\", led to legal action being taken by MGM, the distributors of the \"James Bond\" film franchise, that briefly led to the film's title being removed from promotional material and trailers. The dispute was quickly resolved and the film title remained unchanged on the provision that the film would include trailers in its cinema releases for the then-upcoming James Bond film, \"Die Another Day\", and \"\".\n\nAustin Powers (Myers), having conquered the '90s and the '60s, travels back to the 1970s and teams up with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) to thwart a new villain, Goldmember (Myers once again). Myers also plays Fat Bastard for the second time, this time parodying the kind of \"wire fight\" seen in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\". The film also stars Beyoncé Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (parodying blaxploitation heroines, primarily Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones, as well as Christie Love when she says, \"You're under arrest, sugah!\"), Michael York, reprising the role of Basil Exposition, and Verne Troyer in his second appearance as Mini-Me. The film also introduced a new character named Number 3 (a.k.a. the Mole), who is portrayed by former child star Fred Savage. Clint Howard plays a radar operator in all three films. Michael Caine guest stars as Austin's father, Nigel; this role was inspired by \"The Ipcress File\", a 1965 film starring Caine.\n\nFour actors who appeared in the earlier films play different characters in \"Goldmember\". Rob Lowe, who played the friend of a dead guard in \"International Man of Mystery\", reprises his role as a younger Number 2 from \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\", while Neil Mullarkey (quartermaster clerk in \"International Man of Mystery\") and Eric Winzenried (army private soldier in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\") appear as the Physician and Henchman Sailor in the Sick Bay. Michael McDonald (the Virtucon guard who got run over by a steamroller in \"International Man of Mystery\" and a NATO soldier in \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\") appears as the royal guard.\n\nJohan van der Smut, better known as Goldmember, is a fictional villain played by Myers (John Travolta plays the character in a cameo at the end of the film). The name was inspired by the James Bond villain Auric Goldfinger. Goldmember's Dutch origins and character traits were, according to Myers, inspired by an episode of the HBO TV series \"Real Sex\" featuring a Dutchman who operated a \"sex barn\" north of Rotterdam. The man's distinct forms of expression caught Myers' attention while he was writing.\n\n\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" took in £5,585,978 in the United Kingdom on its opening weekend. In the United States, it broke the opening weekend record for a spoof movie, surpassing the previous Austin Powers film. The film grossed US$73 million on its opening weekend, and grossed a total of $213 million in the United States, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" was released on video and DVD on December 3, 2002. The DVD was released under the \"Infinifilm\" label, and was re-packed in 2011 as part of the \"Austin Powers 3 Film Collection\"\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 54%, based on 183 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \"While the narrative structure is messy and doesn't make much sense, the third installment of the \"Austin Powers\" franchise contains enough inspired bits to entertain\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nMyers was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the third time, but lost against Daveigh Chase for her role as Samara Morgan in \"The Ring\", making it the first time Myers lost the award. However, he did win the award for Best Comedic Performance, making it the first time he won the award, having previously lost twice for the first two films.\n\nThe song \"Hey Goldmember\" interpolates and is a parody of four 1970s disco songs formed into a medley; \"Sing a Song\" by Earth, Wind & Fire, \"Get Down Tonight\", \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\", and \"That's the Way (I Like It)\", all by KC and the Sunshine Band.\n\n\"Sing a Song\" is not listed in the credits but is sung by Beyoncé at the beginning.\n\n\nIn October 2005, in an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Mike Myers discussed the possibility of studio sources moving forward with a fourth film. \"There is hope!\". \"We're all circling and talking to each other. I miss doing the characters.\" In May 2007, in an interview with IGN, \"So no more \"Austin Powers\"?\" was asked, and Myers replied, \"No, no, there is a fully conceived idea for a fourth and I can just say that it's from Dr. Evil's point of view. So if you balanced how much of it was Austin with Dr. Evil, it's more about Dr. Evil than Austin\". Also, in the audio commentary from the DVD release of \"Goldmember\", Myers revealed that in the fourth film, Fat Bastard would return and regain the weight that he lost in \"Goldmember\".\n\nIn May 2007, at the \"Shrek the Third\" première, Mike Myers announced that a fourth \"Austin Powers\" film was planned, but that it would focus more on Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He also said that he'd start work on it after he started work on \"The Love Guru\", which became a box office bomb. In February 2008, it was announced that Jay Roach would return as director. In April 2008, it was reported that Gisele Bündchen had been offered a role in the film. However, Seth Green, who played Scott Evil, state that there was any script at the moment and that \"Austin Powers 4\" would be made if a script is written and approved. In June 2008, in an interview, when asked about another \"Austin Powers\" film, Myers stated, \"I have an idea, and again it's one of those things that will emerge or it won't.\" In July 2008, Mike Myers stated that he had begun writing \"Austin Powers 4\", and that the plot is \"really about Dr. Evil and his son.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Jay Roach indicated to MTV that Myers is working on ideas for a fourth film. In August 2011, Mike Myers revealed he would return, and had begun writing a script for a fourth installment. In September 2013, when asked about the future of \"Austin Powers\", Myers answered \"I'm still figuring that out.\" In September 2015, Verne Troyer expressed his desire to return as Mini-Me if he was asked to do so.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, Roach was asked about the fourth \"Austin Powers\" film during an interview with Larry King, and he stated the ideas for the fourth film that he and Myers have are good and interesting. In August 2016, in a telephone interview, Mike Myers stated \"Everything is being negotiated and worked out and all that stuff\" in regards to the fourth installment of the \"Austin Powers\" film series.\n\nIn April 2017, as the twentieth anniversary approached for \"\", Mike Myers claimed he would love to do another \"Austin Powers\" film, but audiences would \"just have to see\". Two days later, Roach stated that a fourth film would only occur if Myers creates a good story for it. On May 26, 2017, Troyer stated that Mini-Me will reveal that he can speak in the fourth movie. However, Troyer died on April 21, 2018, delaying production of a fourth film and precluding him from reprising his role as Mini-Me. On May 9, 2018, Myers reiterated his interest in making a fourth \"Austin Powers\", stating that it would be fun, also hinting that some tribute to Troyer might be included.\n\n\n"}

This meant for the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP), that for the first time workers could vote and that representatives from the party, ten years after its foundation, could enter the Belgian parliament. With a doctrinarian charter the program of the socialist party was presented to the electorate. Out of several ideas Émile Vandervelde chose this proposition, which was adopted on the Easter Congress of the Socialist Party, at Quaregnon on 25-26 March 1894, and which became known as the \"Charter of Quaregnon\".

{"id": "541067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=541067", "title": "Crone", "text": "Crone\n\nThe crone is a stock character in folklore and fairy tale, an old woman. In some stories, she is disagreeable, malicious, or sinister in manner, often with magical or supernatural associations that can make her either helpful or obstructing. The Crone is also an archetypal figure, a Wise Woman. As a character type, the crone shares characteristics with the hag.\n\nThe word \"crone\" is a less common synonym for \"old woman\", and is more likely to appear in reference to traditional narratives than in contemporary everyday usage. The word became further specialized as the third aspect of the Triple Goddess popularized by Robert Graves and subsequently in some forms of neopaganism, particularly Wicca in which she symbolizes the Dark Goddess, the dark of the moon, the end of a cycle; together with the Mother and the Maiden she represents part of the circle of life. In New Age and feminist spiritual circles, a \"Croning\" is a ritual rite of passage into an era of wisdom, freedom, and personal power. Some feminist authors have defined the crone archetype in a positive light, as a powerful and wise old woman.\n\nAs a noun, \"crone\" entered the English language around the year 1390, deriving from the Anglo-French word \"carogne\" (an insult), itself deriving from the Old North French \"charogne\", \"caroigne\", meaning a disagreeable woman (literally meaning \"carrion\"). Prior to the entrance of the word into English, the surname Hopcrone is recorded (around 1323–1324).\n\nIn Joseph Campbell's classic work \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", the first encounter of the hero on his journey is with a protective figure who provides him with amulets or magic devices against the dangers he will face. The crone is one of the most common of these protective figures.\n\nThe child of destiny has to face a long period of obscurity. This is a time of extreme danger, impediment, or disgrace. He is thrown inward to his own depths or outward to the unknown; either way, what he touches is a darkness unexplored. And this is a zone of unsuspected presences, benign as well as malignant: an angel appears, a helpful animal, a fisherman, a hunter, crone, or peasant.\n\nCampbell links the \"helpful crone\" to the fairy godmother. The wicked fairy godmother sometimes appears in the guise of a crone.\n\nIn Norse myth, Thor wrestles the crone Elli who personifies old age.\n\nThe Slavic witch Baba Yaga is a crone and liminal guardian to the Otherworld.\n\nIn the local folklore of Somerset in southwest England, the Woman of the Mist is said to appear sometimes as a crone gathering sticks; sightings of her were reported as late as the 1950s. In the Scottish Highlands tale \"The Poor Brother and the Rich\", a crone refuses to stay buried, until her son-in-law provides a generous wake, after which he becomes as wealthy as his more fortunate brother.\n\nIn Cuban traditional folklore old women often appear as helpful characters, as in the tale of the sick man who can't get well until he meets an old woman who advises him to wear the tunic of a man who is truly happy. According to writer Alma Flor Ada, \"They tend to be the ones who keep the family together, who pass on the traditions, who know the remedies that would cure the different illnesses\".\n\n"}

This yielded military intelligence which, along with that from other decrypted Axis radio and teleprinter transmissions, was given the codename \"Ultra\". This was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to have been \"decisive\" to the Allied victory.\n\nThe Enigma machines were a family of portable cipher machines with rotor scramblers. Good operating procedures, properly enforced, would have made the plugboard Enigma machine unbreakable. However, most of the German military forces, secret services and civilian agencies that used Enigma employed poor operating procedures, and it was these poor procedures that allowed the Enigma machines to be reverse-engineered and the ciphers to be read.\n\nThe German plugboard-equipped Enigma became Nazi Germany's principal crypto-system. It was broken by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau in December 1932, with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material obtained from a German spy. A month before the outbreak of World War II, at a conference held near Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau shared its Enigma-breaking techniques and technology with the French and British. During the German invasion of Poland, core Polish Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated, via Romania, to France where they established the PC Bruno signals intelligence station with French facilities support. Successful cooperation among the Poles, the French, and the British at Bletchley Park continued until June 1940, when France surrendered to the Germans.\n\nFrom this beginning, the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park built up an extensive cryptanalytic capability. Initially, the decryption was mainly of \"Luftwaffe\" (German air force) and a few \"Heer\" (German army) messages, as the \"Kriegsmarine\" (German navy) employed much more secure procedures for using Enigma. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician and logician, provided much of the original thinking that led to the design of the cryptanalytical bombe machines that were instrumental in eventually breaking the naval Enigma. However, the \"Kriegsmarine\" introduced an Enigma version with a fourth rotor for its U-boats, resulting in a prolonged period when these messages could not be decrypted. With the capture of relevant cipher keys and the use of much faster US Navy bombes, regular, rapid reading of U-boat messages resumed.\n\nThe Enigma machines produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. During World War I, inventors in several countries realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher unbreakable. This led to the development of rotor cipher machines which alter each character in the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, by means of a scrambler comprising a set of \"rotors\" that alter the electrical path from character to character, between the input device and the output device. This constant altering of the electrical pathway produces a very long period before the pattern—the key sequence or substitution alphabet—repeats.\n\nDecrypting enciphered messages involves three stages, defined somewhat differently in that era than in modern cryptography. First, there is the \"identification\" of the system in use, in this case Enigma; second, \"breaking\" the system by establishing exactly how encryption takes place, and third, \"solving\", which involves finding the way that the machine was set up for an individual message, \"i.e.\" the \"message key\". Today, it is often assumed that an attacker knows how the encipherment process works (see Kerckhoffs's principle) and \"breaking\" is often used for \"solving\" a key. Enigma machines, however, had so many potential internal wiring states that reconstructing the machine, independent of particular settings, was a very difficult task.\n\nThe Enigma rotor cipher machine was potentially an excellent system. It generated a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, with a period before repetition of the substitution alphabet that was much longer than any message, or set of messages, sent with the same key.\n\nA major weakness of the system, however, was that no letter could be enciphered to itself. This meant that some possible solutions could quickly be eliminated because of the same letter appearing in the same place in both the ciphertext and the putative piece of plaintext. Comparing the possible plaintext \"Keine besonderen Ereignisse\" (literally, \"no special occurrences\"—perhaps better translated as \"nothing to report\"), with a section of ciphertext, might produce the following:\nThe mechanism of the Enigma consisted of a keyboard connected to a battery and a current entry plate or wheel (German: \"Eintrittswalze\"), at the right hand end of the scrambler (usually via a plugboard in the military versions). This contained a set of 26 contacts that made electrical connection with the set of 26 spring-loaded pins on the right hand rotor. The internal wiring of the core of each rotor provided an electrical pathway from the pins on one side to different connection points on the other. The left hand side of each rotor made electrical connection with the rotor to its left. The leftmost rotor then made contact with the reflector (German: \"Umkehrwalze\"). The reflector provided a set of thirteen paired connections to return the current back through the scrambler rotors, and eventually to the lampboard where a lamp under a letter was illuminated.\n\nWhenever a key on the keyboard was pressed, the stepping motion was actuated, advancing the rightmost rotor one position. Because it moved with each key pressed it is sometimes called the \"fast rotor\". When a notch on that rotor engaged with a pawl on the middle rotor, that too moved; and similarly with the leftmost ('slow') rotor.\n\nThere are a huge number of ways that the connections within each scrambler rotor—and between the entry plate and the keyboard or plugboard or lampboard—could be arranged. For the reflector plate there are fewer, but still a large number of options to its possible wirings.\n\nEach scrambler rotor could be set to any one of its 26 starting positions (any letter of the alphabet). For the Enigma machines with only three rotors, their sequence in the scrambler—which was known as the \"wheel order (WO)\" to Allied cryptanalysts—could be selected from the six that are possible.\n\nLater Enigma models included an \"alphabet ring\" like a tyre around the core of each rotor. This could be set in any one of 26 positions in relation to the rotor's core. The ring contained one or more notches that engaged with a pawl that advanced the next rotor to the left.\n\nLater still, the three rotors for the scrambler were selected from a set of five or, in the case of the German Navy, eight rotors. The alphabet rings of rotors VI, VII and VIII contained two notches which, despite shortening the period of the substitution alphabet, made decryption more difficult.\n\nMost military Enigmas also featured a plugboard (German: \"Steckerbrett\"). This altered the electrical pathway between the keyboard and the entry wheel of the scrambler and, in the opposite direction, between the scrambler and the lampboard. It did this by exchanging letters reciprocally, so that if \"A\" was plugged to \"G\" then pressing key \"A\" would lead to current entering the scrambler at the \"G\" position, and if \"G\" was pressed the current would enter at \"A\". The same connections applied for the current on the way out to the lamp panel.\n\nTo decipher German military Enigma messages, the following information would need to be known.\n\nLogical structure of the machine (unchanging)\nInternal settings (usually changed less frequently than external settings)\nExternal settings (usually changed more frequently than internal settings)\n\nDiscovering the logical structure of the machine may be called \"breaking\" it, a one-off process except when changes or additions were made to the machines. Finding the internal and external settings for one or more messages may be called \"solving\" - although breaking is often used for this process as well.\n\nThe various Enigma models provided different levels of security. The presence of a plugboard (\"Steckerbrett\") substantially increased the security of the encipherment. Each pair of letters that were connected together by a plugboard lead, were referred to as \"stecker partners\", and the letters that remained unconnected were said to be \"self-steckered\". In general, the unsteckered Enigma was used for commercial and diplomatic traffic and could be broken relatively easily using hand methods, while attacking versions with a plugboard was much more difficult. The British read unsteckered Enigma messages sent during the Spanish Civil War, and also some Italian naval traffic enciphered early in World War II.\n\nThe strength of the security of the ciphers that were produced by the Enigma machine was a product of the large numbers associated with the scrambling process.\n\nHowever, the way that Enigma was used by the Germans meant that, if the settings for one day (or whatever period was represented by each row of the setting sheet) were established, the rest of the messages for that network on that day could quickly be deciphered.\n\nThe security of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to cryptanalysts.\n\nEnigma featured the major operational convenience of being symmetrical (or self-inverse). This meant that decipherment worked in the same way as encipherment, so that when the ciphertext was typed in, the sequence of lamps that lit yielded the plaintext.\n\nIdentical setting of the machines at the transmitting and receiving ends was achieved by key setting procedures. These varied from time to time and across different networks. They consisted of \"setting sheets\" in a \"codebook\". which were distributed to all users of a network, and were changed regularly. The message key was transmitted in an \"indicator\" as part of the message preamble. The word \"key\" was also used at Bletchley Park to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets. Initially these were recorded using coloured pencils and were given the names \"red\", \"light blue\" etc., and later the names of birds such as \"kestrel\". During World War II the settings for most networks lasted for 24 hours, although towards the end of the war, some were changed more frequently. The sheets had columns specifying, for each day of the month, the rotors to be used and their positions, the ring positions and the plugboard connections. For security, the dates were in reverse chronological order down the page, so that each row could be cut off and destroyed when it was finished with.\n\nUp until 15 September 1938, the transmitting operator indicated to the receiving operator(s) how to set their rotors, by choosing a three letter \"message key\" (the key specific to that message) and enciphering it twice using the specified initial ring positions (the \"Grundstellung\"). The resultant 6-letter indicator, was then transmitted before the enciphered text of the message. Suppose that the specified \"Grundstellung\" was \"RAO\", and the chosen 3-letter message key was \"IHL\", the operator would set the rotors to \"RAO\" and encipher \"IHL\" twice. The resultant ciphertext, \"DQYQQT\", would be transmitted, followed by the message enciphered using message key \"IHL\". The receiving operator would use the specified \"Grundstellung RAO\" to decipher the first six letters, yielding \"IHLIHL\". The receiving operator, seeing the repeated message key would know that there had been no corruption and use \"IHL\" to decipher the message.\n\nThe weakness in this indicator procedure came from two factors. First, use of a global \"Grundstellung\" —this was changed in September 1938 so that the operator selected his initial position to encrypt the message key, and sent the initial position in clear followed by the enciphered message key. The second problem was the repetition of message key within the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. This security problem enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau to break into the pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. On 1 May 1940 the Germans changed the procedures to encipher the message key only once.\n\nIn 1927, the UK openly purchased a commercial Enigma. Its operation was analysed and reported. Although a leading British cryptographer, Dilly Knox (a veteran of World War I and the cryptanalytical activities of the Royal Navy's Room 40), worked on decipherment he had only the messages he generated himself to practice with. After Germany supplied modified commercial machines to the Nationalist side in the Spanish Civil War, and with the Italian Navy (who were also aiding the Nationalists) using a version of the commercial Enigma that did not have a plugboard, Britain could intercept the radio broadcast messages. In April 1937 Knox made his first decryption of an Enigma encryption using a technique that he called \"buttoning up\" to discover the rotor wirings and another that he called \"rodding\" to solve messages. This relied heavily on cribs and on a crossword-solver's expertise in Italian, as it yielded a limited number of spaced-out letters at a time.\n\nBritain had no ability to read the messages broadcast by Germany, which used the military Enigma machine.\n\n \nIn the 1920s the German military began using a 3-rotor Enigma, whose security was increased in 1930 by the addition of a plugboard. The Polish Cipher Bureau sought to break it due to the threat that Poland faced from Germany, but its early attempts did not succeed. Near the beginning of 1929, the Polish Cipher Bureau realized that mathematicians may make good codebreakers; the bureau invited math students at Poznań University to take a class on cryptology. After the class, the Bureau recruited some students to work part-time at a Bureau branch set up in Poznań for the students. The branch operated for some time. On 1 September 1932, 27-year-old Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and two fellow Poznań University mathematics graduates, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, joined the Bureau full-time and moved to Warsaw. Their first task was to reconstruct a four-letter German naval cipher.\n\nNear the end of 1932 Rejewski was asked to work a couple of hours a day on breaking the Enigma.\n\nMarian Rejewski quickly spotted the Germans' major procedural weaknesses of specifying a single indicator setting (\"Grundstellung\") for all messages on a network for a day, and repeating the operator's chosen \"message key\" in the enciphered 6-letter indicator. Those procedural mistakes allowed Rejewski to decipher the message keys without knowing any of the machine's wirings. In the above example of \"DQYQQT\" being the enciphered indicator, it is known that the first letter \"D\" and the fourth letter \"Q\" represent the same letter, enciphered three positions apart in the scrambler sequence. Similarly with \"Q\" and \"Q\" in the second and fifth positions, and \"Y\" and \"T\" in the third and sixth. Rejewski exploited this fact by collecting a sufficient set of messages enciphered with the same indicator setting, and assembling three tables for the 1,4, the 2,5, and the 3,6 pairings. Each of these tables might look something like the following:\n\nA path from one first letter to the corresponding fourth letter, then from that letter as the first letter to its corresponding fourth letter, and so on until the first letter recurs, traces out a cycle group. The following table contains six cycle groups.\nRejewski recognized that a cycle group must pair with another group of the same length. Even though Rejewski did not know the rotor wirings or the plugboard permutation, the German mistake allowed him to reduce the number of possible substitution ciphers to a small number. For the 1,4 pairing above, there are only possibilities for the substitution ciphers at positions 1 and 4.\n\nRejewski also exploited cipher clerk laziness. Scores of messages would be enciphered by several cipher clerks, but some of those messages would have the same encrypted indicator. That meant that both clerks happened to choose the same three letter starting position. Such a collision should be rare with randomly selected starting positions, but lazy cipher clerks often chose starting positions such as \"AAA\", \"BBB\", or \"CCC\". Those security mistakes allowed Rejewski to solve each of the six permutations used to encipher the indicator.\n\nThat solution was an extraordinary feat. Rejewski did it without knowing the plugboard permutation or the rotor wirings. Even after solving for the six permutations, Rejewski did not know how the plugboard was set or the positions of the rotors. Knowing the six permutations also did not allow Rejewski to read any messages.\n\nBefore Rejewski started work on the Enigma, the French had a spy, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin and had access to some Enigma documents. Even with the help of those documents, the French did not make progress on breaking the Enigma. The French decided to share the material with their British and Polish allies. In a December 1931 meeting, the French provided Gwido Langer, head of the Polish Cipher Bureau, with copies of some Enigma material. Langer asked the French for more material, and Gustave Bertrand of French Military Intelligence quickly obliged; Bertrand provided additional material in May and September 1932. The documents included two German manuals and two pages of Enigma daily keys.\n\nIn December 1932, the Bureau provided Rejewski with some German manuals and monthly keys. The material enabled Rejewski to achieve \"one of the most important breakthroughs in cryptologic history\" by using the theory of permutations and groups to work out the Enigma scrambler wiring.\n\nRejewski could look at a day's cipher traffic and solve for the permutations at the six sequential positions used to encipher the indicator. Since Rejewski had the cipher key for the day, he knew and could factor out the plugboard permutation. He assumed the keyboard permutation was the same as the commercial Enigma, so he factored that out. He knew the rotor order, the ring settings, and the starting position. He developed a set of equations that would allow him to solve for the rightmost rotor wiring assuming the two rotors to the left did not move.\n\nHe attempted to solve the equations, but failed with inconsistent results. After some thought, he realized one of his assumptions must be wrong.\n\nRejewski found that the connections between the military Enigma's keyboard and the entry ring were not, as in the commercial Enigma, in the order of the keys on a German typewriter. He made an inspired correct guess that it was in alphabetical order. Britain's Dilly Knox was astonished when he learned, in July 1939, that the arrangement was so simple.\n\nWith the new assumption, Rejewski succeeded in solving the wiring of the rightmost rotor. The next month's cipher traffic used a different rotor in the rightmost position, so Rejewski used the same equations to solve for its wiring. With those rotors known, the remaining third rotor and the reflector wiring were determined. Without capturing a single rotor to reverse engineer, Rejewski had determined the logical structure of the machine.\n\nThe Polish Cipher Bureau then had some Enigma machine replicas made; the replicas were called \"Enigma doubles\".\n\nThe Poles now had the machine's wiring secrets, but they still needed to determine the daily keys for the cipher traffic. The Poles would examine the Enigma traffic and use the method of characteristics to determine the six permutations used for the indicator. The Poles would then use the grill method to determine the rightmost rotor and its position. That search would be complicated by the plugboard permutation, but that permutation only swapped six pairs of letters — not enough to disrupt the search. The grill method also determined the plugboard wiring. The grill method could also be used to determine the middle and left rotors and their setting (and those tasks were simpler because there was no plugboard), but the Poles eventually compiled a catalog of the possible permutations (reflector and 2 leftmost rotor permutations), so they could just look up the answer.\n\nThe only remaining secret of the daily key would be the ring settings, and the Poles would attack that problem with brute force. Most messages would start with the three letters \"ANX\" (\"an\" is German for \"to\" and the \"X\" character was used as a space). It may take almost trials, but that was doable. Once the ring settings were found, the Poles could read the day's traffic.\n\nThe Germans made it easy for the Poles in the beginning. The rotor order only changed every quarter, so the Poles would not have to search for the rotor order. Later the Germans changed it every month, but that would not cause much trouble, either. Eventually, the Germans would change the rotor order every day, and late in the war (after Poland had been overrun) the rotor order might be changed during the day.\n\nThe Poles kept improving their techniques as the Germans kept improving their security measures.\n\nRejewski realised that, although the letters in the cycle groups were changed by the plugboard, the number and lengths of the cycles were unaffected—in the example above, six cycle groups with lengths of 9, 9, 3, 3, 1 and 1. He described this invariant structure as the \"characteristic\" of the indicator setting. There were only 105,456 possible rotor settings. The Poles therefore set about creating a \"card catalog\" of these cycle patterns.\n\nThe cycle-length method would avoid using the grill. The card catalog would index the cycle-length for all starting positions (except for turnovers that occurred while enciphering an indicator). The day's traffic would be examined to discover the cycles in the permutations. The card catalog would be consulted to find the possible starting positions. There are roughly 1 million possible cycle-length combinations and only 105,456 starting positions. Having found a starting position, the Poles would use an Enigma double to determine the cycles at that starting position without a plugboard. The Poles would then compare those cycles to the cycles with the (unknown) plugboard and solve for the plugboard permutation (a simple substitution cipher). Then the Poles could find the remaining secret of the ring settings with the ANX method.\n\nThe problem was compiling the large card catalog.\n\nRejewski, in 1934 or 1935, devised a machine to facilitate making the catalog and called it a \"cyclometer\". This \"comprised two sets of rotors... connected by wires through which electric current could run. Rotor N in the second set was three letters out of phase with respect to rotor N in the first set, whereas rotors L and M in the second set were always set the same way as rotors L and M in the first set\". Preparation of this catalog, using the cyclometer, was, said Rejewski, \"laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready, obtaining daily keys was a question of [some fifteen] minutes\".\n\nHowever, on 1 November 1937, the Germans changed the Enigma reflector, necessitating the production of a new catalog—\"a task which [says Rejewski] consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time\".\n\nThis characteristics method stopped working for German naval Enigma messages on 1 May 1937, when the indicator procedure was changed to one involving special codebooks (see German Navy 3-rotor Enigma below). Worse still, on 15 September 1938 it stopped working for German army and air force messages because operators were then required to choose their own \"Grundstellung\" (initial rotor setting) for each message. Although German army message keys would still be double enciphered, the days keys would not be double enciphered at the same initial setting, so the characteristic could no longer be found or exploited.\n\nAlthough the characteristics method no longer worked, the inclusion of the enciphered message key twice gave rise to a phenomenon that the cryptanalyst Henryk Zygalski was able to exploit. Sometimes (about one message in eight) one of the repeated letters in the message key enciphered to the same letter on both occasions. These occurrences were called \"samiczki\" (in English, \"females\"—a term later used at Bletchley Park).\n\nOnly a limited number of scrambler settings would give rise to females, and these would have been identifiable from the card catalog. If the first six letters of the ciphertext were SZVSIK\", this would be termed a 1-4 female; if \"WHOEHS\", a 2-5 female; and if \"ASWCRW, a 3-6 female. The method was called \"Netz\" (from \"Netzverfahren\", \"net method\"), or the Zygalski sheet method as it used perforated sheets that he devised, although at Bletchley Park Zygalski's name was not used for security reasons. About ten females from a day's messages were required for success.\n\nThere was a set of 26 of these sheets for each of the six possible sequences \"wheel orders\". Each sheet was for the left (slowest-moving) rotor. The 51×51 matrices on the sheets represented the 676 possible starting positions of the middle and right rotors. The sheets contained about 1000 holes in the positions in which a female could occur. The set of sheets for that day's messages would be appropriately positioned on top of each other in the perforated sheets apparatus. Rejewski wrote about how the device was operated:\n\nThe holes in the sheets were painstakingly cut with razor blades and in the three months before the next major setback, the sets of sheets for only two of the possible six wheel orders had been produced.\n\nAfter Rejewski's characteristics method became useless, he invented an electro-mechanical device that was dubbed the \"bomba kryptologiczna\" or \"cryptologic bomb\". Each machine contained six sets of Enigma rotors for the six positions of the repeated three-letter key. Like the Zygalski sheet method, the \"bomba\" relied on the occurrence of \"females\", but required only three instead of about ten for the sheet method. Six \"bomby\" were constructed, one for each of the then possible \"wheel orders\". Each \"bomba\" conducted an exhaustive (brute-force) analysis of the 17,576 possible message keys.\n\nRejewski has written about the device: \n\nThe cipher message transmitted the \"Grundstellung\" in the clear, so when a \"bomba\" found a match, it revealed the rotor order, the rotor positions, and the ring settings. The only remaining secret was the plugboard permutation.\n\nOn 15 December 1938, the German Army increased the complexity of Enigma enciphering by introducing two additional rotors (IV and V). This increased the number of possible \"wheel orders\" from 6 to 60. The Poles could then read only the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to commission 54 more bombs or produce 58 sets of Zygalski sheets. Other Enigma users received the two new rotors at the same time. However, until 1 July 1939 the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—continued to use its machines in the old way with the same indicator setting for all messages. This allowed Rejewski to reuse his previous method, and by about the turn of the year he had worked out the wirings of the two new rotors. On 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight to between seven and ten, which made other methods of decryption even more difficult.\n\nRejewski wrote, in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War: \n\nIn 1940 Dilly Knox wanted to establish whether the Italian Navy were still using the same system that he had cracked during the Spanish Civil War; he instructed his assistants to use rodding to see whether the crib \"PERX\" (\"per\" being Italian for \"for\" and \"X\" being used to indicate a space between words) worked for the first part of the message. After three months there was no success, but Mavis Lever, a 19-year-old student, found that rodding produced \"PERS\" for the first four letters of one message. She then (against orders) tried beyond this and obtained \"PERSONALE\" (Italian for \"personal\"). This confirmed that the Italians were indeed using the same machines and procedures.\n\nThe subsequent breaking of Italian naval Enigma ciphers led to substantial Allied successes. The cipher-breaking was disguised by sending a reconnaissance aircraft to the known location of a warship before attacking it, so that the Italians assumed that this was how they had been discovered. The Royal Navy's victory at the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 was considerably helped by Ultra intelligence obtained from Italian naval Enigma signals.\n\nAs the likelihood of war increased in 1939, Britain and France pledged support for Poland in the event of action that threatened its independence. In April, Germany withdrew from the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. The Polish General Staff, realizing what was likely to happen, decided to share their work on Enigma decryption with their western allies. Marian Rejewski later wrote:\n\nAt a conference near Warsaw on 26 and 27 July 1939, the Poles revealed to the French and British that they had broken Enigma and pledged to give each a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their Enigma-solving techniques and equipment, including Zygalski's perforated sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. Dilly Knox was a member of the British delegation. He commented on the fragility of the Polish system's reliance on the repetition in the indicator, because it might \"at any moment be cancelled\". In August two Polish Enigma doubles were sent to Paris, whence Gustave Bertrand took one to London, handing it to Stewart Menzies of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service at Victoria Station.\n\nGordon Welchman, who became head of Hut 6 at Bletchley Park, wrote:\n\nPeter Calvocoressi, who became head of the Luftwaffe section in Hut 3, wrote of the Polish contribution:\n\nOn 17 September 1939, the day the Soviet Union began its invasion of Poland, Cipher Bureau personnel crossed their country's southeastern border into Romania. They eventually made their way to France, and on 20 October 1939, at \"PC Bruno\" outside Paris, the Polish cryptanalists resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in collaboration with Bletchley Park.\n\n\"PC Bruno\" and Bletchley Park worked together closely, communicating via a telegraph line secured by the use of Enigma doubles. In January 1940 Alan Turing spent several days at \"PC Bruno\" conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of Zygalski sheets that had been punched at Bletchley Park by John Jeffreys using Polish-supplied information, and on 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic—that from 28 October 1939. From that time, until the Fall of France in June 1940, 17 percent of the Enigma keys that were found by the allies, were solved at \"PC Bruno\".\n\nJust before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive against the Low Countries and France, the Germans made the feared change in the indicator procedure, discontinuing the duplication of the enciphered message key. This meant that the Zygalski sheet method no longer worked. Instead, the cryptanalysts had to rely on exploiting the operator weaknesses described below, particularly the cillies and the Herivel tip.\n\nAfter the June Franco-German armistice, the Polish cryptological team resumed work in France's southern \"Free Zone\", although probably not on Enigma. Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski, after many travails, perilous journeys and Spanish imprisonment, finally made it to Britain, where they were inducted into the Polish Army and put to work breaking German \"SS\" and \"SD\" hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in Boxmoor. Due to their having been in occupied France, it was thought too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.\n\nAfter the German occupation of Vichy France, several of those who had worked at \"PC Bruno\" were captured by the Germans. Despite the dire circumstances in which some of them were held, none betrayed the secret of Enigma's decryption.\n\nApart from some less-than-ideal inherent characteristics of the Enigma, in practice the system's greatest weakness was the way that it was used. The basic principle of this sort of enciphering machine is that it should deliver a very long stream of transformations that are difficult for a cryptanalyst to predict. Some of the instructions to operators, however, and their sloppy habits, had the opposite effect. Without these operating shortcomings, Enigma would, almost certainly, not have been broken.\n\nThe set of shortcomings that the Polish cryptanalysts exploited to such great effect included the following:\n\n\nOther useful shortcomings that were discovered by the British and later the American cryptanalysts included the following, many of which depended on frequent solving of a particular network:\n\n\nMavis Lever, a member of Dilly Knox's team, recalled an occasion when there was an extraordinary message. \n\nPostwar debriefings of German cryptographic specialists, conducted as part of project TICOM, tend to support the view that the Germans were well aware that the un-steckered Enigma was theoretically solvable, but thought that the steckered Enigma had not been solved.\n\nThe term \"crib\" was used at Bletchley Park to denote any \"known plaintext\" or \"suspected plaintext\" at some point in an enciphered message.\n\nBritain's Government Code and Cipher School (GC&CS), before its move to Bletchley Park, had realised the value of recruiting mathematicians and logicians to work in codebreaking teams. Alan Turing, a Cambridge University mathematician with an interest in cryptology and in machines for implementing logical operations—and who was regarded by many as a genius—had started work for GC&CS on a part-time basis from about the time of the Munich Crisis in 1938. Gordon Welchman, another Cambridge mathematician, had also received initial training in 1938, and they both reported to Bletchley Park on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany.\n\nMost of the Polish success had relied on the repetition within the indicator. But as soon as Turing moved to Bletchley Park—where he initially joined Dilly Knox in the research section—he set about seeking methods that did not rely on this weakness, as they correctly anticipated that the German Army and Air Force might follow the German Navy in improving their indicator system.\n\nThe Poles had used an early form of crib-based decryption in the days when only six leads were used on the plugboard. The technique became known as the \"Forty Weepy Weepy\" method for the following reason. When a message was a continuation of a previous one, the plaintext would start with \"FORT\" (from \"Fortsetzung\", meaning \"continuation\") followed by the time of the first message given twice bracketed by the letter \"Y\". At this time numerals were represented by the letters on the top row of the Enigma keyboard. So, \"continuation of message sent at 2330\" was represented as \"FORTYWEEPYYWEEPY\".\n\n\"Cribs\" were fundamental to the British approach to solving Enigma keys, but guessing the plaintext for a message was a highly skilled business. So in 1940 Stuart Milner-Barry set up a special \"Crib Room\" in Hut 8.\n\nForemost amongst the knowledge needed for identifying cribs was the text of previous decrypts. Bletchley Park maintained detailed indexes of message preambles, of every person, of every ship, of every unit, of every weapon, of every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon. For each message the traffic analysis recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one. Thus, as Derek Taunt, another Cambridge mathematician-cryptanalyst wrote, the truism that \"nothing succeeds like success\" is particularly apposite here.\n\nStereotypical messages included \"Keine besonderen Ereignisse\" (literally, \"no special occurrences\"—perhaps better translated as \"nothing to report\"), \"An die Gruppe\" (\"to the group\") and a number that came from weather stations such as \"weub null seqs null null\" (\"weather survey 0600\"). This was actually rendered as \"WEUBYYNULLSEQSNULLNULL\". The word \"WEUB\" being short for \"Wetterübersicht\", \"YY\" was used as a separator and \"SEQS\" was common abbreviation of \"sechs\" (German for \"six\"). As another example, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Quartermaster started all of his messages to his commander with the same formal introduction.\n\nWith a combination of probable plaintext fragment and the fact that no letter could be enciphered as itself, a corresponding ciphertext fragment could often be tested by trying every possible alignment of the crib against the ciphertext, a procedure known as \"crib-dragging\". This, however, was only one aspect of the processes of solving a key. Derek Taunt has written that the three cardinal personal qualities that were in demand for cryptanalysis were (1) a creative imagination, (2) a well-developed critical faculty, and (3) a habit of meticulousness. Skill at solving crossword puzzles was famously tested in recruiting some cryptanalysts. This was useful in working out plugboard settings when a possible solution was being examined. For example, if the crib was the word \"WETTER\" (German for \"weather\") and a possible decrypt before the plugboard settings had been discovered, was \"TEWWER\", it is easy to see that \"T\" with \"W\" are \"stecker partners\". These examples, although illustrative of the principles, greatly over-simplify the cryptanalysts' tasks.\n\nA fruitful source of cribs was re-encipherments of messages that had previously been decrypted either from a lower-level manual cipher or from another Enigma network. This was called a \"kiss\" and happened particularly with German naval messages being sent in the \"dockyard cipher\" and repeated \"verbatim\" in an Enigma cipher. One German agent in Britain, Nathalie Sergueiew, code named \"Treasure\", who had been \"turned\" to work for the Allies, was very verbose in her messages back to Germany, which were then re-transmitted on the \"Abwehr\" Enigma network. She was kept going by MI5 because this provided long cribs, not because of her usefulness as an agent to feed incorrect information to the \"Abwehr\".\n\nOccasionally, when there was a particularly urgent need to solve German naval Enigma keys, such as when an Arctic convoy was about to depart, mines would be laid by the RAF in a defined position, whose grid reference in the German naval system did not contain any of the words (such as \"sechs\" or \"sieben\") for which abbreviations or alternatives were sometimes used. The warning message about the mines and then the \"all clear\" message, would be transmitted both using the \"dockyard cipher\" and the U-boat Enigma network. This process of \"planting\" a crib was called \"gardening\".\n\nAlthough \"cillies\" were not actually cribs, the \"chit-chat\" in clear that Enigma operators indulged in amongst themselves, often gave a clue as to the cillies that they might generate.\n\nWhen captured German Enigma operators revealed that they had been instructed to encipher numbers by spelling them out rather than using the top row of the keyboard, Alan Turing reviewed decrypted messages and determined that the word \"eins\" (\"one\") appeared in 90% of messages. Turing automated the crib process, creating the \"Eins Catalogue\", which assumed that \"eins\" was encoded at all positions in the plaintext. The catalogue included every possible rotor position for \"EINS\" with that day's \"wheel order\" and plugboard connections.\n\nThe British bombe was an electromechanical device designed by Alan Turing soon after he arrived at Bletchley Park in September 1939. Harold \"Doc\" Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) in Letchworth ( from Bletchley) was the engineer who turned Turing's ideas into a working machine—under the codename CANTAB. Turing's specification developed the ideas of the Poles' \"bomba kryptologiczna\" but was designed for the much more general crib-based decryption.\n\nThe bombe helped to identify the \"wheel order\", the initial positions of the rotor cores, and the \"stecker partner\" of a specified letter. This was achieved by examining all 17,576 possible scrambler positions for a set of \"wheel orders\" on a comparison between a crib and the ciphertext, so as to eliminate possibilities that contradicted the Enigma's known characteristics. In the words of Gordon Welchman \"the task of the bombe was simply to reduce the assumptions of \"wheel order\" and scrambler positions that required 'further analysis' to a manageable number.\"\n\nThe demountable drums on the front of the bombe were wired identically to the connections made by Enigma's different rotors. Unlike them, however, the input and output contacts for the left-hand and the right-hand sides were separate, making 104 contacts between each drum and the rest of the machine. This allowed a set of scramblers to be connected in series by means of 26-way cables. Electrical connections between the rotating drums' wiring and the rear plugboard were by means of metal brushes. When the bombe detected a scrambler position with no contradictions, it stopped and the operator would note the position before restarting it.\n\nAlthough Welchman had been given the task of studying Enigma traffic callsigns and discriminants, he knew from Turing about the bombe design and early in 1940, before the first pre-production bombe was delivered, he showed him an idea to increase its effectiveness. It exploited the reciprocity in plugboard connections, to reduce considerably the number of scrambler settings that needed to be considered further. This became known as the \"diagonal board\" and was subsequently incorporated to great effect in all the bombes.\n\nA cryptanalyst would prepare a crib for comparison with the ciphertext. This was a complicated and sophisticated task, which later took the Americans some time to master. As well as the crib, a decision as to which of the many possible \"wheel orders\" could be omitted had to be made. Turing's Banburismus was used in making this major economy. The cryptanalyst would then compile a \"menu\" which specified the connections of the cables of the patch panels on the back of the machine, and a particular letter whose \"stecker partner\" was sought. The menu reflected the relationships between the letters of the crib and those of the ciphertext. Some of these formed loops (or \"closures\" as Turing called them) in a similar way to the \"cycles\" that the Poles had exploited.\n\nThe reciprocal nature of the plugboard meant that no letter could be connected to more than one other letter. When there was a contradiction of two different letters apparently being \"stecker partners\" with the letter in the menu, the bombe would detect this, and move on. If, however, this happened with a letter that was not part of the menu, a false stop could occur. In refining down the set of stops for further examination, the cryptanalyst would eliminate stops that contained such a contradiction. The other plugboard connections and the settings of the alphabet rings would then be worked out before the scrambler positions at the possible true stops were tried out on Typex machines that had been adapted to mimic Enigmas. All the remaining stops would correctly decrypt the crib, but only the true stop would produce the correct plaintext of the whole message.\n\nTo avoid wasting scarce bombe time on menus that were likely to yield an excessive number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use menus that were estimated to produce no more than four stops per \"wheel order\". This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib. The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that \"turn-over\" of the middle rotor would have occurred.\n\nThe production model 3-rotor bombes contained 36 scramblers arranged in three banks of twelve. Each bank was used for a different \"wheel order\" by fitting it with the drums that corresponded to the Enigma rotors being tested. The first bombe was named \"Victory\" and was delivered to Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940. The next one, which included the diagonal board, was delivered on 8 August 1940. It was referred to as a \"spider bombe\" and was named \"Agnus Dei\" which soon became \"Agnes\" and then \"Aggie\". The production of British bombes was relatively slow at first, with only five bombes being in use in June 1941, 15 by the year end, 30 by September 1942, 49 by January 1943 but eventually 210 at the end of the war.\n\nA refinement that was developed for use on messages from those networks that disallowed the plugboard (\"Stecker\") connection of adjacent letters, was the \"Consecutive Stecker Knock Out\". This was fitted to 40 bombes and produced a useful reduction in false stops.\n\nInitially the bombes were operated by ex-BTM servicemen, but in March 1941 the first detachment of members of the Women's Royal Naval Service (known as \"Wrens\") arrived at Bletchley Park to become bombe operators. By 1945 there were some 2,000 Wrens operating the bombes. Because of the risk of bombing, relatively few of the bombes were located at Bletchley Park. The largest two outstations were at Eastcote (some 110 bombes and 800 Wrens) and Stanmore (some 50 bombes and 500 Wrens). There were also bombe outstations at Wavendon, Adstock and Gayhurst. Communication with Bletchley Park was by teleprinter links.\n\nWhen the German Navy started using 4-rotor Enigmas, about sixty 4-rotor bombes were produced at Letchworth, some with the assistance of the General Post Office. The NCR-manufactured US Navy 4-rotor bombes were, however, very fast and the most successful. They were extensively used by Bletchley Park over teleprinter links (using the Combined Cipher Machine) to OP-20-G for both 3-rotor and 4-rotor jobs.\n\nAlthough the German army, SS, police, and railway all used Enigma with similar procedures, it was the \"Luftwaffe\" (Air Force) that was the first and most fruitful source of Ultra intelligence during the war. The messages were decrypted in Hut 6 at Bletchley Park and turned into intelligence reports in Hut 3. The network code-named ‘Red’ at Bletchley Park was broken regularly and quickly from 22 May 1940 until the end of hostilities. Indeed, the Air Force section of Hut 3 expected the new day’s Enigma settings to have been established in Hut 6 by breakfast time. The relative ease of solving this network’s settings was a product of plentiful cribs and frequent German operating mistakes. Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring was known to use it for trivial communications, including informing squadron commanders to make sure the pilots he was going to decorate had been properly deloused. Such messages became known as \"Göring funnies\" to the staff at Bletchley Park.\n\nDilly Knox's last great cryptanalytical success before his untimely death in February 1943, was the solving, in 1941, of the \"Abwehr\" Enigma. Intercepts of traffic which had an 8-letter indicator sequence before the usual 5-letter groups led to the suspicion that a 4-rotor machine was being used. The assumption was correctly made that the indicator consisted of a 4-letter message key enciphered twice. The machine itself was similar to a Model G Enigma, with three conventional rotors, though it did not have a plug board. The principal difference to the model G was that it was equipped with a reflector that was advanced by the stepping mechanism once it had been set by hand to its starting position (in all other variants, the reflector was fixed). Collecting a set of enciphered message keys for a particular day allowed \"cycles\" (or \"boxes\" as Knox called them) to be assembled in a similar way to the method used by the Poles in the 1930s.\n\nKnox was able to derive, using his \"buttoning up\" procedure, some of the wiring of the rotor that had been loaded in the fast position on that day. Progressively he was able to derive the wiring of all three rotors. Once that had been done, he was able to work out the wiring of the reflector. Deriving the indicator setting for that day was achieved using Knox's time-consuming \"rodding\" procedure. This involved a great deal of trial and error, imagination and crossword puzzle-solving skills, but was helped by \"cillies\".\n\nThe \"Abwehr\" was the intelligence and counter-espionage service of the German High Command. The spies that it placed in enemy countries used a lower level cipher (which was broken by Oliver Strachey's section at Bletchley Park) for their transmissions. However, the messages were often then re-transmitted word-for-word on the \"Abwehr's\" internal Enigma networks, which gave the best possible crib for deciphering that day's indicator setting. Interception and analysis of \"Abwehr\" transmissions led to the remarkable state of affairs that allowed MI5 to give a categorical assurance that all the German spies in Britain were controlled as double agents working for the Allies under the Double Cross System.\n\nIn the summer of 1940 following the Franco-German armistice, most Army Enigma traffic was travelling by land lines rather than radio and so was not available to Bletchley Park. The air Battle of Britain was crucial, so it was not surprising that the concentration of scarce resources was on \"Luftwaffe\" and \"Abwehr\" traffic. It was not until early in 1941 that the first breaks were made into German Army Enigma traffic, and it was the spring of 1942 before it was broken reliably, albeit often with some delay. It is unclear whether the German Army Enigma operators made deciphering more difficult by making fewer operating mistakes.\n\nThe German Navy used Enigma in the same way as the German Army and Air Force until 1 May 1937 when they changed to a substantially different system. This used the same sort of setting sheet but, importantly, it included the ground key for a period of two, sometimes three days. The message setting was concealed in the indicator by selecting a trigram from a book (the \"Kenngruppenbuch\", or K-Book) and performing a bigram substitution on it. This defeated the Poles, although they suspected some sort of bigram substitution.\n\nThe procedure for the naval sending operator was as follows. First they selected a trigram from the K-Book, say YLA. They then looked in the appropriate columns of the K-Book and selected another trigram, say YVT, and wrote it in the boxes at the top of the message form: \nThey then filled in the \"dots\" with any letters, giving say:\n\nFinally they looked up the vertical pairs of letters in the Bigram Tables\n\nand wrote down the resultant pairs, UB, LK, RS and PW which were transmitted as two four letter groups at the start and end of the enciphered message. The receiving operator performed the converse procedure to obtain the message key for setting his Enigma rotors.\n\nAs well as these \"Kriegsmarine\" procedures being much more secure than those of the German Army and Air Force, the German Navy Enigma introduced three more rotors (VI, VII and VIII), early in 1940. The choice of three rotors from eight meant that there were a total of 336 possible permutations of rotors and their positions.\n\nAlan Turing decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because \"no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\". He established Hut 8 with Peter Twinn and two \"girls\". Turing used the indicators and message settings for traffic from 1–8 May 1937 that the Poles had worked out, and some very elegant deductions to diagnose the complete indicator system. After the messages were deciphered they were translated for transmission to the Admiralty in Hut 4.\n\nThe first break of wartime traffic was in December 1939, into signals that had been intercepted in November 1938, when only three rotors and six plugboard leads had been in use. It used \"Forty Weepy Weepy\" cribs.\n\nA captured German \"Funkmaat\" (\"radio operator\") named Meyer had revealed that numerals were now spelt out as words. EINS, the German for \"one\", was present in about 90% of genuine German Navy messages. An EINS catalogue was compiled consisting of the encipherment of EINS at all 105,456 rotor settings. These were compared with the ciphertext, and when matches were found, about a quarter of them yielded the correct plaintext. Later this process was automated in Mr Freeborn's section using Hollerith equipment. When the ground key was known, this EINS-ing procedure could yield three bigrams for the tables that were then gradually assembled.\n\nFurther progress required more information from German Enigma users. This was achieved through a succession of \"pinches\", the capture of Enigma parts and codebooks. The first of these was on 12 February 1940, when rotors VI and VII, whose wiring was at that time unknown, were captured from the , by minesweeper .\n\nOn 26 April 1940, the Narvik-bound German patrol boat \"VP2623\", disguised as a Dutch trawler named \"Polares\", was captured by . This yielded an instruction manual, codebook sheets and a record of some transmissions, which provided complete cribs. This confirmed that Turing's deductions about the trigram/bigram process were correct and allowed a total of six days' messages to be broken, the last of these using the first of the bombes. However, the numerous possible rotor sequences, together with a paucity of usable cribs, made the methods used against the Army and Air Force Enigma messages of very limited value with respect to the Navy messages.\n\nAt the end of 1939, Turing extended the clock method invented by the Polish cryptanalyst Jerzy Różycki. Turing's method became known as \"Banburismus\". Turing said that at that stage \"I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken.\" Banburismus used large cards printed in Banbury (hence the Banburismus name) to discover correlations and a statistical scoring system to determine likely rotor orders (\"Walzenlage\") to be tried on the bombes. The practice conserved scarce bombe time and allowed more messages to be attacked. In practice, the 336 possible rotor orders could be reduced to perhaps 18 to be run on the bombes. Knowledge of the bigrams was essential for Banburismus, and building up the tables took a long time. This lack of visible progress led to Frank Birch, head of the Naval Section, to write on 21 August 1940 to Edward Travis, Deputy Director of Bletchley Park: \n\nSchemes for capturing Enigma material were conceived including, in September 1940, Operation Ruthless by Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming (author of the James Bond novels). When this was cancelled, Birch told Fleming that \"Turing and Twinn came to me like undertakers cheated of a nice corpse...\"\n\nA major advance came through Operation Claymore, a commando raid on the Lofoten Islands on 4 March 1941. The German armed trawler \"Krebs\" was captured, including the complete Enigma keys for February, but no bigram tables or K-book. However, the material was sufficient to reconstruct the bigram tables by \"EINS-ing\", and by late March they were almost complete.\n\nBanburismus then started to become extremely useful. Hut 8 was expanded and moved to 24-hour working, and a crib room was established. The story of Banburismus for the next two years was one of improving methods, of struggling to get sufficient staff, and of a steady growth in the relative and absolute importance of cribbing as the increasing numbers of bombes made the running of cribs ever faster. Of value in this period were further \"pinches\" such as those from the German weather ships \"München\" and \"Lauenburg\" and the submarines and .\n\nDespite the introduction of the 4-rotor Enigma for Atlantic U-boats, the analysis of traffic enciphered with the 3-rotor Enigma proved of immense value to the Allied navies. Banburismus was used until July 1943, when it became more efficient to use the many more bombes that had become available.\n\nOn 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages to and from Atlantic U-boats, which Bletchley Park called '\"Shark,\" became significantly different from the rest of the traffic, which they called \"Dolphin.\"\n\nThis was because a new Enigma version had been brought into use. It was a development of the 3-rotor Enigma with the reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a thin reflector. Eventually, there were two fourth-position rotors that were called Beta and Gamma and two thin reflectors, Bruno and Caesar which could be used in any combination. These rotors were not advanced by the rotor to their right, in the way that rotors I to VIII were.\n\nThe introduction of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the fourth rotor wheel to be a reflector wheel. Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.\n\nThis major challenge could not be met by using existing methods and resources for a number of reasons.\n\nIt seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. This was an immense problem and it gave a great deal of trouble. Work on a high speed machine had been started by Wynn-Williams of the TRE late in 1941 and some nine months later Harold Keen of BTM started work independently. Early in 1942, Bletchley Park were a long way from possessing a high speed machine of any sort.\n\nEventually, after a long period of being unable to decipher U-boat messages, a source of cribs was found. This was the Kurzsignale (short signals), a code which the German navy used to minimize the duration of transmissions, thereby reducing the risk of being located by high-frequency direction finding techniques. The messages were only 22 characters long and were used to report sightings of possible Allied targets. A copy of the code book had been captured from on 9 May 1941. A similar coding system was used for weather reports from U-boats, the \"Wetterkurzschlüssel\", (Weather Short Code Book). A copy of this had been captured from on 29 or 30 October 1942. These short signals had been used for deciphering 3-rotor Enigma messages and it was discovered that the new rotor had a neutral position at which it, and its matching reflector, behaved just like a 3-rotor Enigma reflector. This allowed messages enciphered at this neutral position to be deciphered by a 3-rotor machine, and hence deciphered by a standard bombe. Deciphered Short Signals provided good material for bombe menus for Shark. Regular deciphering of U-boat traffic restarted in December 1942.\n\nUnlike the situation at Bletchley Park, the United States armed services did not share a combined cryptanalytical service. Before the US joined the war, there was collaboration with Britain, albeit with a considerable amount of caution on Britain's side because of the extreme importance of Germany and her allies not learning that its codes were being broken. Despite some worthwhile collaboration amongst the cryptanalysts, their superiors took some time to achieve a trusting relationship in which both British and American bombes were used to mutual benefit.\n\nIn February 1941, Captain Abraham Sinkov and Lieutenant Leo Rosen of the US Army, and Lieutenants Robert Weeks and Prescott Currier of the US Navy, arrived at Bletchley Park, bringing, amongst other things, a replica of the 'Purple' cipher machine for Bletchley Park's Japanese section in Hut 7. The four returned to America after ten weeks, with a naval radio direction finding unit and many documents, including a \"paper Enigma\".\n\nThe main American response to the 4-rotor Enigma was the US Navy bombe, which was manufactured in much less constrained facilities than were available in wartime Britain. Colonel John Tiltman, who later became Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, visited the US Navy cryptanalysis office (OP-20-G) in April 1942 and recognised America's vital interest in deciphering U-boat traffic. The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full blueprints and wiring diagrams received by US Navy Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942. Funding for a full, $2 million, Navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.\nCommander Edward Travis, Deputy Director and Frank Birch, Head of the German Naval Section travelled from Bletchley Park to Washington in September 1942. With Carl Frederick Holden, US Director of Naval Communications they established, on 2 October 1942, a UK:US accord which may have \"a stronger claim than BRUSA to being the forerunner of the UKUSA Agreement,\" being the first agreement \"to establish the special Sigint relationship between the two countries,\" and \"it set the pattern for UKUSA, in that the United States was very much the senior partner in the alliance.\" It established a relationship of \"full collaboration\" between Bletchley Park and OP-20-G.\n\nAn all electronic solution to the problem of a fast bombe was considered, but rejected for pragmatic reasons, and a contract was let with the National Cash Register Corporation (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio. This established the United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory. Engineering development was led by NCR's Joseph Desch, a brilliant inventor and engineer. He had already been working on electronic counting devices.\n\nAlan Turing, who had written a memorandum to OP-20-G (probably in 1941), was seconded to the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington in December 1942, because of his exceptionally wide knowledge about the bombes and the methods of their use. He was asked to look at the bombes that were being built by NCR and at the security of certain speech cipher equipment under development at Bell Labs. He visited OP-20-G, and went to NCR in Dayton on 21 December. He was able to show that it was not necessary to build 336 Bombes, one for each possible rotor order, by utilising techniques such as Banburismus. The initial order was scaled down to 96 machines.\n\nThe US Navy bombes used drums for the Enigma rotors in much the same way as the British bombes, but were very much faster. The first machine was completed and tested on 3 May 1943. Soon, these bombes were more available than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations, and as a consequence they were put to use for Hut 6 as well as Hut 8 work. A total of 121 Navy bombes were produced. In Alexander's \"Cryptographic History of Work on German Naval Enigma\", he wrote as follows.\nThe US Army also produced a version of a bombe. It was physically very different from the British and US Navy bombes. A contract was signed with Bell Labs on 30 September 1942. The machine was designed to analyse 3-rotor, not 4-rotor traffic. It did not use drums to represent the Enigma rotors, using instead telephone-type relays. It could, however, handle one problem that the bombes with drums could not. The set of ten bombes consisted of a total of 144 Enigma-equivalents, each mounted on a rack approximately long high and wide. There were 12 control stations which could allocate any of the Enigma-equivalents into the desired configuration by means of plugboards. Rotor order changes did not require the mechanical process of changing drums, but was achieved in about half a minute by means of push buttons. A 3-rotor run took about 10 minutes.\n\nThe German navy was concerned that Enigma could be compromised. Key schedules were printed in water-soluble inks so they could not be salvaged. The navy policed what its operators did and disciplined them when errors that could compromise the cipher were made. The navy minimized its exposure. For example, Enigma machines were not carried by ships that might be captured or run aground. When ships were lost in circumstances where they might be salvaged, the Germans investigated. After investigating some losses in 1940, Germany changed some message indicators.\n\nIn April 1940, the British sank eight German destroyers in Norway. The Germans concluded that it was unlikely that the British were reading Enigma.\n\nIn May 1941, the British deciphered some messages that gave the location of some supply ships for the battleship \"Bismarck\" and the cruiser \"Prinz Eugen\". As part of the \"Operation Rheinübung\" commerce raid, the Germans had assigned five tankers, two supply ships, and two scouts to support the warships. After the \"Bismarck\" was sunk, the British directed its forces to sink the supporting ships \"Belchen\", \"Esso Hamburg\", \"Egerland\", and some others. The Admiralty specifically did not target the tanker \"Gedania\" and the scout \"Gonzenheim\" figuring that sinking so many ships within one week would indicate to Germany that Britain was reading Enigma. However, by chance, British forces found those two ships and sank them. The Germans investigated, but concluded Enigma had not been breached by either seizures or brute force cryptanalysis. Nevertheless, the Germans took some steps to make Enigma more secure. Grid locations (an encoded latitude and longitude) were further disguised using digraph tables and a numeric offset. The U-boats were given their own network, \"Triton\", to minimize the chance of a cryptanalytic attack.\n\nIn August 1941, the British captured . The Germans concluded the crew would have destroyed the important documents, so the cipher was safe. Even if the British had captured the materials intact and could read Enigma, the British would lose that ability when the keys changed on 1 November.\n\nAlthough Germany realized that convoys were avoiding its wolfpacks, it did not attribute that ability to reading Enigma traffic. Instead, Dönitz thought that Britain was using radar and direction finding. The \"Kriegsmarine\" continued to increase the number of networks to avoid superimposition attacks on Enigma. At the beginning of 1943, the \"Kriegsmarine\" had 13 networks.\n\nThe \"Kriegsmarine\" also improved the Enigma. On 1 February 1942, it started using the four-rotor Enigma. The improved security meant that convoys no longer had as much information about the whereabouts of wolfpacks, and were therefore less able to avoid areas where they would be attacked. The increased success of wolfpack attacks following the strengthening of the encrypytion might have have given the Germans a clue that the previous Enigma codes had been broken. However, that recognition did not happen because other things changed at the same time, the United States had entered the war and Dönitz had sent U-boats to raid the US East Coast where there were lots of easy targets.\n\nIn early 1943, Dönitz was worried that the Allies were reading Enigma. Germany's own cryptanalysis of Allied communications showed surprising accuracy in its estimates of wolfpack sizes. It was concluded, however, that Allied direction finding was the source. The Germans also recovered a cavity magnetron from a downed British bomber. The conclusion was that the Enigma was secure. The Germans were still suspicious, so each submarine got its own key net in June 1944.\n\nBy 1945, almost all German Enigma traffic (Wehrmacht military; comprising the Heer, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe; and German intelligence and security services like the Abwehr, SD, etc.) could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security. They openly discussed their plans and movements, handing the Allies huge amounts of information, not all of which was used effectively. For example, Rommel's actions at Kasserine Pass were clearly foreshadowed in decrypted Enigma traffic, but the information was not properly appreciated by the Americans.\n\nAfter the war, Allied TICOM project teams found and detained a considerable number of German cryptographic personnel. Among the things learned was that German cryptographers, at least, understood very well that Enigma messages might be read; they knew Enigma was not unbreakable. They just found it impossible to imagine anyone going to the immense effort required. When Abwehr personnel who had worked on Fish cryptography and Russian traffic were interned at Rosenheim around May 1945, they were not at all surprised that Enigma had been broken, only that someone had mustered all the resources in time to actually do it. Admiral Dönitz had been advised that a cryptanalytic attack was the least likely of all security problems.\n\nModern computers can be used to solve Enigma, using a variety of techniques. There were also projects to decrypt some remaining messages using distributed computing. Stefan Krah led an effort in Germany to crack three messages intercepted in 1942 by ; the messages were published by Ralph Erskine in a 1995 letter to \"Cryptologia\". Two of these messages were cracked in 2006, and the final one was deciphered in 2013. As of January 2018, the Enigma@home project is working on Enigma M4 message Nachricht P1030680, which was sent from U-534 on May 1, 1945.\n\n\n\n"}

Kossy was also the founder and curator of the Kooks Museum (1996–1999, online), and the editor-publisher of the magazine \"Book Happy\" (1997–2002, about \"weird and obscure books\").\n\nDescribed by \"Wired\" as \"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects\", Kossy wrote books reviewed in publications ranging from \"Fortean Times\" to \"New Scientist\". Journalist Jonathan Vankin named her \"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks\", and writer Bruce Sterling noted that she \"boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers and philosophers who were or are completely nuts\".\n\nDonna J. Kossy was born in 1957. She started doing zines in sixth grade, co-editing \"Kid Stuff\" with a friend: \"It had gossip, fashions, poetry, jokes and even movie reviews. It sold for 5 cents. My mom typed it up and Xeroxed it at work!\" After graduating college in 1979, Kossy became involved in punk culture via collage art, color xerox postcards and mail art.\n\nKossy eventually became a computer programmer, but also published zines because \"Publishing is power, pure and simple\", and turned \"author and folklorist.\"\n\nAt one time, Kossy was the housemate of fellow zine maker Pagan Kennedy. She attuned Chicago writer Dan Kelly to cult \"kook\" Francis E. Dec. In the early 1980s, she was part of the \"Processed World\" (PW) magazine, then romantically involved with anti-PW and ex-SubGenius anarchist Bob Black until 1987, moving with him to Boston in 1985.\n\nIn 1989, research for her \"Kooks Magazine\" led Kossy to abandon much of her other work. She is now married to Ken DeVries (\"a.k.a.\" Orton Nenslo), also a member of the Church of the SubGenius and contributor to their books, who provided some illustrations for her books and some articles for her website.\n\nIn 1984, Kossy started publishing \"False Positive\" (1984–1988), a Xeroxed zine which ran for eleven issues. Each issue focused on one topic (such as technology, sex, Japan, cars, crime, kooks, food & drugs) and featured related book excerpts, satire, collages, drawings, etc.\n\nThe zine and Kossy were quoted by Discordianism co-founder Kerry Thornley (alias Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst) in his 1991 foreword to the 5th edition of the \"Principia Discordia\", reprinting the \"Manifesto of the Artistic Elite of the Midwest\". Kossy said that her \"career as a crackpotologist\" started there with the \"Kooks Pages\" within each issue and the two special all-kooks issues.\n\nIn 1988, Kossy started publishing \"Kooks Magazine\" (1988–1991), now using offset printing and running for eight issues. A spinoff of the kooks pages of her zine, it was in line with the 1988 book \"High Weirdness by Mail\" by SubGenius co-founder Rev. Ivan Stang (who later praised the collected book) and featured obscure \"kooks\" as well as some better-documented \"cranks\" such as reclusive Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko in its final issue (#8, November 1991).\n\nIn \"Factsheet Five\", the zine magazine, founder-editor Mike Gunderloy described it as \"A collection of bizarre literature and semi-scholarly research on kooks: those folks who have all the answers that science and the authorities have been trying to suppress. This issue features [...] progress towards a theory of kookdom.\" then reported one year later that it \"keeps getting better; you can spend hours lost in the worldviews here.\" SubGenius and writer Richard Kadrey described it as \"indispensable for anyone interested in the real bleeding edge of thought.\" Research for the topic even led Kossy to attend a recruitment meeting of Heaven's Gate (when it was calling itself Human Individual Metamorphosis), the group that ended in a 1997 mass suicide.\n\nIn 1994, Feral House published Kossy's first book, \"Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief\", an anthology containing updated articles from her zine along with articles written exclusively for the book, with the cover illustration painted by her husband. Organized into seven parts (Religion, Science, Metaphysics, Politics, Conspiracy, Enigmas; plus Outtakes in the 2nd ed.), it documented the rants and ravings of \"kooks\" such as Richard Brothers (Anglo-Israelism alias British Israelism), Charles E. Buon (God's Envoy to the U.S.A.), Ray Crabtree (The Philosopher King), the first biography of Francis E. Dec (Your Only Hope against the Gangster Computer God), Professor Arnold Ehret (Mucusless Diet Healing System), Joe Gould alias Professor Seagull (The Longest Book Ever Written), Jim and Lila Green (Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps), Hillman Holcomb (Well Regulated Militia of Christian Technocracy), Les U. Knight (Voluntary Human Extinction Movement), alien abductee artist Paul Laffoley (Third Generation Lunatic Fringe), Alfred Lawson (Lawsonomy: The Base for Absolute Knowledge), David Linton (How Men Can Have Babies), Emil Matalik (World/U.S. Presidential Candidate Since 1964), the MIT's crank files (The Archive of Useless Research), Rose Mokry (Jewish Poisoners Are the Sole Producers of All the Diseases, Sudden Deaths and Birth Defects), Dr. Cyrus Teed (not Cyrus Tweed) alias Koresh (Koreshanity: We Actually Live on the Inside of the Earth), black supremacist Dwight York alias Malachi Z. York et al. (Ansaaru Allah Community of Nuwaubianism), etc.\n\nThe book was praised as \"a rich compendium of looniness\" by the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"indispensable for anyone interested in the real cutting edge of thought\" by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", and a \"delight\" by \"Fortean Times\". In \"Factsheet Five\", the new editor R. Seth Friedman recommended it with, \"I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. [...] Don't miss out on this book.\" Jay Kinney, publisher of \"Gnosis Magazine\", found it \"Compulsively readable. The 'kooks' collected in this volume are our true American originals and Donna Kossy chronicles their jaw-dropping messages with a rare mix of objectivity, sympathy, and wit.\" And a 1995 \"Wired\" review described Kossy as \"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects.\"\n\nIn 1995, \"Kooks Outtakes\" followed its namesake, being a 36-page supplement of material Kossy had left out for reasons of space; it was later merged with the second edition of the book in 2001, which the editor of \"Ink 19\" praised, noting that \"Kossy's style is direct and surprisingly unjudgemental. [...] Kossy is quite systematic in her research, and margin comments abound, along with a lush bibliography. This is serious stuff.\"\n\nIn 1996, Kossy founded and curated on her web site the \"Kooks Museum\" (an online summary and extension of her book \"Kooks\", updated until mid-1999 when it was discontinued and kept as an archive), explaining: \"As curator and founder of the first Kooks Museum in history I am fulfilling a half-life-long goal of housing kook ideas from all over the world under one crumbling roof. [...] The point of all this excess is neither to debunk nor to proselytize. Rather, my intent is to document and study the vast cornucopia of forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas, with all due consideration to social and cultural context. Nor do I think all ideas are equally valid. Rather, I try to be both open-minded to and skeptical of them.\"\n\nThe Museum was listed in the \"MetroActive\" guide to \"the most interesting, unusual, weird or otherwise alternative sites on the World Wide Web\" by journalist and writer on conspiracies Jonathan Vankin, who named Kossy \"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks.\"\n\nIn 1997, Kossy started editing and publishing \"Book Happy\" (1997–2002), a printed magazine which ran for seven issues. Written by Kossy and others (recurrent contributors includes Greg Bishop, Ken DeVries, Dan Howland, Dan Kelly, John Marr, Chris Mikul, David C. Morrison, Chip Rowe, Brian Tucker, Robert Tucker), it was dedicated to reviewing \"weird and obscure books\".\n\nThe magazine was complemented by her web site (later becoming its domain name) and the formation of Book Happy Booksellers () an online used book business specializing in unusual and hard-to-find items, with inventory listed on various book listing sites including Abebooks, Biblio, Alibris, Choosebooks and others. \"Book Happy\" was reviewed positively by English artist Mark Pawson (creator of \"Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book\") in a 1999 review for the British cultural magazine \"Variant\".\n\nIn 2001, Feral House published Kossy's second full-length book, \"Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes\" (right after reprinting \"Kooks\" in an expanded edition). As of August 1998, Kossy had already announced the manuscript for her second book as being finished (with a tentative title balancing between \"Aberrant Anthropology\" and \"Nazis, Saucers and Aquatic Apes\") and its publication at Feral House scheduled for \"Fall, 1999\"; it would however be two more years before the actual release.\n\nOrganized into seven parts (Extraterrestrial Origins, De-evolution, Race, Eugenics, Creationism, The Aquatic Ape Theory, and Urantia/Szukalski/H.I.M.), the book documented the fringe and pseudoscientific theories of \"crackpots\" such as David Barclay (mankind as dinosaurs pets), Helena Blavatsky (The Seven Root Races of Theosophy), Darwin's cousin Francis Galton (inventor of eugenics against regression toward the mean), Henry H. Goddard (inventor of moronism with The Kallikak Family), Madison Grant (Nordicism and scientific racism), Finnvald Hedin (The Thorians), Brinsley Le Poer Trench (UFOs from Hollow Earth), slave trader Edward Long (Polygenism: Man Comes From God, Negroes Come From Apes), Oscar Kiss Maerth (The Beginning Was the End: ape brain cannibalism), Alfred W. McCann (creationism), Elaine Morgan (aquatic ape hypothesis), Raël (creation by extraterrestrials), B. H. Shadduck (de-evolution), Zecharia Sitchin (ancient astronauts), Lothrop Stoddard (Pan-Aryanism and racial purity), Stanisław Szukalski (Zermatism: post-deluge Easter Island vs. Yetis), the \"Urantia Book\" (intelligent design by Life Carriers), George Van Tassel (Space Brothers aliens), Erich von Däniken (Ancient Astronauts from the Chariots of the Gods?), etc.\n\nThe book was praised from \"Fortean Times\" to \"Booklist\" and from the \"Washington City Paper\" to \"Counterpoise\". In a mixed review, the \"New Scientist\" noted that \"Donna Kossy's \"Strange Creatures\" [sic!] is about people who have spent rather more time on these problems than most, visiting some of the weirder reaches of the human imagination\". And Rev. Ivan Stang remarked: \"To write entertainingly for 'nonkooks' about so-called kooks, crackpots, and possible visionaries requires walking a tightrope between tolerant understanding of 'outsider' psychology and graceful sarcasm, balancing both a solid grounding in the mainstream scientific paradigm, and a healthy distrust of the status quo.\"\n\nScience-fiction writer Bruce Sterling, who also touched upon online cranks in his essay \"Electronic Text\", commented that \"Donna Kossy boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers, and philosophers who were or are completely nuts. \"Kooks\" ranks with such sociological classics as Mackay's \"Extraordinary Popular Delusions\" and Dudley's \"Mathematical Cranks\". This, for obvious reasons, is a book which every science fiction writer should possess.\" In her own words, Kossy has stated, \"I seek not to debunk strange ideas, but to present them as a necessary segment of the full spectrum of human thought.\"\n\nKossy is currently focused on her bookselling business and from November 2007 to September 2008 wrote a blog, \"The Cutthroat World of Book Scouting\" (http://bookhappy.easyjournal.com<nowiki>)</nowiki>, which chronicled her experiences in the book trade.\n\n\n\n\nMain sources used for this article:\n\n\n"}

It was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1987 and is now part of Smithsonian Folkways.\n\nThe Folkways Records & Service Co. was founded by Moses Asch and Marian Distler in 1948 in New York City. Harold Courlander was editor of the Folkways Ethnic Library at the time and is credited with coming up with the name \"Folkways\" for the label. Asch sought to record and document sounds and music from everywhere in the world. From 1948 until Asch's death in 1986, Folkways Records released 2,168 albums. In 1964, Asch helped MGM Records start Verve Folkways Records which evolved in 1967 into Verve Forecast Records. The Folkways catalog includes traditional and contemporary music from around the world as well as poetry, spoken word, language instruction, and field recordings of people and nature. Folkways was an early supporter of Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Lead Belly, who formed the center of the American folk music revival.\n\nFolkways influenced a generation of folk singers by releasing old-time music from the 1920s and 1930s, such as Dock Boggs, Clarence Ashley, and contemporary performers like the New Lost City Ramblers. The \"Anthology of American Folk Music\" appeared on Folkways, as did the accompanying album to \"The Country Blues\" by Samuel Charters. Folkways was one of the earliest companies to release albums of world music, including the \"Music of the World's Peoples\" collection edited by Henry Cowell. It also released many spoken word albums, and other unusual repertoire. The albums came with a pull-out leaflet containing extensive liner notes.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage in Washington, D.C. acquired Asch's Folkways recordings and business files after his death in 1986. This acquisition was initiated by Ralph Rinzler of the Smithsonian before Asch's death and completed by the Asch Family to ensure the sounds and artists would be preserved for future generations. As a result, it was agreed to continue Asch's policy that all of the 2,168 titles would stay in print indefinitely regardless of market sales. The Smithsonian Folkways website uses the internet to make the recordings available as streaming samples, DRM-free digital downloads in MP3 and lossless FLAC format, and on CDs via mail order.\n\nA complete set of the Folkways recordings was also donated to the University of Alberta where Michael Asch, Moses Asch's son, was an anthropology professor. \"FolkwaysAlive\", a joint initiative between the University and the Smithsonian, is involved in digitization and archiving of the collection as well as maintaining a research center and sponsoring student research scholarships and an annual concert series.\n\nSince acquiring Folkways, the Smithsonian has expanded Asch's collection by adding several other record labels, including Cook, Monitor, Fast Folk, Dyer-Bennet, and Paredon Records. They have released over 300 new recordings.\n\nSmithsonian Folkways states that their mission \"is the legacy of Moses Asch, who founded Folkways Records in 1948 to document 'people's music.'\" They \"are dedicated to supporting cultural diversity and increased understanding among peoples through the documentation, preservation, and dissemination of sound\", and that \"musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world.\" By making these recordings available, they intend to \"strengthen people's engagement with their own cultural heritage and to enhance their awareness and appreciation of the cultural heritage of others.\"\n\nSmithsonian Folkways has produced or co-produced a number of radio series based on Folkways collections. \"The Folkways Collection\" and \"Sounds to Grow On\" are co-produced with CKUA radio; \"Tapestry of the Times\" was co-produced by WYPR radio; and \"Sound Sessions\" was produced by the Smithsonian and broadcast on WAMU radio. \"Sounds to Grow On\" is hosted by Michael Asch, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Alberta and the son of Moses Asch.\n\n\n"}

On July 8, 2006, the city of Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, announced it had signed an agreement with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York City to build a Guggenheim Museum on Saadiyat Island. Upon completion, it is planned to be the largest of the Guggenheim museums. Architect Frank Gehry designed the building. Work on the site began in 2011 but was soon suspended. As of 2018, no completion date is available, and construction is still suspended. The museum collection is planned to reflect Islamic and middle-eastern culture.\n\nThe museum is part of a larger complex of arts and cultural institutions that is being built on Saadiyat Island intended to appeal to international tourists.\n\nThe museum is planned to be located on Saadiyat Island, just offshore of the city of Abu Dhabi. The island's Cultural District is planned to house the largest cluster of world-class cultural assets in Abu Dhabi. The Guggenheim building is part of a massive project to \"create an exhibition space intended to turn this once-sleepy desert city along the Persian Gulf into an international arts capital and tourist destination.\" Former Guggenheim director Thomas Krens indicated that \"The Middle East is one of the world's most important emerging regions in terms of contemporary culture.\"\n\nThe facilities at the island include the Louvre Abu Dhabi art museum designed by Jean Nouvel, which opened in 2017. Additional planned facilities include the Zayed National Museum, designed by United Kingdom-based construction company Foster and Partners under the direction of Lord Norman Foster; a performing arts centre designed by Zaha Hadid; a New York University campus, a maritime museum with concept design by Tadao Ando and a number of arts pavilions.\n\nThe Guggenheim stated in 2008 that \"Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development & Investment Company ...will own the museum\", while \"[t]he Guggenheim Foundation will establish and manage\" its program. William Mack, Chair of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, said: \"It is with a keen sense of historical precedent and with an abiding commitment to cultural exchange as a bridge to international understanding that the foundation enters into this agreement to establish a Guggenheim museum in Abu Dhabi.\"\n\nAbu Dhabi's crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, indicated that the \"signing represents the determination of the Abu Dhabi Government to create a world-class cultural destination for its residents and visitors.\n\nThe Guggenheim museum's design is by architect Frank Gehry. The lighting was designed by L'Observatoire International. Surrounded on three sides by the Persian Gulf, the site also acts as a manmade breakwater that protects the island’s northern beaches. Gehry noted, \"The site itself, virtually on the water or close to the water on all sides, in a desert landscape with the beautiful sea and the light quality of the place suggested some of the direction.\"\n\nThe museum is planned, at , to be the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's largest facility. It is designed to accommodate approximately of exhibition space. Gehry's design features exhibition galleries, education and research space, a conservation laboratory, a center for contemporary Arab, Islamic and Middle Eastern culture, and a center for \"art and technology\". Inspired by traditional middle-eastern covered courtyards and wind towers, used to cool structures exposed to the desert sun, the museum's clusters of horizontal and vertical galleries of various sizes are connected by catwalks and planned around a central, covered courtyard, incorporating natural features intended to maximize the energy efficiency of the building. The largest galleries will offer a grand scale for the display of large contemporary art installations. Parts of the building will be four stories tall with galleries stacked atop each other. The museum is intended to be a centerpiece in the island's plan for contemporary art and culture\".\n\nIn 2011, the museum began construction on a peninsula at the northwestern tip of Saadiyat Island adjacent to Abu Dhabi, but after some work on the foundation, construction was suspended the same year. The completion date was first pushed back from 2011 to 2013 then to 2015, after the emirate cancelled contracts with concrete suppliers, and again to 2017 \"amid more difficult economic times\". Continued progress awaits the approval of construction applications and contracts by the Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC). As of 2018, construction remained suspended.\n\nThe museum is intended to form its own major collection of modern contemporary art that are expected to focus on Middle-Eastern works. It will also display special exhibitions from the foundation's main collection. All works to go on display at the museum will \"respect Abu Dhabi's culture and national and Islamic heritage,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Our objective is not to be confrontational, but to be engaged in a cultural exchange,\" said Thomas Krens when asked how the boldness of contemporary art can be reconciled with conservative Muslim values. \"The Guggenheim implicitly regards all contemporary cultures and their traditions as potential partners in the field of aesthetic discourse - we are both respectful of difference and excited by it,\" he said. \"We also believe that the Middle East is one of the world's most important emerging regions in terms of contemporary culture.\"\n\nAs of 2014, Guggenheim curators have been collecting an international representation of art for the past five years. The museum plans to show a preview of these works as \"Seeing Through Light: Selections from the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Collection\" at the island's visitor's center at Saadiyat from November 2014 through January 2015.\n\nOver 130 international artists urged a boycott of the new Guggenheim museum (as well as Louvre Abu Dhabi), citing reports, since 2009, of abuses of foreign construction workers on Saadiyat Island, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions and failure of companies to pay or reimburse the steep recruitment fees being charged to laborers. According to \"Architectural Record\", Abu Dhabi has comprehensive labor laws to protect the workers, but they are not conscientiously implemented or enforced. In 2010, the Guggenheim foundation placed on its website a joint statement with TDIC recognizing the following workers' rights issues, among others: health and safety of the workers; their access to their passports and other documents that the employers have been retaining to guaranty that they stay on the job; using a general contractor that agrees to obey the labor laws; maintaining an independent site monitor; and ending the system that has been generally used in the Persian Gulf region of requiring workers to reimburse recruitment fees.\n\nIn December 2013, \"The Observer\" reported that conditions for the workers at the Louvre and New York University construction sites on Saadiyat amount to \"modern-day slavery\". In April 2014, the Guggenheim's Director, Richard Armstrong, said that he believed that living conditions for the workers at the Louvre project were now good and that \"many fewer\" of them were having their passports confiscated. He stated that the main issue then remaining was the recruitment fees charged to workers by agents who recruit them. Asked if the Guggenheim would refuse to proceed with the construction unless these issues were solved, he answered, \"we have faith that there will be progress.\"\n\nIn September 2014, the Guggenheim's architect, Gehry, commented that working with the Abu Dhabi officials to implement the law to improve the labor conditions at the museum's site is \"a moral responsibility.\" He is encouraging the TDIC to build additional worker housing and proposes that the contractor cover the cost of the recruitment fees. In 2012, TDIC engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers as an independent monitor, which issues reports every quarter. TDIC solicited bids by contractors in August 2014 and as of September 2014 was expected to hire a general contractor soon. Labor lawyer Scott Horton told \"Architectural Record\" that he hopes the Guggenheim project will influence the treatment of workers on other Saadiyat sites and will \"serve as a model for doing things right.\"\n\n"}

He founded the H. C. Frick & Company coke manufacturing company, was chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company, and played a major role in the formation of the giant U.S. Steel manufacturing concern. He also financed the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Company, and had extensive real estate holdings in Pittsburgh and throughout the state of Pennsylvania. He later built the historic neoclassical Frick Mansion (now a landmark building in Manhattan), and upon his death donated his extensive collection of old master paintings and fine furniture to create the celebrated Frick Collection and art museum. However, as a founding member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, he was also in large part responsible for the alterations to the South Fork Dam that caused its failure, leading to the catastrophic Johnstown Flood. His vehement opposition to unions also caused violent conflict, most notably in the Homestead Strike.\n\nFrick was born in West Overton, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in the United States, a grandson of Abraham Overholt, the owner of the prosperous Overholt Whiskey distillery (see Old Overholt). Frick's father, John W. Frick, was unsuccessful in business pursuits. Henry Clay Frick attended Otterbein College for one year, but did not graduate. In 1871, at 21 years old, Frick joined two cousins and a friend in a small partnership, using a beehive oven to turn coal into coke for use in steel manufacturing, and vowed to be a millionaire by the age of thirty. The company was called Frick Coke Company.\n\nThanks to loans from the family of lifelong friend Andrew W. Mellon, by 1880, Frick bought out the partnership. The company was renamed H. C. Frick & Company, employed 1,000 workers and controlled 80 percent of the coal output in Pennsylvania, operating coal mines in Westmoreland and Fayette counties, where he also operated banks of beehive coke ovens. Some of the brick and stone structures are still visible in both Fayette and Westmoreland Counties.\n\nShortly after marrying Adelaide Howard Childs, in 1881, Frick met Andrew Carnegie in New York City while the Fricks were on their honeymoon. This introduction would lead to an eventual partnership between H. C. Frick & Company and Carnegie Steel Company and, eventually, to United States Steel. This partnership ensured that Carnegie's steel mills had adequate supplies of coke. Frick became chairman of the company. Carnegie made multiple attempts to force Frick out of the company they had created by making it appear that the company had nowhere left to go and that it was time for Frick to retire. Despite the contributions Frick had made towards Andrew Carnegie's fortune, Carnegie disregarded him in many executive decisions including finances.\n\nAt the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Frick helped to found the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The charter members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club were Benjamin Ruff; T. H. Sweat, Charles J. Clarke, Thomas Clark, Walter F. Fundenberg, Howard Hartley, Henry C. Yeager, J. B. White, Henry Clay Frick, E. A. Meyers, C. C. Hussey, D. R. Ewer, C. A. Carpenter, W. L. Dunn, W. L. McClintock, and A. V. Holmes.\n\nThe sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania, and included among their number Frick’s best friend, Andrew Mellon, his attorneys Philander Knox and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's occasional business partner Andrew Carnegie. The club members made inadequate repairs to what was at that time the world's largest earthen dam, behind which formed a private lake called Lake Conemaugh. Less than downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown. Cambria Iron Company operated a large iron and steel work in Johnstown and its owner, Daniel J. Morrell, was concerned about the safety of the dam and the thoroughness of repairs made to it. Morrell had even sent his own engineer to inspect the site but little was done in the long run to satisfy his concerns and the matter was largely dropped after Morrell's death in the mid-1880s.\n\nPoor maintenance, unusually high snow melt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889, resulting in the Johnstown Flood. Other sources blame a screen placed across the spillway by the club to prevent fish from escaping, as a cause, when debris accumulated during a storm. When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims, as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club’s members. With a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equalled that of the Mississippi River,[2] the flood killed 2,209 people[3] and caused US$17 million of damage (about $450 million in 2015 dollars). Although Cambria Iron's facilities were heavily damaged, they returned to full production within a year and a half.\n\nIn 1881, Frick, already wealthy, took control of his grandfather's whiskey company, Old Overholt. Frick split ownership with Andrew Mellon and one Charles W. Mauck; each owned one-third of the company. The family's whiskey company was a sentimental side business for Frick, and was headquartered in Pittsburgh's Frick Building. In 1907, as prohibition became more popular across the country, Frick and Mellon removed their names from the distilling license, although they retained ownership in the company. Upon Frick's death in 1919, he left his share of the company to Mellon.\n\nFrick and Carnegie's partnership was strained over actions taken in response to the Homestead Steel Strike, an 1892 labor strike at the Homestead Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, called by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. At Homestead, striking workers, some of whom were armed, had locked the company staff out of the factory and surrounded it with pickets. Frick was known for his anti-union policy and as negotiations were still taking place, he ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill \"Fort Frick.\" With the mill ringed by striking workers, Pinkerton agents planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton detectives assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles (8 km) below Pittsburgh at 10:30 p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver with the object of removing the workers by force. Upon their landing, a large mêlée between workers and Pinkerton detectives ensued. Ten men were killed, nine of them workers, and there were seventy injuries. The Pinkerton agents were thrown back, and the riot was ultimately quelled only by the intervention of 8,000 armed state militia under the command of Major General George R. Snowden. During the confrontation Frick issued an ultimatum to Homestead workers, which restated his refusal to speak with union representatives and threatened to have striking workers evicted from their homes.\n\nAmong working-class Americans, Frick's actions against the strikers were condemned as excessive, and he soon became a target of even more union organizers. Because of this strike, people like Alan Petrucelli had thought that he is depicted as the \"rich man\" in Maxo Vanka's murals in St. Nicholas Croatian Church, but the Society to Preserve the Millvale Murals of Maxo Vanka (which works to preserve the artwork) says it depicts Andrew Mellon.\n\nAlexander Berkman plotted to murder Frick. On July 23, 1892 Berkman, armed with a revolver and a sharpened steel file, entered Frick's office in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nFrick, realizing what was happening, attempted to rise from his chair while Berkman pulled a revolver and fired at nearly point-blank range. The bullet hit Frick in the left earlobe, penetrated his neck near the base of the skull, and lodged in his back. The impact knocked Frick down, and Berkman fired again, striking Frick for a second time in the neck and causing him to bleed extensively. Carnegie Steel vice president (later, president) John George Alexander Leishman, who was with Frick, was then able to grab Berkman’s arm and prevented a third shot, probably saving Frick's life.\n\nFrick was seriously wounded, but rose and (with the assistance of Leishman) tackled his assailant. All three men crashed to the floor, where Berkman managed to stab Frick four times in the leg with the pointed steel file before finally being subdued by other employees, who had rushed into the office.\n\nFrick was back at work in a week; Berkman was charged and found guilty of attempted murder. Berkman's actions in planning the assassination clearly indicated a premeditated intent to kill, and he was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Negative publicity from the attempted assassination resulted in the collapse of the strike. Approximately 2,500 men lost their jobs, and most of the workers who stayed had their wages halved.\n\nFrick married Adelaide Howard Childs of Pittsburgh on December 15, 1881. They had four children: Childs Frick (born March 12, 1883), Martha Howard Frick (born August 9, 1885), Helen Clay Frick (born September 3, 1888) and Henry Clay Frick, Jr. (born July 8, 1892). In 1882, after the formation of the partnership with Andrew Carnegie, Frick and his wife bought a home they eventually called Clayton, an estate in Pittsburgh's East End. They moved into the home in early 1883. The Frick children were born in Pittsburgh and were raised at Clayton. Two of them, Henry, Jr. and Martha, died in infancy or childhood.\nIn 1904, he built Eagle Rock, a summer estate at Prides Crossing in Beverly, Massachusetts on Boston's fashionable North Shore. The 104-room mansion designed by Little & Browne was razed in 1969.\n\nFrick was a fervent art collector whose wealth allowed him to accumulate a large collection. By 1905, Henry Clay Frick's business, social, and artistic interests had shifted from Pittsburgh to New York. He took his art collection with him to New York, and served on many corporate boards, which brought him considerable opportunity to continue his lifelong business interests.\n\nFor example, as a board member of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, Frick attempted the removal of James Hazen Hyde (the founder's only son and heir) from the United States to France by seeking an appointment for him to become United States Ambassador to France. Frick had engaged a similar stratagem when orchestrating the ouster of the man who had saved his life, John George Alexander Leishman, from the presidency of Carnegie Steel a decade \nbeforehand. In that instance, Leishman had chosen to accept the post as ambassador to Switzerland. Hyde, however, rebuffed Frick's plan. He did, however, move to France, where he served as an ambulance driver during World War I and lived until the outbreak of World War II. (Coincidentally, while in France, Hyde married Leishman's eldest daughter Marthe.)\n\nThe Frick Collection is home to one of the finest collections of European paintings in the United States. It contains many works of art dating from the pre-Renaissance up to the post-Impressionist eras, but in no logical or chronological order. It includes several very large paintings by J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. In addition to paintings, it also contains an exhibition of carpets, porcelain, sculptures, and period furniture. Frick continued to live at both his New York mansion and at Clayton until his death.\n\nFrick purchased the \"Westmoreland\", a private railroad car, from the Pullman Company in 1910. The car cost nearly $40,000, and featured a kitchen, pantry, dining room, servant's quarters, two staterooms, and a lavatory. Frick frequently used the car for travel between his residences in New York City, Pittsburgh, and Prides Crossing, Massachusetts, as well for trips to places such as Palm Beach, Florida, and Aiken, South Carolina. The car remained in the Frick family until it was scrapped by Helen Clay Frick in 1965. Photographs of family and friends travelling on the \"Westmoreland\" form part of the Frick archive, as do the original construction plans and upholstery fabric samples.\n\nFrick and his wife Adelaide had booked tickets to travel back to New York on the inaugural trip of the RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912, along with J.P. Morgan. The couple canceled their trip after Adelaide sprained her ankle in Italy and missed the disastrous voyage.\n\nHenry Clay Frick died of a heart attack on December 2, 1919, weeks before his 70th birthday. He was buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.\n\nFrick left a will in which he bequeathed of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park, together with a $2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park. Frick Park opened in 1927. Between 1919 and 1942, money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park, increasing its size to almost . Following the death of Adelaide Howard Childs Frick in 1931, the Frick Collection was opened to the public as a museum in 1935.\n\nMany years after her father's death, Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton in 1981, and lived there until her death in 1984. After extensive restoration, this property was also opened to the public in 1990 as the Frick Art & Historical Center.\n\nFrick was elected an honorary member of the Alpha Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity at the New England Conservatory of Music on October 19, 1917.\n\nThe Henry Clay Frick archive of business records consisted of the documents regarding the business and financial dealings from 1849-1919. These original documents record the evolution of the period of American steel and coal industrial growth. Documentation includes first business activities, first coal firm, H.C. Frick & Company, to the formation of United States Steel Corporation on March 2, 1901. Correspondence sent and received from prominent businessmen such as Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, Andrew Mellon, Henry Oliver, H. H. Rogers, Henry Phipps, and J. P. Morgan are part of the collection. Much of the collection is available as digitized and openly accessible. Most of the collection is from 1881 to 1914, and is relevant to the history of the Pittsburgh region.\n\nFrick's great-grandfather, Henry Overholt (1739-1813) collection is also housed at the Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh Library System, University of Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lincoln would sometimes stay with the McCullough family when he reached the Bloomington, Illinois area of the circuit. McCullough became an ardent supporter of Lincoln beginning with Lincoln's successful run for Congress in 1846. With the start of the Civil War, McCullough petitioned Lincoln to allow him enlist despite his health problems and age. McCullough's request was granted and he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 4th Illinois Cavalry. \n\nAfter McCullough was killed December 5, 1862 in an engagement near Coffeeville, Mississippi, his daughter Mary Frances (\"Fanny\") was inconsolable and locked herself in her room. At the request of David Davis, a mutual friend of Lincoln and the McCullough family, Lincoln wrote to Fanny on December 23.\n\n\n"}

This map is a post-conquest document done in amate paper in a traditional cartographic history style very common in Mesoamerica (Boone, 2000) and used to recount creation myths, migrations, battles and allegiances, and to document lineages and territorial boundaries (Reyes, 1977).\n\nMapmaking is a cultural expression evidenced in different forms in any human community over time and space: From fourth century BC (400 BC) China to nineteenth century Europe, maps have been a medium that materialized or translated man's relationship to the world around it; as Harley puts it “There are few aspects of human action and thought that have not been mapped at one time or another” (Harley, 1991). Maps are a representation of place. As part of the Greek legacy, cartography stressed the “scientific”, methodical, and measurable aspects of these representations, which the European tradition embraced, dismissing the other more subjective discourses; and referring to these non-European maps as “primitive\". (see History of Cartography).\nRanging from paintings produced by the Aboriginal people of Australia (Indigenous Australians) to maps of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas (Native Americans), and from the Marshall Islands stick charts to the battle plans drawn on the ground by Māori warriors in New Zealand, they were widely regarded as an inchoate stage in the cognitive history of cartography. To the extent that they lacked orientation, regular scales, and the Euclidean geometry of modern maps, or were drawn on unfamiliar media, little effort was made to crack their codes of representation. They remained on the periphery of Western cartographic achievement. (Harley, 1991)\nAs cartography encompassed both the Western world and non-Western world expressions its definition expanded from just being cognitive structures to understand space to be a contextual historical discourse.\n\nPost-conquest indigenous cartographic expressions were an example of the conscientious combination of the foreign and indigenous styles, an active reflection of the cultural changes taking place at that moment in Mesoamerica. The maps and the mapmaking that came from Europe to the New World during the conquest were “framed by a scientific rationale, primarily accentuating economic, social, and political boundaries and often ignoring levels of signs and abstractions deeply rooted in the cultural context and social order where a map is produced” (Botero, 2006). \nWith this in mind Aztec maps were not just layouts of the empire, but actually cartographic histories. Not only those documented how things were arranged in space but they told stories and were a common method of presenting space and movement through it and Mexican historians made remarkable use of this technique (Boone, 2000). According to Elizabeth Hill Boone any story is tied to a protagonist (who), a date (when), and a location (where); and maps such as the MC2 allowed the representation of these three elements, therefore they were a suitable discourse for their stories.\n\nThe map, using an undoubtedly Mesoamerican cartographic discourse, though with minor European accents (for example in the detail of the facial expressions), describes a pilgrimage. A ritual (Boone, 2000) and cultural journey from the mythical cave of Chicomoztoc to the town of Cuauhtinchan in the heart of today's Valley of Puebla in the immediacies of the Amozoc-Tepeaca mountain range (Yoneda, 2005). It tells a story that spans about four hundred years, between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries (Reyes, 1977). The story told in this manuscript starts while the Olmeca-Xicallanca were attacking the city of Cholula, the Tolteca capital. The Tolteca rulers send two lords/priests, Icxicouatl (“Serpent Foot”) and Quetzalteueyac (“Feather Lip”) (Kirchhoff et al., 1976; Wake, 2007) to find and hire the famous Chichimeca mercenaries, “son valientes hombres, animosos y esforzados soldados (tiyacuah)” (Kirchhoff et al., 1976) that lived in Chicomoztoc to fight for them (Reyes, 1977).\nThe Chichimeca tribes left the sacred site led by Itzpapalotl, their goddess of war (Yoneda, 2002a), followed their Tolteca guides for thirteen days (Yoneda, 2002b), arrived to the city of Cholula, and defeated the Tolteca enemies, the Olmeca-Xicallanca. As reward for their services the Chichimeca-Cuauhtinchantlacas (the mapmakers' ancestors) were given the title of teuchtli and allowed to settle in the immediacies of the mountain range of Amozoc-Tepeaca, where after surveying the valley they founded Cuauhtinchan (Reyes, 1977; Yoneda, 2005). \nAdditionally, the Map tells the story of the tensions between Cuauhtinchantlacas and Popollocas, their claims to the lands of the alteptl of Cuauhtinchan, and their ultimate defeat by the Mixteca Lord 13, who pursued and killed Teuchtlecozauhqui (Kirchhoff et al., 1976). After this the Cuauhtinchantlaca survivors took refuge in Matlazinco, south of Cuauhtinchan in the bank of the Atoyac River near the current town of San Juan of Tzictlacoya (Kirchhoff et al., 1976).\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007 research on this manuscript was conducted at Harvard University. The work was carried through the Moses Mesoamerican Archive in the Department of Anthropology and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University. The Mexican American historian of religions David Carrasco was responsible for organizing the five-year study at Harvard that resulted in Cave, City, and Eagle's Nest, edited by Carrasco and his former student and colleague Scott Sessions. For a useful history of this project see the introduction to the book written by the co-editors. Carrasco did a lecture tour about the MC2 Codex in 2008 and 2009.\n\nSome interesting internal and external links to indigenous manuscripts and studies on these documents are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1854348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1854348", "title": "Michael Hayes (wrestler)", "text": "Michael Hayes (wrestler)\n\nMichael Seitz (born March 29, 1959) is an American producer, retired professional wrestler and former musician. Seitz is best known for leading The Fabulous Freebirds under the ring name Michael \"P.S.\" (\"Purely Sexy\") Hayes and for his role as an announcer under the name Dok Hendrix in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He currently works with WWE as the head of the road agents/producers.\n\nHayes started wrestling in 1977 in the Tennessee regional promotions. In 1978, he wrestled his first tour overseas in Germany for Catch Wrestling Association. In 1979,wrestling for Mid South Wrestling at the suggestion of Bill Watts he formed a tag team with Terry \"Bam Bam\" Gordy winning the Mid South Tag Team Championship 3 times and became the wrestling faction called The Fabulous Freebirds. Hayes became Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes, and they strutted their way to many tag team titles along with Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts. Hayes also started moonwalking in the ring like Michael Jackson used to do in concert.\n\nThe Freebirds spent 1980 through 1982 in the NWA's Georgia Championship Wrestling area, where they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship a few times, split and feuded, then mended fences.\n\nIn 1982, they left for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), where they had one of their most famous feuds. Hayes was chosen by the fans to be the special guest referee during the Ric Flair-Kerry Von Erich NWA World Heavyweight Championship steel cage match at Christmas Star Wars. Hayes at one point knocked Flair out so Von Erich could get the pin and the title. Von Erich refused to pin him after the dirty deed which ultimately led to Gordy slamming the cage door on Von Erich's head. As this later cost him the title, it triggered the legendary feud between The Fabulous Freebirds and The Von Erichs and ended a good respectful friendship between both groups. The Freebird-Von Erich feud ended for good in 1993 during a memorial card in tribute to Kerry Von Erich.\n\nHayes was always the leader of the group with his exceptional mic skills and he recorded the team's new theme song, \"Badstreet USA\", in 1983. The video to the song features all three of The Fabulous Freebirds as well as Jimmy Garvin, who was often considered the fourth Freebird. They had used the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Free Bird\" and Willie Nelson's version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" up to that point and would on occasion in the future.\n\nIn 1984, The Freebirds had a brief stint in the WWF but left when management wanted to split them up. The Freebirds then spent a few months in the AWA in 1985, feuding with The Road Warriors over the AWA World Tag Team Championship, winning the belts temporarily at the inaugural SuperClash event before the AWA overturned the decision. The Freebirds interfered in the match where the Warriors lost the belts to Jimmy Garvin and Steve Regal, and subsequently returned to Texas.\n\nIn 1986, Hayes appeared in the opening credits of \"Highlander\" alongside The Fabulous Freebirds, working his Purely Sexy gimmick on the turnbuckle while writhing free of his ring robe.\n\nThe Freebirds also spent several months in the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1986 and early 1987 with Sunshine as their manager. There they feuded with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers) and with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams.\n\nIn 1986, Hayes' partner in the Freebirds, Terry Gordy, became the first holder of the UWF heavyweight title. After losing the title by default to One Man Gang, the Freebirds engaged in a major heel vs heel feud with Skandor Akbar's Devastation Inc. group. The feud continued even after Akbar double-crossed Gang and helped Big Bubba Rogers win the title from him, and saw the Freebirds form an alliance with their former enemy Williams against Devastation Inc.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Freebirds, Hayes became a full-fledged babyface and remained in the UWF, which was later sold to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) on April 9, 1987. At the JCP/UWF co-promoted pay-per-view event Starrcade '87, Hayes teamed with Jimmy Garvin (also now a babyface after reconciling with kayfabe brother Ron Garvin) and Sting to face the team of Eddie Gilbert, Rick Steiner and Larry Zbyszko whom they wrestled to a time-limit draw. He later challenged NWA World Champion Ric Flair and frequently teamed with Jimmy Garvin.\n\nHayes returned to World Class Championship Wrestling to find that his former Freebird partners Gordy and Roberts, in alliance with Iceman Parsons and The Angel of Death, had resumed their feud with the Von Erichs. After Gordy and Roberts helped Parsons win the World Class heavyweight title from Kerry Von Erich by bashing Kerry with socks loaded with weights while the arena lights were mysteriously turned off, a disgusted Hayes allied himself with the Von Erichs against his former Freebird 'brothers'.\n\nAt the 1988 Parade of Champions, Gordy defeated Hayes in a hair vs hair \"triple dome of terror\" (three vertically stacked cages) match. After the match, however, Gordy refused to cut Hayes' hair and instead turned babyface on Roberts and cut \"his\" hair. Subsequently, Hayes and Gordy reunited as babyfaces and feuded with Roberts and his Samoan Swat Team as well as old Freebird enemies Devastation Inc, of whom Parsons was now a member.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Hayes continued with his music career, often playing concerts with his Badstreet Band at the Dallas Sportatorium, World Class's main arena. Inevitably, the music career overlapped with World Class' storylines when, at one such concert, Roberts appeared onstage and hit Hayes over the head with a guitar. Hayes also formed a new tag team with \"Do It To It\" Steve Cox and together they twice briefly beat the Samoan Swat Team for the World Class tag team titles, on September 12–16, 1988 and October 15–17, 1988.\n\nIn 1989, Hayes went to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) (formerly JCP) where he wrestled as a face. He turned on U.S. Champ Lex Luger during a match with Hiro Matsuda's \"Yamazaki Corporation\" and joined them. The stable included Ric Flair, Barry and Kendall Windham, and Butch Reed. Hayes feuded with Luger and won the U.S. Title from him after Terry Gordy surprised everybody and interfered in the match. Luger later regained the title from Hayes and The Freebirds entered the tournament to crown new NWA World tag team champions.\n\nAt , on June 14, 1989, Jimmy Garvin showed up as the newest Freebird and he and Hayes won the tournament and titles (thus reuniting their old tag team from JCP circa 1987). The new champions immediately feuded with The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). Gordy left in late 1989 and Hayes and Garvin feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson).\n\nIn 1991, The Freebirds feuded with \"The Young Pistols\" (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers). They soon added another Freebird, the masked Badstreet. He helped them win the U.S. Tag Team Titles and they all won the Six-Man Titles. They also had two managers briefly, Big Daddy Dink and Diamond Dallas Page. Once Badstreet departed from the group in late 1991, The Freebirds were left with no real direction. The Freebirds turned face, and Garvin's wife Precious became their on-screen manager. Although they won the U.S. Tag Titles again, The Freebirds disbanded by late 1992.\n\nHayes then turned heel again and started managing Arn Anderson and Bobby Eaton, who were still members of the Dangerous Alliance. He became a member of sorts and even helped Paul E. Dangerously in his feud with Madusa. In 1993, Hayes became a fan favorite again and feuded with Paul Orndorff over the TV Title and then briefly teamed (and later feuded) with Johnny B. Badd and also did some commentating before quitting WCW in January 1994, after being offered a $75,000 a year contract (Hayes would make one final appearance in WCW at SuperBrawl IV in February).\n\nHe went back to Dallas to the Global Wrestling Federation and reunited with Garvin and Gordy as The Freebirds, whom he managed them to win their Tag Team Championship, before the company folded that September. After the GWF folded, Hayes remained in Dallas for the National Wrestling Alliance's stay in Dallas, which lasted until April 1995.\n\nMichael Hayes received a tryout match with the WWF on February 21, 1995 at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping in Augusta, Georgia. Wrestling in a dark match, Hayes competed as a face and defeated Ken Raper. However he retired from active competition due to a serious back injury he suffered while in WCW and after the NWA's Dallas promotion ended, and debuted on April 14 instead as Dok Hendrix, \"WWF Action Zone\" co-host with Todd Pettengill. As Dok Hendrix, he interviewed wrestlers before their matches and initially acted more like a heel, though that was later dropped. His most famous interviews include \"The birth of Austin 3:16,\" \"The Super Soaker DX\" commercials, and hosting most of WWF's products. Hayes also worked as a color commentator in 1995 with Vince McMahon on \"WWF Superstars\" and on the In Your House 1 and the 1995 King of the Ring pay-per-view events.\n\nHayes returned to active competition in 1999 for Power Pro Wrestling, where he won the promotion's title. He soon came back to WWF TV as the manager for The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy). The Hardy Boyz lost the Tag Team Titles to The Acolytes at Fully Loaded when Hayes was pinned in a handicap match; he was fired by them in August.\n\nHe then became a backstage road agent and color commentator for the WWF. Initially appearing for one night on the September 23, 1999 broadcast of \"SmackDown!\", Hayes became a color commentator on \"Sunday Night Heat\" alongside Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly from 2000 to 2001, although he was mostly used on the international broadcasts of that show. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, he competed in the gimmick Battle Royal, but was eliminated by the One Man Gang.\n\nHayes received some attention when it became known that, prior to the November 13, 2003 episode of \"SmackDown\" he had canvassed for John Cena (then a face) to attack his tag team partner Chris Benoit (also a face) after they had won their match. Hayes believed that adding an \"edge\" to Cena's character could recreate the popularity of Stone Cold Steve Austin. After the live crowd reacted badly to the storyline, it was cut from the \"SmackDown!\" broadcast.\n\nDuring the December 5, 2005 episode of \"RAW\", he became involved in verbal sparring with Edge in which Hayes attacked Edge's lack of main event experience and the details of his love life (with regard to Matt Hardy and Lita). Hayes was later attacked by Edge.\n\nIn October 2006, Hayes became the head creative writer for the \"SmackDown\" brand after Alex Greenfield's departure from the company. He can be seen on the second season of WWE Classics on Demand series \"Legends of Wrestling\".\n\nHayes made occasional appearances on WWE programmes: on the December 7, 2007 episode of \"SmackDown\", Hayes was a guest of MVP's VIP Lounge. Hayes promoted the new \"Triumph and Tragedy of WCCW\" DVD and reinforced its anti-drug message. However, Hayes ended up being attacked by MVP before being saved by Rey Mysterio, Jr.\n\nOn June 28, 2010 episode of \"Raw\", Hayes was one of several Legends who accompanied Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, who was out to promote his new DVD. Hayes and the other legends were later attacked by the NXT season 1 graduates, collectively known as The Nexus. On the May 12, 2011 episode of \"WWE Superstars\", Hayes accompanied Tyson Kidd to the ring but turned on him a week later after Kidd lost his match to Yoshi Tatsu. Hayes hit Kidd, stating he had better things to do than hang around losers.\n\nIn October 2013, Hayes took a leave of absence from WWE for personal reasons, but he returned to work on December 2, 2013.\n\nOn August 1, 2014 Hayes appeared in a short segment on the online series \"JBL and Cole Show\" in which he stared at a \"Free Birds, call to enquire\" flier. In February 2015, Hayes partook in a WWE.com interview alongside Arn Anderson with Michael Cole to discuss Triple H and Sting's match at WrestleMania 31.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Hayes was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame with the Fabulous Freebirds. Hayes accepted the award alongside Jimmy Garvin.\n\nIn 1987, on the back of the popularity of the \"Badstreet USA\" theme, Hayes recorded and released an album, \"Off The Streets\". He also performed live concerts to promote the album with his backing band, the Badstreet Band. The July 1988 issue of Pro Wrestling Illustrated (written circa March 1988) contained a (possibly kayfabed) column by writer Dave Rosenbaum in which he visited the box office for a Badstreet Band show and surveyed what sort of people would actually go to Hayes' concerts.\n\nIn 1992, Hayes performed a duet with music producer Darwin Conort called \"Freebird Forever\" on the WCW album, \"Slam Jam 1\".\n\nIn 2011, Hayes paid tribute to his Freebird brother Terry Gordy, who died of a heart attack caused by a blood clot in 2001, with a song entitled \"Freebird Road\". His music video was an emotional and stirring trip down memory lane as a Freebird and shows shots of him at Gordy's grave.\n\n\n\n\nTrack list:\n\n"}

The center provides a variety of film and video exhibition, education and information programs primarily directed to the residents of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska.\n\nThe center was founded as the Northwest Film Study Center in 1971, and incorporated into the Portland Art Museum in 1978.\n\nThe center was located in Portland's historic Guild Theatre from 1998 to 2006.\n\nSponsors of the center include the National Endowment for the Arts, Oregon Arts Commission, Oregon Cultural Trust, Washington State Arts Commission, Regional Arts & Culture Council, The Ted R. Gamble Film Endowment, The Rose E. Tucker Charitable Trust, The Paul G. Allen Foundation for the Arts, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission.\n\nThe Center offers college credit in association with Portland State University, Marylhurst University, and the Pacific Northwest College of Art. \n\nThere are three levels of the certificate program. All require the same four core classes: Art of Filmmaking (using 8 mm film), Digital Video Editing (with final cut pro), Shooting Digital Video, and Sound Recording and Post. A final project is required for each level, which is made over a two-term period (in the winter and the summer) in a class called advanced production and advanced editing. The final projects are shown at the Portland Art Museum Whitsell Auditorium in the Fall.\n\nOne elective class is required for level 1, and two elective classes are required for levels 2 and 3. Level 2 requires three additional classes -- Narrative Traditions, Documentary Forms & Visions, and Experimental Film & Video. Level 3 adds a requirement for a class on 16 mm. In addition, 10 - 12 hours of workshop time is required for level 1, 15 - 20 hours of workshop time required for level 2, and 20+ hours of workshop time required for level 3. Workshops are short classes lasting an afternoon or an entire day offered periodically throughout the year, often by visiting filmmakers. As all of the classes have sections in the evenings, it is possible to complete the certificate program while working full-time.\nThe school's 36 instructors are mostly working filmmakers with several hundred years total experience.\n\nThe film center rents a wide range of filmmaking equipment to students, artists, and for commercial use. Preference is to the school's students. It has standard video, super 8, and 16 mm film equipment, along with a full range of sound capture, lighting, electrical supplies.\n\nEvents at the NWFC include the Portland International Film Festival, the Northwest Filmmakers' Festival, Reel Music Film Festival, Portland Jewish Film Festival and the Young People's Film Festival.\n\nPast judges of the Northwest Filmmakers' Festival (previously known as the Northwest Film and Video Festival) have included Gus Van Sant, Matt Groening, Todd Haynes, Christine Vachon, Bill Plympton, Dan Ireland, Karen Cooper of Filmforum, B. Ruby Rich, Amy Taubin, J. Hoberman, and John Cooper, Sundance Film Festival and Outfest programmer.\n\n"}

It is included in Office 365, Exchange Server, and Exchange Online. It includes a web-based email client, a calendar tool, a contact manager, and a task manager. It also includes add-in integration, Skype on the web, and alerts as well as unified themes that span across all the web apps. Outlook on the web is navigated using the App Launcher icon which brings down a list of web apps from which the user may choose. In 2015, Microsoft started upgrading Outlook.com and Outlook on the web to use the Office 365 infrastructure, which was almost complete in January 2017 after the next version of Outlook.com was released.\n\nOutlook on the web is available to Office 365 and Exchange Online subscribers, and is included with the on-premises Exchange Server, to enable users to connect to their email accounts via a web browser, without requiring the installation of Microsoft Outlook or other email clients. In case of Exchange Server, it is hosted on a local intranet and requires a network connection to the Exchange Server for users to work with e-mail, address book, calendars and task. The Exchange Online version, which can be bought either independently or through Office 365 licensing program, is hosted on Microsoft servers on the world wide web.\n\nOutlook Web Access was created in 1995 by Microsoft Program Manager Thom McCann on the Exchange Server team. An early working version was demonstrated by Microsoft Vice President Paul Maritz at Microsoft's famous Internet summit in Seattle on December 27, 1995. The first customer version was shipped as part of the Exchange Server 5.0 release in early 1997.\n\nThe first component to allow client-side scripts to issue HTTP requests (XMLHTTP) was originally written by the Outlook Web Access team. It soon became a part of Internet Explorer 5. Renamed XMLHttpRequest and standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium, it has since become one of the cornerstones of the Ajax technology used to build advanced web apps.\n\nOutlook Web Access was later renamed Outlook Web App. An update on August 4, 2015 renamed OWA to \"Outlook on the web\".\n\nMail is the webmail component of Outlook on the web. The default view is a three column view with folders and groups on the left, email in the middle, and the selected message on the right. With the 2015 update, Microsoft introduced the ability to pin, sweep and archive messages, and undo the last action, as well as richer image editing features. It can connect to other services such as GitHub and Twitter through Office 365 Connectors. Actionable Messages in emails allows a user to complete a task from within the email, such as retweeting a Tweet on Twitter or setting a meeting date on a calendar.\n\nOutlook on the web supports S/MIME and includes features for managing calendars, contacts, tasks, documents (used with SharePoint or Office Web Apps), and other mailbox content. In the Exchange 2007 release, Outlook on the web (still called Outlook Web App at the time) also offers read-only access to documents stored in SharePoint sites and network UNC shares.\n\nCalendar is the calendaring component of Outlook on the web. With the update, Microsoft added a weather forecast directly in the Calendar, as well as icons (or \"charms\") as visual cues for an event. In addition, email reminders came to all events, and a special Birthday and Holiday event calendars are created automatically. Calendars can be shared and there are multiple views such as day, week, month, and today. Another view is work week which includes Mondays through Fridays in the calendar view.\n\nCalendar details can be added with HTML and rich-text editing, and files can be attached to calendar events and appointments.\n\nPeople is the contact manager component of Outlook on the web. A user can search and edit existing contacts, as well as create new ones. Contacts can be placed into folders and duplicate contacts can be linked from multiple sources such as LinkedIn or Twitter. In Outlook Mail, a contact can be created by clicking on an email address sender, which pulls down a contact card with an add button to add to Outlook People. Contacts can be imported as well as placed into a list that can be utilized when composing an email in Outlook Mail.\n\nPeople can also sync with friends and connections lists on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nTasks was originally launched as \"Tasks for Outlook Web App\". Microsoft was slowly rolling out a preview of Tasks to its consumer-based Outlook.com service that in May 2015, was announced to be moving to the Office 365 infrastructure. It was initially a part of Calendar as a view. Microsoft has separated the services into its own web app in Outlook on the web. In a post on the Office Blogs in 2015, Microsoft announced that Outlook Web App would be renamed Outlook on the web and that Tasks would move under that brand. A user can create tasks, put them into categories, and move them to another folder. A feature added was the ability to set due days and sort and filter the tasks according to those criteria. The app provides the user with fields such as subject, start and end dates, percent complete, priority, and how much work was put into each task. Rich editing features like bold, italic, underline, numbering, and bullet points were also introduced. Tasks can be edited and categorized according to how the user wishes them to be sorted.\n\nOutlook on the web has had two interfaces available: one with a complete feature set (known as Premium) and one with reduced functionality (known as Light or sometimes Lite). Prior to Exchange 2010, the Premium client required Internet Explorer. Exchange 2000 and 2003 require Internet Explorer 5 and later, and Exchange 2007 requires Internet Explorer 6 and later. Exchange 2010 supports a wider range of web browsers: Internet Explorer 7 or later, Firefox 3.01 or later, Chrome, or Safari 3.1 or later. However, Exchange 2010 restricts its Firefox and Safari support to macOS and Linux. In Exchange 2013, these browser restrictions were lifted.\n\nIn Exchange 2010 and earlier, the Light user interface is rendered for browsers other than Internet Explorer. The basic interface did not support search on Exchange Server 2003. In Exchange Server 2007, the Light interface supported searching mail items; managing contacts and the calendar was also improved. The 2010 version can connect to an external email account.\n\n\n"}

Originating from early online discussions about rave culture conducted on Usenet, it has been commonly used since the early 1990s when it became commonplace in club flyers and especially on club paraphernalia advertising underground outdoor trance parties. It has since expanded to the larger rave dance music culture as well.\n\nIt may be interpreted as the essential philosophy of life for ravers and clubbers, at least insomuch as it relates to interpersonal relationships, with basic directions on how people are expected to behave at a rave gathering. This universalist philosophy underpinning the tribal dance culture which began circling the globe with the rise of the internet, theoretically takes precedence over any chemical or musical aspects of the rave scene. Raves represent a modern ritualistic experience, promoting a strong communal sense, where PLUR is considered an ideology.\n\n\nPLUR is an aggregation of ideas synonymous with the earlier hippy and hip hop culture, with the peace movement being an essential starting point to any be-in encounter or rave. \n\nUse of the term 'PLUR' dates to the late 1980s and early 1990s rave scene in the UK which incorporated house and acid house music that originated in Chicago during the 1980s. The term began as an informal discussion on usenet lists alt.rave and alt.culture.zippies. SF-raves mailing list archived at hyper-real also noted the use of the term, and there is a flyer archive which might contain evidence of the existence of the term.\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the term outside the internet, mostly anecdotal, appears to be DJ Frankie Bones in June 1993. Supposedly in response to a fight that broke out at one of his epic Storm Raves in Brooklyn, New York, Bones is said to have got on the microphone and yelled: \"If you don't start showing some peace, love, and unity, I'll break your faces.\"\n\nLater incarnations and variations of PLUR can be seen in the adoption of Pronoia and also Ubuntu, with PLUR and Pronoia often being interchangeable terms, depending upon one's company. \n\nSeveral other variations on the same four words, but in a different order (e.g. LURP), have been proposed. However, none of these are commonly used.\n\n"}

Under New Jersey state law, tenured teachers have to be laid off in reverse order of seniority. However, the board faced a problem, as the district's least senior tenured teachers, Sharon Taxman (a white teacher) and Debra Williams (an African-American teacher), had started working at the school on the same day, and thus had equal seniority. In the interest of maintaining racial diversity (Williams was the only African-American teacher in the department, and 50% of the students were minorities), the school board voted to lay off Taxman. Taxman complained to the EEOC, saying that the board had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and was given authority to file suit against the board.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in favor of Taxman.\n\nThe school board appealed to the United States Supreme Court and a hearing was scheduled for January 1998, but civil rights groups, fearing that the case could lead to the prohibition of affirmative action, provided money for the board to settle the case out of court, so the case was never heard.\n\nTaxman was subsequently rehired, and later reassigned to Conackamack Middle School.\n\nWilliams retired at the conclusion of the 2009-2010 school year.\n\n"}

The goal of the Ross Farm Museum is to give visitors an understanding of the importance of Nova Scotia's rural heritage. It includes a country store displaying the types of products available then, a working cooper shop, historic breeds of farm animals, a blacksmith, a working farm, and a village school house. Costumed guides are on hand to explain life in that time period. Wagon rides are often available. Ross Farm is a member of the Nova Scotia Museum network.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, the village of Sherbrook (renamed New Ross) and the Ross Farm were established by William Ross (1783–1822) in 1816. William Ross was originally from Cork, Ireland. During the Napoleonic Wars, he became part of the British Army 16th Regiment of Foot and stationed in Fort Amsterdam, Surinam. His wife Mary accompanied him. They had their second child while they were there. During their return to Britain, they survived their ship being wrecked on the Tuskar Rock off the coast of Wexford, Ireland. \n\nWilliam and Mary moved to Sunderland, England, where their son Edward Ross (1813–1894) was born, the author of the diaries on which the museum is based. During the War of 1812, as a soldier in the 16th Regiment, William Ross and his family moved to British North America and were stationed at Fort Coteau-du-Lac, Quebec. The Battle of the Chateauguay happened while he was there. His role in the battle is unknown. Lieutenant William Ross chose to transfer to the Nova Scotia Fencibles Infantry while in Quebec.\n\nAfter the war, upon their return to Nova Scotia, the Ross family again survived the sinking of their ship Archduke Charles off the coast of Green Island (Jeddore Ledges, Nova Scotia). Capt. Ross arrived in Halifax where he and his family were hosted by John Lawson, Esquire. In gratitude to their host, Capt. Ross named the lake below the settlement Lawson Lake after his Haligonian host. \n\nThe Fencibles were disbanded on 25 July 1816. Two weeks later, on 7 August 1816, William Ross led 172 former soldiers who were given land grants along the newly burned road between Chester and Kentville, Nova Scotia. Six years later on 2 May 1822, William Ross died suddenly at the age of 39 and was buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia). Four months later, his wife Mary gave birth to their fourth child. \n\nWilliam’s son Edward Ross kept a diary for most of his life. The Ross Farm Museum is based on the diaries Edward wrote when he was a young man age 22-28 (1835–1841). During this time on the farm, he sold produce from the local community in his store and also made a trip by boat from Chester to Halifax every spring. He was also a justice of the peace. \nAt age 28, Edward left the community and married Marie three years later at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia (1844). At age 52, Edward spent time in jail for not being able to pay his debts (1865). Five years later he went to Boston in search of work. While there, he heard the famous Lucy Stone speak at the Massachusetts State House(1872). They returned to Kentville, Nova Scotia until Marie died (1882). Edward lived for twelve more years. He eventually moved back to the Ross Farm. He lived on the farm for the last three years of his life. He died at age 81 (1894).\n\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

It was officially launched in 1964. It is now owned by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters). The larger version (Science Citation Index Expanded) covers more than 8,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from 1900 to the present. These are alternatively described as the world's leading journals of science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process.\n\nThe index is made available online through different platforms, such as the Web of Science and SciSearch.

This database allows a researcher to identify which later articles have cited any particular earlier article, or have cited the articles of any particular author, or have been cited most frequently. Thomson Reuters also markets several subsets of this database, termed \"Specialty Citation Indexes\", such as the Neuroscience Citation Index and the Chemistry Citation Index.\n\nThe Chemistry Citation Index was first introduced by Eugene Garfield, a chemist by training. His original \"search examples were based on [his] experience as a chemist\". In 1992 an electronic and print form of the index was derived from a core of 330 chemistry journals, within which all areas were covered. Additional information was provided from articles selected from 4,000 other journals. All chemistry subdisciplines were covered: organic, inorganic, analytical, physical chemistry, polymer, computational, organometallic, materials chemistry, and electrochemistry.\n\nBy 2002 the core journal coverage increased to 500 and related article coverage increased to 8,000 other journals. \n\nOne 1980 study reported the overall citation indexing benefits for chemistry, examining the use of citations as a tool for the study of the sociology of chemistry and illustrating the use of citation data to \"observe\" chemistry subfields over time.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3028988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3028988", "title": "Segedunum", "text": "Segedunum\n\nSegedunum was a Roman fort at modern-day Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, England, UK. The fort lay at the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall (in Wallsend) near the banks of the River Tyne, forming the easternmost portion of the wall. It was in use as a garrison for approximately 300 years, from around 122 AD, almost up to 400AD.\n\nToday, Segedunum is the most thoroughly excavated fort along Hadrian's Wall, and is operated as Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths and Museum.\n\nFive places named Segedunum are known to have existed in the Roman empire, one each in Britain and Germany and three in Gaul.\n\nThe name \"Segedunum\" is known from the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" of the 4th century, but there is no consensus on its meaning. The various conjectures include \"derived from the Celtic for 'powerful' or 'victorious'\", \"derived from the [Celtic] words \"sego\" ('strength') and \"dunum\" ('fortified place')\", \"Romano-British \"Segedunum\" 'Strong-fort'\", and \"Celtic \"sechdun\" or 'dry hill'\".\n\nThe first element of the name is attested widely in Gaul, Spain, Germany and Italy, and derives from the Indo-European root \"segh-\", which is reflected in various later European languages with similar meanings: Irish \"seg-\", \"segh-\" 'strength, vigour', Welsh \"hy\" 'daring, bold', German \"Sieg\" 'victory', and so on. As applied to place names, it appears to have had the meaning of \"place of strength\" or \"place of victory\". The second element, \"-dunum\", is a Celtic term widely attested across Britain and Gaul and typically meant a fort. Thus \"Segedunum\" probably had the meaning of \"strong fort\" or \"victory fort\".\n\nThe Roman wall originally terminated at Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne). Work began at Pons Aelius in 122AD and proceeded towards the west. Subsequently, in about 127AD, the wall was extended further east, possibly to protect the river crossing at Pons Aelius. A four-mile section of the wall east from the fort of Pons Aelius, passing through present-day Byker and ending at the new fort of Segedunum was built. The new section of wall was narrower than the sections previously built, being on a foundation of . Unlike the rest of the wall, the extension had no vallum.\n\nThe fort measured from north to south and from east to west, covering an area of . A wide ditch and an earth embankment surrounded the fort on all sides. It had four double gates with the east, west and north gates opening outside the wall and only the south gate opening within the wall. The wall joined to the west wall of the fort just south of the west gate. From the southeast angle of the fort, a wide wall ran down to the riverbank and extended at least as far as the low water level.\n\nThere is evidence that there was an extensive vicus, or village surrounding the fort, including the area to the north of the wall.\n\nThe original garrison of Segedunum is unknown, but in the 2nd century Cohors II Nerviorum was stationed there. In the 3rd and 4th centuries the part-mounted Fourth Cohort of the Lingones occupied the fort, as recorded in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\". Both units were 600 strong, consisting of 120 cavalry and 480 infantry.\n\nSometime round about 400AD the fort was abandoned. For centuries the area remained as open farmland, but in the 18th century, collieries were sunk near the fort and the area gradually became a populous pit village. Eventually, in 1884, the whole fort disappeared under terraced housing.\n\nIn 1929 some excavations were carried out which recorded the outline of the fort. The local authority marked out this outline in white paving stones. In the 1970s the terraced houses covering the site were demolished.\n\nA section of Hadrian's Wall was excavated and a reconstruction built in the early 1990s. The Segedunum project began in January 1997 with a series of excavations in and around the Fort, as well as the construction of the bath house and the conversion of former Swan Hunter shipyard buildings to house the new museum. Segedunum Roman Fort, Baths & Museum opened to the public in June 2000.\n\nThe site of the fort now contains the excavated remains of the buildings' foundation of the original fort, as well as a reconstructed Roman military bathhouse based on excavated examples at Vindolanda and Chesters forts. A museum contains items of interest that were found when the site was excavated, and a large observation tower overlooks the site. A portion of the original wall is visible across the street from the museum, and a reconstruction of what the whole wall might have looked like. The central section of Hadrian's Wall was erected atop the Whin Sill, a geological formation that offers a natural topographic defence against invaders or immigrants from the north. However at the eastern end of the wall, the main topographic defence was the River Tyne itself, and the very final stretch of the wall ran down from Segedunum fort to the river's edge. There may have been a statue or monument to mark the very end of the wall, but if there ever was, it no longer exists.\n\nNorth Tyneside Council provided accommodation in the newly built Battle Hill Estate for the owners of all the houses demolished when the site was cleared. The name Wallsend comes from Segedunum being at the easternmost end of Hadrian's Wall; the westernmost end is at Bowness-on-Solway.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "152501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152501", "title": "Susning.nu", "text": "Susning.nu\n\nSusning.nu (literally meaning \"clue.now\") was a Swedish language wiki website created by Lars Aronsson (also the founder of Project Runeberg) in 2001 and active until 2009. In its first three years, Susning.nu ran as an open wiki that anyone could edit. Susning did not have a pronounced ambition and could be compared in scope to Everything2; Aronsson's stated original aim for Susning was \"to make it into whatever the users want it to be\". As such, Susning was an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a discussion forum about any concept of interest to its users. Because of this, Susning grew and became Sweden's biggest and the world's next biggest wiki.\n\nAt its peak in April 2004, Susning had over 60,000 articles on various topics, which was more than any other Swedish wiki at that time. During its first few years, it was in direct competition with the Swedish Wikipedia. However, because of the website's popularity, Susning was highly affected by vandals. In attempt at preventing vandalism, many efforts were made by Susning's founder Lars Aronsson, which were mostly unsuccessful. Users who regularly edited at Susning were called \"susare\".\n\nSusning.nu was started on August 31, 2001, by Lars Aronsson and functioned as part of his personal website. It changed to Susning.nu on September 29, and was released on October 1. During October that year, Susning.nu was indexed by the bigger web search engines, and the article collection firmly increased. In one year, Susning.nu grew with 10,000 articles, and more features were added. Among them were link statistics for all pages, and date searching which automatically generated dates and search links in several languages. The first edit war broke out on July 31, 2002.\n\nSusning used a heavily modified version of UseModWiki as its wiki engine. Its domain name .nu, which belongs to the island of Niue in Oceania but which is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen as a domain hack, because \"nu\" means \"now\" in Swedish (as well as Danish and Dutch). \"\"Skaffa dig en susning.nu\" was the slogan of Susning and translates to \"Get a clue.now\"\". (The standard top level domain for Sweden is .se.)\n\nA significant difference from the Swedish Wikipedia was that Susning did not have any voluntary administrators who could assist in blocking other users; the only person who could do that on Susning was Lars Aronsson. As Susning grew, the issue with vandalism became bigger. In December 2003, Susning was affected by a vandal who had automatized their activity through a script. In just a few minutes, thousands of articles were deleted. Several users were forced to spend hours restoring them. The issues increased even further with vandals who added pornographic images and made the site inaccessible. The issues with vandalism were practically going on daily. To aid removal and discovery of vandalism, a \"karma system\" was added on February 22, 2004. The system derailed fairly soon, as the karma only could decrease. Because of this, even the most established \"susare\" were affected by bad karma. The karma system was shut down on March 25, 2004.\n\nAs a last attempt at preventing vandalism, the ability to see images was shut down entirely on April 5, 2004. However, a couple of days later it was possible to add images from certain chosen domain names. Due to a bug in the system, there were ways to evade this, which the vandals utilised. The bug was fixed on April 15, 2004, but a few minutes later that day, all editing on Susning.nu was shut down. Aronsson announced that the editing abilities would be shut down until a solution to the vandalism issues had been found, and that a password system would be imposed. No details were given for the time being. A couple dozen of logged in \"susare\" had edited a fairly huge amount of articles since the password lock was imposed.\n\nAfter the imposing of the password lock, Susning became a more inactive project, and a dozen users made almost all edits. In March 2004, before the password system was imposed, articles were saved approximately 36,000 times; by May, this had been reduced to 1,600 times. On May 11, 2004, editing on Susning.nu was temporarily opened for non-logged in users, but after just 18 hours, vandalism once again became such a big problem that non-logged in editing was once again shut down. In March 2006, editing by non-logged in users was opened on Sunday afternoons between 12:00–16:00. A year later, editing between 06:00–07:00 each day was enabled as well. Overall, this worked well but with a bit of vandalism.\n\nIn mid-2008, the website was affected by a persistent spammer who used proxy servers to spam different articles with English advertisement links. In April 2009, this forced Aronsson to remove the daily editing abilities between 06:00–07:00. The editing abilities during Sunday afternoons, however, continued to be open despite recurring spam attacks. By this time, very few users were still creating and editing articles on the website, which was shut down entirely in mid-August 2009; no reason for this was ever announced.\n\nAn aired opinion was that Susning's status as a one-man project on the technical side was a big aberration.

The library is one of the largest special collections repositories in the United States. Its collections, consisting of over half a million volumes and three kilometers of manuscript material, encompass the broad areas of literature, history, art, theology, philosophy, technology and the natural sciences, and include large collections of emblem books, writings of and works about John Milton, and authors' personal papers.\n\nFrom the founding of the University Library into the twentieth century, rare materials were housed within the main stacks. Significant early acquisitions, now housed in the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, include the Richard Aron collection on German pedagogy (20,000 items), acquired in 1913; the H. A. Rattermann collection of German-American literature (7,000 items), acquired in 1915; the James Collins collection of Irish literature (over 7.000 items), acquired in 1917; the Julius Doerner collection on theology, history, and literature (50,000 items), acquired in 1918; and the Antonio Cavagna collection of Italian books and manuscripts (45,000 items), acquired in 1921. Professor Harris F. Fletcher, a member of the English faculty from 1926 to 1962, advised the library on the purchase of books by and about John Milton, often assisting during his own visits to England. In 1937, the Library decided to designate a small space on the fourth floor (\"The Seventeenth Century Room\") to house Fletcher's collection of approximately 5,700 volumes. In 1966, the Rare Book & Manuscript library acquired the large personal collection of Professor and Shakespeare scholar Thomas W. Baldwin, with strong holdings in Renaissance pedagogy, literature, drama, history, and politics in an attempt to collect books that Shakespeare and his contemporaries might have read in their lifetimes. As a result of these and other acquisitions, the library is a significant repository of English imprints from the 16th to 19th centuries and incunabula, including numerous items from the New Haven firm of C. A. Stonehill. The library also began collecting incunabula; by 1950, its collection of pre-1501 imprints numbered nearly 400.\n\nThe library developed some of its specialties following specific major acquisitions. An elephant folio of Audubon’s \"The Birds of America\" (1826–38) is the centerpiece of substantial ornithological holdings. The library acquired 82 cubic feet of H. G. Wells manuscripts in 1954 and has since added numerous related items and small collections to its Wells holdings. The RBML also holds a large collection of Marcel Proust correspondence, comprised in part of materials collected by professor-collector Philip Kolb; the current Proust collection includes over 1,100 holographic items, as well as additional resources for research on Proust and his contemporaries.\n\nUnder the leadership of Robert B. Downs (1958-1974), the University Library began identifying rare titles throughout the general stacks and subject libraries, bringing them together in a new, larger space designated the Rare Book Room. Downs actively sought to enlarge the library's holdings in its areas of strength and to develop new areas of interest. During his tenure, the library acquired numerous major collections, including the Lloyd Francis Nickell collection of eighteenth-century English literature (2,000 volumes), the Ewin Cannon Baskette collection on freedom of expression (10,000 items); the Spanish Civil War collection; the Marvin T. Herrick collection of Italian plays from 1500 to 1700 (500 items), the Jacob Hollander collection of economic history (4,470 items); the Franklin J. Meine collection of Mark Twain (2,100 items); the Yamagiwa collection of Japanese illustrated books (1,800 items); the Harwell collection of Confederate imprints and sheet music (2,500 items), and a large group of Carl Sandburg papers. By the end of Downs’s career, the Rare Book Room had moved from its fourth-floor location to the library's west wing, where the RBML remains today.\n\nIn 2017, Lynne M. Thomas was named the Juanita J. and Robert E. Simpson Rare Book & Manuscript Professor of The Rare Book & Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign).\n\nThe collection of over twelve hundred Incunabula from the fifteenth century is one of the largest university collections in the United States and is especially strong in classical texts, theology, pedagogy, and science.\n\nThe library's strengths include materials from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The library holds significant collections of books by and about writers such as Shakespeare and John Milton, as well as various important editions of the Bible and pedagogical materials.\n\nLiterature, history, and science are well represented, with strong holdings in first editions of nineteenth- and twentieth-century English authors, books related to travel and exploration, and social history. Also noteworthy are collections in radical literature and Anarchist newspapers, natural history, fine press and typography, and the history of publishing. The library also holds 162 cubic feet of unpublished film and television scripts.\n\nThe Rare Book & Manuscript Library's manuscript collections contain materials dated from approximately 3000 BCE to the present day, including clay tablets, medieval illuminated manuscripts, early modern codices and documents, and modern records. Manuscript holdings are subdivided internally by size and date. The bulk of the RBML's early manuscripts are codices covering subjects such as religion, music, and history, but it also holds a cuneiform tablet, papyrus fragments, and individual and groups of manuscripts. Many of these early materials are written in Latin.\n\nThe Rare Book & Manuscript Library also has an extensive collection of manuscripts created after 1650, including codices, single-item and small collections, and large collections. The library owns the world's largest collection of Marcel Proust correspondence, as well as the personal papers of H. G. Wells, Carl Sandburg, W.S Merwin, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Several collections pertain to the Spanish Civil War, and the library has a collection of materials created by the Combat Paper Project. The library's later manuscripts complement its other holdings in subjects such as literature, history, natural history, and music. Most of the manuscripts are in English, but languages such as German, French, and Italian are well represented. The library also owns items in Arabic, Hebrew, and a Batak language.\n\nCollection of Count Antonio Cavagna Sangiuliani di Gualdana (1843-1913), Italian nobleman, writer and bibliophile consists of 90 cu. ft. of manuscripts and pamphlets on Italian history from 1116 to 1913 with special emphasis on the Italian Unification period around 1871. It is one of the largest collections of Italian language materials in the United States.\n\nThe Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Illinois is deeply involved in the training of new generations of curators and special collections librarians. Jointly with the UIUC School of Information Sciences (iSchool at Illinois), the library offers a Certificate in Special Collections Librarianship with courses on a wide range of topics, including special collections librarianship, exhibition preparation, bookbinding, medieval manuscripts, the history of paper, bibliographic description, and rare book cataloging. The program emphasizes an apprenticeship model, and two to ten iSchool students work in the library every semester.\n\n"}

{"id": "9379226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9379226", "title": "Thomas Messinger Drown", "text": "Thomas Messinger Drown\n\nThomas Messinger Drown (March 19, 1842 – November 17, 1904) was the fourth University President of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States. He was also an analytical chemist and metallurgist.\n\nHe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1842. He graduated from Central High School in Philadelphia in 1859, and then went on to study medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1862. He went abroad to Germany to study chemistry in Freiberg, Saxony, and mining at the University of Heidelberg. From 1869 to 1870 he was an instructor of metallurgy at Harvard University. In 1870, he started a consulting business in Philadelphia. In 1872, he hired a former student, John Townsend Baker, as an assistant. From 1874 to 1881, he was professor of Analytical Chemistry at Lafayette College. Baker followed him to Lafayette and later would found the J. T. Baker Chemical Co., which merged with Mallinckrodt and was absorbed and spun off of Tyco International as a component company of Covidien.\n\nHis professional career was interrupted in 1881, when, after the death of his father, he devoted himself to family matters. He restarted his professional work in 1885 by accepting a professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHe helped start MIT's chemical engineering curriculum in the late 1880s. In 1887, he was appointed by the newly formed Massachusetts Board of Health to a landmark study of sanitary quality of the state's inland waters. As consulting chemist to the Massachusetts State Board of Health, he was in charge of the famous Lawrence Experiment Station laboratory conducting the water sampling, testing, and analysis. There he put to work the environmental chemist and first female graduate of MIT, Ellen Swallow Richards. This research created the famous \"normal chlorine\" map of Massachusetts that was the first of its kind and was the template for others. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern sewage treatment plant was created.\n\nAs a professor, Drown published a number of papers on metallurgy, mostly in \"Transactions\" of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. He was a founding member of the Institute, and served as its secretary, and editor of its \"Transactions\" from 1871 till 1884. He was elected its president in 1897.\n\nIn 1895 he left MIT to become the fourth President of Lehigh University. Lehigh's endowment was predominantly in the stock of the major company of its founder, Asa Packer's Lehigh Valley Railroad. The Panic of 1893 crashed the market, brought the country into depression that lasted years, and nearly brought the university to financial insolvency. Many prominent railroads such as the Northern Pacific Railway, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad went into bankruptcy, and over 15,000 companies and 500 banks failed. In order to gain new sources of funding, President Drown broke the university's ties with the Episcopal Church in 1897, qualifying the university for aid from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. During his term, which started during a major financial crisis, he was able to save Lehigh from bankruptcy, grow enrollment, which had dipped seriously, grow academics, and even have one major building erected.\n\nA broad intellectual with interests in various fields, he nonetheless thought the key to Lehigh's success would be the school of technology. There he sought to broaden and deepen the offerings, increase the quality and quantity of laboratory space, equipment and apparatus, as funding permitted. Additionally, and in consultation with the faculty and the Board of Trustees, he created many new tiers of teaching, including the associate and assistant professorships. His idea was that this would create resources for top Professors to be invited to Lehigh, and so help enlarge the curricula. During his tenure, the University's first emeritus Professorship was granted (Harding of Physics), and first Doctorate awarded (Joseph W. Richards). Many new degrees in the technical school were now being offered, such as Metallurgy (1891), Electrometallurgy, and Chemical Engineering (1902). The curriculum leading to a degree in arts and engineering was established, as was the department of zoology and biology. New courses (majors, that is, or degree offerings, as it is \"now\" known) were also adopted in geology, and physics.\n\nDr. Drown eventually gained in popularity on campus, with his forward ideas, success, idiosyncratic pince-nez glasses and mustache. Faculty members eventually came to refer to Dr. Drown as \"chief\". Unfortunately, T. M. Drown would not live long enough to see all his ideas to fruition, as he passed in office, following abdominal surgery, Nov. 16, 1904, effectively ending his term.\n\nWilliams Hall (1903), a Beaux Arts inspired Brick structure, was erected to house the growing departments of Biology and Geology, among other functions.\n\nIn 1908, Lehigh University opened up Drown Hall which now houses Lehigh's English Department.\n\n"}

The work was commissioned by King Mindon as part of his transformation of Mandalay into a royal capital. It was completed in 1868. The text contains the Buddhist canon in the Burmese language.\n\nThere are 730 tablets and 1,460 pages. Each page is wide, tall and thick. Each stone tablet has its own roof and precious gem on top in a small cave-like structure of Sinhalese relic casket type called \"kyauksa gu\" (stone inscription cave in Burmese), and they are arranged around a central golden pagoda.\n\nThe pagoda itself was built as part of the traditional foundations of the new royal city which also included a \"pitakat taik\" or library for religious scriptures, but King Mindon wanted to leave a great work of merit for posterity meant to last five millennia after the Gautama Buddha who lived around 500 BC. When the British invaded southern Burma in the mid-19th century, Mindon Min was concerned that Buddhist dhamma (teachings) would also be detrimentally affected in the North where he reigned. As well as organizing the Fifth Buddhist council in 1871, he was responsible for the construction in Mandalay of the world's largest book, consisting of 729 large marble tablets with the Tipitaka Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism inscribed on them in gold. One more was added to record how it all came about, making it 730 stone inscriptions in total.\n\nThe marble was quarried from Sagyin Hill north of Mandalay, and transported by river to the city. Work began on 14 October 1860 in a large shed near Mandalay Palace. The text had been meticulously edited by tiers of senior monks and lay officials consulting the \"Tipitaka\" (meaning \"three baskets\", namely Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka) kept in royal libraries in the form of \"peisa\" or palm leaf manuscripts. Scribes carefully copied the text on marble for stonemasons. Each stone has 80 to 100 lines of inscription on each side in round Burmese script, chiseled out and originally filled in with gold ink. It took a scribe three days to copy both the obverse and the reverse sides, and a stonemason could finish up to 16 lines a day. All the stones were completed and opened to the public on 4 May 1868.\n\nThe stones are arranged in neat rows within three enclosures, 42 in the innermost, 168 in the middle and 519 in the outermost enclosure. The caves are numbered starting from the west going clockwise (\"let ya yit\") forming complete rings as follows:\n\nThirty years later in 1900, a print copy of the text came out in a set of 38 volumes in Royal Octavo size of about 400 pages each in Great Primer type. The publisher, Philip H. Ripley of Hanthawaddy Press, claimed that his books were \"true copies of the \"Pitaka\" inscribed on stones by King Mindon\". Ripley was a Burmese-born Briton brought up in the royal court of Mandalay by the king and went to school with the royal princes including Thibaw Min, the last king of Burma. At the age of 17 he fled to Rangoon when palace intrigues and a royal massacre broke out after the death of King Mindon, and he had the galley proofs checked against the stones.\n\nThe British later invaded the North, the gems and other valuables were looted, and the buildings and images vandalised by the troops billeted in the temples and pagodas near the walled city and Mandalay Hill. When the troops withdrew from religious sites after a successful petition to Queen Victoria, restoration work began in earnest in 1892 organised by a committee formed by senior monks, members of the royal family and former officers of the king including Atumashi Sayadaw (Abbot of Atumashi Monastery), Kinwon Min Gyi U Kaung (chancellor), Hleithin Atwinwun (minister of the royal fleet), Yaunghwe Saopha Sir Saw Maung (a Shan prince), and Mobyè Sitkè (a general in the royal army). In the tradition of the time, when something needed repair, it was first offered to the relatives of those who had originally made the \"Dāna\" (donation) and they came forward and assisted in making repairs. The public was then asked for help, but the full original glory was not achieved.\n\nThe gold writing had disappeared from all 729 marble tablets, along with the bells from the \"hti\" (umbrella or crown) of each of the small stupas, and they were now marked in black ink, made from shellac, soot from paraffin lamps and straw ash, rather than in gold, and few of the gems still exist. Mobyè Sitkè also asked permission from senior monks to plant star flower trees (\"Mimusops elengi\") between the rows of \"kyauksa gu\"s. The inscriptions have been re-inked several times since King Thibaw had it done for the second time in gold. The undergrowth amongst the caves was cleared and paved through public donations appealed for in the \"Ludu Daily\" in 1968. The words of the Buddha are still preserved in this place which is therefore a popular destination for devout Buddhists as well as scholars and tourists.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1949450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949450", "title": "Variable data printing", "text": "Variable data printing\n\nVariable data printing (VDP) (also known as variable information printing (VIP) or variable imaging (VI)) is a form of digital printing, including on-demand printing, in which elements such as text, graphics and images may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing process and using information from a database or external file. For example, a set of personalized letters, each with the same basic layout, can be printed with a different name and address on each letter. Variable data printing is mainly used for direct marketing, customer relationship management, advertising, invoicing and applying addressing on selfmailers, brochures or postcard campaigns.\n\nVDP is a direct outgrowth of digital printing, which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional offset printing. Variable data printing enables the mass customization of documents via digital print technology, as opposed to the 'mass-production' of a single document using offset lithography. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.\n\nThe returns for variable printing vary from double the normal return at the basic level to 10–15 times the return for fully variable jobs. This naturally depends on content and the relevancy of that content, but the technique presents an effective tool for increasing ROI on marketing campaigns.\n\nThere are several levels of variable printing. The most basic level involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like mail merge. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated by a set of application and style rules and the information contained in the database.\n\nThere are three main operational methodologies for variable data printing.\n\nIn one methodology, a static document is loaded into printer memory. The printer is instructed, through the print driver or raster image processor (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page out to the printer driver or RIP. Variable data can then be printed on top of the static document. This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical mail merge.\n\nA second methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) print file with every image being merged into every page. A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large print files can overwhelm the RIP's processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job of more than a few hundred pages.\n\nA third methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized print files, such as PDF/VT, PostScript or PPML, that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.\n\nThere are many software packages available to merge text and images into VDP print files. Some are stand-alone software packages, however most of the advanced VDP software packages are actually plug-in modules for one or more publishing software packages such as Adobe Creative Suite.\n\nBesides VDP software, other software packages may be necessary for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States (United States Postal Service) and Canada to take advantage of reduced postage for bulk mailing. Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, Canada Post now offers a 'Machineable' personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates. \n\nSoftware to manage data quality (e.g. for duplicate removal or handling of bad records) and uniformity may also be needed. In lieu of purchasing software, various companies provide an assortment of VDP-related print file, mailing and data services.\n\nThe difference between variable data printing and traditional printing is the personalization that is involved. Personalization allows a company to connect to its customers. Variable data printing is more than a variable name or address in a printed piece; in the past, a variable name would have been effective, because it was a new concept at the time. In today’s world, personalization has to reflect what the customer values. In order for VDP to be successful, the company must know something about the customer. For example, a customer who loves baseball receives a VDP postcard with an image of their favorite baseball player. The postcard is effective, because the customer is more likely to read what is on it. An example of an ineffective VDP piece would be to mail a postcard to the same customer with an image of a soccer player. If the customer has no interest in soccer, then he or she may or may not pay attention to the postcard. The idea is to add value to the customer through the ability to relate to them. Personalization allows a company to relate, communicate, and possibly start a relationship with a prospective customer and to maintain a relationship with their current customers. A prospect that is converted to a customer can then be converted to a loyal customer. Companies want to create loyal customers, and variable data printing can help gain these types of customers, along with quality work and service.\n\nAnother benefit is the increase in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the mailed piece has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A mailed piece that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.\n\nVariable data printing can be combined with other platforms – such as PURLS, email blasts, and QR codes; all three platforms are considered marketing tools. Many people have found the benefit of combining all of these platforms in order to have a successful campaign. Email blasts and PURLS allow a company to find out information about their consumer. An email blasts usually doesn’t contain much personalization, but it can. The bulk of the personalization would be seen in a PURL. A PURL is a personalized uniform resource locator (URL). In short, it is a landing page. It is also where most of the knowledge about the consumer will be gained. The email blasts will contain a PURL, which will lead the consumer to a personalized page. The PURL is where a company can gain information about the consumer through the requested information. The QR code can be added to a mailed piece. It works like an email blasts. It directs the consumer to a website. The integration of these three platforms can help a campaign.\n\nThe origin of the term variable data printing is widely credited to Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. Mr. Romano does not explicitly take credit for coining the term \nbut points to his use of it as early as 1969 and its appearance in the 1999 book, “Personalized and Database Printing”, that he authored with David Broudy.\n\nThe concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop 'mail merge', to complex mainframe applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in recent years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.\n\n"}
