{"id": "34685701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34685701", "title": "Abertay Historical Society", "text": "Abertay Historical Society\n\nThe Abertay Historical Society (AHS) is a historical society based in Dundee, Scotland. It aims to promote interest in history, with a special focus on the history of Perthshire, Angus and Fife. The AHS runs a regular programme of public lectures on historical topics and also organises special events. The Society also publishes books, usually producing at least one publication per year.\n\nThe Society was founded at a meeting held at University College, Dundee on 29 May 1947. The founders were the Principal of University College, Major-General Douglas Wimberley, and the College's history lecturer, Dr Frederick T Wainwright. It has been suggested that the Society was promoted as part of a process of developing 'town and gown links' in Dundee by Wimberley. The AHS was set up with the goal of encouraging the study of local history in the Abertay area (Perthshire, Angus and northern Fife).The Society pursued this aim by organising regular talks and lectures as well as other events such as excursions.\n\nThe Society formerly had an Archaeological Section which organised excavations in the local area and its own series of meetings. However, in 1993 the activities of this section came under the control of the Society’s Council. For a time in the 1970s the AHS also had an Industrial Archaeology Section, which mainly sought to record the region's industrial heritage. In 2015 the archaeological activities of the Society were taken over by a newly established fieldwork division, which has undertaken projects including the recording of stones that survive from the demolished Dundee Royal Arch.\n\nSince 1953 the Society has published books on local history, the first of which was \"Dundee and the American Civil War\" by David Carrie. A number of notable historians and authors have written volumes published by the Society including Bruce Lenman, Andrew Murray Scott and Christopher Whatley. The 51st AHS publication \"Ten Taysiders: Forgotten Figures from Dundee, Angus and Perthshire\" was published in 2011 and was edited by members of the Society's Council. In 2011 the AHS began to make copies of out-of-print titles available for free download from their website. The Society's publications are regularly cited in academic literature.\n\nAs well as running events, the AHS has undertaken various heritage activities. The Society has lobbied for the preservation of local buildings and historic sites, and played a key role in the creation of Dundee Civic Trust and Dundee Heritage Trust. The Abertay Historical Society was also a benefactor of The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum Fundraising Appeal which allowed the restoration and refurbishment of Dundee's main museum and galleries between 2006 and 2009.\n\nA number of notable individuals have been associated with the Abertay Historical Society. These include Sir Francis Mudie who was President of the Society from 1963 to 1965 and also contributed to its publications. Another key figure in the society's history was S. G. Edgar Lythe, a founder member who went on to be Vice Principal of the University of Strathclyde. Lythe, who edited and wrote several of the Society's publications, was credited with moving the AHS away from simply organising events and towards actively encouraging research into local history. The Dundee bibliophile and antiquarian Catherine Kinnear was a founder member of the Society and later went on to be its president.\n\nThe AHS has been described as \"one of Scotland's most successful local history organisations\". It organises a regular programme of evening lectures, which are usually held in Discovery Point, Dundee, although other venues are also used from time to time. These lectures cover a wide range of topics relating to the local area. The Society also works with other Dundee-based groups to run the Dundee Afternoon Lectures series. The AHS is a registered charity.\n\nSome events are held jointly with other local groups. For example, in 2010 the AHS joined with the Perth Strathspey and Reel Society to have an event at the A. K. Bell Library, Perth entitled \"The Fiddle Music of Perth\" as part of the Perth 800 celebrations. In 2011 the AHS contributed to the Dundee Science Festival by organising a public lecture on the design and construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse.\n\nThe Society is a partner in Great War Dundee, a project commemorating the First World War, and its impact on Dundee set up to mark the centenary of the conflict.\n\nThe Society is run by a council whose membership includes the President, General Secretary, other office bearers and various ordinary members. In addition the Lord Provost of Dundee, the Provost of Perth and Kinross, the Provost of Angus, the Principal of the University of Dundee and the Principal of the University of St Andrews all serve as Honorary Presidents of the Society.\n\nAs noted above the Abertay Historical Society was founded at what was then University College, Dundee by my members of that institution's staff. Since that time the AHS has maintained close links with the institution, which has since 1967 been known as the University of Dundee. The Principal of the University of Dundee is one five Honorary Presidents of the Society, and many of the Society's members and office-holders, including past presidents, have been University staff and students. Equally many of its publications have been authored by figures connected with the University and the AHS' lecture programme has offers University staff and students the chance to present their research to the local community.\n\nAn annual prize is awarded by the AHS to the undergraduate at the University of Dundee who produces the dissertation which makes the most significant contribution to local history. Some of these dissertations have been expanded and published by the AHS. For example, the AHS publication No. 44 \"Scottish Cowboys and the Dundee Investors\" by Claire E. Swan evolved from a dissertation which won the Abertay History Prize in 2003. Julie Danskin, author of the Society's 54th publication is also a past winner of the Abertay History Prize.\n\nThe archives of the AHS are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee.\n\nCurrently most of the Society's lectures are held at the University, usually in the Dalhousie Building.\n\nThe first publication by the society was \"Dundee and the American Civil War\" which was published in 1953. An editorial note in the publication announced that it was hoped it was to 'be followed by others of similar\ncharacter, produced to a uniform size to simplify binding into convenient volumes'. It was also stated that while its publications would 'always have a strong local flavour the Society aims to\navoid undue parochialism and seeks to set its studies against the wide backcloth of general historical development'. As of December 2015 the Society has published a further 55 books relating to the history of Tayside and Fife. Members of the Society are sent a free copy of each new publication, while other copies are made available for sale either from the Society or via booksellers. The publications have covered a wide number of topics and have varied in style. While most are monographs some titles have been collections of essays written by various authors. An example of the latter is the 2011 publication \"Ten Taysiders\" which featured biographical essays on ten historic figures from Dundee, Pethshire and Angus, such as Mary Ann Baxter, A.K. Bell and William Sharpey and which was written by various authors including Steve Connelly, Fiona Scharlau, Charles Waterston, Graham Lowe, John MacEwen, John Kerr, William Kenefick and Kenneth Baxter.\n\nThe following books have been published by the AHS:\n\n\nThe Society has undertaken a programme of making digital versions of some of its out of print publications available for free download from its website.\n\n"}

{"id": "44395096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44395096", "title": "Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives", "text": "Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives holds approximately 300,000 volumes and over 3,000 linear feet of archives related to the history of the museum and its collections. The library collections comprise books, periodicals, auction catalogs, artist and institutional files as well as special collections containing photographs, sketches, artists' books, rare books and trade catalogues. The museum archives contains institutional records, curatorial correspondence, expedition reports, and other related textual and visual records dating to the founding of the institution.\nThe Brooklyn Museum evolved from the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association, founded in 1823, and the first free and circulating library in Brooklyn. In 1831, the library acquired its first painting, joining a developing book collection. According to the Minutes of the Apprentices' Library from January 31, 1835: \"Walter Whitman acting librarian presented a Report this evening, in which it is stated that there are now about 1200 volumes in the library in a proper \nstate for being drawn out; and that the number of Readers is 172.\"\n\nBy the 1840s, the public demand for educational programs resulted in the reorganization of the library with the adoption by the association of a revised charter under the name of the Brooklyn Institute and the library was housed in a new building. Evening classes were offered, the first exhibition of paintings was held and library acquisition funds became available. The library accession records document early institutional interest in the world at large. An early acquisition is currently in the museum's long term installation, \"Connecting Cultures\".\n\nOver the next forty years, the Brooklyn Institute grew and was reorganized into the Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences, which eventually became the parent organization of the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Children's Museum, the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. During the late 1880s, plans were established to revitalize the institute in order ″to make the property of the Institute the nucleus of a broad and comprehensive institution for the advancement of science and art...″ After an architectural competition held in 1893, the firm of McKim, Mead & White was chosen to design a building to house the Brooklyn Museum and its library.\n\nThe early 1900s saw reorganization of the original Apprentices' Library by the museum librarians who kept portions of the collection that supported research on the museum's object collections and transferred the rest to other libraries in Brooklyn and other institutions.\n\nWilliam Henry Goodyear, the museum's first Curator of Fine Arts (1890-1923), founding museum librarian Susan A. Hutchinson (1900–35) and Stewart Culin, the museum's first Curator of Ethnology (1903–29), laid the foundation of the research and object collections. Some of the rarest material in the library collection today, such as a set of documentary photographs of Mexico and Central America taken by Alfred P. Maudslay in the 1880s, was acquired under their direction. After Stewart Culin died, the trustees acquired his archives and personal library of nearly 7,000 titles, focused primarily on the arts and culture of the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe.\n\nToday the Brooklyn Museum has two research libraries—the Art Reference Library and the Wilbour Library of Egyptology—in addition to the museum archives which support research on the museum, its history and collections as well as the broader areas of art and cultural history.\n\nThe Wilbour Library is named after Charles Edwin Wilbour, 1833–96, one of America's first Egyptologists. During his travels to Egypt, Wilbour visited temples and tombs and copied inscriptions found on monuments in the field. He built an important resource on Ancient Egypt by collecting books from fellow Egyptologists abroad, as well as from dealers and scholarly publishers, developing his personal library as a resource to educate himself. Wilbour's personal library was enriched with scholarly annotations containing corrections and additions to the published text which are of value today as they offer unique information. In 1916, Wilbour's children offered his antiquities and library collection to the Brooklyn Museum as a memorial to their father. After this initial donation, Wilbour's heirs continued to donate objects to the museum. In 1932, the Charles Edwin Wilbour Fund was set up by Victor Wilbour to support both the library and the Egyptian collection at the museum.\n\nIn 1985, the Brooklyn Museum established the archives as part of the library. Textual and visual materials are available to support users in understanding the museum's object collections as well as its history and programs. Exchanges between curators and artists, collectors and donors, as well as exhibition files containing information on specific artists or works of art that have been exhibited at the museum, and object documentation tracing how an object was acquired, and more can all be found in the archives.\n\nToday the Brooklyn Museum Library collections are encyclopedic in scope and parallel the strength of the museum's collections. In addition to being a research center, the library collections are frequently exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum and elsewhere. Collection highlights include special collections of fashion sketches, documentary photographs, artists’ books, trade catalogs and other rare books.\n\nHighlights of the fashion sketch collection include sketches by Elizabeth Hawes, Bonnie Cashin, Walter Plunkett and a full visual record of every design imported or created by Henri Bendel from 1912 to 1950. The museum's website has images of such collections.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, the Brooklyn Museum Libraries sent a questionnaire to seventy-five designers requesting biographical information along with sketches of their work. The questionnaire was announced in Women's Wear Daily. Henri Bendel sent a large collection of sketches rendered by design artists employed by the retailer. The artists attended Parisian shows to record the work of more than 170 designers including Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Lanvin, Poiret, Schiaparelli, Vionnet, and Worth. In 1944, sketches from the collection were featured in an exhibition at the museum, French Fashion Sketches from the Henri Bendel Collection.\n\nToday, the Henri Bendel Collection represents the largest and one of the first sketch collections received, with more than 11,000 sketches of French couture imported by the company in addition to its own house designs from 1912 through 1950.\n\nArtists books are a special feature of the library collection with a focus on Brooklyn-based artists; artists who are exhibited by the museum or who have work in the museum’s object collection; artists who create work that relates to the objects or cultures that are represented in the museum’s object collections; artists who are considered to be innovators or masters in the artists books world. Recent donations include artists books from the library of Arnold Smoller and the library of Thea Westreich and Ethan Wagner.\n\nThe exhibition entitled \"Artist Books\", held in 2000, featured 50 books ranging from multiples to limited edition to unique works from the library collection. From 2003 to 2006, the museum featured key works from the Wilbour Library of Egyptology in a two part exhibition entitled \"Egypt Through Other Eyes: Early Travel and Exploration and the Popularization of Ancient Egypt\", that examined how Western writers and artists saw and recorded Egypt from early works on hieroglyphs to the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922.\n\nIn an effort to provide greater access to the collections, the Brooklyn Museum Libraries have been digitizing parts of its collections. Some digital projects include the Gilded Age Project, the Bendel Fashion sketches, and Brooklyn Visual Heritage. A multi-year collaboration with Pratt Institute's School of Information and Library Science is underway to provide a training ground for librarians and archivists and to make the library and archive collections more accessible via digital means.\n\nIn 2006, The Libraries of the Brooklyn Museum, The Frick, and The Museum of Modern Art joined forces to form the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC). In addition to other projects, they have collaborated to build an integrated library system, known as Arcade., to provide better access to their respective collections.\n\nDuring the renovation on the 2nd floor of the Brooklyn Museum, the libraries are open with limited access to researchers. The libraries and archives are scheduled to reopen to the public in the fall of 2016. When the floor is reopened it will feature a new Gallery of Libraries and Archives as well as newly reinstalled Asian and Islamic art galleries.\n\n"}

Synchronous transmissions are synchronized by an external clock, while asynchronous transmissions are synchronized by special signals along the transmission medium.\n\nWhenever an electronic device transmits digital (and sometimes analog) data to another, there must be a certain rhythm established between the two devices, i.e., the receiving device must have some way of, within the context of the fluctuating signal that it's receiving, determining where each unit of data begins and where it ends.\n\nThere are two ways to synchronize the two ends of the communication.\n\nThe synchronous signalling methods use two different signals.\nA pulse on one signal indicates when another bit of information is ready on the other signal.\n\nThe asynchronous signalling methods use only one signal.\nThe receiver uses transitions on that signal to figure out the transmitter bit rate (\"autobaud\") and timing, and set a local clock to the proper timing, typically using a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with the transmission rate.\nA pulse from the local clock indicates when another bit is ready.\n\nIn synchronous communications, the stream of data to be transferred is encoded as fluctuating voltage levels in one wire (the 'DATA'), and a periodic pulse of voltage on a separate wire (called the \"CLOCK\" or \"STROBE\") which tells the receiver \"the current DATA bit is 'valid' at this moment in time\".\n\nPractically all parallel communications protocols use synchronous transmission. For example, in a computer, address information is transmitted synchronously—the address bits over the address bus, and the read or write 'strobe's of the control bus.\n\nA logical one is indicated when there are two transitions in the same time frame as a zero. In the Manchester coding a transition from low to high indicates a one and a transition from high to low indicates a zero. When there are successive ones or zeros, an opposite transition is required on the edge of the time frame to prepare for the next transition and signal.\n\nThe most common asynchronous signalling, asynchronous start-stop signalling, uses a near-constant 'bit' timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required at both end of the connection). Using this method, the receiver detects the 'first' edge transition... (the START BIT), waits 'half a bit duration' and then reads the value of the signal. A further delay of one 'whole bit duration' is executed before the next data bit is 'read' - repeating for length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits).\nFinally an optional STOP bit is appended to identify the end of the data word.\n\nThe word structure used in typical asynchronous serial communications is START-DATA[0:7]-STOP[0:1] (followed by an optional PARITY bit). These formatting variables are specified when configuring the transmit and receive nodes before communications take place.\nThe bit duration is determined from the nominated 'bit rate' in bps... 300, 1200, 9600, 19200, 115200 etc. The use of the word BAUD is not strictly correct in the modern application of serial channels.\n\nSpecial level & timing conditions are detected to identify an open-circuit condition (BREAK)\n\nThe sync token might be a single pulse (a \"start bit\" as noted above), or it may be a more complicated syncword or self-synchronizing code such as HDLC or 8B/10B encoding.\n"}

{"id": "11353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11353", "title": "Frigg", "text": "Frigg\n\nIn Germanic mythology, Frigg (; Old Norse), Frija (Old High German), Frea (Langobardic), and Frige (Old English) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god Odin. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is also connected with the goddess Fulla. The English weekday name Friday (etymologically Old English \"Frīge's day\") bears her name.\n\nFrigg is described as a goddess associated with foresight and wisdom in Norse mythology, the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god Odin and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir, is famous for her foreknowledge, is associated with the goddesses Fulla, Lofn, Hlín, and Gná, and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse \"Earth\"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god Baldr. Due to the significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess Freyja.\n\nAfter Christianization, the mention of Frigg continued to occur in Scandinavian folklore. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives modern veneration in Germanic Neopaganism.\n\nThe theonyms \"Frigg\" (Old Norse) and \"Frija\" (Old High German) are cognate forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of Proto-Germanic *\"frijaz\" (via Holtzmann's law). *\"frijaz\" descends from the same source (Proto-Indo-European) as the feminine Sanskrit noun \"priyā\" and the feminine Avestan noun \"fryā\" (both meaning \"own, dear, beloved\"). In the modern period, an -a suffix is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form \"Frigga\". This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word \"frig\".\n\nThe connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess Freyja with Frigg in the Proto-Germanic period (Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis) is a matter of scholarly debate. The name \"Freyja\" is not attested outside of Scandinavia, like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess \"Frigg\", who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *\"Frijjō\". Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse \"Freyja\" descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.\n\nRegarding a Freyja–Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"\n\nThe English weekday name \"Friday\" comes from Old English \"Frīġedæġ\", meaning 'day of Frige'. It is cognate with Old High German \"frîatac\". Several place names refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.\n\nThe 7th-century \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\", and Paul the Deacon's 8th-century \"Historia Langobardorum\" derived from it, recount a founding myth of the Langobards, a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see Lombardy). According to this legend, a \"small people\" known as the \"Winnili\" were ruled by a woman named Gambara who had two sons, Ybor and Agio. The Vandals, ruled by Ambri and Assi, came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the \"Origo\"): \"Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that \"at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands\". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked \"who are those Long-beards?\" Frea responded to Godan, \"As you have given them a name, give them also the victory\". Godan did so, \"so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory\". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the \"Langobards\" (Langobardic \"long-beards\").\n\nA 10th-century manuscript found in what is now Merseburg, Germany, features an invocation known as the Second Merseburg Incantation. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her—Volla, to assist in healing a horse:\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems \"Völuspá\", \"Vafþrúðnismál\", the prose of \"Grímnismál\", \"Lokasenna\", and \"Oddrúnargrátr\".\n\nFrigg receives three mentions in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Völuspá\". In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son Baldr in Fensalir. Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the \"beloved of Frigg\" and his future death is referred to as the \"second grief of Frigg\". Like the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied \"first grief\" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, Baldr.\nIn the prose introduction to the poem \"Grímnismál\", Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king Hrauðungr, Agnar (age 10) and Geirröðr (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a crofter. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirröðr. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirröðr aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.\n\nThe boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirröðr, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said \"go where an evil spirit may get thee.\" Away went the ship and Geirröðr walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirröðr was king. He \"became a splendid man\". The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in Hliðskjálf, \"look[ing] into all the worlds\". Odin says: \"'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse \"gȳgi\"] in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'\"\n\nOdin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her \"waiting-maid\" Fulla to warn Geirröðr to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirröðr was inhospitable with his guests, Geirröðr did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is \"Grímnir\". Geirröðr has Grímnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Grímnir is brought a full drinking horn by Geirröðr's son, Agnar (so named after Geirröðr's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.\n\nIn the poem \"Lokasenna\", where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by Ægir. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, \"his wife\", Frigg.\n\nFrigg is mentioned throughout the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Frigg is first mentioned in the \"Prose Edda\" Prologue (Prose Edda), wherein a euhemerized account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of folk etymology, the author attempts to associate the name \"Frigg\" with the Latin-influenced form \"Frigida\". The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin \"had the gift of prophecy\".\n\nIn the next section of the \"Prose Edda\", \"Gylfaginning\", High tells Gangleri (the king Gylfi in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of Fjörgynn (Old Norse \"Fjörgynsdóttir\") is married to Odin and that the Æsir are descended from the couple, and adds that \"the earth [\"Jörðin\"] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife\". According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god Thor.\nLater in \"Gylfaginning\", Gangleri asks about the \"ásynjur\", a term for Norse goddesses. High says that \"highest\" among them is Frigg and that only Freyja \"is highest in rank next to her\". Frigg dwells in Fensalir \"and it is very splendid\". In this section of \"Gylfaginning\", Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other \"ásynjur\": Fulla carries Frigg's ashen box, \"looks after her footwear and shares her secrets\"; Lofn is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to \"arrange unions\" among men and women; Hlín is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and Gná is sent by Frigg \"into various worlds to carry out her business\".\n\nIn section 49 of \"Gylfaginning\", a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a thing and decided that they should \"request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger\". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, Loki discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.\n\nThere, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the thing. The woman says that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that \"Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all.\" The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; \"there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of Val-hall. It is called mistletoe. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from.\" Loki immediately disappears.\nNow armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the Æsir are assembled and tricks the blind Höðr, Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks \"who there was among the Æsir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to Hel and try if he could find Baldr, and offer Hel a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard\".\n\nHermóðr, Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings—foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, Nanna dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband. Hermóðr locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Hermóðr Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Hermóðr rides back to the Æsir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a jötunn in a cave named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.\n\nFrigg is mentioned several times in the \"Prose Edda\" section \"Skáldskaparmál\". The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the Æsir and Ásynjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, Asgard. Frigg is one of the twelve ásynjur in attendance.\n\nIn \"Ynglinga saga\", the first book of \"Heimskringla\", an Euhemerized account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers Vili and Vé oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the Æsir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, \"but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.\n\nIn \"Völsunga saga\", the great king Rerir and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; \"that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked\".\n\nA 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the Schleswig Cathedral in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a distaff. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.\n\nDue to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and Freyja descend from a common entity from the Proto-Germanic period. Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar Stephan Grundy comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-Viking Age references to Germanic goddesses, and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"\n\nUnlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the Vanir, the name \"Freyja\" is not attested outside of Scandinavia, as opposed to the name of the goddess \"Frigg\", who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as Proto-Germanic *\"Frijjō\". Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which \"Freyja\" descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.\n\nFrigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, Gustav III of Sweden, king of Sweden, composed \"Friggja\", a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and Hans Friedrich Blunck's \"Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust\" in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (\"Frigg, Freyja\", drawing, 1883), John Charles Dollman (\"Frigga Spinning the Clouds\", painting, c. 1900), Emil Doepler (\"Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster\", painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (\"Fricka\", drawing, date not provided).\n\nFrigga appears in Marvel Comics and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as the queen of Asgard, wife of Odin, mother of Thor, and the adoptive mother of Loki. \n\nThe Finnish folk band Frigg takes its name from the deity.\n\n\n"}

Inside there are three different types of museums: Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography (open-air), Castle Museum (partly open-air), and the Museum of Antiques. Vehicles are offered to visitors due to the spacious area of museums. There are the tours in different languages: Azerbaijani, Russian, English, German and French.\n\nThe area of the museum is 1.5 ha and has rock paintings, pottery, household items, jewelry, weapons and coins belong to the ancient times of Azerbaijan. In this museum, there are more than 2,000 different archaeological and architectural monuments – mounds, seats of ancient settlements, burial places dating back to thousands of years ago. \n\nThe reserve was established in the year of 2008 under the auspices of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. It is located in Gala, 40km far from Baku and bears the name of this district. Gala- State Historical Ethnographic Reserve is devoted to the history of the Absheron Peninsula. As a result of archaeological excavations, it is feasible to get the picture of the lifestyle of the Azerbaijani people from ancient times to the Middle Ages.\n\nThere is an 18th century tandoor, two underground passages belonging to the 10th and 15th centuries. Besides these, old houses, portable tents made of animal skins, stone and straw houses with domes, an old smithy, a pottery workshop, and a thresher can be found. All these can be touched and photographed.\n\nOn October 2, 2013 the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan approved the Regulation on the special regime of the Gala State Historical-Ethnographic Reserve. In accordance with the Regulation, Gala-State Historical and Ethnographic Reserve is a state-protected area of architectural monuments, archaeological and ethnographic materials. The Reserve's Buffer Zone has been created by the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan in order to protect the historical-architectural appearance of the Reserve, the monuments located in the territory, their functional designation and longevity, as well as to protect the natural landscape formed around the Reserve. The boundaries of the reserve are defined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Gala-State Historical and Ethnographic Reserve carries out the following research works in accordance with the Regulation on the special regime of it:\n\n\nRelevant international organizations may participate in the scientific research, restoration, regeneration, reconstruction and conservation of the monuments located in the territory of the Reserve, with the consent of the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe work carried out in the reserve should be done in accordance with the General Plan of the settlement of Gala, the status of the Reserve, its detailed plan, development concept, protecting historical-architectural appearance, planning structure. The territory of the Reserve is used for the purposes of demonstration and development of the protection and use of historical and cultural monuments, organization of scientific research, training, tourism, recreation. State registration of the monuments and exponats in the territory of the reserve, their passportization is carried out by the Department of the Reserve. Physical and legal persons can not engage in activities that may threat historical, cultural, scientific, aesthetic, recreational value in the territory of the Reserve, as well as natural landscape. Construction, reconstruction, renovation and repair works can not be carried out without the positive opinion of the Department. Any works that may cause a threat to the monuments in the territory of the Reserve can be carried out by preventive measures by the decision of the Department. Deployment of enterprises, institutions and organizations that do not comply with the objectives of the Reserve for their activities, as well as representatives of diplomatic and international organizations of foreign states, shall be carried out on the basis of consent of the Department.\n\nCarrying out any restoration, construction, repair, reconstruction, regeneration and conservation projects in the territory of the Reserve, issuing different protection requirements, approving the implementation of the projects and monitoring the compliance of the works with the approved projects and requirements are also include the protection measures. It is forbidden to change the architectural appearance of the monuments, to destroy them, and to carry out repair, construction and other work that may endanger them.\n\nArrangement of engineering, communication and road infrastructure, as well as public utility services, organization of sanitation, cleaning and landscaping, registration and maintenance of public and non-residential areas are ensured through the subordination of the Department. \n\nMonuments belonging to the territory of the Reserve may be used for scientific, cultural, religious, tourism, service, housing and household purposes with the consent of the Department. Use of monuments should not damage their preservation and the historical and artistic value, but they can not be used for military purposes. To exhibit movable monuments of the Reserve abroad may be carried out only with the permission of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nCompensation of damage caused to monuments located in the territory of the Reserve is carried out in accordance with the civil legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\n\nThere are 243 historic-architectural monuments (mosques, ancient living buildings, baths, coffee beans, walls of ancient houses, etc.) in the Gala Museum. There are also 400-year-old pistachio trees, figs, figs, olive trees, flowers and other decorative items in the territory of the reserve.\n\nIn 2008, on the initiative of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, the Archeological and Ethnographic Museum Complex under the open sky was established. Archaeological architectural monuments discovered on the Absheron Peninsula were collected and restored here. The mounds, settlements and other architectural monuments of the 3rd-2nd millennium BC were built in the same way as before the era.\n\nAncient mounds, grave stones, dwellings, quarries, places of worship and some other material cultural remains found in the territory of Absheron Peninsula reflect the mood of the previous millennia. One of the mound is called \"Dubendi\". The basis of this mound is the rug-shaped stone masonry.\n\nTools made from sheep bones and stone were found in the Reserve area. The \"Turkan\" mound also consists of a ring-shaped stonework. There is also a quadrilateral hole in this mound.\n\nThere are residues of water and food wells, coffee houses, ancient houses in the territory of the reserve. Archaeological excavations have been proven to be the Bronze Age settlement 5,000 years ago in the village of Gala.\n\nIn the ancient village of Gala, there were a number of fields of art. One of them is pottery. Pottery products discovered during archaeological excavations in Galada are potentially interesting in terms of pottery. The ancient carpets, the tools used during the carpet weaving - the apron, the cloth, the scissors, the hooked knife. \n\nRock paintings and caves dating back to the new stone Bronze Age were discovered during the archaeological excavations in the Agdash Plain, Khashakhun and Dubendi in the vicinity of Gala village in the east of Absheron. As well as traces of settlements, mounds, hearths and material cultural remains have been discovered here.\n\nThere are three baths in the village of Gala: Shor Baths, Gum Baths and Bayramali Baths. The \"Shore Bath\" was located in the southern part of the village, near the salt lake. There was water from the lake.\n"}

Jim Ross cites him as the most significant influence on his career as an announcer.\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Solie moved to Tampa, Florida, in the 1950s after completing military service in the United States Air Force. Solie began his pro wrestling career as a ring announcer, making $5 a night emceeing weekly shows in the Tampa Bay area. He soon began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida, and in 1960, he moved into the broadcast booth to become the lead announcer for CWF's Saturday morning television shows, a spot he would occupy for the next quarter-century. During that time, he commentated on matches featuring some of pro wrestling's biggest legends, including WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes, The Brisco Brothers and Dory Funk Jr., among numerous others. Solie rose to national prominence when Superstation WTBS began broadcasting pro wrestling, and the exposure helped him branch out, leading to Solie working for promotions in Georgia, Alabama and Puerto Rico.\n\nMuch of his fame stems from the gravelly sound of his voice calling the in-ring action and his unique lingo. He sometimes is incorrectly credited for originating the term \"Pier-Six Brawl\" to describe a wild brawl, and was also notorious for noting when a bloodied superstar was \"wearing the crimson mask.\" His oft-imitated signature call of a suplex as a \"su-play.\" His signature sign-off was: \"So long from the Sunshine State,\" followed by a wink.\n\nIn 1987, a board game, Gordon Solie's Championship Wrestling Trivia Game, was released by Sports Entertainment International, Inc.\n\nWhen CWF finally folded in 1987, Solie returned to Georgia and became one of the lead announcers for the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance) later WCW television programs. Solie also worked for the Continental Wrestling Federation and USA Championship Wrestling based out of Knoxville. It was a natural transition for \"The Dean,\" who had also been Georgia Championship Wrestling's lead announcer before it became a subsidiary of NWA/WCW. He remained there until his eventual retirement in 1995. He was diagnosed with cancer soon after his retirement. In the late-1990s, his vocal chords were removed due to throat cancer. In July 2000, he died due to throat cancer at the age of 71, leaving behind five children.\n\nIn 2005, his posthumously released memoir \"Gordon Solie ...

In 2008, he was inducted, by Jim Ross, into the WWE Hall of Fame, appearing on Solie's behalf were his five children; Pam, Danise, Jonard, Eric and Greg.\n\nOn March 29, 2008, Jim Ross posthumously inducted Solie into the WWE Hall of Fame in the Class of 2008. Later the same year WWE's WWE Classics on Demand video service began offering \"The Film Room with Gordon Solie\", hosted by Ross, focusing on Solie's announcing and interviewing of a specific wrestler or group of wrestlers involved in a feud. On August 11, 2009 Solie's biography, \" The Solie Chronicles\" was released by Crowbar Press.\n\nSolie's last announcing job was to be the Heroes of Wrestling pay-per-view in 1999, but he could not attend due to failing health.

He also portrayed the on-screen role of WWF President from 1995 to 1997.\n\nIn professional wrestling, the staging area just behind the entrance curtain at an event, a position which Marella established and where he could often be found during WWF shows late in his career, is named the \"Gorilla Position\" in his honor. Although remembered fondly by many viewers, Monsoon was voted Worst Television Announcer a record six times by readers of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" in the publication's annual awards poll.\n\nMarella attended Jefferson High School in Rochester, New York, becoming a standout athlete in football, amateur wrestling, and track and field. At the time, he weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg), and was affectionately called \"Tiny\" by his teammates.\n\nMarella was also a standout athlete after high school at Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York. He continued to wrestle, now weighing over 350 pounds, and took second in the 1959 NCAA Wrestling Championships. He also held several school athletic records, including an 18-second wrestling pin, and several track-and-field distinctions. He was inducted into the Ithaca College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973. During the summers he was at Ithaca College, he was a construction worker in Rochester. One of the buildings he helped construct was the Rochester War Memorial Arena. He was inducted into the Section V Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2010 along with longtime childhood friend Frank Marotta who gave a speech on his behalf.\n\nMarella's size and athletic ability attracted the attention of New York promoter Pedro Martinez, and he went to wrestle for Martinez after graduating from Ithaca in 1959. Gorilla was 6'2\" and weighed around 330 pounds when he first started wrestling professionally. By the end of his career he was up around 375 pounds, although he had weighed as much as 440 pounds at points.\n\nMarella originally billed himself as Gino Marella, a proud Italian American babyface who would sing in Italian prior to his matches. Even after changing his ring name, \"Gino\" stuck as Marella's nickname among friends and colleagues, including Jesse Ventura, who would call Marella \"Gino\" on the air. Marella garnered moderate popularity, but soon realized that fans paid more attention to outlandish monster heel gimmicks, and they therefore made more money. Marella totally revamped his image, growing a long beard and billing himself as Gorilla Monsoon, a terrifying giant from Manchuria. Supposedly born on an isolated farm, \"Monsoon\" traveled across the countryside with a gypsy caravan wrestling bears, spoke no English, ate raw meat, and drank his victims' blood. The story given on WWWF television was a bit different: his first manager, Bobby Davis, claimed to have discovered Monsoon in Manchuria wading nude in a mountain stream. The Monsoon character was far more successful, and fans were genuinely afraid of him, sparking a huge financial windfall for Marella. In the ring, Monsoon dominated opponents with vicious chops, the dreaded Manchurian Splash, and his signature move, the Airplane Spin.\n\nMarella first wrestled Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Championship on October 4, 1963, at Roosevelt Stadium, in Jersey City, New Jersey Monsoon qualified by winning a partially televised Ring Wrestling Magazine tournament, where he pinned Killer Buddy Austin in about a minute.\nMonsoon's disqualification win over Sammartino in NJ triggered a series of rematches at Madison Square Garden, and they would renew the feud again there in 1967. At the end of the Jersey City match as Monsoon was sitting on the mat a fan (not part of the show) jumped into the ring and broke the back of a wooden chair over Monsoon's head.\n\nIn 1963, Vincent J. McMahon reformed the Capitol Wrestling Corporation into the \"World Wide Wrestling Federation\" (WWWF) (currently known as World Wrestling Entertainment), breaking his territory away from the National Wrestling Alliance in an attempt to create a new national powerhouse. At the time, the WWWF was the dominant wrestling promotion in the Northeast U.S. Marella formed a friendship with McMahon, and became a 1/6 shareholder in the WWWF, controlling bookings in several WWWF territories. He also became one of the promotion's top heels, feuding with popular babyface champion Bruno Sammartino in sellout arenas across the country. Despite his huge size, then in excess of 400 pounds, Monsoon had great agility and stamina, often wrestling Sammartino to one-hour time-limit draws.\n\nMonsoon teamed up with Killer Kowalski with success. In November 1963, they defeated Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard to win the U.S. Tag Team Championship. The following month, the duo lost the belts to the Tolos Brothers (Chris and John) in Teaneck, New Jersey. Monsoon and Kowalski reunited in the late 1960s to defeat champion Bruno Sammartino and Victor Rivera 2 falls to 1 in Madison Square Garden in a main event, marking the first, and possibly only time, that Sammartino & Rivera lost as a tag team.\n\nMonsoon also teamed with Professor Toru Tanaka, and they had a number of tag matches in Madison Square Garden.\nThey won a main event on disqualification over Sammartino and Spiros Arion and later lost a Texas Death rematch to the same team.\nA year later, after defeating teams such as Al Costello & Dr. Bill Miller and Bobo Brazil and Earl Maynard, they went on\nto lose a main event to Sammartino and Victor Rivera. Monsoon had semi main event matches with Spyros Arion as well as Bobo Brazil in his key heel years.\n\nIn 1969, Monsoon became a babyface, befriending his former arch-rival when Sammartino rescued him from an attack by \"Crazy\" Luke Graham. The stage was set for Monsoon to become a fan favorite of the 1970s and feud with top heels of the decade, including champion Superstar Billy Graham. He turned heel for a short time in 1977 and feuded with André the Giant, and the two engaged in a special boxing match in Puerto Rico (where Monsoon owned stock in the territory), with André winning the match.\n\nAs a face, he had major wins in Madison Square Garden, including over Killer Kowalski as well as \"Big Cat\" Ernie Ladd.\n\nOn June 2, 1976, a very famous incident occurred in Philadelphia involving boxing great Muhammad Ali. Ali, preparing for his upcoming crossover bout with Antonio Inoki in Japan later that month, jumped into the ring as Monsoon was concluding a short match against Baron Mikel Scicluna that was being taped for the syndicated WWWF TV show. Ali removed his shirt and started dancing around Monsoon while gesturing and throwing jabs at him, to which Monsoon responded by grabbing Ali in his Airplane Spin and slamming him to the mat. Marella would never reveal whether the incident was preplanned. In an interview, he commented, \"I never saw him before and haven't seen him since.\"\n\nA kind of torch bearer of the Vincent J. McMahon-era WWWF, Gorilla Monsoon was rabidly supported by New York audiences. On June 16, 1980, a young and up-and-coming Hulk Hogan was booked to face him at Madison Square Garden. At the time, Hogan was a widely followed heel character, while Monsoon was still a babyface. However, in order to push the new talent, McMahon told Hulk Hogan to beat Monsoon in under a minute. Upon that outcome, the crowd became livid and chased Hogan when he was leaving the arena, turning over his car. Policemen on horses had to be summoned to quiet the mob.\n\nAs the 1980s began, Marella's in-ring career wound down. On August 23, Monsoon put his career on the line in a match against Ken Patera. Monsoon lost the match and stayed true to his word, retiring several weeks later and returning just four times: wrestling a match in 1982 as a substitute for André the Giant, taking part in Big John Studd's \"Body Slam Challenge\" in 1983, a six-man tag team match at Madison Square Garden, and participating in a special \"old timers\" battle royal in 1987 which was won by Lou Thesz. The next phase of his career began, as the voice and backstage manager of WWF.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Vincent J. McMahon's son, Vincent K. McMahon, began assuming the reins of the promotion from his father. The elder McMahon asked his son to take care of long-time employees that had been loyal to him. The younger McMahon agreed, and in 1982, Vince bought Marella's shares in the company in exchange for a guarantee of lifetime employment. As he had been to his father, Marella became a close confidant of the younger McMahon, and assumed a prominent backstage role within the then WWF. Marella would then become an announcer for the WWF starting in 1982. In addition, McMahon needed a new commentary team to head up his television programming, and installed Marella with the recently retired Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura in 1985.\n\nMarella and Ventura had great chemistry, with Ventura as the pro-heel color commentator and Marella as the pro-face \"voice of reason\". Marella and Ventura called five of the first six WrestleManias together (the notable exception was WrestleMania 2, where Marella commentated on the Chicago portion of the event with Gene Okerlund, Cathy Lee Crosby and Ernie \"The Cat\" Ladd while Ventura commentated on the Los Angeles portion with Lord Alfred Hayes and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark).\n\nThe Ventura/Monsoon duo of heel and babyface were the original broadcast duo, setting the standard which all who followed would attempt to emulate, especially Ventura's charismatic pro-heel character which was a first of its kind as previous wrestling commentators had almost always been in favor of the fan favorites. The pair commentated on all the WWF pay-per-views together with the exception of the first two SummerSlams and the 1990 Royal Rumble (at SummerSlam 1988 Ventura was the guest referee for the main event so Monsoon commentated with \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, while Ventura was paired with Tony Schiavone at both SummerSlam 1989 and the Royal Rumble). When Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, he was replaced in commentary by Monsoon's \"Prime Time Wrestling\" co-host, heel manager Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, another duo that subsequent wrestling commentary teams have often tried to emulate. The two also formed a close real-life friendship which Heenan often recalled fondly. In his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech at the 2004 ceremony, Heenan finished by saying that only one thing was missing – that he wished Monsoon was there. Other people who were often paired with Monsoon in the broadcast booth included Lord Alfred Hayes, Johnny Polo, \"Superstar\" Billy Graham, Hillbilly Jim, Tony Schiavone, Jim Neidhart, Randy Savage and Jim Ross.\n\nMonsoon called the first eight WrestleManias from 1985 to 1992. Monsoon was the lead commentator on the syndicated show, \"WWF All Star Wrestling\", its successor \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\", and the USA Network weekend show, \"WWF All American Wrestling\", as well as hosting the WWF weeknight show, \"Prime Time Wrestling\". Monsoon also served as co-host of \"Georgia Championship Wrestling\" on WTBS during McMahon's short-lived ownership of the promotion.\n\nAs a play-by-play commentator, Monsoon's colorful announcing style proved a perfect fit for the character-based WWF while, at the same time, maintaining the sporting aspect of pro wrestling. Not only would Monsoon call holds but he consistently brought up the athletic competition frequently mentioning his and Jesse's wrestling backgrounds and drawing on that, saying on occasion that he was \"glad [he] had retired\" (after a particularly devastating move during a match he was commentating). Gorilla would also mention the \"winners and losers purse\" when it came to match decisions. Monsoon accentuated the storylines surrounding the bouts while relying on hyperbole, deadpan humor and unique catchphrases. One such phrase was his ironic use of the word \"literally\", such as \"the Garden just literally exploded!\" Nearly every venue was described, at the start of the broadcast, as \"Jam packed to the rafters\", even events in a roofless location. Another popular catchphrase was, \"...and a beauty!\", which would usually follow a well-executed wrestling move (such as \"[A] clothesline, and a beauty!\"). On the other hand if Monsoon would see a poorly executed move he would quip \"not but behind it\".\n\nAnother of Monsoon's phrases was \"Will you stop?\" This was usually directed, in frustration, at co-commentator Bobby Heenan after he went off on one of his many heel-backing tangents or other rants. Monsoon also used \"will you stop\" when either Ventura, Heenan or any other heels he was commentating with would mention what a bad job referee Joey Marella was doing, the joke being that Marella was Monsoon's real life adopted son, a fact not well known among wrestling fans at the time.\n\nAnother classic Monsoon comment regularly heard just after he would sign on for an important event was, \"Pandemonium is running wild! The electricity in here is so thick that you can cut it with a knife!\" Another was \"This place has gone bananas!\", which was preceded by an event in which the audience had erupted in cheers or jeers, such as the entrance of a wrestler or the finish of a match. Many times, Monsoon would also substitute simple words with needlessly complex and obscure equivalents – for example, he memorably used \"external occipital protuberance\" as an alternative to \"back of the head.\" Or when a wrestler suffered a knee injury, he would state, \"He may have temporarily dislocated the patella!\" Heenan mocked this, once sarcastically calling a move to the \"cervial dervial part of the back.\" However, Monsoon also employed several homegrown substitutes for body part terminology – for example, describing the mouth as a \"kisser\" and the abdomen as \"the bread basket.\" When a wrestler put his finishing hold/maneuver on a jobber, he would say \"Get the (hot) shower ready, this one is history!\" or \"Stick the fork in (losing wrestler), he's done!\". While commentating a match where a title changes hands, Monsoon might declare \"History has been made!\" When discussing something he didn't believe would happen, he would say \"highly unlikely.\" If a babyface wrestler was attacked from behind or by surprise, he would refer to it as a \"Pearl Harbor Job.\" When a babyface wrestler used an illegal tactic on a heel wrestler that was used on the babyface earlier in the match, Monsoon would state \"What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\" Also, when a wrestler or tag team (usually the face) lost a match through illegal tactics (such as being hit with \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart's megaphone), Monsoon would often proclaim that there had been a \"miscarriage of justice\". Monsoon generally put more emphasis on this when the heel(s) won a championship match, or retained their title(s). When referring to the heel managers/on screen personalities (Bobby Heenan, Luscious Johnny V, Jimmy Hart, Brother Love, etc.), he would refer to them as \"That fountain of misinformation\" \"a walking advertisement for birth control\" or \"That piece of garbage\".\n\nWhen speaking to and/or about someone's lack of presence at some event, he would often remark that they were \"conspicuous by their absence.\" Other common phrases used were \"listen to the ovation for (name of wrestler)\" as a fan-favorite made his way to the ring and \"take a look at (name of wrestler)\" to highlight the impressiveness of a wrestler. Finally, during encounters between two super-heavyweights, Monsoon sometimes described the match as \"the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.\" This phrase became most well-known after being used to promote the match between André the Giant and Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania III. During matches which involved heavyweight wrestlers such as André the Giant, King Kong Bundy or the One Man Gang, Jesse Ventura would often reference Marella's own wrestling weight by asking him what he weighed at his heaviest, with Marella often replying \"440\" (), and that he could easily wrestle for an hour at that weight. Ventura would then usually ask where he got weighed to which the reply was usually that he would go to the truck weighbridges located on the interstate.\n\nMarella stepped down as the WWF's lead commentator at WrestleMania IX (where he was Master of Ceremonies) to make way for WCW recruit Jim Ross. He was phased out of \"Wrestling Challenge\" with Bobby Heenan and was moved to \"All-American Wrestling\" with Lord Alfred Hayes on April 11, 1993. He commentated with Jim Ross on WWF Radio for the broadcasts of SummerSlam 1993, Survivor Series 1993 and Royal Rumble 1994. He returned to the television broadcast team to call the King of the Ring 1994 with Randy Savage as well as covering a few episodes of \"Monday Night RAW\" in 1993 and 1994 whenever Vince McMahon was unavailable. He was also called upon sporadically to return to \"Challenge\" from 1993 to 1995, calling action with Stan Lane, Ted DiBiase, and Ross again. Monsoon also did various work for Coliseum Video. Marella's last pay-per-view commentary was for the 1994 Survivor Series, with Vince McMahon on play-by-play. Marella remained in his backstage role and appeared on-air frequently, becoming the storyline WWF President in the summer of 1995 (replacing Jack Tunney). The WWF President's role was to arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and make matches, similar to the current WWE general managers. It was during this time that, after he was attacked and (kayfabe) severely injured by Vader, that Roddy Piper became interim WWF President until WrestleMania XII, when Marella assumed the position again. Health concerns forced him to relinquish this role during the summer of 1997. Instead of naming a replacement, the WWF decided to retire the role of \"President\" and introduced Sgt. Slaughter as the new WWF Commissioner in August 1997. Marella's health deteriorated from there. In late 1998, Marella returned briefly to call the international version of \"WWF Superstars\". In 1999, Marella appeared in a WWF Attitude commercial featuring Freddie Blassie, Ernie Ladd, Pat Patterson and Killer Kowalski. His final appearance on WWF television before his death was as one of the three judges for a \"Brawl for All\" contest between Bart Gunn and Butterbean at WrestleMania XV. Because of his frail appearance and rapidly declining health, the camera only focused on Monsoon during his introduction as a judge, for which he received a standing ovation.\n\nMarella was married to his wife, Maureen, for more than 40 years and had three children: Sharon (born 1960), Joey (adopted, 1963–1994), and Valerie (born 1966).Victor Quinones (1959-2006) was listed in Gorilla's obituary as his son as well. This was never confirmed officially by Gorilla but the Marella family has acknowledged this after Gorilla's death.\n\nAlong with Linda McMahon, Marella was considered as a possible replacement for Vince McMahon as the owner of the WWF if McMahon had been found guilty during his 1994 legal trial for illegal steroid use in the company.\n\nOn July 4, 1994, his adopted son, Joey Marella, fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike, while returning from refereeing a WWF event in Ocean City, Maryland. He was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.\n\nFor years, Marella had a custom New Jersey license plate which read \"kayfabe\".\n\nMarella died on October 6, 1999, of heart failure brought on by complications of diabetes, at his home in Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He was 62 years old. In a tribute that aired on October 11, 1999, on an episode of \"Raw Is War\" from the Georgia Dome, McMahon described Marella as \"one of the greatest men I have ever known.\"\n\nHe is interred next to his son, Joey Marella, at Lakeview Memorial Park in Cinnaminson, New Jersey.\n\nWCW commentator Tony Schiavone acknowledged Marella's death on the October 11, 1999, episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". Bobby Heenan insisted on doing a tribute to Marella, even though Marella never worked for WCW. Heenan said on-air: \"Gorilla will be sadly missed. Now he was one big tough man. He was a decent honest man. And we're all gonna miss him very much. And you know the pearly gates in heaven? It's now gonna be called 'the Gorilla position.' Goodbye, my friend.\"\n\nRobert Marella was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame, class of 1994, on June 9.\n\nWhen Heenan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2004, he ended his acceptance speech with a very emotional, \"There's only one thing missing, I wish Monsoon was here.\"\n\nIn 2007, when Anthony Carelli made his debut with WWE, as a tribute to Marella, he was given the ring name \"Santino Marella\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6269982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6269982", "title": "McMillan Plan", "text": "McMillan Plan\n\nThe McMillan Plan (formally titled The Report of the Senate Park Commission. The Improvement of the Park System of the District of Columbia) is a comprehensive planning document for the development of the monumental core and the park system of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. It was written in 1902 by the Senate Park Commission. The commission is popularly known as the McMillan Commission after its chairman, Senator James McMillan of Michigan.\n\nThe McMillan Plan proposed eliminating the Victorian landscaping of the National Mall and replacing it with a simple expanse of grass, narrowing the Mall, and permitting the construction of low, Neoclassical museums and cultural centers along the Mall's east–west axis. The plan proposed constructing major memorials on the western and southern anchors of the Mall's two axes, reflecting pools on the southern and western ends, and massive granite and marble terraces and arcades around the base of the Washington Monument. The plan also proposed tearing down the existing railroad passenger station on the National Mall and constructing a large new station north of the United States Capitol building.\n\nAdditionally, the McMillan Plan contemplated the construction of clusters of tall, Neoclassical office buildings around Lafayette Square and the Capitol building, as well as an extensive system of neighborhood parks and recreational facilities throughout the city. Major new parkways would connect these parks as well as link the city to nearby attractions.\n\nNever formally adopted by the United States government, the McMillan Plan was implemented piecemeal in the decades after its release. The location of the Lincoln Memorial, Ulysses S. Grant Memorial, Union Station, and U.S. Department of Agriculture Building are due to the McMillan Plan. Proposals to construct Arlington Memorial Bridge received a major boost from the plan as well. The McMillan Plan continues to guide urban planning in and around Washington, D.C., into the 21st century, and has become a part of the federal government's official planning policy for the national capital.\n\nBeginning around 1880, a series of articles appeared in the local D.C. and national press which were highly critical of the mediocre architecture and poor-quality public spaces and accommodations in the District of Columbia. In addition, a highly influential meeting of the American Institute of Architects was held in Washington in December 1900, during which not only were the city's shortcomings extensively discussed but plans proposed for rectifying them. The plan presented at that meeting by Washington-based architect Paul J. Pelz anticipates several decisions in the eventual McMillan Plan, including the grouping of Congressional office buildings around the Capitol, the development of Federal Triangle, and the location of the National Archives Building.\n\nThe Senate Park Commission was formed by the United States Senate on March 8, 1901, to reconcile competing visions for the development of Washington, D.C., and especially the National Mall and nearby areas. McMillan Commission members included architect Daniel Burnham, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., and architect Charles F. McKim. Charles Moore, Senator McMillan's chief aide, became secretary of the commission. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens joined the commission as its last member in August 1901 at the suggestion of McKim.\n\nThe commission members (excluding Saint-Gaudens, who was ill with cancer) and Moore departed for Europe on June 13, 1901, to tour the continent's great manor homes, gardens, and urban landscapes. By the time the commission returned to the United States on August 1, Moore had become a \"de facto\" member of the commission.\n\nThe commission sponsored a major exhibit about their proposals at the Corcoran Gallery of Art on January 15, 1902, the same day the report was released to the public. President Theodore Roosevelt attended the exhibit's opening. The exhibit was dominated by two vast models of the District of Columbia, one showing it as it existed in 1901 and the other showing the changes proposed by the Senate Park Commission.\nSeventy-one of the report's pages discussed proposals for the National Mall, while the remaining 100 pages discussed improvements for the park system in and around the city. The proposals for the National Mall received the greatest attention from the commission, and were the most detailed. The proposals for the city's parks, beaches, and recreational facilities (ostensibly the reason for its existence) were treated in more general ways. Scattered throughout the plan were references to streets, boulevards, parkways, and various other connections between District and regional parks and the District and the surrounding cities and undeveloped areas.\n\nThe report proposed turning the National Mall into the core of the growing city. A cruciform design for the Mall was proposed. The United States Capitol building anchored the east end of the east–west axis, and the White House the north end of the north–south axis. In the center was the Washington Monument. The recently completed West Potomac Park would be the anchor for the west end of the east–west axis. The commission suggested the recently authorized Lincoln Memorial be sited in the park, while proposing that the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial be moved to a new plaza to be constructed directly west of the Capitol. The recently created East Potomac Park would anchor the southern end of the north–south axis, and be occupied by a vast complex of recreational facilities (\"Washington Commons\") as well as a possible new memorial (to the Founding Fathers or great inventors, the report suggested). Andrew Jackson Downing's winding Victorian landscape design on the National Mall would be replaced with an open vista of grass flanked by formal rows of trees similar to the landscape design at Vaux-le-Vicomte and the Palace of Versailles in France. The width of the Mall, determined after extensive on-site measurements, would be narrowed to just . The north and south sides of the National Mall were to be lined with low public office buildings, museums, and cultural attractions (such as theaters). The plan also suggested constructing a low, Beaux-Arts bridge linking West Potomac Park with Arlington National Cemetery. Around the base of the Washington Monument, new formal gardens and terraces would help to frame the base of the monument. The Pennsylvania Railroad's Baltimore & Potomac (B&P) Railroad Passenger Terminal, located on the National Mall at what is today New Jersey Avenue NW and Constitution Avenue NW, would be torn down and a new, modern train station with a grand court and massive passenger waiting and service areas would be constructed north of the Capitol. Two new reflecting pools (or \"canals\") would be constructed on the National Mall. One (cruciform in shape) would extend from West Potomac Park to the Washington Monument. The other would extend from East Potomac Park north to the Washington Monument. The Ellipse would remain open space in order to preserve the vista from the White House south to the Washington Monument and the Potomac River.\n\nThe L'Enfant Plan's diagonal streets formed the great boundaries of the city's new \"monumental core\". Pennsylvania Avenue NW, already an important thoroughfare, formed the northeast boundary linking the Capitol with the White House. The report asked the federal government to tear down the vast slum Murder Bay and replace it with a group of monumental federal office buildings similar to Westminster in London or the Louvre Palace in Paris. Lafayette Square north of the White House would also be razed, and new federal office buildings in the Neoclassical style built there. New York Avenue NW would be extended in a southwesterly direction past the White House to link with the new memorial in West Potomac Park. Maryland Avenue SW, extending from the Capitol to East Potomac Park, would form the southeastern boundary of this new monumental core, while the Potomac River formed the southwestern boundary. The commission suggested that taller federal buildings and museums be constructed in areas not immediately adjacent to the National Mall.\n\nThe park system proposed by the McMillan Plan drew heavily on the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston (also designed by Olmsted). The commission proposed establishing large numbers of neighborhood parks throughout the city, especially in those areas outside the old \"Federal City\" boundaries. Public bathing and swimming facilities, gymnasiums, and playgrounds were an integral part of each proposed park, and the commission's report provided extensive drawings of \"model parks\". The commission's goal was to transform parks from places where the wealthy promenaded for purposes of social mobility into places where the average citizen could reap the advantages of physical exercise while enjoying the moral uplift provided by a natural setting within an urban area. Of critical importance to the commission was the development of the Anacostia Flats along the Anacostia River. The flats (like West and East Potomac Parks) had recently been reclaimed by dumping dredged material along the riverbank to eliminate marshes. The commission suggested building roads to provide access to the Anacostia River, and constructing a large water park for boating, bathing, swimming, and other uses to draw development to the area.\n\nLinking the more important parks would be a series of parkways, designed to allow citizens in carriages (the automobile not having come into widespread use) to become emotionally refreshed by viewing nature. Parkways were envisioned along the south side of the Potomac River from Arlington National Cemetery down to Mount Vernon, and from West Potomac Park through Rock Creek Park to the National Zoological Park. Another parkway (known as \"Fort Drive\"), nearly circumferential around the city, would link newly created parks designed to preserve the historic Civil War forts which circled the District of Columbia.\nImplementation of the McMillan Plan was opposed by the powerful Speaker of the House, Joseph Gurney Cannon. Cannon was angry that the Senate had bypassed the House in creating the commission, and he was strongly opposed to spending the enormous sums that it would take to complete the plan. Although Moore had implemented a carefully planned public relations campaign to win congressional and public support for the McMillan Plan, it was clear that seeking formal approval of the plan from Congress was out of the question due to Cannon's opposition. Instead, members of the commission worked strenuously to ensure that the plan was not encroached upon, while waiting for a more opportune time to seek its implementation. Backers of the plan in Congress regularly called upon commission members to testify before Congress and in public hearings to defend the plan.\n\nOne of the most important goals of the McMillan Plan was to demolish the B&P Railroad Passenger Terminal. This proposal had generated widespread support in Congress for years, and on May 15, 1902, legislation was passed authorizing construction of a new Union Station. Although extensive disagreement broke out in the House over reimbursing the Pennsylvania Railroad for the cost of moving its tracks, legislation providing this reimbursement passed in 1903. The terminal was demolished in 1908.\nThe first major threat to implementing the McMillan Plan came in 1904. A new United States Department of Agriculture building had long been proposed for the south side of the National Mall between 7th and 14th Streets SW. The Department of Agriculture wanted to use all the space allotted to it, but McMillan Plan advocates argued that agriculture headquarters should be set back from the center of the National Mall by . Department of Agriculture officials, however, pointed out that the setback from the mall's center-line was already violated on the south side of the mall by the Smithsonian Institution Building. President Theodore Roosevelt gave his approval for construction of a new agriculture building in line with the Smithsonian headquarters, only to later learn that his decision violated the McMillan Plan (which he also supported). Agriculture officials then argued that, if they had to accept a smaller plot of land, they should be permitted to construct a taller building to compensate for the loss of space. Extensive disagreement broke out between Agriculture officials, members of Congress intent on keeping costs low, McMillan Plan advocates, and others not only about where the building should be placed but also how tall it should be. The new Agriculture Building was eventually built according to the McMillan Plan's setback line, and slightly lowered into the ground to accommodate the building's taller height.\n\nThe next major test of the McMillan Plan came with the siting of the Lincoln Memorial. A Lincoln Memorial Commission was authorized by Congress in 1910, and the commission immediately began wrestling with the many competing proposals for the memorial's location. Concurrently, members of the disbanded McMillan Commission were tiring of the constant demands on their time and the unpaid nature of their role. President Roosevelt agreed that a permanent commission on the arts should be created to help guide decisions regarding art and architecture in accordance with the McMillan Plan. Roosevelt established a commission by executive order shortly before he left office, but President William Howard Taft dissolved it and won congressional approval for a statutory United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) in 1910. Several members of the McMillan Commission were appointed to the CFA, as were many McMillan Plan supporters. When the Lincoln Memorial Commission found itself riven by disagreement over the new memorial's site, it sought out the advice of the CFA. Together, the Lincoln Memorial Commission and CFA worked together to approval West Potomac Park as the site for the new monument. The site for the Lincoln Memorial was approved in June 1911.\n\nOver the years, other decisions were made which helped reinforce the status of the McMillan plan as the \"official\" development plan for the District of Columbia. These included the siting of the Freer Gallery of Art in 1923, the creation of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1926 (which was formally charged with implementing the McMillan Plan), enactment of legislation authorizing the enlargement of the Capitol grounds in 1929 (in accordance with the McMillan Plan), and passage of the Capper-Cramton city park act (which sought to implement the McMillan Plan's park program). Arlington Memorial Bridge was authorized in 1925 after President Warren G. Harding got caught in a three-hour traffic jam during the dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A lengthy fight over the location of the bridge occurred, but the CFA won the battle and the bridge's construction (in the low, classical style advocated by the McMillan Plan) was authorized by Congress on February 24, 1925. The Public Buildings Act of 1926 authorized the razing of the Murder Bay slum and the construction of Federal Triangle in 1926, and the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway was authorized in 1928. Although construction of a massive terrace around the base of the Washington Monument proven unfeasable (it would have destabilized the monument's foundations), the National World War II Memorial was constructed at the eastern end of the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool in 2004.\n\nThe McMillan Plan continues to provide the underpinning for planning in the national capital in the 21st century. In 1997, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) issued a report entitled \"Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital\". The planning document was an attempt to update the McMillan Plan for the 21st century. It redefined the monumental core, and established new guidelines for locating museums, memorials, and federal buildings throughout the city. A second major report, \"Monumental Core Framework Plan: Connecting New Destinations with the National Mall\", was issued in April 2009. Written jointly by the NCPC and CFA, the planning document extends the McMillan Plan's values and planning concepts through the city. It proposed the creation of new \"federal centers\" through the city (away from the monumental core) and proposed redevelopment of the Washington Channel and Anacostia River waterfronts. A second planning effort, CapitalSpace, was also launched in 2009. A joint initiative of the NCPC, the National Park Service, and the government of the District of Columbia, CapitalSpace is designed to implement six of the major unfinished proposals of the McMillan Plan. These include linking the Fort Circle Parks with trails and parkways, improving recreational facilities, enhancing and maintaining neighborhood parks, establishing new and repairing existing playgrounds and school play yards, ensuring the protection and restoration of natural areas within and near the city, and transforming small and underutilized parks into vibrant new neighborhood centers.\n\nIn late 2012, work began on two billion-dollar projects to implement \"Extending the Legacy: Planning America's Capital\" were announced. The first project, named \"The Wharf\", is a $1.45 billion redevelopment of the waterfront roughly between 9th and 7th Streets SW along the Washington Channel. The project will build 10 mixed-use buildings each high. A privately owned cultural center and new public park will be included in The Wharf. A total of will be built, with about two-thirds of that built in the first phase. Maine Avenue SW will be remodeled, Water Street SW will be decommissioned and demolished, a pedestrian promenade built where Water Street was, and two new piers (for both private and commercial use) will be constructed. The second project announced is a $906 million project to replace and realign the aging Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge and build new interchanges between the bridge and Suitland Parkway, the bridge and Potomac Avenue SW, Suitland Parkway and Interstate 295, and Suitland Parkway and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue. The current four-lane bridge will be replaced with a six-lane bridge and brought into a more north–south alignment from its current northwest–southeast alignment. The cost of the bridge replacement is estimated at $573.8 million. A traffic circle with a large field (to be used for public gatherings, and suitable for several new memorials) will connect the north end of the bridge with Potomac Avenue SW. A second massive traffic oval on the south end of the bridge will help connect it to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, and help expand the city's \"monumental core\" into Anacostia. Reconstruction of the two interchanges is estimated to cost $209.2 million. The remainder of the budgeted funds will help remodel South Capitol Street into an urban boulevard from an industrial corridor, and renovate New Jersey Avenue SE.\n\nSeveral elements of the McMillan Plan remained unbuilt.\n\nOne major element was the large system of granite and marble terraces, steps, and arcades (\"Washington Monument Gardens\") proposed for the grounds around the base of the Washington Monument. It was later determined that construction of these features would require the removal of large quantities of earth. This would have destabilized the monument's foundations, however, and none of the proposed elements were built. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Park Service sponsored a design competition in 2011 to revitalize the Mall as part of a $700 million plan to transform it into a world-class park. The design partnership of Weiss/Manfredi + OLIN won a portion of the competition to redesign the Washington Monument grounds and the nearby Sylvan Theater. If implemented, the plan would lightly terrace the grounds of the Washington Monument, while creating deep terraces at the Sylvan Theater to create seating.\n\nAnother unbuilt major element was a collection of tall, Neoclassical office buildings around Lafayette Square. This proposal went unbuilt as the federal government struggled to complete the Federal Triangle complex. The cost of constructing the office complex during the mid to late 1930s, and the lack of materials and manpower during World War II and the Korean War, kept the complex from being built. Although a major effort was made in 1960 to begin razing the historic homes around Lafayette Square, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy opposed their destruction and successfully lobbied Congress and the General Services Administration to retain the structures. Mrs. Kennedy persuaded President John F. Kennedy to allow architect John Carl Warnecke to design a plan to allow the construction of two federal office buildings behind the smaller, historic structures. Warnecke's plan led to the construction of the New Executive Office Building in 1965 and the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building in 1967. They were the only two large office buildings constructed near Lafayette Square, and neither was Neoclassical in design.\nA third major unbuilt recommendation of the McMillan Plan involved the extensive \"Washington Commons\" recreational area on East and West Potomac Parks along the southern side of the Tidal Basin. The McMillan Plan evisioned extensive public bathing and swimming facilities along the Potomac River's edge here, as well as a number of athletic fields, several gymnasiums, and a stadium. Additionally, a major new Neoclassical or Beaux-Arts memorial would be constructed along the White House-Washington Monument axis to serve as the southern anchor of the cruciform National Mall plan. The Washington Commons was to have been built after the Washington Monument terraces and arcades. After it was determined that the Washington Monument grounds project could not be built, attention turned to Washington Commons. But by then the Great Depression was under way, and funds to complete the Tidal Basin in the form envisioned by the McMillan Plan no longer were available. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed construction of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson on the south side of the Tidal Basin. Although the memorial was opposed by the CFA, President Roosevelt ordered its construction and the Jefferson Memorial was completed in 1943.\n\nThe proposed \"Fort Circle Drive\" is another unbuilt part of the plan. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress to build Fort Circle Drive. But civic leaders and the National Park Service openly questioned whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness. They argued that the city had grown past the ring of forts that protected it a century earlier, and city roads already connected the parks (albeit not in the linear route envisioned by the McMillan Plan). The plan to link the city's Civil War fort-parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in the years that followed.\n\nA final unbuilt recommendation of the McMillan Plan was the concept of grouping a large number of executive branch office buildings around the United States Congress. The concept was two-fold: To complement the existing United States Botanic Garden (built in 1867), Library of Congress Building (built in 1897), Cannon House Office Building (built in 1908), and Russell Senate Office Building (built in 1909) to create a symmetrical look to the Capitol environs; and to reduce the time and trouble it took for executive branch workers to serve the needs of Congress. No executive branch office buildings were ever constructed. A number of buildings were constructed nearby, but they were not in the symmetrical siting or design advocated by the McMillan Plan. These structures included the Longworth House Office Building (finished in 1933), the United States Supreme Court Building (finished in 1935), and the John Adams Library of Congress Building (finished in 1939). The Longworth and Adams buildings were both on the House side, and no attempt was made to purchase the land bounded by Maryland Avenue NE, 1st Street NE, and Constitution Avenue NE. This property was quickly developed with private office buildings without reference to the McMillan Plan. Yet another building, the Rayburn House Office Building, was built on the House side in 1965. This left the United States Capitol Complex unbalanced. Only in 1972 was the relatively small Dirksen Senate Office Building completed on the Senate side. Thus far, all the buildings constructed were within the Beaux-Arts or \"stripped Neoclassical\" style. But in 1976, construction on the James Madison Library of Congress Building was completed in the southeast corner of the Capitol Complex. Not only was this building on the House side (again), but it was Modernist in style and did not fit well architecturally with the other structures. This was followed in 1982 with the Modernist Hart Senate Office Building, whose primary concession to the Beaux-Arts style was a marble exterior.\n\nAlthough many neighborhood parks were created in the District of Columbia pursuant to the McMillan Plan, the scope of expansion contemplated by the plan was not achieved. Implementation of the neighborhood park, playground, and recreational facilities program was left to the D.C. government, which lacked the extensive resources of the federal government to implement the McMillan Plan. Few areas beyond the old \"Federal City\" boundary were purchased for park or recreational land. As the city rapidly expanded, this land dramatically increased in price and the city found itself unable to obtain as much land as it wished. The inability of the city government to implement the scope of the McMillan Plan's park proposals is considered the largest failure the plan faced.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47244116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47244116", "title": "Missing Maps", "text": "Missing Maps\n\nMissing Maps is a humanitarian project that preemptively maps parts of the world that are vulnerable to natural disasters, conflicts, and disease epidemics. It was founded in November 2014 by the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders and has so far mapped large towns and cities in countries such as South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic.\n\nThe idea to create the Missing Maps project was born out of a realisation by the American Red Cross, British Red Cross, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, and Médecins Sans Frontières that maps are pivotal to delivering humanitarian aid. In civil wars, for example, maps can help individuals and organisations track the movement of internally displaced populations and determine where best to conduct food and non-food item distributions. Or in the case of disease outbreaks, emergency responders can use maps to identify the source of the outbreak and identify the most effective infection control methods. Baraka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the end of 2014 became one of the pilot projects.\n\nThe project is aimed at preemptively mapping vulnerable parts of the world to create highly detailed maps that will be ready for first-responders to use in the event of a disaster, conflict, or disease epidemic. It relies on a large volunteer community to map these areas through online, remote mapping in the initial phases. Once these digital maps are validated by experienced mappers, they are then sent to field teams to be updated and revised.\n\n\n\nThe mapping process is largely driven by demands in the field. Humanitarian organisations identify areas of vulnerability that are then set as tasks on the HOT tasking manager for remote mapping. Once an area has been mapped and validated, the maps are sent to field staff who work with local people to travel to the mapped areas and input names of streets and key buildings and check for errors. After this step, the maps are deemed ready for use and made available online for free.\n\nAs the mapping is done preemptively, the first step largely involves field staff from MSF, the British Red Cross, and the American Red Cross engaging in dialogue together to identify key areas of vulnerability. They understand the challenges of implementing field projects and are often engaged in delivering frontline humanitarian assistance. Sometimes these challenges are about understanding the locations of malnourished children or the direction that a disease is spreading. When head offices are notified of such challenges, the Missing Maps project activates an online task for remote mapping.\n\nOnce the task is online on the HOT tasking manager, the three humanitarian organisations and HOT alert their supporters through social media, e-mail, and communities to the mapping need. Volunteers trace buildings, streets, swamps, rivers, and all other landmarks onto satellite imagery using the tasking manager. Then volunteer validators check the map that has been created and determine whether it is ready for field mapping or not.\n\nAfter the maps have been declared ready for field mapping, they are printed out by humanitarian volunteers on the ground. They work in collaboration with locals from the community to collect local data about road names, settlements, the natural landscape, and the exact locations of the people they are trying to help. This information is then put into the online map and declared ready for use.\n\nWith detailed maps validated in the field by locals themselves, humanitarian organisations can use the mapped information to plan risk reduction and disaster response activities that save lives.\n\n"}

Performance can also be modeled and simulated instead of measured; one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance or to use a Network Simulator.\n\nThe following measures are often considered important:\n\n\nThe available channel bandwidth and achievable signal-to-noise ratio determine the maximum possible throughput. It is not generally possible to send more data than dictated by the Shannon-Hartley Theorem.\n\n\"Throughput\" is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time. Throughput is controlled by available bandwidth, as well as the available signal-to-noise ratio and hardware limitations. Throughput for the purpose of this article will be understood to be measured from the arrival of the first bit of data at the receiver, to decouple the concept of throughput from the concept of latency. For discussions of this type the terms 'throughput' and 'bandwidth' are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe \"Time Window\" is the period over which the throughput is measured. Choice of an appropriate time window will often dominate calculations of throughput, and whether latency is taken into account or not will determine whether the latency affects the throughput or not.\n\nThe speed of light imposes a minimum propagation time on all electromagnetic signals. It is not possible to reduce the latency below\n\nwhere s is the distance and c is the speed of light in the medium. This approximately means 1 extra millisecond roundtrip time (RTT) for 100 km/62miles of distance between hosts.\n\nOther delays also occur in intermediate nodes. In packet switched networks delays can occur due to queueing.\n\nJitter is the undesired deviation from true periodicity of an assumed periodic signal in electronics and telecommunications, often in relation to a reference clock source. Jitter may be observed in characteristics such as the frequency of successive pulses, the signal amplitude, or phase of periodic signals. Jitter is a significant, and usually undesired, factor in the design of almost all communications links (e.g., USB, PCI-e, SATA, OC-48). In clock recovery applications it is called \"timing jitter\".\n\nIn digital transmission, the number of bit errors is the number of received bits of a data stream over a communication channel that have been altered due to noise, interference, distortion or bit synchronization errors.\n\nThe bit error rate or bit error ratio (BER) is the number of bit errors divided by the total number of transferred bits during a studied time interval. BER is a unitless performance measure, often expressed as a percentage.\n\nThe bit error probability \"p\" is the expectation value of the BER. The BER can be considered as an approximate estimate of the bit error probability. This estimate is accurate for a long time interval and a high number of bit errors.\n\nAll of the factors above, coupled with user requirements and user perceptions, play a role in determining the perceived 'fastness' or utility, of a network connection. The relationship between throughput, latency, and user experience is most aptly understood in the context of a shared network medium, and as a scheduling problem.\n\nFor some systems, latency and throughput are coupled entities. In TCP/IP, latency can also directly affect throughput. In TCP connections, the large bandwidth-delay product of high latency connections, combined with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively causes the throughput of a high latency connection to drop sharply with latency. This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet coalescing, TCP acceleration, and forward error correction, all of which are commonly used for high latency satellite links.\n\nTCP acceleration converts the TCP packets into a stream that is similar to UDP. Because of this, the TCP acceleration software must provide its own mechanisms to ensure the reliability of the link, taking the latency and bandwidth of the link into account, and both ends of the high latency link must support the method used.\n\nIn the Media Access Control (MAC) layer, performance issues such as throughput and end-to-end delay are also addressed.\n\nMany systems can be characterized as dominated either by throughput limitations or by latency limitations in terms of end-user utility or experience. In some cases, hard limits such as the speed of light present unique problems to such systems and nothing can be done to correct this. Other systems allow for significant balancing and optimization for best user experience.\n\nA telecom satellite in geosynchronous orbit imposes a path length of at least 71000 km between transmitter and receiver. which means a minimum delay between message request and message receipt, or latency of 473 ms. This delay can be very noticeable and affects satellite phone service regardless of available throughput capacity.\n\nThese long path length considerations are exacerbated when communicating with space probes and other long-range targets beyond Earth's atmosphere. The Deep Space Network implemented by NASA is one such system that must cope with these problems. Largely latency driven, the GAO has criticized the current architecture. Several different methods have been proposed to handle the intermittent connectivity and long delays between packets, such as delay-tolerant networking.\n\nAt interstellar distances, the difficulties in designing radio systems that can achieve any throughput at all are massive. In these cases, maintaining communication is a bigger issue than how long that communication takes.\n\nTransportation is concerned almost entirely with throughput, which is why physical deliveries of backup tape archives are still largely done by vehicle.\n\n\n\n"}

Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range.\n\nWith the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate quickstart guide is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on CD-ROM to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a videotape or DVD, along with the owner's manual.\n\nMany businesses offer PDF copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.\n\nAn installation manual or installation guide is a technical communication document intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a technical writer or other technical staff. \n\nInstallation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use. An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the setup.\n\nIn case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual.\n\nThe size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions.\n\nThe international standard IEC 82079 prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting.\n\nFor machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.  \n\nAll new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the glove compartment for easy reference.

Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used.

Its main editorial focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Launched on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid, \"Passion\" eventually evolved into a glossy 140-page magazine.\n\n\"Passion\" was conceived as a forum for the written word and to showcase the visual side of Paris. It regularly published excellent photography and benefited from the pool of creative illustrators in Paris. The magazine’s use of strong eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity.\n\nLaunched in November 1981, Paris Passion was an English-language magazine in France that existed until early 1991. Its main editorial focus was on life in Paris for both residents and visitors. Also known as \"Passion\", it featured an eclectic mix of feature journalism, interviews with leading figures in Paris, city consumer advice, coverage of French arts, culture, politics, design, architecture, food and fashion and was also a regular showcase for excellent photography. For many years, \"Passion\" also had a detachable events-listings section, published short fiction by Paris-based writers, a French-language section, and a separate fashion supplement called \"Accent\".\n\nDespite good distribution and a relatively high profile in Paris, \"Passion\" was more a critical success than a financial one. Its financial struggle undermined the magazine's full editorial potential. \"Passion\" began on a shoestring budget as a 24-page black-and-white tabloid and eventually evolved into a full-fledged glossy 140-page magazine. Over its nine-plus years, \"Passion\" published 78 issues.\n\nAt its peak, the circulation reached 50,000 copies, with almost a quarter of that distributed outside France. It was sold and displayed prominently in news kiosks and bookstores in Paris and even had street hawkers selling it in certain parts of the city. It was available in international newsstands in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, London, and Amsterdam and had subscribers in many countries.\n\nIn addition to its practical information and extensive arts and entertainment coverage, \"Passion\" became popular also for its often irreverent and humorous (but not mocking) take on the French and the challenges and idiosyncrasies of Paris life.\n\nIt did not shy away from serious issues. It tackled everything from the political intrigues at Paris City Hall to urban planning fiascoes to anti-Semitism in France to drug-related social problems in Paris to the plight of North African immigrants in France and a variety of environmental concerns.\n\n\"Passion\" can be seen as part of the time-honored tradition of expatriate English-language publishing in Paris that dates back to the early 20th century. Over the years, there have been numerous, mostly literary, publications published in English in the French capital, most of them short-lived.\n\n\"Passion\" was founded by expatriate Canadian journalist Robert Sarner. He moved to Paris in 1979 from Toronto where he had begun his career in journalism a few years earlier. Before starting \"Passion\", Sarner took part in the Paris-based 'Journalists In Europe' fellowship program. His partners in the magazine were Michael Budman and Don Green, both originally from Detroit and the co-founders of Roots Canada Ltd. (a successful apparel company and lifestyle brand). Sarner was the Editor-in-Chief and Publisher, while Budman and Green were the Executive Publishers. Sarner had first met Budman and Green in Canada a few years earlier when he approached them for investment in a city magazine that he had hoped to launch in Toronto.\n\nIn 1988, the London-based city magazine \"Time Out\" purchased the majority of \"Paris Passion\". \"Time Out\"'s owner Tony Elliott became the co-publisher with Robert Sarner who also remained the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nUnder the new ownership, \"Passion\" adopted a more conventional physical format, expanded its staff and moved into new, better-equipped headquarters. Two and a half years later, following a difference of opinion over the direction of the magazine, Elliott squeezed out Sarner in mid-1990. Elliott then brought in staff from London, redesigned the magazine, and changed the editorial style from American to British. But the business faltered further and \"Time Out\" ended up closing the magazine in 1991.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"Time Out\" used the \"Paris Passion\" name in conjunction with some of the annual Paris guides it published during that period.\n\n\"Paris Passion\" was conceived as both a forum for the written word and a showcase of the visual side of the city. One of its main objectives was to engage both the minds and the eyes of readers. To that end, the magazine drew on a wealth of freelance talent based in Paris that shared the editorial aims of its editors. Despite limited financial means, \"Passion\" featured well-established journalists, photographers and illustrators while also developing many younger writers who had rarely been published before.\n\nAs a magazine based in, and focused on, Paris, \"Passion\" attracted a wide range of talented expatriate writers and journalists eager to have their work published in English in a creative magazine circulated both in France and abroad. Some were longtime Paris residents, others were more recent arrivals. Most of the writers came from English-speaking counties, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India; others were French, (especially during the period when each issue of \"Passion\" published several pages in French). Collectively, they wrote many articles, columns, reviews and short stories that in one way or another related to Paris.\n\nThe following are some of the writers who contributed to \"Passion\" (listed in alphabetical order): Kathy Acker, John Baxter, Chris Boicos, Clement Barclay. Philip Brooks, Charla Carter, Ramesh Chandran, Tony Crawley, Claire Downey, David Downie, Fiona Dunlop, Jonathan Ferziger, Richard Foltz, Sarah Gaddis, Peter Green, Brion Gysin, Linda Healey, Susan Herman-Loomis, Edward Hernstadt, Amy Hollowell, Mark Honigsbaun, Mark Hunter, Doug Ireland, Nick Kent, Jack Kevorkian, Tanis Kmetyk, Dawn Kolokithas, Randy Koral, Corrine LaBalme, William Leone, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Barbara Lippert, J.B.

Its visual presentation, most of which focused on Paris, was an important part of its appeal.\n\nStarting with its first issue, \"Paris Passion\" always showed an appreciation for good photography, devoting generous space to photo essays, portfolios and portraits of Parisians. Photography was an intrinsic part of the magazine and helped shaped its identity. It was a natural development given the large number of talented photographers and leading photo agencies and galleries in Paris.\n\nOn a regular basis, \"Passion\" showcased the work of some of the world's leading photographers working in Paris. In the process, the magazine earned an enviable reputation for the quality of images featured in its pages.\n\nThe following are some of the photographers who worked with \"Passion\" and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): Jim Allen, Arnaud Bauman, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Clement Barclay, Chalkie Davies, Francois Dischinger, Barry Dunne, Christophe Galatry, Jean-Paul Goude, Frank Horvat, Benjamin Kanarek, William Klein, Xavier Lambours, Antoine LeGrand, Elizabeth Lennard, Erica Lennard, Jonathan Lennard, Berangere Lomont, Wily Maywald, Doug Metzler, Jacques Mitelman, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Helmut Newton, Scott Osman, Andre Ostier, Ian Patrick, Alain Potignon, Ray Reynolds, Bettina Rheims, David Rochline, David Seidner, Jean-Loup Sieff, Alice Springs, Lawrence Sudre, Keichi Tahara, Patrick Trautwein, Peter Turnley, Ellen von Unwerth, Javier Vallhonrat, Claus Wickrath, Patrick Wilen, Michael Williams, Rafael Winer.\n\nAs part of its design, \"Paris Passion\" also benefited from the enormous pool of gifted illustrators in Paris. It commissioned many French and expatriate illustrators to create images to enhance editorial content in the magazine.\n\nThe following are some of the illustrators who worked with \"Passion\" and/or whose work was featured prominently in the magazine (listed in alphabetical order): , Jean-Paul Buquet, Helene Cote, Milo Daax, Jean-Philippe Delhomme, Bil Donovan, Blair Drawson, David Dudu Geva, Diana Huff, Myles Hyman, Antonio Lopez, Patricia Marx, Tina Mercier, Philippe Petit-Roulet, Patricia Reznikav, Michael Roberts, Hippolyte Romain, Laurie Rosenwald, Tignous, Solweig Vonkleist.\n\nAmong the graphic artists and art directors who worked with \"Passion\" and contributed to the look of the magazine were Layne Jackson, Nancy Dorking, Judith Christ, Scott Minick and Rémy Magron.\n\nLike the rest of the magazine, \"Paris Passion\"'s front covers evolved considerably from the time of its first issue in 1981 until the last in 1991. The changes included going from black-and-white images to those in full color; from newsprint to glossy stock; from celebrity portraits to more conceptual illustrations; and different logos and varying approaches to the use of text.\n\nDuring the life of \"Passion\", its use of strong, eye-catching visuals on its large format covers was an influential part of its identity. \"Passion\" favored simple, clean, bold, colorful images to grab the attention of readers. It stemmed, in part, from the fact that as a magazine relying mainly on newsstands for its distribution, it had to stand out from other publications in order to establish and promote itself, especially in the absence of any marketing budget.\n\nIn Paris, in addition to its presence on newsstands and in kiosks, \"Passion\" also had a network of \"street hawkers\" who sold the magazine. They circulated in places where potential readers would congregate, from hip cafes and restaurants to major cultural events, fashion shows and tourist attractions where hawkers would hold up the latest issue for all to see, and hopefully buy. The cover played a critical role in determining the perception and sales of the magazine.\n\nIn the pursuit of effective images for its covers, \"Passion\" drew from the presence of many excellent photographers and illustrators in Paris (see text above). They liked seeing their work showcased on the covers of \"Passion\", thanks to its large size, its relatively unobtrusive cover text and good visibility in Paris kiosks and in international bookstores and newsstands in major cities outside France.\n\n"}

(The synonymous term shell folder is sometimes used instead.) Special folders make it possible for any application to ask the operating system where an appropriate location for certain kinds of files can be found; independently of which version or user language of Windows is being used.\n\nIn Windows Server 2003 and earlier, a folder like the \"Start Menu\" had a different name on non-English versions of Windows. For example, on German versions of Windows XP it is \"Startmenü\". However, starting with Windows Vista, all versions of Windows use the same English named folders and only display different names in the Windows Explorer. In Windows 10 the user can switch to another display language and the names of the special folders will change.\n\nWindows uses the concept of special folders to present the contents of the storage devices connected to the computer in a fairly consistent way that frees the user from having to deal with absolute file paths, which can (and often do) change between operating system versions, and even individual installations. The idea has evolved over time, with new special folders being added in every version of Windows post their introduction in Windows 95.\n\nMicrosoft's \"Compatible with Windows\" software logo requires that an application make use of special folders locations to locate the appropriate folders in which documents and application settings should be stored.\n\nA special folder can either be a reference to a physical file system directory, or a reference to a \"virtual\" folder. In the former case, they are analogous to environment variables — in fact, many of the environment variables that are set in a user's session are defined by where the special folders are set to point to.\n\nVirtual folders do not actually exist on the file system; they are instead presented through Windows Explorer as a tree of folders that the user can navigate. This is known as the Shell namespace. On Windows XP systems, the root of this namespace is the \"Desktop\" virtual folder, which contains the \"My Documents\", \"My Computer\", \"My Network Places\" (\"Network Neighborhood\" in Windows 95 and 98) and \"Recycle Bin\" virtual folders. Some virtual folders (like Desktop) have an accompanying special folder that is a reference to a directory on the physical file system. Windows Explorer displays the combined contents of a virtual folder and its associated file system folder to the user. This can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the Folder view in Windows XP's Explorer; in the Desktop virtual folder, the four standard virtual folders can be seen, as well as an additional folder, \"a folder on the desktop\", which is a real folder located in the Desktop directory in the user's profile.\n\nSome third-party programs add their own virtual folders to Windows Explorer.\n\nThe following tables list most of the file system and virtual folders that are available as of Windows Vista.

However, between the 2nd century BC and the 14th century AD, Tamil trader colonies were established in many parts of West Asia, South-East Asia and Egypt apart from the islands of the Indian Ocean.\n\nDuring British rule, large numbers of Tamils from the Madras Presidency were transported to Malaya, Singapore, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa, Central Sri Lanka, Reunion, Trinidad and Tobago, Fiji and Guyana to work as indentured labourers in sugar plantations. There was also a large mercantile class in Burma, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia and the Persian Gulf countries.\n\nThe first colonies of Tamil-speaking people outside the Indian mainland were founded in Sri Lanka. While there has been evidence of pre-historic Tamil settlements in Sri Lanka, the earliest records of a Tamil presence in the island date from about 185 BC, when the legendary Chola\nking Ellalan invaded and conquered Sri Lanka. Migration accelerated between the 5th and 14th centuries AD, when the Pallava, Chola and Pandya kings mounted large-scale expeditions to conquer the island. The presence of a large number of Tamil mercenaries in the island by the 11th century CE is indicated by the Velakkara Revolt. The migrations rapidly decreased after the attack of the Pandya kingdom by the Delhi Sultanate's Muslim general Malik Kafur in about 1317, though cultural and commercial contact between the southern Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka continued. The Nayaks of Kandy had matrimonial alliances with the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. Following the conquest of the Kandy kingdom by the East India Company in 1795, the British ruled the island as a part of Madras Presidency till 1803, when a separate administration was set up. Starting from the middle of the 19th century, the British transported large numbers of Tamils to work as indentured labourers in the hills of central Sri Lanka.\n\nAs of 2012, Tamil speakers constituted 25 percent of the total population of Sri Lankan population with large concentrations in the northern, north-eastern and central parts of the island. There has been uninhibited exchange of vocabulary between Tamil and Sinhala. Tamil is one of the official languages of Sri Lanka.\n\nDe-Tamilization refers to disappearance of Tamil culture and language. By the end of 13th century, the power of Tamil dynasties like Pandyans, Cheras and Cholas slowly declined in Tamilakam. The Tamil language disappeared in western Tamilakam (Kerala), which led to the rise of Malayalam, the people's language.\n\nThe state backed De-Tamilization or Sinhalisation of Sri Lanka was a major factor in contributing to the ethnic polarization towards the outbreak of the Sri Lankan civil war.\n\nList of countries where Tamil is an official language\n"}

Twenty-six of these dishes are now in the collection of the British Museum in London.\n\nThe dishes are parcel gilt with reeded rims and are engraved with the arms of Sir Christopher Harris of Radford. The Sherborne Mercury newspaper of Dorset reported on 28 January 1828, that following an \"inspection the Herald's office, London, the arms, which are very perfect all the pieces, were those of Sir Christopher Harris, an ancestor of the Harris family of Radford, near Plymouth, quartered with those of his wives,and who lived in the year 1600\". The arms of Sydenham are also said to be present, supposedly of one of Harris's wives \"Mary Sydenham\", who is not however listed in authoritative biographies. Sir Francis Drake did however have a connection with the Sydenham family of Combe Sydenham in Somerset. They bear prominent and large London hallmarks on the upper rims for the years 1581, 1599, 1600 and 1601.\nThe Armada Service was commissioned by Sir Christopher Harris (c. 1553–1625), of Radford in the parish of Plymstock, Devon, a Member of Parliament for Plymouth in Devon in 1584, Vice-Admiral of Devon during the reign of James I and a Commissioner for Booty at Plymouth under Sir Walter Raleigh. He was a close friend of Admiral Sir Frances Drake, who on one occasion lodged part of his captured treasure at Radford. In partnership with John Hele (died 1608) \nof Wembury in Devon, serjeant-at-law and MP, Harris acquired the estate of Buckland Abbey in Devon as a seat for Drake. During the 16th and 17th centuries amassing silver was usual for wealthy English families. Such collections served two distinct purposes: to increase family prestige and to act as a store of value or investment.\n\nDuring the Civil War (1642–1651) huge amounts of silver were melted down to pay for military supplies and wages, and the silver dishes were buried by the Harris family on the wild moorland of Dartmoor, near to Radford, to avoid being looted by Parliamentary troops. The silver was never subsequently recovered by the Harris family, who remained at Radford until after 1810, but was at last discovered in 1827, when three farm labourers employed by the Splat company of Brixham, discovered it in a cave they were excavating to increase the storage capacity for the company's potatoes. The local newspaper reported that \"upwards of 30 dishes\" had been found. In June 1911 the Splat family sold the dishes at Christie's auctioneers in London for £11,500 .\n\nThe service has been described as \"one of the most important groups of English silver to have been found in England.\" As a set of relatively plain objects, of which the bullion value may have exceeded the artistic worth, this service represents \"the unique survival of a type of utilitarian plate which is listed in the inventories of the gentry and aristocracy of the late Tudor and early Stuart periods.\"\n\nThe nomenclature of the hoard's name is subject to speculation by scholars. It was named by modern scholars the \"Armada Service\" in allusion to the Spanish Armada of 1588, a failed attempt by Spain to invade England, as it is believed to have a connection to New World silver captured and pilfered from the Spanish treasure fleet operating at about that time. 31 pieces were \"commissioned to mark the conquering of the Spanish naval fleet and used at a dinner thrown\" at Harris's seat at Radford. Some modern scholars have suggested a connection to the \"Madre de Deus\" (\"Mother of God\"), a Portuguese ship captured by the English in about 1590.

Edited by Fred R. Shapiro, it was published by Yale University Press in 2006 with a foreword by Joseph Epstein, . Prior to publication it was referred to by its working title, \"The Yale Dictionary of Quotations\". The book presents over 12,000 quotations on 1067 pages. It is arranged alphabetically by author (or, for some quotations, by quotation type), with some information as to the source of each quotation and, where the editor deems this relevant, cross-references to other quotations. A keyword index allows the reader to generally find quotations by significant words in the quotations.\n\nAs described in its introduction, \"The Yale Book of Quotations\" is characterized by its greater focus, relative to its nearest competitors, \"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations\" and \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\", on modern American quotations, including those that do not have conventional literary sources. These include quotations from politicians, judges, journalists, sportscasters, athletes, screenwriters, songwriters, and anonymous sources. There are special sections for some kinds of quotations, including advertising slogans, film lines, folk and anonymous songs, political slogans, proverbs, and television catchphrases. There is also coverage of traditional literary sources. There are, for example, 400 quotations from the Bible, 106 quotations from Charles Dickens, 127 quotations from T. S. Eliot, 153 quotations from Mark Twain, and 455 quotations from William Shakespeare. This coverage is less extensive than that offered by \"Bartlett's\", which provides 1,642 quotations from the Bible and 1,906 from Shakespeare.\n\n\"The Yale Book of Quotations\"' introduction also exhaustively describes the editor's attempts at research to identify many famous quotations, trace them to their original sources as far as possible, and record those sources as precisely and accurately as he could. In compiling the book, Shapiro made extensive use of online databases to find earlier or more precise information about famous quotations. He also used the Stumpers network of reference librarians and other research professionals; and the American Dialect Society electronic mailing list, as well as traditional library research. Shapiro claims that, to ensure that famous quotations were included, he reviewed more than a thousand previous quotations collections and other types of anthologies, read the alt.quotations newsgroup and other Internet and online resources for a while, and consulted experts on famous authors and types of literature.\n\nShapiro's research resulted in some interesting findings, on occasion correcting misattributions elsewhere.

These papers include an \"A list\" of so-called \"prominents\" interned in the camp and a \"B-list\" created by the Jewish Elders themselves. The Theresienstadt papers include two albums with biographies and many photographs, 64 watercolors and drawings from prisoners in Theresiendstadt, and the annual report of the Theresienstadt Central Library. The papers were preserved at the liberation of the camp in May 1945 by Theresienstadt librarian Käthe Starke-Goldschmidt and later loaned to the Altona Museum for Art and Cultural History in Hamburg by her son Pit Goldschmidt. The collection was opened for viewing by the public in 2002 at the Heine Haus branch of the Altona Museum.\n\nTheresienstadt, also called Terezin, was a hybrid of ghetto and concentration camp. Although in practice the ghetto, run by the SS, served as a transit camp for Jews en route to extermination camps, it was also presented as a \"model Jewish settlement\" for propaganda purposes.\n\nFrom 1942, the Nazis interned the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia, elderly Jews and persons of \"special merit\" in the Reich, and several thousand Jews from the Netherlands and Denmark. The camp became known as the destination for the \"Altentransporte\" (\"elderly transports\") of German Jews, older than 65. Many prominent artists from Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Germany were imprisoned at Theresienstadt, along with writers, scientists, jurists, diplomats, musicians, and scholars.\n\nAmong the western European Jews deported to the camp were 456 Jews from Denmark, sent to Theresienstadt in 1943, and a number of European Jewish children whom Danish organizations had tried to conceal in foster homes. The arrival of the Danes was significant, as their government requested access to the camp for the International Red Cross, so that they could view and evaluate conditions there. Historians believe the Nazis complied with the request to keep the Danes satisfied, as they were impressed by the production of Danish workers in factories. In addition, the tide of war was changing.\n\nAs part of the general preparations for the Red Cross visit, in the spring of 1944, the Gestapo screened the Jews of Theresienstadt, classifying them according to social prominence. The prominents of Theresienstadt were catalogued in two almost identical portfolios in blue cardboard cover and fasteners. Begun on 1 January 1944, these binders include not only resumes and many photographs, but identified the individual according to which category of prominence they fit, \"A\" or \"B\". The so-called prominents included cultural professionals, high-ranking military officers, politicians, scientists, aristocrats, bankers and industrialists and also, in some cases, their families.\n\nThose with prominent status drew generally favorable treatment from the camp commandant, including homes with better living conditions, greater food rations, no obligation to work, and, for the \"prominent category A\", first transport protection. For the Red Cross visit, some 150 to 200 prominent individuals were assigned to single rooms that would be shared by only two people, so that a husband and wife could live by themselves. Several members of the Cultural Council – the \"Jewish self-government of Theresienstadt\" selected on demand of the Nazis – were included on the prominent list, due to the influence of Benjamin Murmelstein, then an Elder of Theresienstadt. Former prisoners suggested in statements that those who held positions of authority practiced nepotism, trying to protect individuals close to them, while struggling to avoid deportation and death in the closing days of the war.\n\nThe 64 watercolors and drawings from the Theresienstadt camp were rescued by chief librarian Hugo Friedmann who had been gathering them secretly with the knowledge of library director Emil Utitz. He passed these works to Starke-Goldschmidt in September 1944, just before his deportation through Auschwitz to Dachau. The collection includes only a small part of the drawings and watercolors produced by artists within Theresienstadt to document daily life. (Many visual artists in Theresienstadt were employed in the design office of its Technical Department.) According to Starke-Goldschmidt, the artists lacked drawing paper, so she provided them with blank pages from the volumes within the library itself. The collection includes a self-portrait by Julie Wofthorn as well as images by Felix Bloch, Bedřich (Friedrich) Fritta, Leo Haas, Peter Kien and Otto Ungar. Some of these artists were eventually deported, with their families, to Auschwitz because the camp commandant became aware that they were smuggling images of \"atrocity propaganda,\" as the Nazis termed it, to Switzerland.\n\nThe Theresienstadt Central Library was one of several libraries in the combined ghetto and camp. The Central Library had been opened on the order of the camp commandant in November 1942 and remained active until the camp was dissolved, although the bulk of library staff was deported to Auschwitz in autumn of 1944 after the library had been beautified and shown to the Red Cross. During its years in operation, the library grew from a collection of 4,000 volumes to, at the end of the war, 180,000. Books included Hebraica, Judaica, fiction and classics alongside volumes of philosophy, history, and linguistic and scientific literature. The books had been confiscated from private individuals as well as from libraries, with 75% originating in Czechoslovakia and the rest coming from the German Reich. After the war, the holdings of the library were largely transferred to the Jewish Museum in Prague and, secondarily, to the Jerusalem National Library.\n\n\n"}

It is well illustrated in comic-style and much of the text is written as poetry in a humorous manner. The Fibel is remarkably different from the typical tedious style of a German tank manual of that period.\n\nThe manuals were approved by Heinz Guderian, the Inspector-General of Panzer troops. In the case of the Panther manual, he issued his approval in the manual's rhyming style, ending with the words, \"Die Pantherfibel ist genehmigt; wer sie nicht kennt, der wird erledigt\" (roughly \"The Panther fible is approved; who knows it not will be removed.\" )\n\n\n"}

Through this declaration, the British government unilaterally ended its protectorate over Egypt and granted it nominal independence with the exception of four \"reserved\" areas: foreign relations, communications, the military and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.\n\nThe declaration was preceded by a period of inconclusive negotiations between the Egyptian and British governments. Areas of disagreement included Egypt's position on the issues of the protectorate and of its future role in Sudan. Egyptian prime minister Adli Yakan Pasha and moderate Egyptian nationalists managed to obtain the agreement of British High Commissioner Edmund Allenby to secure the more general issue of Egypt's independence. The government of Liberal British prime minister Lloyd George wanted to maintain the protectorate over Egypt. However, Allenby threatened to resign. His actions brought the issue of Egyptian independence to public discussion and led to a quick official response: two weeks later the declaration was issued.\n\nAlthough it met the Egyptian nationalists' immediate demands for an end to the protectorate, the declaration was globally unsatisfactory since it did not grant Egypt full independence. Egyptian sovereignty was greatly restricted by the \"reserved points\" clause. This led to sustained pressure on the United Kingdom from Egyptian nationalists to renegotiate the relationship between the two countries, which finally occurred with the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.\n\n\"The following text was first published in 1922. As a result, it is currently in the public domain in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom where its Crown copyright has expired.\"\n"}
