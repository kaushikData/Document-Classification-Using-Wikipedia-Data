{"id": "1928876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928876", "title": "An Instinct for Dragons", "text": "An Instinct for Dragons\n\nAn Instinct for Dragons is a book by University of Central Florida anthropologist David E. Jones, in which he seeks to explain the alleged universality of dragon images in the folklore of human societies. In the introduction, Jones conducts a survey of dragon myths from cultures around the world and argues that certain aspects of dragons or dragon-like mythical creatures are found very widely. He claims that even the Inuit have a reptilian dragon-like monster, even though (living in a frigid environment unsuited for cold-blooded animals) they had never seen an actual reptile.\n\nJones then argues against the common hypothesis that dragon myths might be motivated by primitive discoveries of dinosaur fossils (he argues that there are widespread traits of dragons in folklore which are not observable from fossils), and claims that the common traits of dragons seem to be an amalgam of the principal predators of our ancestral hominids, which he names as the raptors, great cats (especially leopards) and pythons.\n\nThe hypothesis to which Jones conforms is that over millions of years of evolution, members of a species will evolve an instinctive fear of their predators, and he proposes ways in which these fearful images may be merged in artistic or cultural expression to create the dragon image and, perhaps, other kinds of hybrid monster.\n\nFinally he suggests sociological reasons for why such images may be perceived differently at different stages of a culture to try to explain why Chinese dragons are considered basically good and representative of government, but the great majority (although not all) European dragons are evil and often represent chaos.\n\nJones' theory was opposed in an article by Paul Jordan-Smith in the Spring 2002 issue of \"Western Folklore\" and by other authors. Jordan-Smith criticized the lack of evidence given to prove why dragon myths could not have been passed from culture to culture. He also notes that it cannot be demonstrated that the fears of ancestral hominids are coded into the human brain. He concludes his review by writing \"One is tempted to say, as Dorothy Parker once did, that this is a book not to be tossed aside lightly but thrown violently. But no, it is not worth spending even that much energy on.\"\n\nD. Ogden writes that Jones' ideas \"might offer pause for thought given the universality of dragon-slaying narratives\". He adds, though, that the compound cat, snake, raptor creature imagined by Jones is mostly the Western stereotype based on mediaeval imagery, and that Jones has sought out similar images in a way that lacks rigor. In particular, Ogden notes that the dragons of Graeco-Roman myth do not fit with Jones's prototype, typically lacking one or more of the hybrid components (with the exception of Typhon, who, however, combines many more animals than Jones's three).\n"}

The work is sometimes known as Mageoghagan’s Book, after its translator Conall the Historian.\n\nThe Irish chronicle was translated into English, in the style of the Elizabethan period, in 1627 by Conall Mag Eochagáin, of Lismoyny (Co. Westmeath), near Clara, Co. Offaly. Mag Eochagáin dedicated this translation to his brother-in-law, Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochláin, whose family was among the last to uphold and practice native Irish Gaelic customs.\n\nThe translation was completed on April 20, 1627 in the Castle of Lemanaghan in County Offaly. The original manuscript of Mag Eochagáin's translation is lost, but there are several copies of it in both the Library of Trinity College and in the British Museum.\n\nThe original work was in Irish Gaelic. Mag Eochagáin more than once refers \"to the ould Irish book out of which he wrote, to the old Irish book which he translates, out of which many leaves were lost or stolen..\" Mag Eochagáin seems to have preserved the value of the original Gaelic phraseology and rendered it every justice as far as we can determine in the absence of the original manuscript.\n\nThe original manuscript or manuscripts of the Irish annals are lost, and the names of its compilers are unknown. These annals have usually gone by the name of the Annals of Clonmacnoise, because the work was thought to be based on materials gathered at the monastery of Clonmacnoise, though there is some doubt about this. In the book itself there is nothing to show why it should be called by this name. However, the Annals do give special prominence to the history of the parts of the country on both sides of the River Shannon at Clonmacnoise and to the families inhabiting the areas of Uí Maine (Hy Many) surrounding them, namely O'Kellys, O'Rourkes, O'Molloys, O'Connors and McDermotts. In addition, the text bears close similarities to the so-called Clonmacnoise-group of annalistic texts. The principal value of these Annals arises from the historical details given of these districts and families which are not found to the same extent elsewhere.\n\nThe Annals give the history of Ireland and the areas surrounding Clonmacnoise from the creation of man to the year 1408. Mag Eochagáin points out that several parts of the original work are missing as from 1182 to 1199 and again from 1290 to 1299. He states that the originals were destroyed not merely by the books being burnt by marauding Vikings but also by tailors cutting the leaves of the books and slicing them off in long pieces to make their measures.\n\nThe translation of the Annals was first published in Dublin in 1896 and again reprinted by Llanerch Publishers in 1993. Scholars have repeatedly called for a new edition as Murphy’s edition has been deemed inadequate for modern scholarly purposes. Such scholars include Prof David Dumville who has bemoaned the ‘poor textual condition of the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the lack of adequate modern criticism of that text’. Dr Nollaig O Muraile has also expressed a wish that someone will undertake one of ‘those great desiderata in this particular field - namely new, up-to-date editions of the Annals of Tigernach, of Mageoghegan's Book’ (i.e. the Annals of Clonmacnoise).\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to ICANN Bylaw XI.4.a, \"ALAC is the primary organizational home within ICANN for individual Internet users\", with a mandate to \"consider and provide advice on the activities of ICANN, insofar as they relate to the interests of individual Internet users\".\n\nThe ALAC is composed by fifteen members, three from each of the five geographic regions used by ICANN for geographical diversity requirements.\n\nAs a part of its mission, the ALAC reaches out for groups of individual Internet users all around the world - identified as \"At-Large Structures\" (ALSes) - and encourages them to apply for accreditation by ICANN. Once accredited, these groups can participate in the five \"Regional At-Large Organizations\" (RALOs), regional groupings that host discussions at a regional level. In turn, each RALO appoints two members of the ALAC (for a total of ten members out of fifteen). This builds an open, bottom-up mechanism to select the ALAC members. The remaining five members of the ALAC are appointed by ICANN's Nominating Committee.\n\nThe ALAC appoints one non-voting representative to the councils of the Generic Names Supporting Organization and to the Country Code Names Supporting Organization, and liaisons to ICANN working groups and task forces. It also appoints five members (one per geographic region) of ICANN's Nominating Committee. It has some statutory authority, though limited, to influence ICANN's policy making activities. However, it usually shares its opinions through non-binding advisory statements sent to the ICANN Board.\n\nOriginally the ALAC appointed a liaison to the ICANN Board; however, that position was abolished in 2010 when an additional, fully voting position on the ICANN Board was designated to be selected by the At-Large community. The first person selected by this process, joining the ICANN Board in October 2012, was former ALAC member Sébastien Bachollet\n\nThe ALAC was created in 2002, as one of the changes introduced in the so-called \"ICANN 2.0\" reform, with the purpose of providing a viable mechanism for participation by a significant number of active individual users of the Internet from around the world. Its structure was studied through the \"At-Large Advisory Committee Assistance Group\", which made a proposal that was then approved by the ICANN Board.\n\nThe first ALAC was appointed in January 2003. Since the Regional At-Large Organizations did not exist yet, the committee was marked as \"interim\" and the ten regional members were appointed by the ICANN Board instead. The initial membership included the former ICANN Chairman Esther Dyson. The initial Chairman was Vittorio Bertola, and the first appointed liaison to the ICANN Board was Roberto Gaetano, and Thomas Roessler to the GNSO, who in December 2004 left his position to Bret Fausett. In March 2006, Bertola left the Chairmanship to Annette Muehlberg; in December 2006, Bertola was appointed as the new Board liaison, Alan Greenberg as GNSO liaison, and Siavash Shahshahani as CCNSO liaison.\n\nInitially, there was widespread concern that the ALAC would fail as a result of a perception of disenfranchisement common to many Internet rights groups - especially the North American ones - that followed the demise by ICANN of the original At Large election plan. However, the number of accredited At Large Structures grew slowly but steadily, reaching 100 in the first months of 2007. In December 2006, the first Regional At-Large Organization - the Latin American RALO was formally accredited by ICANN. Further RALOs for Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific were expected to be accredited in the first half of 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The colossal order is rare in French architecture before Bullant; his characteristic use of it might be its first appearance in France here, on the pavilion on the court side. \n\nAnne de Montmorency was a major patron of the arts in France, and a protector of artists: his chapel was decorated with sculptures by Jean Goujon, and Jean Bullant, Barthélemy Prieur, Bernard Palissy. Some of the Androuet du Cerceau family found protection and work at Écouen. Unhappily, no building accounts survive, so the precise sequence of the construction cannot be closely followed; panels of grisaille stained glass in the gallery of the west wing are dated 1542 and 1544, and the east wing was paved in 1549-50. The building was frescoed and furnished during the 1550s, in the style of the School of Fontainebleau.\n\nÉcouen was illustrated in engravings in Jacques Androuet du Cerceau's \"Les Plus excellents bastiments de France\", 1576.\n\nIn 1787 the east (entrance) wing was demolished by the owner, the Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé. When he emigrated at the Revolution, Château of Écouen fell to the State, as a \"national property\" (\"bien national\").\n\nFollowing an idea of André Malraux the castle was thoroughly renovated by architects of the \"Monuments Historiques\", after having served as a school for daughters of chevaliers of the Légion d'Honneur, from 1807 to 1962, in order to house the \"Musée national de la Renaissance\", comprising the Renaissance objects of the collections of the Musée de Cluny, in sympathetic surroundings. A series of small, highly focussed exhibitions have been staged at Écouen over the years since the museum fully opened in 1982.\n\n"}
{"id": "1669955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1669955", "title": "Classic of Mountains and Seas", "text": "Classic of Mountains and Seas\n\nThe Classic of Mountains and Seas or Shan Hai Jing, formerly romanized as the Shan-hai Ching, is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and myth. Versions of the text may have existed since as early as the 4th century BC, but the present form was not reached until the early Han dynasty a few centuries later. It is largely a fabulous geographical and cultural account of pre-Qin China as well as a collection of Chinese mythology. The book is divided into eighteen sections; it describes over 550 mountains and 300 channels.\n\nThe exact author(s) of the book and the time it was written are still undetermined. It was originally thought that mythical figures such as Yu the Great or Boyi wrote the book. However, the consensus among modern Sinologists is that the book was not written at a single time by a single author, but rather by numerous people from the period of the Warring States to the beginning of the Han dynasty.\n\nThe first known editor of the \"Classic\" was Liu Xiang from the Western Han, who among other things cataloged the Han imperial library. Later, Guo Pu, a scholar from the Western Jin, further annotated the work.\n\nThe book is not a narrative, as the \"plot\" involves detailed descriptions of locations in the cardinal directions of the \"Mountains\", \"Regions Beyond Seas\", \"Regions Within Seas\", and \"Wilderness\". The descriptions are usually of medicines, animals, and geological features. Many descriptions are very mundane, and an equal number are fanciful or strange. Each chapter follows roughly the same formula, and the whole book is repetitious in this way.\n\nIt contains many short myths, and most rarely exceed a paragraph. A famous ancient Chinese myth from this book is that of Yu the Great, who spent years trying to control the deluge. The account of him is in the last chapter, chapter 18, in the 2nd to last paragraph (roughly verse 40). This account is a much more fanciful account than the depiction of him in the \"Classic of History\".\n\n‘Shan Hai Jing’ is a book full of magical works. It has various kinds of contents. It has a rich knowledge of geography, mythology, folklore, history of science, religion, ethnology, medicine and other valuable information. Its academic value involves so many scientific areas. It largely and orderly records the features of natural geography and the content of human geographies, such as mountains, hydrology, animal, plant, mineral, national geography, economy, social culture. A lot of information can be explored if the reader searches deeply and carefully.\n\nSome scholars believe that: \"Shan Hai Jing\" is China's first geography. \"Shan Hai Jing\" is not a purely geographical book, however, the geographical knowledge is in the top position. It orderly describes the geographical features by location, including nature geography and culture geography. First, \"Shan Hai Jing\" has a natural geographical description. This includes the record of many mountains, such as \"the mountain of the court\", \"mountain of niuyang\", \"blue hill mountain\", \"Kei tail mountain\" and so on, and each mountain is named according to the mountain landscape, these mountains also reflect the direction of the mountain; as well as an extremely rich hydrological record and rivers are mostly marked with the source. The beginning of the river can be in some foothills, and its injection is far away from this mountain. The narrator also noticed the full picture of the river streams. Despite the river routes were not recorded, but their approximate flow through region can be known through the route of tributaries to the mainstream such as Huanghe and Weishui. Secondly, it also recorded the human geography. For example, in the \"sea\" section, it records lots of regional social and cultural customs, economic development, scientific and technological achievements at that moment.\n\nAs a mythological literature, ‘Shan Hai Jing’ at least has three valuable facts:\n\n1. Different kinds of records of seven categories of ancient Chinese mythology.\n\n2. Left a reliable text in the relationship between the physical world and mythical world.\n\n3. The preservation of a vast number of primitive items with primitive cultural information, it contains the potential mythological value. \n\nIt is inappropriate to classify Chinese mythology based on the principle of western mythology classification which is based on the presentation of human consciousness and spiritual growth process. It should classify based on the main contents, basic spirit, inner structure and important features which formed by above. ‘Shan Hai Jing’ does not have too many records about the mythology that is looking for the origins of content (the origins of world, tribes, and cultures), but it has many records of heroic mythology and tribal warfare and it reflects the basic feature of Chinese historical culture and the value orientation of cultural spirit.\n\n‘Shan Hai Jing’ has rich and varied literary value and it can be explored from many aspects. Reader can discover, understand and interpret the literary value from the perspective of the influence of the traditional romantic creation literature, the expression of the original logic, the rich emotional experience in the humanistic care and the judgment of the pragmatism and all these can be understood by mythical thinking (ie, the original thinking). ‘Shan Hai Jing’ has a rich of mythology thinking, it has a huge and far-reaching impact in the tradition of the romantic literary. In-depth study of mythological thinking and reveal this impact is not only good for discovering the reasons for the creation of romantic literary, but it also helps clarify the development of various literary phenomena. \n\nThere are at least three facts can explain how mythical thinking impacts the tradition of romantic literature:\n\n1. The impact of the rich intuitive imagination on the creation of romantic literature.\n\n2. The mythologies which contain abundant mythological thinking are always the creative material of romantic literature.\n\n3. The primitive concept of the life of mythical thinking profoundly impacts on the creation of romantic literary.\n\nLots of myths and legend in \"Shan Hai Jing\" are extremely rare materials for current religious studies. From these myths, not only present the activities of the wizard, but also the ancient nation's faith, worship and so on. There are a lot of magical animals recorded, these animals are mainly birds, animals, dragons, and snakes. They usually have some magical powers. These animals are probably the ancients' totem worship. According to \"Classic of Regions Beyond the Seas: West\", \"Wuxian nation is north to Nvchou, the right-hand holds the green snake, and the red on the left\". Snake may be the totem of Wuxian country. \"Shan Hai Jing\" is the critical material for ancient Chinese religious study.\n\nEarlier Chinese scholars referred to it as a bestiary, but apparently assumed it was accurate. In fact the information in the book is mythological. It is not known why it was written or how it came to be viewed as an accurate geography book.\n\nThe \"Classic of Mountains and Rivers\" has 18 chapters (巻). Chapter 4 has 12 subsections (次一), 2 and 4 have four, and chapters 1 and 3 have three.\nAll 18 chapters can be classified into 4 categories: Classic of the Mountains (contents 5 chapters), Classic of the Seas (contents 8 chapters), Classic of the Great Wilderness (contents 4 chapters), and Classic of Regions Within the Seas (contents 1 chapter). It recorded more than 100 diplomatically related realms, 550 mountains and 300 rivers, along with the geographic and cultural information of the nearby realms. The Classic of Mountains and Seas also recorded up to 277 different animals. Scholars believe the records of animals in Classic of the Mountains are somewhat exaggerated due to the long history of people compiling them in different dynasties; yet they still have a certain degree of authority, because they were generally written by sorcerers and Fangshi based on the experiences they gained from their trips.\n\nThe ancient Chinese treated the \"Classic\" as a record of geography. The \"Classic\" was classified under the category of geography in both Book of Sui and Comprehensive Examination of Literature of Duanlin Ma. It was also an important reference material of Chinese historians through the long history of China.\n\nThe \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" is also the source and origin of the ancient Chinese mythology. Some of them are popular and well known in Asian culture, such as Kua Fu, Nüwa, Houyi and Yellow Emperor. There were up to 450 gods and deities mentioned in Classic and they used something called Jingmi (精米) or Jing (糈) which is similar to sorcery.\n\nChinese scholar Ming Hua Zhang claimed that the Zhulong, which was a mythical creature mentioned in Classic of the Great Wilderness: North, is symbolizing the aurora (northern light). The Zhulong is (according to Classic) \"red, with a human face and a snake body that is thousand mile long. It is the god of Zhong Mountain.\" He believes that this description matches with the characteristics of aurora.\n\n\n\n"}

Cole during the presidency of Barack Obama. The memorandum, sent to all United States Attorneys, governed federal prosecution of offenses related to marijuana. The memo stated that given its limited resources, the Justice Department would not enforce federal marijuana prohibition in states that \"legalized marijuana in some form and ... implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana,\" except where a lack of federal enforcement would undermine federal priorities (such as preventing violence in marijuana cultivation and distribution, preventing cannabis impaired driving, and preventing marijuana revenues from going to gangs and cartels).\n\nThe Cole Memorandum was rescinded by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January 2018, during the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nOn August 29, 2013, the Department of Justice published a memorandum authored by Cole which described a new set of priorities for federal prosecutors operating in states which had legalized the medical or other recreational use of marijuana. The \"Cole memo\" followed a 2009 memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden directing U.S. Attorneys in the Western United States to \"not focus federal resources in your States on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana\". The 2013 memorandum represented a significant shift of government priorities away from strict enforcement of federal cannabis prohibition and toward a more hands-off approach in the case of \"jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of marijuana.\" Indeed, Cole's memo went so far as to state that \"a robust system may affirmatively address [federal] priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of marijuana outside the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to marijuana by minors, and replacing an illicit marijuana trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for.\" Since that date, although federal prosecutions have continued in some legalizing states (notably in the Kettle Falls Five case), the overall number of federal marijuana prosecutions in such states has declined.\n\nStates with legalized cannabis were concerned about the incoming Trump administration's handling of the Cole Memo and their congressional representatives and governors saw Attorney General Jeff Sessions as adamantly opposed to its continuation. Anti-legalization groups like Smart Approaches to Marijuana requested a review or revocation of the memorandum. The federal government's position was vague, with the Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein saying in mid-June \"maybe there will be changes to it [the Cole Memorandum] in the future, but we're still operating under that policy\".\n\nAround June 2017, a Justice Department task force was convened to review the Cole Memo and other Obama-era decisions; it was headed by Michael Murray, Counsel to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. The committee's report was finalized June 27, 2017 and released to the public in August when it was found to have \"no new policy recommendations\", and recommended that the Trump Administration Attorney General \"should evaluate whether to maintain, revise or rescind\" the memo.\n\nThe memorandum was rescinded by a one-page memo signed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on January 4, 2018. Governors and United States Senators from several states including Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington immediately expressed displeasure at the decision.\n\nLegal and political experts expressed varied reactions to Sessions' 2018 memo. Some said that it would not fundamentally change the existing system, with power to prosecute remaining in the hands of various U.S. Attorneys. Law professor and author Ilya Somin called the decision an \"assault on federalism\". Political columnist Jacob Sullum said it could be seen as justified reaction to the Obama Administration's use of executive actions.\n\n\n\n"}

It is compiled from existing databases and from contributions by experts and non-experts throughout the world. It aims to build one \"infinitely expandable\" page for each species, including video, sound, images, graphics, as well as text. In addition, the Encyclopedia incorporates content from the Biodiversity Heritage Library, which digitizes millions of pages of printed literature from the world's major natural history libraries. The project was initially backed by a US$50 million funding commitment, led by the MacArthur Foundation and the Sloan Foundation, who provided US$20 million and US$5 million, respectively. The additional US$25 million came from five cornerstone institutions—the Field Museum, Harvard University, the Marine Biological Laboratory, the Missouri Botanical Garden, and the Smithsonian Institution. The project was initially led by Jim Edwards and the development team by David Patterson. Today, participating institutions and individual donors continue to support EOL through financial contributions.\n\nEOL went live on 26 February 2008 with 30,000 entries. The site immediately proved to be extremely popular, and temporarily had to revert to demonstration pages for two days when over 11 million views of it were requested.\n\nThe site relaunched on 5 September 2011 with a redesigned interface and tools. The new version – referred to as EOLv2 – was developed in response to requests from the general public, citizen scientists, educators and professional biologists for a site that was more engaging, accessible and personal. EOLv2 is redesigned to enhance usability and encourage contributions and interactions among users. It is also internationalized with interfaces provided for English, German, Spanish, French, Galician, Serbian, Macedonian, Arabic, Chinese, Korean and Ukrainian language speakers.

As the discovery of new species is expected to continue (currently at about 20,000 per year), the encyclopedia will continue to grow. As taxonomy finds new ways to include species discovered by molecular techniques, the rate of new additions will increase, particularly in respect to the microbial work of (eu)bacteria, archaebacteria and viruses.\n\nEOL's goal is to serve as a resource for the general public, enthusiastic amateurs, educators, students and professional scientists from around the world.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Life has content partners around the world who share information through the EOL platform, including Wikipedia and Flickr.\n\nIts interface is translated at translatewiki.net.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17263851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17263851", "title": "Ergenekon (allegation)", "text": "Ergenekon (allegation)\n\nErgenekon () was the name given to an alleged clandestine, secularist ultra-nationalist organization in Turkey with possible ties to members of the country's military and security forces. The would-be group, named after Ergenekon, a mythical place located in the inaccessible valleys of the Altay Mountains, was accused of terrorism in Turkey.\n\nErgenekon was by some believed to be part of the \"deep state\". The existence of the \"deep state\" was affirmed in Turkish opinion after the Susurluk scandal in 1996. Alleged members had been indicted on charges of plotting to foment unrest, among other things by assassinating intellectuals, politicians, judges, military staff, and religious leaders, with the ultimate goal of toppling the incumbent government.\n\nErgenekon's \"modus operandi\" had been compared to Operation Gladio's Turkish branch, the Counter-Guerrilla.\nBy April 2011, over 500 people had been taken into custody and nearly 300 formally charged with membership of what prosecutors described as \"the Ergenekon terrorist organization\", which they claimed had been responsible for virtually every act of political violence—and controlled every militant group—in Turkey over the last 30 years.\n\nAs of 2015 most of the people accused of such crimes has been acquitted, forensic experts concluded the documents for supposed plots were fake and some of the executors of trials proved to be linked to the Gülen Movement and were charged with plotting against Turkish Army.\n\nAn organization named \"Ergenekon\" has been talked about since the Susurluk scandal, which exposed a similar gang. However, it is said that Ergenekon has undergone serious changes since then. The first person to publicly talk about the organization was retired naval officer Erol Mütercimler, who spoke of such an organization in 1997. Mütercimler said he heard of the original organization's existence from retired general Memduh Ünlütürk, who was involved in the anti-communist Ziverbey interrogations following the 1971 coup. Major general Ünlütürk told Mütercimler that Ergenekon was founded with the support of the CIA and the Pentagon. Mütercimler was detained during the Ergenekon investigation for questioning before being released.\n\nMütercimler and others, however, draw a distinction between the Ergenekon of today and the original one, which they equate with the Counter-Guerrilla; Operation Gladio's Turkish branch. Today's Ergenekon is said to be a \"splinter\" off the old one. The person whose testimony contributed most to the indictment, Tuncay Güney, described Ergenekon as a junta related to the Turkish Resistance Organization (, TMT) operating in North Cyprus; the TMT was established by founding members of the Counter-Guerrilla. Former North Cyprus President Rauf Denktaş denied any connection of the TMT to Ergenekon.\n\nAnother position is that while some of the suspects may be guilty of something, there is no organization to which they are all party, and that the only thing they have in common is opposition to the AKP. There is evidence to suggest that some – but only some – of the defendants named in the indictments have been engaged in illegal activity and that others – again far from all – hold eccentric or distasteful political opinions and worldviews. There are also allegations that Ergenekon's agenda is in line with the policies of the National Security Council, elaborated in the top-secret \"Red Book\" (the National Security Policy Document).\n\nBased on documents prepared by one of the prosecutors, an article in Sabah says that the alleged organization consists of six cells with the following personnel:\n\nOf those, the structure of only the \"Theory\" department had been revealed as of September 2008.\n\nSome have called Veli Küçük the leader in the organization. Şamil Tayyar of the \"Star\" daily says that Küçük is not \"even among the top ten\". Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MİT) reportedly informed the prosecutor about the identity of the \"number one\" in the organization, but this will not be made public.\n\nIn most cases the name is shown as having derived from the Ergenekon myth; a place in Eurasia of mythological significance, esp. among nationalists (see Agartha). The legend was vigorously promulgated during the early years of the Turkish Republic as Atatürk sought to create a nation state in which national consciousness rather than religion served as the primary determinant of identity. With the growing number of detentions and subsequent court cases (see: Ergenekon (trials)) not many people still really understand what is happening. (also see chapter: Debate on Ergenekon)\n\nAlthough the investigation was officially launched in 2007, the existence of the organization was known beforehand. The files on Ergenekon were said to be discovered after a spy called Tuncay Güney was detained in March 2001 for petty fraud. Some say the crime was a ploy to set the investigation in motion. A police search of his house turned up the six sacks of evidence on which the indictment is based.\n\nOne month later, a columnist on good terms with the government, Fehmi Koru, was the first to break the news, under his usual pen name, Taha Kıvanç. His article was based on a key Ergenekon report dated 29 October 1999, and titled .\n\nThe person whose statements to the police in 2001 formed \"the backbone of the indictment\" was a spy named Tuncay Güney, alias \"İpek\". Güney is believed to be subordinate to Mehmet Eymür, formerly of the National Intelligence Organization (MİT)'s Counterterrorism Department. Eymür was discharged and his department disbanded in 1997. Güney's relationship to the MİT has been a matter of confusion; his boss was once a MİT employee, while the MİT says Güney was not (specifically, he was not a \"registered informant\") and that the MİT considered him a suspicious person.\n\nHe had allegedly been tasked with infiltrating the gendarmerie's intelligence agency (JITEM) and Ergenekon in 1992. Güney was apprehended in 2001 for issuing fake licenses and plates for luxury cars. He is still sentenced \"in absentia\" for this offense. No charges have been brought against him in the frame of the Ergenekon investigation, some say as a result of a bargain struck with the authorities. However, he is currently under investigation, and State Prosecutor Ziya Hurşit Karayurt has proposed that he be subpoenaed. The court is deliberating whether to consolidate his earlier case with the Ergenekon one. In addition, legal proceedings have been initiated to obtain his testimony from abroad using Interpol. Prosecutor Öz has prepared a list of 37 questions for Güney, who says he will cooperate if the questioning is done by the Canadian police.\n\nGüney has been said to conflate fact and fiction, casting doubt over the indictment, which names him a \"fugitive suspect\" (). Güney is seen as such an important figure that rival press groups have exchanged columns accusing one another of attempting to influence public opinion by questioning his credibility. It is alleged that one the parties, Aydın Doğan, was asked not to publish material about Ergenekon, by Veli Küçük through Doğu Perinçek. In December 2008, Güney said that a \"Hürriyet\" reporter offered him a bribe not to talk about the newspaper, one of whose senior members is allegedly in Ergenekon. \"Hürriyet\" denied the allegations.\n\nThe first hearing was held on 20 October 2008. Retired public prosecutor Mete Göktürk estimated that they would last at least one year. Most of the cases related to Ergenekon are handled by Istanbul Heavy Penal Court 12 and 13 (formerly Istanbul State Security Court 4 and 5). The original three prosecutors were Zekeriya Öz (prosecutor-in-chief), Mehmet Ali Pekgüzel and Nihat Taşkın. The judge was Köksal Şengün. Most trials are held at a prison complex in Istanbul's Silivri neighborhood. At the beginning the courtroom could accommodate about 280 people.\n\nThe investigation drew alleged links between an armed attack on the Turkish Council of State in 2006 that left a judge dead, a bombing of a secularist newspaper, threats and attacks against people accused of being unpatriotic and the 1996 Susurluk incident, as well as links to the plans of some groups in the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) to overthrow the present government. According to the investigation, Ergenekon had a role in the murder of Hrant Dink, a prominent journalist of Armenian descent Italian priest Father Andrea Santoro in February 2006 and the brutal murders of three Christians, one a German national, killed in the province of Malatya in April 2007. Furthermore, files about JİTEM related the assassination of former JİTEM commander Cem Ersever, killed in November 1993, to Ergenekon. A former JİTEM member, Abdülkadir Aygan, said that JİTEM is the military wing of Ergenekon.\n\nThe indictment also suggests questionable connections between Ergenekon and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), raising some suspicions that Ergenekon might have played a role in inciting ethnic hatred between Turks and Kurds and increasing sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Alevis. The Gülen movement-affiliated \"Zaman\" newspaper quoted a senior intelligence officer, Bülent Orakoğlu, as having said that the PKK, Dev Sol, Hezbollah, and Hizb ut-Tahrir are artificial organizations set up by the network, and that Abdullah Öcalan himself was an Ergenekon member. However, \"Zaman\"'s claims have been disputed, and the role of the broader Gülen movement in the trials has come under scrutiny.\nÖcalan dismissed allegations made by intelligence officer Bülent Orakoğlu concerning himself, but he did say that a group inside the PKK, which he called the Zaza Group, had links with Ergenekon. He said that this group was led by Sait Çürükkaya and tried to seize control of the PKK, adding \"Particularly in the Diyarbakır-Muş-Bingöl triangle, they have staged intensive and bloody attacks\". The brother of Sait Çürükkaya, Selim Çürükkaya had earlier written a book \"When secrets get decoded\" (tr: \"Sırlar Çözülürken\") accusing Abdullah Öcalan of being a member of Ergenekon.\n\nResponding to allegations in \"Taraf\", DHKP/C issued a press release ridiculing claims of its connection to Ergenekon.\n\nBy May 2009, 142 people had been formally charged with membership of the \"Ergenekon armed terrorist organization\" in two massive indictments totalling 2,455 and 1,909 pages respectively. Further trials followed and in March 2011 the state-owned Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) presented the following figures:\n\nIn August 2008, 300 intellectuals from Turkey declared their support for the investigation and called upon all civil and military institutions to deepen the investigation in order to reveal the rest of the people tied to Ergenekon. This initial wave of optimism has since waned, and there is a growing mass of intellectuals and policy analysts who dismiss the possibility of Ergenekon carrying out the deeds attributed to it by the public prosecution as laid out in the indictment and trial proceedings. Many people have criticized the manner in which the Ergenekon investigation is being conducted, citing in particular the length of the indictment, wiretapping in breach of privacy laws, and illegal collection of evidence.\n\nSome commentators have suggested the trials are being used to suppress opponents and critics of the AKP government, particularly in the Odatv case. Commenting on the arrest of former chief of staff İlker Başbuğ in January 2012, former United States Ambassador to Turkey Eric S. Edelman said the Ergenekon arrests \"underscore the serious questions about Turkey's continued commitment to press freedom and the rule of law\".\n\nGülen movement's possible involvement in Ergenekon plot has always been a debate of issue, which critics have characterized as \"a pretext\" by the government \"to neutralize dissidents\" in Turkey. In March 2011, seven Turkish journalists were arrested, including Ahmet Şık, who had been writing a book, \"Imamin Ordusu\" (\"The Imam's Army\"), which alleges that the Gülen movement has infiltrated the country's security forces. As Şık was taken into police custody, he shouted, \"Whoever touches it [the movement] gets burned!\". Upon his arrest, drafts of the book were confiscated and its possession was banned. Şık has also been charged with being part of the alleged Ergenekon plot, despite being an investigator of the plot before his arrest.\n\nIn a reply, Abdullah Bozkurt, from the Gülen movement newspaper \"Today's Zaman\", accused Ahmet Şık of not being \"an investigative journalist\" conducting \"independent research,\" but of hatching \"a plot designed and put into action by the terrorist network itself.\"\n\nAccording to Gareth H. Jenkins, a Senior Fellow of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Joint Center at Johns Hopkins University: \nFrom the outset, the pro-AKP media, particularly the newspapers and television channels run by the Gülen Movement such as \"Zaman\", \"Today's Zaman\" and Samanyolu TV, have vigorously supported the Ergenekon investigation. This has included the illegal publication of \"evidence\" collected by the investigators before it has been presented in court, misrepresentations and distortions of the content of the indictments and smear campaigns against both the accused and anyone who questions the conduct of the investigations.\nThere have long been allegations that not only the media coverage but also the Ergenekon investigation itself is being run by Gülen's supporters. In August 2010, Hanefi Avcı, a right-wing police chief who had once been sympathetic to the Gülen Movement, published a book in which he alleged that a network of Gülen's supporters in the police were manipulating judicial processes and fixing internal appointments and promotions. On September 28, 2010, two days before he was due to give a press conference to present documentary evidence to support his allegations, Avcı was arrested and charged with membership of an extremist leftist organization. He remains in jail. On March 14, 2011, Avcı was also formally charged with being a member of the alleged Ergenekon gang.\n\nThe Gülen movement has also been implicated in what both Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well as the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) have said were illegal court decisions against members of the Turkish military, including many during the Ergenekon investigation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72308", "title": "Grendel", "text": "Grendel\n\nGrendel is a character in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem \"Beowulf\" (AD 700–1000). He is one of the poem's three antagonists (along with Grendel's mother and the dragon), all aligned in opposition against the protagonist Beowulf. Grendel is feared by all but Beowulf. Grendel is described as descended from the lineage of the Biblical figure Cain, from Genesis 4 of the Bible. He is usually depicted as a monster or a giant, although his status as a monster, giant, or other form of supernatural being is not clearly described in the poem and thus remains the subject of scholarly debate. \n\nIn John Gardner's book \"Grendel\" (1971), Grendel has more human qualities and the book is narrated from his perspective.\n\nGrendel is originally found in the poem \"Beowulf,\" which is contained in the \"Nowell Codex\". Grendel, being cursed as the descendant of the Biblical Cain, is \"harrowed\" by the sounds of singing that come every night from the mead-hall of Heorot built by King Hrothgar, describing the \"Almighty's\" creation of the earth. He is unable to bear it anymore and attacks Heorot. Grendel continues to attack the Hall every night for twelve years, killing its inhabitants and making this magnificent mead-hall unusable. Beowulf hears of these attacks and leaves the Geats to destroy Grendel. He is welcomed by King Hrothgar, who gives a banquet in celebration. Afterwards Beowulf and his warriors bed down in the mead hall to await the inevitable attack of the creature. Grendel stalks outside the building for a time, spying the warriors inside. He then makes a sudden attack, bursting the door with his fists and continuing through the entry. The first warrior Grendel finds is still asleep, so he seizes the man and devours him. Grendel grabs a second warrior, but is shocked when the warrior grabs back with fearsome strength. As Grendel attempts to disengage, the reader discovers that Beowulf is that second warrior. He has chosen not to use a weapon because he heard Grendel fights without one; this choice is what wins him the battle, because Grendel has a charm that protects him from every weapon. A battle ensues, with Beowulf's warriors attempting to aid in the melee. Finally Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, mortally wounding the creature. Grendel flees but dies in his marsh-den. There, Beowulf later engages in a fierce battle with Grendel's mother, over whom he triumphs. Following her death, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse and removes his head, which he keeps as a trophy. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the \"ninth hour\" (l. 1600, \"nōn\", about 3 pm). He returns to Heorot, where a grateful Hrothgar showers him with gifts.\n\nIn 1936, J.R.R. Tolkien's \"\" discussed Grendel and the dragon in \"Beowulf\". Tolkien argues that \"the evil spirits took visible shape\" in Grendel and the dragon; however, the author's concern is focused on Beowulf. He points out that while Grendel has Christian origins as the descendant of Cain, he \"cannot be dissociated from the creatures of northern myth.\" He also argues for the importance of Grendel's role in the poem as an \"eminently suitable beginning\" that sets the stage for Beowulf's fight with the dragon: \"Triumph over the lesser and more nearly human is cancelled by defeat before the older and more elemental.\" This essay was the first work of scholarship in which Anglo-Saxon literature was seriously examined for its literary merits – not just scholarship about the origins of the English language, or what historical information could be gleaned from the text, as was popular in the 19th century. Tolkien wrote his own translation of Beowulf entitled, between 1920 and 1926.\n\nDuring the following decades, the exact description of Grendel became a source of debate for scholars. Indeed, because his exact appearance is never directly described in Old English by the original \"Beowulf\" poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely his descent from the biblical Cain (who was the first murderer in the Bible). Grendel is referred to as a \"sceadugenga\" – \"shadow walker\", \"night goer\" – given that the monster was repeatedly described to be in the shroud of darkness.\n\nSome scholars have linked Grendel's descent from Cain to the monsters and giants of \"the Cain tradition\".\n\nSeamus Heaney, in his translation of \"Beowulf\", writes in lines 1351–1355 that Grendel is vaguely human in shape, though much larger:\n\nHeaney's translation of lines 1637–1639 also notes that Grendel's disembodied head is so large that it takes four men to transport it. Furthermore, in lines 983–989, when Grendel's torn arm is inspected, Heaney describes it as being covered in impenetrable scales and horny growths:\n\nAlfred Bammesgerber looks closely at line 1266 where Grendel's ancestry is said to be the \"misbegotten spirits\" that sprang from Cain after he was cursed. He argues that the words in Old English, \"geosceaftgasta,\" should be translated \"the great former creation of spirits.\" \n\nPeter Dickinson (1979) argued that seeing as the considered distinction between man and beast at the time the poem was written was simply man's bipedalism, the given description of Grendel being man-like does not necessarily imply that Grendel is meant to be humanoid, going as far as stating that Grendel could easily have been a bipedal dragon.\n\nOther scholars such as Kuhn (1979) have questioned a monstrous description, stating:\nThere are five disputed instances of āglǣca [three of which are in \"Beowulf\", lines] 649, 1269, 1512 ... In the first ... the referent can be either Beowulf or Grendel. If the poet and his audience felt the word to have two meanings – \"monster\" and \"hero\" – the ambiguity would be troublesome; but if by āglǣca they understood a \"fighter\", the ambiguity would be of little consequence, for battle was destined for both Beowulf and Grendel and both were fierce fighters (216–217).\n\nO'Keefe has suggested that Grendel resembles a Berserker, because of numerous associations that seem to point to this possibility.\n\nSonya R. Jensen argues for an identification between Grendel and Agnar, son of Ingeld, and suggests that the tale of the first two monsters is actually the tale of Ingeld, as mentioned by Alcuin in the 790s. The tale of Agnar tells how he was cut in half by the warrior Bothvarr Bjarki (\"Warlike little Bear\"), and how he died \"with his lips separated into a smile\". One major parallel between Agnar and Grendel would thus be that the monster of the poem has a name perhaps composed of a combination of the words \"gren\" and \"daelan\". The poet may be stressing to his audience that Grendel \"died laughing\", or that he was \"gren-dael[ed]\" or \"grin-divid[ed]\", after having his arm torn off at the shoulder by Beowulf, whose name means \"bee-wolf\" or \"bear\".\n\nGrendel appears in many other cultural works.\n\n"}
{"id": "1646966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1646966", "title": "Hameau de la Reine", "text": "Hameau de la Reine\n\nThe Hameau de la Reine (, \"The Queen's Hamlet\") is a rustic retreat in the park of the Château de Versailles built for Marie Antoinette in 1783 near the Petit Trianon in Yvelines, France. It served as a private meeting place for the Queen and her closest friends, a place of leisure. Designed by the Queen's favoured architect, Richard Mique with the help of the painter Hubert Robert, it contained a meadowland with lakes and streams, a classical Temple of Love on an island with fragrant shrubs and flowers, an octagonal belvedere, with a neighbouring grotto and cascade. There are also various buildings in a rustic or vernacular style, inspired by Norman or Flemish design, situated around an irregular pond fed by a stream that turned a mill wheel. The building scheme included a farmhouse, (the farm was to produce milk and eggs for the queen), a dairy, a dovecote, a boudoir, a barn that burned down during the French Revolution, a mill and a tower in the form of a lighthouse. Each building is decorated with a garden, an orchard or a flower garden. The largest and most famous of these houses is the \"Queen's House\", connected to the Billiard house by a wooden gallery, at the center of the village. A working farm was close to the idyllic, fantasy-like setting of the Queen’s Hamlet.\n\nThe \"hameau\" is the best-known of a series of rustic garden constructions built at the time, notably the Prince of Condé's Hameau de Chantilly (1774–1775) which was the inspiration for the Versailles hamlet. Such model farms, operating under principles espoused by the Physiocrats, were fashionable among the French aristocracy at the time. One primary purpose of the \"hameau\" was to add to the ambiance of the \"Petit Trianon\", giving the illusion that it was deep in the countryside rather than within the confines of Versailles. The rooms at the \"hameau\" allowed for more intimacy than the grand salons at Versailles or at the \"Petit Trianon\".\n\nAbandoned after the French Revolution, it was renovated in the late 1990s and is open to the public.\n\nInspired by a wave of naturalism in art, architecture, and garden design, the Hameau de la Reine was constructed between 1782 and 1783. The garden surroundings of the Petit Trianon, of which the \"hameau de la Reine\" is an extension, began their transformation from formal pattern gardens. Under Louis XV it had been an arboretum and the new arrangements eliminated this famous botanical garden, replacing it with a more informal \"natural\" garden of winding paths, curving canals and lakes under the direction of Antoine Richard, gardener to the Queen. Richard Mique modified the landscape design to provide vistas of lawn to west and north of the Petit Trianon, encircled by belts of trees. Beyond the lake to the north, the \"hameau\" was sited like a garden stage set, initially inspired in its grouping and vernacular building by Dutch and Flemish genre paintings, philosophically influenced by Rousseau's cult of \"nature\", and reflecting exactly contemporary picturesque garden principles set forth by Claude-Henri Watelet and by ideas of the \"philosophes\", their \"radical notions co-opted into innocent forms of pleasure and ingenious decoration\" as William Adams has pointed out. Artists played a more direct role in French picturesque than they probably had done in England, as can be seen by Hubert Robert's involvement.\n\nThe stylistic design of the Hameau de la Reine was influenced by the hameau de Chantilly, a similarly rustic \"village\" with half-timbered façades and reed-thatched roofs. A wave of naturalism and an affinity towards the \"simple\" life was sweeping across France in the 18th century. French aristocrats loved to act like shepherds and shepherdesses, while still enjoying the comforts of their social position. This idealism of the natural life came from the extremely influential works of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who emphasized Nature. The hamlet seemed completely rustic and natural from the outside, while the Rococo interior provided the desired comfort and luxury of the Queen and her friends.\n\nThe Petit Trianon, originally built for Madame de Pompadour under the reign of Louis XV, was a private domain. Encircling the Petit Trianon was the Jardin Anglais (the English Garden), a wilder style of garden that arose in response to traditional French manicured gardens. The Hamlet is built in a hybrid architectural style. A combination of Norman, Flemish, and French styles came together to create the village full of sylvan charm. Typically Norman, the cottages have half-timbered façades and reed coverings. The brick, \"sparrow-stepped\" gables and the stained glass windows are distinctly Flemish. The roofs covered with dormer windows and the plaster-covered façades, though, were native to France. The French architect Richard Mique designed and built the Hamlet with the garden in mind, and it is almost an extension of the Jardin Anglais. His buildings lend themselves to the surrounding landscape in their arrangement around a small lake, giving the illusion of a perfect and functioning village.\n\nThe barn, occasionally used as a ballroom, was destroyed during the French Revolution, while the rest of the houses survived the tumultuous period of French history.\n\nCourtiers at the Palace of Versailles constantly surrounded Marie Antoinette, leaving her in need of a refuge. She escaped the responsibilities and structure of court life to her private estate. The Hamlet was part of Marie Antoinette’s estate, and she enjoyed dressing as a young shepherdess or milkmaid and acting like a peasant, while surrounded by the comforts of a royal lifestyle. This unintentional mockery of the economically depressed French peasants helped build the resentment towards the monarchy among the French people, eventually leading to the French Revolution.\n\nWhile still in power, Marie Antoinette enjoyed acting as a tableau vivant, as if she were part of a painting. She brought her idyllic, picturesque village to life by stocking the barn with animals, and bringing in \"simple\" people, such as milkmaids and herdsmen, to act like residents of the Hamlet. Marie Antoinette would stroll around her perfect world in simple peasants' garb with her children, part of an idealized Nature. Her closest friends joined her in her ornamental village, where they also enjoyed pretending to live a simple life. Their isolation at the Hameau caused suspicion among the French people. Already resentful of Marie Antoinette for her profligate spending in times of economic depression, the secrecy surrounding her life of amusement led to suspected hedonism and scandal. It was rumored that Marie Antoinette had lovers, and they met at the Hameau, a surreal place that was completely her own. The extravagance and subtle mockery of peasant life did not help Marie Antoinette’s already suffering image.\n\nIn spite of its idyllic appearance, the hamlet was a real farm, fully managed by a farmer appointed by the Queen, with its vineyards, fields, orchards and vegetable gardens producing fruit and vegetables consumed at the royal table. Animals from Switzerland, according to the instructions of the Queen, were raised on the farm. For this reason the place was often called \"the Swiss hamlet\".\n\nThe Queen sought refuge in peasant life, milking cows or sheep, which were carefully maintained and cleaned by the servants. She preferred to wear simple clothing uncharacteristic to the frivolous fashion of the French Court while at the \"hameau\", and often dressed in a sun hat and informal muslin dress, a Polonaise gown, or a \"Chemise à la Reine\". The \"chemise\", worn without panniers and with a high waistline, was first worn by women in warmer climates in the colonies and was popularised amongst the aristocracy through Marie Antoinette. The simplicity and high waistline of the garment would lay the foundations for Regency/Empire fashion in the later decades during and after the Revolution. The Queen would often wear a straw Bergère hat and a fichu alongside a Polonaise gown; the term Polonaise referring to the dress of Polish shepherdesses who would hoist and drape their overskirts in two or three loops in order to keep their dress clean while farming. Marie Antoinette's wardrobe was generally imitative of the peasantry of the period.\n\nMarie Antoinette used buckets of Sèvres porcelain specially decorated with her arms by the Manufacture Royale. The place was completely enclosed by fences and walls, and only intimates of the Queen were allowed to access it. During the Revolution, \"a misogynistic, nationalistic and class-driven polemic swirled around the \"hameau\", which had previously seemed a harmless agglomeration of playhouses in which to act out a Boucher pastorale.\" The queen was accused by many of being frivolous, and found herself a target of innuendos, jealousy and gossip throughout her reign. Although for Marie Antoinette, the \"hameau\" was an escape from the regulated life of the Court at Versailles, in the eyes of French people, the queen seemed to be merely amusing herself.\n\nMarie Antoinette’s Hamlet consisted of a variety of different cottages and buildings, all built around a small lake. Each building had a specific function, and each played its part in the daily life of the Hamlet. The twelve cottages constructed in the hamlet can be divided into two groups: five were reserved for use by the Queen; the other seven had a functional purpose and were used effectively for agriculture. Marie Antoinette had her own house, connected to the pool. Nearby was her boudoir. The mill and the dairy received frequent visits from the Queen.\n\n\"The Queen's house and billiard room\" is situated in the middle of the Hamlet, and it is the largest and most important building. Its construction is innovative: two rustic buildings are connected by a covered gallery that is curved in a half-moon shape. A spiral staircase offers access to the second floor on one end of the house. These buildings included the Queen’s private chambers, as well as her salons and her parlors. The upper level comprises the petit salon, also known as the \"room of the nobles\", an anteroom in the form of a \"Chinese cabinet\" and the large living room with wood panelling hung with tapestries of Swiss style in embroidered wool. From the room's six windows, the Queen could easily control the work fields and activity of the hamlet. Access is via the staircase of the round tower. At the center of the room is a harpsichord which Marie Antoinette loved to play. On the ground floor, paved with single slabs of stone, the building includes a backgammon room and a dining room. The lyre-backed chairs in mahogany lined with green Morocco, were created by Georges Jacob. To the left, another building housing the billiard room is connected to the Queen's house by a wooden gallery decorated with trellises and twelve hundred St. Clement faience pots, marked in the blue figures of the Queen. Upstairs, a small apartment which seems to have been inhabited by the architect Richard Mique, has five rooms including a library. Despite the rustic appearance of facades, the interior finish and furnishings are luxurious and have been created by the carpenter Georges Jacob and the ébéniste Jean-Henri Riesener.\n\nThe \"Boudoir\", (4.6 x 5.2 metres) is the smallest structure, and it was nicknamed \"the little house of the Queen.\" Marie Antoinette would retire here by herself, or else with one or two of her friends. The boudoir was altered slightly during the Second Empire, but its small construction has remained to this day.\n\n\"The Mill\", built and fitted from 1783 to 1788, was never used for grinding grain, contrary to what is often argued. The wheel is driven by a stream derived from the Grand Lake and is only a decorative element. No mechanism or wheel were installed in the factory. The interior decoration was simple and neat. This structure is one of the most picturesque of the Hamlet. Each façade of the building is decorated slightly differently. This mill also served as a laundry.\n\nThis circular tower on the shores of the lake is mainly decorative. It was originally called \"The Fishery Tower.\" It was created after a popular lullaby from the era. The basement is used for storage, but the top part of the tower has a fairytale-esque design.\n\nThe \"warming room\" is recessed at the rear of the Queen's house. It has a stone interior and included a large kitchen, a bakery, a fireplace and pantry, also linen and silverware. It was used to prepare the dishes for dinners given by the Queen in the house or mill.\n\nThere were originally two dairies: one in which the dairy products were made, and one in which the Queen would taste them. The Preparation Dairy was destroyed during the First Empire. Each were designed with sanitation in mind: the rooms are light colored marble, which gives the impression of cleanliness.\n\nValy Bussard, the farmer, came to the Hameau to run a functional farm. Decorated in a rustic style, \"the farm\" included three bedrooms, a kitchen, and a dining room. It was well stocked with animals and vegetable gardens, whose crops led to agricultural and culinary experimentation at Versailles.\n\n\"The dovecote and pigeon coops\" were near the lake. Roosters and hens of various species were brought from the west of France and settled in the aviary in 1785 for Marie Antoinette’s use.\n\nThis building is situated on the edge of the field near the woods. Its original occupant was the Swiss guard, Jean Bersy, who lived there with his family. Because of the prominence of the occupants of the Hamlet, the guard was necessary for Marie Antoinette’s security.\n\n\"The barn\" also served as a ballroom. It was badly damaged during the French Revolution and destroyed during the First Empire.\n\n"}

He was generally known as Horace, to distinguish him from his Uncle Horatio, after whom he was named.\n\nMoule was born on 30 May 1832 at Fordington, Dorset, where his father was vicar. In 1851 he entered Trinity College, Oxford, but left without a degree; in 1854 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, but did not get a B.A. until 1867 and an M.A. in 1873. He did, however, win the Hulsean Prize in 1858.\n\nHe spent a brief spell as an assistant master at Marlborough College, and then became a government inspector of workhouses.\n\nMoule appears to have suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his life and death were shaped by these character traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a dipsomaniac-and that he was suffering from D.T'.\n\nOn 21 September 1873, when deeply depressed and affected by alcohol, he ended a three-hour conversation at Queens' with his brother Charles and went to bed. Minutes later Charles, writing in an adjoining room, heard what he described as a \"trickling\" sound and went to investigate. He found Horace covered in blood but conscious and able to utter his last words \"Easy to die. Love to my mother\", having slashed his throat with the razor that he kept under his pillow for that very purpose. The inquest jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, and he was buried at Fordington.\n\nSome of Hardy's poems were dedicated to Moule, and it has been suggested that several characters and scenes in his novels were inspired by him. Henry Knight in \"A Pair of Blue Eyes\" shares many of Moule's character traits.\n\n\n"}

These learning materials became very popular and were widely read, so today Langenscheidt can be considered the \"Father of distance education\". From 1867 Langenscheidt Publishing Group had its own printing press.\n\nFrom 1869 Langenscheidt worked with Karl Sachs and Césaire Villatte on the \"Encyklopädisches französisch-deutsches und deutsch-französisches Wörterbuch\" (\"Encyclopedic French-German and German-French dictionary\") and published it in 1880.

In 1843, after Noah Webster died, the company bought the rights to \"An American Dictionary of the English Language\" from Webster's estate. All Merriam-Webster dictionaries trace their lineage to this source.\n\nIn 1964, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., acquired Merriam-Webster, Inc., as a subsidiary. The company adopted its current name in 1982.\n\nIn 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, . In 1807 Webster started two decades of intensive work to expand his publication into a fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language\". To help him trace the etymology of words, Webster learned 26 languages. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country used somewhat different vocabularies and spelled, pronounced, and used words differently.\n\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, and at the University of Cambridge. His 1820s book contained 70,000 words, of which about 12,000 had never appeared in a dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced American English spellings, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", \"waggon\" with \"wagon\", and \"centre\" with \"center\". He also added American words, including \"skunk\" and \"squash\", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of 70 in 1828, Webster published his dictionary; it sold poorly, with only 2,500 copies putting him in debt. However, in 1840, he published the second edition in two volumes with much greater success.\nIn 1843, after Webster's death, George Merriam and Charles Merriam secured publishing and revision rights to the 1840 edition of the dictionary. They published a revision in 1847, which did not change any of the main text but merely added new sections, and a second update with illustrations in 1859. In 1864, Merriam published a greatly expanded edition, which was the first version to change Webster's text, largely overhauling his work yet retaining many of his definitions and the title \"\"An American Dictionary\". This began a series of revisions that were described as being \"unabridged\" in content. In 1884 it contained 118,000 words, \"3000 more than any other English dictionary\".\n\nWith the edition of 1890, the dictionary was retitled \"Webster's International\". The vocabulary was vastly expanded in \"Webster's New International\" editions of 1909 and 1934, totaling over half a million words, with the 1934 edition retrospectively called \"Webster's Second International\" or simply \"The Second Edition\" of the New International.\n\nThe \"Collegiate Dictionary\" was introduced in 1898 and the series is now in its eleventh edition. Following the publication of \"Webster's International\" in 1890, two \"Collegiate\" editions were issued as abridgments of each of their \"Unabridged\" editions. With the ninth edition (\"Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary\" (WNNCD), published in 1983), the \"Collegiate\" adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the \"Third New International\" (the main text of which has remained virtually unrevised since 1961). Some proper names were returned to the word list, including names of Knights of the Round Table. The most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word, to document its entry into the English language. The eleventh edition (published in 2003) includes more than 225,000 definitions, and more than 165,000 entries. A CD-ROM of the text is sometimes included. This dictionary is preferred as a source \"for general matters of spelling\" by the influential \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the United States. The \"Chicago Manual\" states that it \"normally opts for\" the first spelling listed.\n\nMerriam overhauled the dictionary again with the 1961 \"Webster's Third New International\" under the direction of Philip B. Gove, making changes that sparked public controversy. Many of these changes were in formatting, omitting needless punctuation, or avoiding complete sentences when a phrase was sufficient. Others, more controversial, signaled a shift from linguistic prescriptivism and towards describing American English as it was used at that time.\n\nSince the 1940s, the company has added many specialized dictionaries, language aides, and other references to its repertoire.\n\nThe G. & C. Merriam Company lost its right to exclusive use of the name \"Webster\" after a series of lawsuits placed that name in public domain. Its name was changed to \"Merriam-Webster, Incorporated\", with the publication of \"Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary\" in 1983. Previous publications had used \"A Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" as a subtitle for many years and will be found on older editions.\n\nThe company has been a subsidiary of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. since 1964.\n\nIn 1996, Merriam-Webster launched its first website, which provided free access to an online dictionary and thesaurus.\n\nMerriam-Webster has also published dictionaries of synonyms, English usage, geography (\"Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary\"), biography, proper names, medical terms, sports terms, slang, Spanish/English, and numerous others. Non-dictionary publications include \"Collegiate Thesaurus\", \"Secretarial Handbook\", \"Manual for Writers and Editors\", \"Collegiate Encyclopedia\", \"Encyclopedia of Literature\", and \"Encyclopedia of World Religions\".\n\nOn February 16, 2007, Merriam-Webster announced the launch of a mobile dictionary and thesaurus service developed with mobile search-and-information provider AskMeNow. Consumers use the service to access definitions, spelling and synonyms via text message. Services also include Merriam-Webster's \"Word of the Day\"—and \"Open Dictionary\", a wiki service that provides subscribers the opportunity to create and submit their own new words and definitions.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster company once used a unique set of phonetic symbols in their dictionaries—intended to help people from different parts of the United States learn how to pronounce words the same way as others who spoke with the same accent or dialect did. Unicode accommodated IPA symbols, but did not specify room for Merriam-Webster phonetics. Hence, to enable computerized access to the pronunciation without having to rework all dictionaries to IPA notation, the online services of Merriam-Webster specify phonetics using a less-specific set of ASCII characters.\n\nMerriam creates entries by finding uses of a particular word in print and recording them in a database of \"citations\". Editors at Merriam spend about an hour a day looking at print sources, from books and newspapers to less formal publications, like advertisements and product packaging, to study the uses of individual words and choose things that should be preserved in the citation file. Merriam-Webster's citation file contains more than 16 million entries documenting individual uses of words. Millions of these citations are recorded on 3-by-5 cards in their paper citation files. The earliest entries in the paper citation files date back to the late 19th century. Since 2009, all new entries are recorded in an electronic database.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "352603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352603", "title": "Morgan le Fay", "text": "Morgan le Fay\n\nMorgan le Fay (, meaning \"Morgan the Fairy\"), alternatively known as Morgana, Morganna, Morgain, Morgaine, Morgane, Morgen, Morgne, and Morgue among other names and spellings, is a powerful enchantress in the Arthurian legend. Early appearances of Morgan do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a goddess, a fay, or a sorceress, generally benevolent and related to King Arthur as his magical savior and protector. Her prominence increased over time, as did her moral ambivalence, and in some texts there is an evolutionary transformation of her to an antagonist, particularly as portrayed in cyclical prose such as the Lancelot-Grail and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. A significant aspect in many of Morgan's medieval and later iterations is the unpredictable duality of her nature, with potential for both good and evil.\n\nHer character may have been rooted in Welsh mythology as well as other earlier myths and historical figures. The earliest account, by Geoffrey of Monmouth in \"Vita Merlini,\" refers to Morgan in conjunction with the Isle of Apples (Avalon), which is where Arthur was carried after being fatally wounded in the Battle of Camlann. There, and in the early chivalric romances by Chrétien de Troyes and others, her chief role is that of a great healer. It is Chrétien who establishes her as Arthur's supernatural elder sister.\n\nIn the Robert de Boron-derived French prose versions and the works based on them, including among them Thomas Malory's influential \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", she is usually established as the youngest daughter of Arthur's mother, Igraine, and her first husband, Gorlois. Arthur, son of Igraine and Uther, is Morgan's half-brother; Mordred's mother Morgause is one of Morgan's sisters. Morgan unhappily marries Urien with whom she has a son, Ywain. She becomes an apprentice of Merlin, and a vindictive adversary of some knights of the Round Table, all the while harboring a special hatred for Arthur's wife Guinevere. In this tradition, she is also sexually active and even predatory, taking numerous lovers that may include Merlin and Accolon, with an unrequited love for Lancelot. In some variants, including the popular retelling by Malory, Morgan is the greatest enemy of Arthur, scheming to usurp his throne, indirectly becoming an instrument of his death; however, she eventually reconciles with Arthur, and retains her original role of taking him on his final journey to Avalon.\n\nMany other medieval and Renaissance works feature continuations of her evolutionary tale from the aftermath of Camlann as she becomes the immortal queen of Avalon in both Arthurian and non-Arthurian stories, sometimes alongside Arthur. After a period of being largely absent from modern culture, Morgan's character again rose to prominence in the 20th and 21st centuries, appearing in a wide variety of roles and portrayals.\n\nThe earliest spelling of the name (found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Vita Merlini\", written c. 1150) is \"Morgen\", which is likely derived from Old Welsh or Old Breton \"Morgen\", meaning \"Sea-born\" (from Common Brittonic \"*Mori-genā\", the masculine form of which, \"*Mori-genos\", survived in Middle Welsh as \"Moryen\" or \"Morien\"; a cognate form in Old Irish is \"Muirgen\", the name of a Christian shapeshifting female saint who was associated with the sea). The name is not to be confused with the unrelated Modern Welsh masculine name Morgan (spelled \"Morcant\" in the Old Welsh period). As her epithet \"le Fay\" (invented in 15th century by Thomas Malory from the earlier French \"la fée\", \"the fairy\") and some traits indicate, the figure of Morgan appears to have been a remnant of supernatural females from Celtic mythology, and her main name could be connected to the myths of Morgens (also known as Mari-Morgans or just Morgans), the Welsh and Breton fairy water spirits. While many later works make her specifically human, she retains her magical powers, and sometimes also her otherworldly if not divine attributes. In fact she is often referred to as either a fairy queen or outright a goddess (\"dea\", \"déesse\", \"gotinne\") by authors.\n\nGeoffrey's description of Morgen and her sisters in the \"Vita Merlini\" closely resembles the story of the nine Gaulish priestesses of the isle of Sena (now Île de Sein) called \"Gallisenae\" (or \"Gallizenae\"), as described by the geographer Pomponius Mela during the 1st century, strongly suggesting that Pomponius' \"Description of the World\" (\"De situ orbis\") was one of Geoffrey's prime sources of inspiration. Further inspiration for her character likely came from Welsh folklore and medieval Irish literature and hagiography. Speculation sometimes (beginning with Lucy Allen Paton in 1904) connects Morgan with the Irish shapeshifting and multifaced goddess of strife known as the Morrígan (\"great queen\"). Proponents of this have included Roger Sherman Loomis, who doubted the Muirgen connection. She has also been linked with the supernatural mother Modron, derived from the continental mother goddess figure of Dea Matrona and featured with some frequency in medieval Welsh literature. Modron appears in Welsh Triad 70 (\"Three Blessed Womb-Burdens of the Island of Britain\") — in which her children by Urien are named Owain mab Urien (son) and Morfydd (daughter) — and a later folktale have recorded more fully in the manuscript Peniarth 147. A fictionalized version of the historical king Urien is usually Morgan le Fay's husband in the variations of Arthurian legend informed by continental romances, wherein their son is named Ywain. Furthermore, the historical Urien had a treacherous ally named Morcant Bulc who plotted to assassinate him, similar to how Morgan attempts to kill Urien. Additionally, Modron is called \"daughter of Afallach\", a Welsh ancestor figure, also known as Avallach or Avalloc, whose name can also be interpreted as a noun meaning \"a place of apples\"; in the tale of Owain and Morfydd's conception in Peniarth 147, Modron is called the \"daughter of the King of Annwn\", a Celtic Otherworld. This evokes Avalon, the marvelous \"Isle of Apples\" with which Morgan le Fay has been associated since her earliest appearances. Possible influence by elements of the classical Greek mythology sorceresses or goddesses such as Circe and especially Medea, as well as magical women from the Irish mythology, such as the mother of hero Fráech or the otherworldly woman Niamh (including the motif of apple in connection to Avalon-like isle of Tír na nÓg), and the contemporary historical figure of Empress Matilda, have been also suggested.\n\nAccording to Gerald of Wales, a noblewoman and close relative of King Arthur named Morganis carried the dead Arthur to her island of Avalon (identified by him as Glastonbury), where he was buried. Writing around 1216 in \"De instructione principis\", Gerald claimed that \"as a result, the fanciful Britons and their bards invented the legend that some kind of a fantastic goddess (\"dea quaedam phantastica\") had removed Arthur's body to the Isle of Avalon, so that she might cure his wounds there,\" for the purpose of enabling the possibility of King Arthur's messianic return. In his encyclopedic work \"Otia Imperialia\", written around the same time and with similar derision for this belief, Gervase of Tilbury calls that mythical enchantress Morganda the Fairy (\"Morganda Fatata\"). Morgan retains this role as Arthur's otherworldly healer in much of later tradition. \n\nMorgan first appears by name in \"Vita Merlini\", written by Norman-Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth. Purportedly an account of the life of Merlin, it elaborates some episodes from Geoffrey's more famous earlier work, \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (1136). In \"Historia\", Geoffrey relates how King Arthur, seriously wounded by Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, is taken off to the blessed Isle of Apple Trees (Latin \"Insula Pomorum\"), Avalon, to be healed; Avalon (\"Ynys Afallach\" in the Welsh versions of \"Historia\") is also mentioned as the place where Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged. (Geoffrey's Arthur does have a sister, whose name here is Anna, but the possibility of her being a predecessor to Morgan is unknown.) In \"Vita Merlini\", Geoffrey describes this island in more detail and names \"Morgen\" as the chief of the nine magical queen sisters who dwell there, ruling in their own right. Morgen agrees to take Arthur, delivered to her by Taliesin to have him revived, but says it might take a long time. She and her sisters are capable of shapeshifting and flying (\"like Daedalus, on strange wings\"), and (at least seemingly) use their powers only for good. Morgen is also said to be a learned mathematician and to have taught astronomy to her fellow nymph (\"nymphae\") sisters, whose names are Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten and Thiton. In creating this Virgin Mary-type character and her sisters, Geoffrey might have been influenced by the 1st-century Roman cartographer Pomponius Mela, who has described an oracle at the Île de Sein off the coast of Brittany and its nine virgin priestesses believed by the continental Celtic Gauls to have the power to cure disease and perform various other marvelous magic, such as controlling the sea through incantations, foretelling the future, and changing themselves into any animal.\n\nAccording to a theory postulated by R. S. Loomis, Geoffrey was not the original inventor of Morgan's character, which had already existed in hypothetical unrecorded stories of her as Arthur's fairy savior or even also his fairy godmother (her earliest shared supernatural ability being able to traverse on or under water) as being told by wandering storytellers (as credited by Gerald of Wales) that would influence various authors writing independently from each other, especially since \"Vita Merlini\" was a little known text that only survived in one manuscript. Geoffrey's description of Morgen is notably very similar to that of Medea in Benoît de Sainte-Maure's epic poem \"Roman de Troie\" (c. 1155–1160), a story of the ancient Trojan War in which Morgan herself makes an unexplained appearance in this second known text featuring her. As Morgan the fairy (\"Orva la fée\", likely a corruption of a spelling such as \"*Morgua\" in the original-text), there she loves Hector and gifts him a wonderful horse but then pursues him with hate after he rejects her. The abrupt way in which she is used suggests Benoît did expect his aristocratic audience to have been familiar with her character. In \"Jaufre\", an Occitan language Arthurian romance dated c. 1180, Morgan apparently appears, without being named (other than naming herself as the Fairy of Gibel), as the lady of an underground kingdom who takes the protagonist knight Jaufre through a fountain to gift him her magic ring of protection. In the romance poem \"Lanzelet\", written by the end of the 12th century by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, the infant Lancelot is spirited away by a water fairy (\"merfeine\" in Old High German) and raised in her paradise island country of Meidelant (\"Land of Maidens\"); his water fairy queen might be also related to Geoffrey's Morgen of Avalon. In Layamon's Middle English poem \"The Chronicle of Britain\" (c. 1215), Arthur was taken to Avalon by two women to be healed there by its most beautiful elfen (\"aluen\") queen named Argante or Argane; it is possible her name had been originally \"Margan(te)\" before it was changed in manuscript transmission.\n\nThe 12th-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes already mentions her in his first romance, \"Erec and Enide\", completed around 1170. In it, a love of Morgan (Morgue) is Guinguemar, the Lord of the Isle of Avalon and a nephew of King Arthur, a derivative of the legendary Breton hero Guingamor. Guingamor's own tale by Marie de France links him to the beautiful magical entity known only as the \"fairy mistress\", who was later identified by Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" as \"Dame Tryamour\", the daughter of the King of the Celtic Otherworld who shares many characteristics with Chrétien's Morgan. It was noted that even Chrétien' earliest mention of Morgan already shows an enmity between her and Queen Guinevere, and although Morgan is represented only in a benign role by Chrétien, she resides in a mysterious place known as the Vale Perilous (which some later authors would say she has created as a place of punishment for unfaithful knights). She is later mentioned in the same poem when Arthur provides the wounded hero Erec with a healing balm made by his sister Morgan. This episode affirms her early role as a healer, in addition to being one of the first instances of Morgan presented as Arthur's sister; healing is Morgan's chief ability, but Chrétien also hints at her potential to harm. Chrétien again refers to Morgan as a great healer in his later romance \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\", in an episode in which the Lady of Norison restores the maddened hero to his senses with a magical potion provided by Morgan the Wise (\"Morgue la sage\"). While Modron is the mother of Owain mab Urien in Welsh literature, and Morgan would be assigned this role in later French literature, this first continental association between Sir Ywain and Morgan does not imply they are son and mother; she is first mentioned as Ywain's mother in the early 13th-century Breton lai \"Tyolet\".\n\nThe Middle Welsh Arthurian tale \"Geraint son of Erbin\", either based on Chrétien's \"Erec and Enide\" or derived from a common source, mentions King Arthur's chief physician named Morgan Tud. It is believed that this character, though considered a male in \"Gereint\", may be derived from Morgan le Fay, though this has been a matter of debate among Arthurian scholars since the 19th century (the epithet Tud may be a Welsh or Breton cognate or borrowing of Old Irish \"tuath\", \"north, left\", \"sinister, wicked\", also \"fairy (fay), elf\"). There, Morgan is called to treat Edern ap Nudd, Knight of the Sparrowhawk, following the latter's defeat at the hands of his adversary Geraint, and is later called on by Arthur to treat Geraint himself. In his version of \"Erec\", the 12th-century German knight and poet Hartmann von Aue describes Arthur's deceased sorceress sister, the goddess (\"gotinne\") Feimurgan (\"Fâmurgân\", Fairy Murgan), whom he based on Morgen of Avalon with a Christian bias, as a mistress of dark magic and healing arts who lived her life \"in defiance of God\" and had the devil in Hell as a trusted companion. Erec is healed by Guinevere with a special plaster that the fairy had given to Arthur before she died. According to the work, at her death all of her wondrous knowledge was lost with her, which included flying, raising the dead, turning people to animals at will, and commanding monsters (wild beasts, evil spirits, dragons). In writing that, Hartmann might have not been influenced by Chrétien, but rather by an earlier oral tradition from the stories of Breton bards. In the 13th-century romance \"Parzival\", another German knight-poet Wolfram von Eschenbach inverted Fâmurgân's name to create that of Arthur's fairy ancestor named Terdelaschoye de Feimurgân, the wife of Mazadân, where the part \"Terdelaschoye\" comes from \"Terre de la Joie\", or Land of Joy; the text also mentions the mountain of Fâmorgân.\n\nA recently discovered moralistic manuscript written in Anglo-Norman French is the only known instance of medieval Arthurian literature presented as being composed by Morgan herself. This late 12th-century text is purportedly addressed to Morgan's court official and tells of the story of a knight called Piers the Fierce; it is likely that the author's motive was to draw a satirical moral from the downfall of the English knight Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Morgan (Morgayne) is titled in it as \"empress of the wilderness, queen of the damsels, lady of the isles, and governor of the waves of the great sea.\" She is also mentioned in the \"Draco Normannicus\", a 12th-century (c. 1167–1169) Latin chronicle by Étienne de Rouen, which contains a fictional letter from King Arthur to Henry II of England, written for political propaganda purposes, in which 'Arthur' criticizes Henry for invading Brittany and claims that he has been healed of his wounds and made immortal in Avalon by his fay sister Morgan, called an \"immortal nymph\" (\"nympha perennis\"). Notably, it is one of the first known texts that made Morgan a sister to Arthur, as she is in the works of Chrétien and many others after him.\n\nMorgan's role was greatly expanded by the unknown authors (possibly members of the Cisterian religious order, which would explain their demonization of pagan motifs and fear of sexuality) of the 13th-century Old French romances of Lancelot-Grail (the Vulgate Cycle) and especially its subsequent rewrites (the Post-Vulgate Cycle). Integrating her fully into the Arthurian world, they also make Morgan's ways and deeds much more sinister and aggressive than she was presented by Geoffrey or Chrétien, as she undergoes a series of transformations and becomes a chaotic counter-heroine in many texts. Beginning as an erratic ally of Arthur and a notorious temptress opposed to his wife and some of his knights (especially Lancelot) in the original stories of the Vulgate Cycle, Morgan's figure eventually often turns into an ambitious and depraved nemesis of King Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate. Her common image is now a malicious and cruel sorceress, the source of many intrigues at the royal court of Arthur and elsewhere. In some of the later works, she is also subversively working to take over Arthur's throne through her mostly harmful magic and scheming, including manipulating men. Most of the time, Morgan's magic arts correspond with these of Merlin's and the Lady of the Lake's, such as shapeshifting, illusion, and sleeping spells. The medieval archetype of the loathly lady is used frequently, as Morgan can be contradictorily described as both beautiful and ugly even within the same narration.\n\nMorgan first appears in the few surviving verses of the Old French poem \"Merlin\", which later served as the original source for the Vulgate Cycle and consequently also the Post-Vulgate Cycle. It was written c. 1200 by the French knight-poet Robert de Boron, who described her as an illegitimate daughter of Lady Igraine (with an unnamed Duke of Tintagel in a continuation of \"Merlin\" in the Vulgate \"Lancelot\"), adopted by King Neutres of Garlot. \"Merlin\" is the first known work linking Morgan to Igraine and mentioning her learning sorcery after having been sent away for an education. In a popular tradition from later evolutions of this narrative, Morgan is the youngest of the daughters of Igraine and Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. In the poem's prose version and its continuations, she has at least two elder sisters (various manuscripts list up to five daughters and some do not mention Morgan being a bastard child): Elaine of Garlot and Morgause, the latter of whom is the mother of Arthur's knights Gawain, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravain by King Lot of Lothian, and the traitor Mordred by Arthur (in some romances the wife of King Lot is called Morcades, a name that R. S. Loomis argued was another variant of Morgan). At a young age, Morgan is sent to a convent after Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, aided by the half-demon Merlin, kills Gorlois and rapes and marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan's younger half-brother). There, Morgan masters the seven arts, and begins her study of magic, going on to specialize in \"astronomie\" (astronomy and astrology) and healing. The late addition known as the Vulgate \"Suite du Merlin\", besides describing Morgan's unmatched beauty and amazing voice, presents more of her skills, including being \"the best worker with her hands that anyone knew about in any land,\" highly eloquent and \"the cleverest of all.\" Its narrator further elaborates on her character, being infamous as \"the most ardent and most lecherous woman in all Britain ... inspired with sensuality and the devil,\" that \"as long as she was in her right mind, she was more courteous than any, but when she was angry with anyone, there was no need in trying to reconcile them.\" \n\nUther (or Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate) betroths her to his ally, King Urien of Gore (possibly Rheged). Now a queen but unhappy with her husband, Morgan is caught in an affair with her lover Guiomar (derived from Chrétien's Guinguemar) by the High King Arthur's newly married wife, Queen Guinevere, whom Morgan had served as a lady-in-waiting. Guinevere intervenes to break their relationship to prevent the loss of honor (and possibly because of Guinevere's perception of Morgan, with her kinship and close relationship with Arthur, as a rival in political power). This incident, introduced in the Prose \"Merlin\" and expanded in the Vulgate \"Lancelot\" and the Post-Vulgate \"Suite du Merlin\" (the Huth \"Merlin\"), begins a lifelong feud between Guinevere and Morgan, who leaves the court of Camelot with all her wealth to seek out Merlin and greater powers. The pregnant Morgan later gives a birth to Guiomar's son, who is not named in the story but is said to grow up to become a great knight. Morgan then either undertakes or continues her studies of dark magic under Merlin, whom she enamors, the details of which vary widely depending on the telling. In the Prose \"Merlin\", for instance, it is Morgan who finds Merlin, whom she \"loves passionately\". In the \"Le Livre d'Artus\", it is rather Merlin who goes to live with Morgan and her two ladies for a long time. In the Post-Vulgate \"Suite\", Morgan had been tutored by Merlin even before her relationship with Guiomar, and later she returns to learn more. They first meet at Lot's funeral; after he teaches her so much she becomes \"the wisest woman in the world\", Morgan scorns and drives Merlin away by threatening to torture and kill him if he would not leave her alone, which causes him great sorrow out of his \"fol amor\" (uncourtly love) for her. In the Vulgate \"Lancelot\", Morgan learns all her magic only from Merlin (and not in the nunnery). She then takes an unnamed knight as her new companion, until she discovers his affair with another woman, which leads to the creation of her magical domain known as the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return), serving as an enchanted prison for false lovers. In any case, having finished her studies under Merlin, Morgan begins scheming her vengeance as she tries to undermine virtue and achieve Guinevere's downfall whenever she can.\n\nIn the Post-Vulgate, where Morgan's explicitly evil nature is stated and accented, she also works to destroy Arthur's rule and end his life, but the reasons for her initial hatred of him are never fully explained other than just an extreme antipathy towards the perfect goodness which he symbolizes. The most famous and important of these machinations is introduced in the Post-Vulgate \"Suite\", where she arranges for her devoted lover Accolon to obtain the enchanted sword Excalibur as well as its protective scabbard, which has been previously confided to Morgan by Arthur himself as he had trusted her even more than his wife, replacing the real ones with fakes. In a conspiracy with the villainous lord Damas, Morgan plans for Accolon to use Arthur's own magic items against him in single combat, so she and her beloved Accolon would become the rulers. As part of her convoluted plan, both Arthur and Accolon are spirited away from their hunt with Urien by a magical boat of twelve damsels. Confident of her coming victory, Morgan also attempts to murder her sleeping husband Urien with his own sword, but in this act she is stopped by their son Ywain (Uwayne), who pardons her when she protests she has been under the devil's power and promises to abandon her wicked ways. After Arthur nevertheless mortally defeats Accolon in a duel arranged by Morgan, her former mentor Merlin, still having feelings for her, saves her from Arthur's wrath by enabling her to escape. To avenge Accolon's death, which caused her great sorrow, Morgan again steals the scabbard from the sleeping king. Pursued by Arthur for her betrayal, Morgan throws the scabbard into a lake, before temporarily turning herself and her entourage to stone, the sight of which makes Arthur think they have been already punished by God. That action of Morgan ultimately causes the death of Arthur, who would otherwise be protected by the scabbard's magic in his final battle. On her way out, Morgan saves Arthur's knight named Manassen (Manessen, Manasses) from certain death and enables him to kill his captor when she learns Accolon was Manessen's cousin. Now banished from Camelot, Morgan retires to her lands in Gore and then to her castle near the stronghold of Tauroc (possibly in North Wales). However, her treacherous attempts to bring about Arthur's demise in the \"Suite\" are repeatedly frustrated by the king's new sorceress advisor Ninianne (the Lady of the Lake). Such is the case when Morgan sends Arthur a supposed offering of peace in the form of a rich mantle cloak; Morgan's messenger maiden is made put on the cursed gift and it burns her to cinders. It is possible that this motif was inspired by classical stories like that how Medea killed her rival for Jason's affection or how Deianira sent a poisoned tunic to Hercules. In one of her castles, Tugan in Garlot, Morgan has hidden a magic book given to her by Merlin, which actually prophesied the deaths of Arthur and Gawain and who would kill them, but no one can read this passage without dying instantly.\n\nMorgan also uses her skills in dealing with various of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, especially the greatest of them all, Lancelot, whom she alternately tries to seduce and to expose as Guinevere's adulterous lover. Her magic aside, Lancelot is always disempowered in his dealings with Morgan as he could never hurt a woman or fight a kin of his king, which allows the writers to make her a perfect foil for Lancelot as \"the woman he most feared in the world.\" Morgan is emphasized as promiscuous, even more than her sister Morgause, as she is \"so lustful and wanton that a looser woman could not have been found.\" Her many paramours include Huneson the Bald (Hemison, Onesun), who is mortally wounded when he attacks Tristan (Tristam) out of his jealously for Morgan's attention; he soon dies after returning to her, and the anguished Morgan buries him in a grand tomb. In one variation, she then takes possession of the lance that was used to kill Huneson, enchants it, and sends it to King Mark of Cornwall, her possible lover, who years later uses it to slay Tristan. In the Prose \"Tristan\", wherein Morgan presents herself as Arthur's full sister, she delivers by Lamorak to Arthur's court a magical drinking horn from which no unfaithful lady can drink without spilling, hoping to disgrace Guinevere by revealing her infidelity, but it is Iseult whose adultery is disclosed instead. Lancelot is Morgan's prime object of sexual desire but he consistently refuses her obsessive advances due to his great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan courts, drugs, enchants or imprisons the knight on several occasions (three times in the Vulgate \"Lancelot\"). Their relationship (as well as interactions between her and Arthur) may evoke that of the goddess Morrígan and the Celtic hero Cú Chulainn. One part of \"Lancelot\" has him captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by her and two other lascivious enchantresses, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan, each of whom wants to make him her lover, but he refuses to choose and escapes with the help of one of their maidservants, Rocedon. The three enchantresses \"knew so much about magic, they enjoyed one another's company and always rode together and ate and drank together.\" Sebile and Morgan are particularly close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Lancelot's brother Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century \"Prophéties de Merlin\"; a resulting contest between them is won by Nimue with help from Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored. After Merlin's entombment by the Lady of the Lake, Morgan and her three enchantresses also try to find and rescue him but they fail in that task. Morgan's other allies in the \"Prophéties\" include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake. In one of her schemes, she even sends Lucifer himself (in the guise of a dragon) against Segurant the Brown (Segurant le Brun).\n\nBesides Lancelot, Morgan's fancied good knights include the rescued-but-abducted young Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin, a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy from the much later addition to the Prose \"Tristan\" as well as the \"Prophéties de Merlin\"), whom she promises to heal; however, he vows to castrate himself rather than to pleasure her. He, however, promises to defend her castle of Fair Guard (\"Belle Garde\"), where he has been held, for a year and a day, and then dutifully continues to guard it even after the castle gets burned down; this eventually leads to his death. In the Val sans Retour, Lancelot frees the 250 unfaithful knights entrapped by Morgan, including Morgan's own son Ywain and her former lover Guiomar whom she has turned to stone for his infidelity. Morgan captures Lancelot under her spell using a magic ring and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would then go mad or die of sorrow. She also otherwise torments Guinevere, causing her great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring that protects her from Morgan's power. On one occasion, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Gawain when he promises to come back (but also keeping him the company of \"the most beautiful of her maidens\" to do \"whatever she could to entice him\"), and he keeps his word and does return; she eventually releases him altogether after over a year, when his health falters and he is near death. It is said that Morgan concentrates on witchcraft to such degree that she goes to live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess (\"Morgain-la-déesse\", \"Morgue la dieuesse\"). In the Post-Vulgate version of \"Queste del Saint Graal\", Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still will be able to control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. Later, after she hosts her nephews Gawain, Mordred and Gaheriet to heal them, Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there; Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this. With same intent, she also gives Tristan an enchanted shield depicting Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to deliver to Camelot (in the Prose \"Tristan\").\n\nIn the Vulgate \"La Mort le Roi Artu\" (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just \"Mort Artu\"), Morgan ceases troubling Arthur and vanishes for a long time, and Arthur assumes her to be dead. But one day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they meet and instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king, overjoyed with their reunion, allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon, \"where the women live who know all the world's magic,\" to live there with other sorceresses. However, disaster strikes when the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. In \"Mort Artu\", a black-hooded Morgan is the first among the ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest and possible revival in Avalon. The latter part of the Post-Vulgate versions of \"Queste\" and \"Mort\" both revert to Morgan's friendly and helpful attitude toward Arthur from the Vulgate Cycle, even as she makes no mention of Avalon or her intentions when taking him away. Arthur steps into her boat after Camlann but assures he is not going to return; his grave is later said to be found mysteriously empty but for his helmet. A 14th-century Middle English version of \"Mort Artu\" known as the Stanzaic \"Morte Arthur\" makes Morgan an unquestionably good sister of Arthur, concerned only about his honor in regard to the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere. Entering her boat (she is not named in the scene, but addresses him as her brother), Arthur believes he is going to be healed, yet his tomb is later discovered by Bedivere.\n\nMiddle English writer Thomas Malory follows much of these portrayals of Morgan in his late-15th-century seminal work of the selective compilation book \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (\"The Death of Arthur\"), though he reduces her in role and detail of characterisation, in particular either removing or limiting her traditions of healing and prophecy, and making her more consistently and inherently evil just as he makes Merlin more good. He also diminishes Morgan's conflict with Guinevere, as there is no motif of Guiomar and Accolon (there Sir Accolon of Gaul) is her first named lover, but does not clarify Morgan's motivations for her antagonistic behaviour against Arthur. Malory scholar Elizabeth Sklar described Morgan's character here as \"an essentially sociopathic personality, respecting no boundaries and acknowledging no rules save those dictated by her own ambitions, envy, and lust.\" Up until the war between Arthur and Lancelot and the rebellion of Mordred, it is Morgan who remains the main and constant source of direct and indirect threat to the realm. In Malory's backstory, she has studied astrology as well as \"nigremancie\" (which might actually mean black magic in general rather than \"necromancy\") in the nunnery where she was raised, before being married to Urien (Uriens) as a young teenager; in this narrative she did not study with Merlin. Her powers seem to be inspired by fairy magic of Celtic folklore rather than by medieval Christian demonology. Malory mentions Arthur's attempts to conquer at least one of her castles, which originally had been his own gift to her, and which he could not retake (apparently due to magical defenses). She also plots an elaborate ambush in \"The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyons\", after learning of the death of one of her favourites in a tournament, but Tristan ends up killing or routing thirty of her knights when the ambush ends in a disaster. Morgan is widely feared and hated, so much that \"many knights wished her burnt.\" She is now the leader of the four (not three) witch queens who capture Lancelot (the others being the Queen of the Northgales, the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Outer Isles). In an episode that had been first introduced by the anonymous writer of the earlier Prose \"Lancelot\", Lancelot rescues Elaine of Corbenic from being trapped in an enchanted boiling bath by Morgan and the Queen of the Northgales, both envious of Elaine's great beauty (echoing Circe's treatment of Scylla). As noted by Mary Lynn Saul: \"Curiously, in spite of all her powers, Morgan is rarely successful in any of her plots. Nevertheless, she remains a medieval symbol of the potential danger of uncontrolled female power.\" However, despite all of their prior hostility towards each other and her numerous designs directed against Arthur personally (and his own promise to get a terrible revenge on her as long as he lives), Malory's Morgan is still redeemed and is one of the four grieving enchantress queens (the others being Nimue, marking the end of conflict between her and Morgan, and two of Morgan's allies, the Queen of the Northgales and the Queen of the Wasteland) who arrive in a black boat to transport the wounded king to Avalon in the end. Unlike in the French and earlier stories on which \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" is based, and where Morgan and Arthur would either have first made peace or have just never fought to begin with, here her change of attitude towards him is sudden and unexplained. Arthur is last seen in Morgan's lap, with her lament of sorrow referring to him as her \"dear brother\" (\"dere brothir\"), as they disappear from the work's narrative together. \n\nMorgan turns up throughout the High and Late Middle Ages in a variety of roles, generally in works related to the cycles of Arthur (the Matter of Britain) or Charlemagne (the Matter of France). They often feature Morgan as a lover and benefactor (and sometimes opponent, especially when being turned down) of various heroes, sometimes also introducing her additional offspring or alternate siblings, or connecting her closer with the figure of the Lady of the Lake. The 15th-century Italian manuscript \"Tavola ritonda\" (\"The Round Table\"), for instance, makes Morgan a sister to the Lady of the Lake as well as to Arthur; it is based on the French romances but here Morgan is a prophetic figure whose main role is to ensure the fulfillment of fate. The Middle English romance \"Arthour and Merlin\", written around 1270, casts a villainous Morgan in the role of the Lady of the Lake and gives her a brother named Morganor as an illegitimate son of King Urien; her wondrous castle Palaus is built mostly of crystal and glass. In the Old French anonymous \"Li Romans de Claris et Laris\" better known as just \"Claris and Laris\" (also c. 1270), Morgane la Faye (Morgana in the modern English translation) is a now fully supernatural being, a former sister of Arthur as well as a former pupil of the Lady of Lake, Viviane (Viviana). Still ever lascivious and sexual, Morgan now lives in a splendid enchanted castle in the wilderness (identified as Brocéliande in a later manuscript) with twelve other beautiful fairy ladies including the sorceress Madoine (Madoina). There, they lure and ensnare many hundreds of young and attractive knights, who then spend the rest of their lives in the palace. The 14th-century Italian romance titled \"La Pulzella Gaia\" (\"The\" \"Merry Maiden\") features the titular beautiful young daughter of Morgana the Wise by Hemison. She is kidnapped by the knight Burletta of the Desert (Burletta della Diserta) and rescued by Lancelot, and later defeats Gawain (Galvan) in her giant serpent form before becoming his lover; she and her fairy army then save Gawain from the jealous Guinevere, who wants Gawain dead after having been spurned by him. She then herself is imprisoned in a magical torment in her mother's glass-and-diamond magical castle Pela-Orso, as Morgana, who here too is a sister of the Lady of the Lake, wants to marry her \"whore\" daughter to Tristan; Gawain storms the castle after three years of siege and frees her from a cursed dungeon, also capturing her tyrannical mother for the same punishment. At the end of the 14th-century Middle English romance \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", one of the best-known Arthurian tales, it is revealed that the entire Green Knight plot has been instigated by Gawain's aunt, the goddess Morgan le Fay (\"Morgue la Faye\", \"Morgne þe goddes\"), whose prior mentorship by Merlin is mentioned. Here, she is an ambiguous trickster who takes an appearance of an elderly woman (contrasting from the beautiful Lady Bertilak in a role evoking the loathly lady tradition), as a test for Arthur and his knights and to frighten Guinevere to death. Morgan's importance to this particular narrative has been disputed and called a \"deus ex machina\" and simply an artistic device to further connect Gawain's episode to the Arthurian legend, but some regard her as a central character and the driving force of the plot. Opinions are also divided regarding Morgan's intentions and whether she succeeds or fails. The story's shapeshifting and enigmatic Morgan might be, or might be not, also Lady Bertilak herself.\n\nIn some texts, Avalon is often described as an otherworldly place ruled by Morgan. In his 14th-century Catalan poem \"La faula\", Guillem de Torroella claims to having visited the Enchanted Isle and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by the fay Morgan (\"Morgan la feya\", \"Morguan la fea\") and they both are now forever young due to the power of the Holy Grail. In the 15th-century Spanish romance \"Tirant lo Blanch\", the noble Queen Morgan searches the world for her missing brother and finds him as an entranced prisoner in Constantinople; Morgan brings Arthur back to his senses by removing Excalibur from his hands, and after great celebrations they depart together back to Avalon. In the legends of Charlemagne, she is most famous for her association with the Danish legendary hero Ogier the Dane, following his initial epics. When he is 100 years old, she restores him to his youthful form but removes his memory, then takes him to her mystical island palace in Avalon (where Arthur and Gawain are also still alive) to be her lover for 200 years; she later protects him during his adventures in the mortal world as he defends France from Muslim invasion, before his eventual return to Avalon. In some accounts, Ogier begets her two sons, including Marlyn (Meurvin); in the 14th-century \"Ly Myreur des Histor\" by Jean d'Outremeus, one of their sons is a giant. In the 13th-century \"chanson de geste\" of Huon of Bordeaux, she is a protector of the eponymous hero and the mother of the fairy king Oberon by none other than Julius Caesar. In \"Ogier le Danois,\" Morgan (\"Morgue la Fée\") lives in her palace in Avalon together with Arthur and Oberon, who both seem to her brothers. In another \"chanson de geste\", \"La Bataille Loquifer\" from the early 13th century, the fays Morgan and her sister Marsion (Marrion) bring the hero Renoart to Avalon, where Arthur is the king, and Renoart's union with Morgan gives him an illegitimate son named Corbon (Corbans). In the 14th-century Crusadic fantasy \"Le Bâtard de Bouillon\", the island kingdom of Arthur and his fairy sister Morgan (\"fée Morgue\") is hidden by a cloud in the Red Sea. The fairy queen Lady Morgan (Dame Morgue, Morgue li fee) also shows up in Adam de la Halle's late-13th-century French farce \"Jeu de la feuillée\", in which she visits a contemporary Arras.\n\nMorgan le Fay, or \"Fata Morgana\" in Italian, has been in particular associated with Sicily as a location of her enchanted realm in the mythological landscape of medieval Europe at least since the Norman conquest of southern Italy, and local folklore describes her as living in a magical castle located at or floating over Mount Etna. As such she gave her name to the form of mirage common off the shores of Sicily, the Fata Morgana, since the 14th century. References linking Avalon to Sicily can be found in \"Otia Imperialia\" (c. 1211) and \"La faula\", as well as in Breton and Provençal literature, for example in \"Jaufre\" and in \"La Bataille Loquifer\" (c. 1170). The 13th-century romance \"Floriant et Florete\" places Morgan's secret mountain castle of Mongibel (Montgibel or Montegibel, derived from the Arabic name for Etna), where, in the role of a fairy godmother, Morgan and two other fays spirit away and raises Floriant, a son of a murdered Sicilian king and the hero of the story. Floriant, with the help of her magic ship, eventually reunites with Morgan at her castle when he returns there with his wife Florete. The 15th-century French romance \"La Chevalier du Papegau\" (\"The Knight of the Parrot\") gives Morgaine the Fairy of Montgibel (\"Morgaine, la fée de Montgibel\", as she is also known in \"Floriant et Florete\") a sister known as the Lady Without Pride (\"la Dame sans Orgueil\"), whom Arthur saves from the evil Knight of the Wasteland.\n\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, Morgan has been primarily featured in relation to the cycle of epic poems of Orlando (based on Roland of the historical Charlemagne). In Matteo Maria Boiardo's late-15th century \"Orlando Innamorato\", fata Morgana (initially as lady Fortune) is beautiful but wicked fairy enchantress, a sister of King Arthur and a pupil of Merlin. Morgana lives in her paradise-like garden in a crystal cavern under a lake, plotting to eventually destroy the entire world. There, she abducts her favourites until she is thwarted by Orlando who defeats, chases and captures Morgana, destroying her underwater prison and letting her keep only one of her forced lovers, a knight named Ziliante. In Ludovico Ariosto's continuation of this tale, \"Orlando Furioso\" (1532), Morgana (also identified as Morgan Le Fay) is revealed as a twin sister of two other sorceresses, the good Logistilla and the evil Alcina; the latter appears after Orlando again defeats Morgana, rescuing Ziliante who has been turned into a dragon, and forces Morgana to swear by her lord Demogorgon to abandon her plots. It also features the medieval motif where she convinces Arthur of the infidelity of his queen (Geneura) using a magic horn, here successfully. Bernardo Tasso's \"L'Amadigi\" (1560) further introduces Morgana's three daughters: Carvilia, Morganetta, and Nivetta, themselves temptresses of knights. Morgan's other 16th-century appearances include these of Morgue la fée in François Rabelais' French satirical fantasy novel \"Les grandes chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua et il publie Pantagruel\" (1532) and of the good Morgana in Erasmo di Valvasone's Italian didactic poem \"La caccia\" (1591). In Edmund Spenser's epic poem \"The Faerie Queene\" (1590), Argante (Layamon's name for Morgan) is lustful giantess queen of the \"secret Ile\", evoking the story of Morgan's kidnapping of Sir Alexander. It also features three other counterpart characters: Acrasia, Duessa, and Malecasta, all representing different themes from Malory's description of Morgan. Morgan might have also inspired the characters of the healer Loosepaine and the fay Oriande in the 16th-century Scots poem \"Greysteil\".\n\nThe character Morgan le Fay has become ubiquitous in Arthurian works of the modern era, spanning fantasy, historical fiction and other genres across various mediums, especially since the mid-20th century. A dedicated article deals with the subject in detail, including listing many of her modern appearances.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3556298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3556298", "title": "Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya", "text": "Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya\n\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (, English: \"National Art Museum of Catalonia\"), abbreviated as MNAC, is the national museum of Catalan visual art located in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Situated on Montjuïc hill at the end of Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, near Pl Espanya, the museum is especially notable for its outstanding collection of romanesque church paintings, and for Catalan art and design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including modernisme and noucentisme. The museum is housed in the Palau Nacional, a huge, Italian-style building dating to 1929. The Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a national museum in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. That same year, a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.\n\nThe history of this institution dates back to the 19th century, when, in accordance with the principles that inspired Catalonia's cultural and political \"Renaixença\" (renaissance), a movement particularly active in that century, many projects were launched to help revive and conserve the country's artistic heritage. This process began with the establishment of the Museu d'Antiguitats de Barcelona (Barcelona Museum of Antiquities) in the Chapel of St Agatha (1880) and the Museu Municipal de Belles Arts (Municipal Fine Art Museum) in the Palau de Belles Arts (1891), a palace built to mark the occasion of the 1888 Universal Exhibition. A project to install all these Catalan art collections in the Palau Nacional, launched in 1934 under the initiative of Joaquim Folch i Torres, the first director of Catalonia Museum of Art, was frustrated by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), when for protection many works were transferred to Olot, Darnius and Paris (where an important exhibit was established). During the postwar period, the 19th- and 20th-century collections were installed in the Museu d'Art Modern, housed from 1945 to 2004 in the Arsenal building in Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella, whilst the Romanesque, Gothic and baroque collections were installed in the Palau in 1942.\n\nThe Palau Nacional, which has housed the Museu d'Art de Catalunya since 1934, was declared a \"national museum\" in 1990 under the Museums Law passed by the Catalan Government. In 1992 a thorough renovation process was launched to refurbish the site, based on plans drawn up by the architects Gae Aulenti and Enric Steegmann, who were later joined in the undertaking by Josep Benedito. The Oval Hall was reopened in 1992 on the occasion of the Olympic Games, and the various collections were installed and opened over the period from 1995 (when the Romanesque Art section was reopened) to 2004. The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (Museu Nacional) was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2004.\n\nSince 2004, the Palau Nacional has once more housed several magnificent art collections, mostly by Catalan art, but also Spanish and European art. The works from that first museum have now been enriched by new purchases and donations, tracing the country’s art history from early medieval times to the mid-20th century: from Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and baroque to modern art. This heritage is completed by the Gabinet Numismàtic de Catalunya (coin and medal collections), the Gabinet de Dibuixos i Gravats (drawings and engravings) and the library.\n\nIt is one of the most important and outstanding collections in the museum, due largely to the series of mural paintings it includes. Indeed, the Museu Nacional Romanesque Collection is unmatched by that of any other museum in the world. Many of the works here originally adorned rural churches in the Pyrenees and other sites in Old Catalonia, or \"Catalunya Vella\", as it is known; they began to be discovered and studied in the early 20th century, particularly after a Pyrenean expedition in 1907 by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Institute of Catalan Studies), which later published \"Les pintures murals catalanes\" (Catalan Mural Paintings). Years later, the news emerged that a group of foreign financiers and antiquarians had block-purchased most of these paintings to be taken to the United States of America. Although there were no laws in Spain at that time to forbid the expatriation of art, the Junta de Museus (Catalan Board of Museums) was able to successfully intervene in order to rescue, dismantle and transfer works to the Museum of Barcelona (1919–1923), then housed in the Parc de la Ciutadella, thus conserving and protecting these Romanesque works, considered a completely unique piece of art heritage and also a symbol of the birth and formation of Catalonia.\n\nThe Romanesque rooms are arranged in chronological and stylistic order, giving visitors a view of the different tendencies in Catalan Romanesque art and featuring works produced, for the most part, in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe visit to this section begins with the mural paintings from Sant Joan in Boí, which show clear stylistic influences from the French Carolingian tradition, and then continues with works showing the Italian influence that dominated painting from the late 11th century, doubtless as a result of the influence of the Gregorian Reform. This style is illustrated in such excellent works as the mural paintings from Sant Quirze de Pedret, Santa Maria d'Àneu and Sant Pere del Burgal.\n\nHowever, the rooms of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also feature a particularly outstanding example of European Romanesque art: the remarkable, original and extraordinarily expressive paintings from the Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll, including the famous Pantocrator or Christ in Majesty, an undisputed masterpiece from the 12th century that forms tangible evidence of the creative power of Catalan painting. Beside this superb piece stands another magnificent group of works, from Santa Maria de Taüll, the most important example of the interior of a Romanesque church painted throughout, with much of its decoration conserved today.\n\nThe Romanesque section ends with the paintings from San Pedro de Arlanza and the chapter house of Sigena. The latter features one of the most magnificent pictorial series in this new style, called 1200 art, which swept across Europe in the 13th century. The piece has been conserved in the museum since it was severely damaged by fire in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nRomanesque rooms also show the techniques that distinguished Catalan art at the time, such as panel painting, wood carving and others that help to complete our aesthetic vision of Romanesque, such as precious metalwork and carving stone.\n\nThe collection of panel paintings, unique in Europe, is another singular aspect of Romanesque painting, due both to the number and antiquity of the Catalan works conserved (the result of interest in the Romanesque since the late19th century) and to their quality and technical diversity. Particularly outstanding are the frontals of the Apostles (also known as the Frontal of La Seu d'Urgell), Alòs d'Isil, Avià and Cardet, which are rightly considered paradigms of an original pictorial technique, embodying enormous artistic interest. Moreover, the wood carving collection completes this wide-ranging summary of Romanesque art, featuring fine works of different types, such as Virgin of Ger, the Batlló Majesty and the carvings in the Erill la Vall Descent from the Cross.\n\nThere are also sculptures in stone that form part of the Museu Nacional Romanesque art collection, particularly a number of works from Ripoll and a large group of elements from ensembles in the city of Barcelona, including the refined marble capitals from the former Hospital de Sant Nicolau. Finally, the Romanesque section also features an important collection of enamels, mostly produced in Limoges, such as the Mondoñedo Crosier.\n\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Gothic art collection began to take shape in the early decades of the 19th century, when a movement was first launched to revive and conserve the important body of Catalan heritage, which had been seriously damaged in the wave of convent burnings that took place at around the time of the disentailment of church goods in the year 1835.\n\nThe Gothic collection features a considerable number of Catalan works accompanied, moreover, by an extraordinary selection of pieces from the other territories that were once ruled by the Crown of Aragon. As a whole, this section presents a broad, representative panoramic view of Gothic art produced in the three large peninsular territories that formed part of the kingdom of Aragon – Catalonia, Aragon itself, and Valencia – as well as a more anecdotal selection of works from Majorca.\n\nThe Gothic rooms display works from the late 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, arranged in chronological order, although the pieces are also grouped by school and typological affinity, and several thematic sections have been established. These include the renowned Mural paintings of the Conquest of Majorca, which preside over the first Gothic room. This same room also contains other works on profane themes or from secular sites, including elements from the enteixinats (coffered ceilings) of noble Barcelona houses to amatory caskets.\n\nOther works in this and the following rooms, from Castile, Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia, clearly illustrate the predominance of French Gothic models, which endured until the mid-14th century, when competition was finally offered by new Italianate models. This new style, developed in the Italy of Giotto, was adopted and adapted here, working a profound transformation in painting and sculpture not only in Catalonia, but throughout the reigns forming part of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nBesides a few Italian examples, the Museu Nacional also features an important selection of Italian, Catalan and Aragonese painting, such as the Triptych of Sant Vicenç d'Estopanyà, probably by an immigrant Italian artist, and altarpieces by the Serra brothers (the Serra family were highly influential in steering the course of Catalan painting during the closing decades of the 14th century). Sculpture during this period from the mid-14th century, was also influenced by Italian models, although the French Gothic style continued to exercise its authority. The collection includes works that may be attributed to some of the most outstanding sculptors of the time, such as Jaume Cascalls (see Head of Christ) and Bartomeu de Robió. Catalan sculpture in the late 14th century and the first half of the 15th is represented by two misericords from Barcelona Cathedral carved stalls by Pere Sanglada. From the 15th century, working in the new International Gothic style, Pere Oller and Pere Joan perhaps represent the peak of what was without doubt an important Catalan contribution to sculptural art.\n\nAmongst Catalan painters, Lluís Borrassà, Joan Mates, Bernat Martorell, Ramon de Mur and Joan Antigó are amongst the finest exponents of International Gothic, a style that also coincided with the period when Valencia was flourishing as a centre for art. Valencia is represented in the Museu Nacional by such outstanding artists as Gonçal Peris. The Gothic collection also features examples of painting from Aragon, another region that enjoyed considerable influence at this time. The exchange of influences continued, in both directions, during the period that followed when artistic representation became more realistic, and which took its initial inspiration from Jan van Eyck: the Valencian artist Lluís Dalmau painted the universally acclaimed Virgin of the Consellers whilst the Catalan Joan Reixac – whose work is well represented at the Museu Nacional – directed the most prolific workshop in Valencia. It was also after a period in Valencia that Jaume Huguet, the great Catalan painter working in the second half of the 15th century, made his residence definitively in Barcelona, establishing his dominance and setting up a school there. Complementing a generous selection of Huguet's works, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya also contains examples from artists active during the same period, such as Pere Garcia de Benabarre, who worked in both Aragon and Catalonia and created another successful formula based on similar cultural components.\n\nBesides this central strain in autochthonous painting, the panorama of Gothic art also features various other important episodes, such as the time spent by Antoine de Lonhy in Barcelona, or the later, longer residence in the Catalan capital of the Cordoban artist Bartolomé Bermejo, who had previously worked in Valencia and Aragon. This journey through the late 15th century continues with such Castilian painters as Fernando Gallego, along with others from Aragon, as Martín Bernat or Miguel Ximénez, and Valencia, principally Roderic d'Osona. Finally, mention the remarkable series of the organ shutters from the Cathedral of la Seu d'Urgell, painted at the end of the 20th century by an artist from Perpignan who is known by various names, including that of the Master of La Seu d'Urgell.\n\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Renaissance and baroque art collection comprises pieces of priceless cultural heritage that – unlike the collections at other great national museums in Europe, which were generally built up from royal and aristocratic collections – was established in Catalonia through the acquisition of local pieces and later complemented by donations and acquisitions from private galleries.\n\nThe itinerary begins with art from the Low Countries in the 16th century, in which religious fervour is mixed with detailed depiction of everyday life, as can be seen in the superb collection of panels and triptychs commissioned for private use. In Catalonia during the early Renaissance period, the Gothic forms are found alongside other, new stylistic solutions, as exemplified, for instance, in St Candidus, by Ayne Bru or St Blaise, by Pere Fernández, works imbued with the humanist feeling and influenced by the modern composition theories that were then emerging in Italy. In the Altarpiece of St Eligius of the Silversmiths, Pere Nunyes clearly shows the influence of this new language, as does the sculptor Damià Forment in his interpretation of the Apostles for the Dormition of the Virgin. Towards the end of the 16th century, Spanish painting produced many works of outstanding beauty, such as El Greco's \"The Bearing of the Cross\" and St Peter and St Paul, enriched by modern use of colour, the fruit of the lessons the artist had learned in Venice. In this age, the Ecce Homo, Luis de Morales, a contemporary of El Greco, Jacopo Tintoretto or The Bassano, masterfully conveyed the devotional spirit of the Counter-Reformation.\n\nThe 17th century begins with the frescoes in the Herrera Chapel by Annibale Carracci and collaborators, who decorated the Church of San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli in Rome, and continues with works by other Italian artists such as the Neapolitans Massimo Stanzione and Andrea Vaccaro. However, standing out above all these are the masterpieces from the masters of the Spanish Golden Age, such as the Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew by José de Ribera, known as Lo Spagnoletto, St Paul, by Diego Velázquez, and the Immaculate Conception and several still lifes by Francisco de Zurbarán. Returning to Catalonia, in his image of St Cajetan, the sculptor Andreu Sala reveals himself to be a worthy follower of the Italian genius Bernini.\n\nEntering now the 18th century, Antoni Viladomat's series of canvases devoted to the Life of St Francis, which decorated the main cloister of the former monastery of the Friars Minor in Barcelona, constitutes the only complete set of scenes from monastic life preserved in a museum. Finally, heralding the art forms that would develop in the 19th century, the daring works of Francesc Pla, known as \"El Vigatà\", illustrate the painterly freedom taken when decorating the interiors of seigniorial mansions belonging to the new, wealthy classes who had made their fortunes in trade and industry.\n\nThe collection, which reflects the taste of certain sections of society for Renaissance and Baroque art, features (exceptionally, if compared to the rest of the Museu Nacional collections) art produced not only in Catalonia, but also in the rest of Spain, Italy and Flanders, providing an overview of the development of European art during this period. Two later donations made important contributions to this more general vision: the Cambó Bequest and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection.\n\nThe collection of paintings that the Catalan politician and arts patron Francesc Cambó (1876–1947) built up with the intention of donating works by the great masters to complement the great medieval series in the Museu d'Art de Catalunya as it was then known, is the most valuable altruistic donation that the Museu Nacional has received in its history, and the one which has most served to enrich the body of Renaissance and Baroque works here.\n\nThe Cambó Bequest forms a collection of paintings embraces European painting history from the 14th to the early 20th century. It includes representative works of the Gothic and Renaissance periods, together with pieces that illustrate the perfection of the Italian Quattrocento, the sensuality of the great Venetian masters of the Cinquecento, the rising economic prosperity of the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th centuries and the magnificence of the Spanish Golden Age, without forgetting the richness of European Rococo. The artists represented at the Museu Nacional, thanks to this distinguished collection, include many outstanding, universally known names: great Italian painters such as Sebastiano dal Piombo, Tiziano Vecellio (Titian) and Giandomenico Tiepolo; superb exponents of the Flemish School in the form of Peter Paul Rubens and Lucas Cranach; Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Maurice Quentin de la Tour and their French rococo works; and, finally, Francisco de Goya, whose revolutionary genius rounds off the artistic journey embraced by the Cambó Bequest.\n\nWhen the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection was installed in the Palacio de Villahermosa in Madrid, and the state formalised the purchase in 1993, a number of the works – 72 paintings and 8 sculptures, mainly on religious themes, though also including several landscapes and portraits – were dispatched on permanent loan to Barcelona. In that same year, 1993, the permanent exhibition of these works was officially opened in a wing of Pedralbes Monastery, converted into a museum by Barcelona City Council. In 2004, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Foundation and the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya reached an agreement under which the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Barcelona was to be exhibited permanently at the Museu Nacional, with the dual purpose of complementing the content in the Catalan museum and making the works more widely known and appreciated.\n\nThe collection comprises paintings and sculptures spanning European art from the Gothic to the rococo period. There are many Italian works, including, most outstandingly, paintings by Fra Angelico, Pietro da Rimini, Taddeo Gaddi, Francesco del Cossa, Bernardino Butinone, Dosso Dossi, Titian, Ludovico Carracci, Tiepolo and Canaletto, among others. Particularly fine examples from the Flemish school are a painting by Petrus Paulus Rubens and a landscape by Salomon Jacobz van Ruysdael, whilst the Spanish Golden Age is represented by Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Mariana of Austria.\n\nThe Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya modern art collection owes its origins to the 1888 Universal Exhibition, when Barcelona City Council installed what was then a modest collection of contemporary (for the time) modern art in the Palau de Belles Arts. This original core of the collection was considerably expanded by acquisitions made by the Council at art exhibitions. As it stands at present, the modern art collection contains a selection of the finest Catalan art from the early 19th century until the 1940s.\n\nThe first part of this itinerary is devoted to the neoclassical, Romantic and realist movements. Among the most outstanding Catalan neoclassical artists represented here are the painter Josep Bernat Flaugier and the sculptor Damià Campeny. In terms of Romanticism, particular mention should be made of Nazarene painters such as Claudi Lorenzale, who focussed on the portrait most notably, and Lluís Rigalt, a precursor of the Catalan landscape tradition, which was continued (now entering the Realist period) by Ramon Martí Alsina, who introduced Courbet's ideas in Catalonia, and Joaquim Vayreda, founder of the Olot School, among others. Special mention should also be made of Marià Fortuny, Catalonia's finest 19th-century painter. Fortuny’s genre painting won him international acclaim, although towards the end of his short life he became interested in pictorial innovation, as can be seen in his last works. Also represented here are several painters who worked in the style of \"anecdotal realism\", including Romà Ribera and Francesc Masriera, and the \"Luminists\" of the Sitges School, disciples of Fortuny. Turning now to sculpture, the Vallmitjana brothers are the most outstanding exponents of the realist tradition. Finally, the section devoted to the 19th century also includes examples from early photographic art, featuring works by A. A. Disdéri, Jean Laurent, Le Jeune and Charles Clifford, among others, featuring images of different places from all over Spanish territory.\n\n\"Modernisme\" is a movement of enormous artistic and cultural importance in Catalonia, is one of the central themes in the Museu Nacional modern art collection. In painting, the works most clearly identified with this movement, infused with a spirit of renewal, are those by Ramon Casas and Santiago Rusiñol, whose Parisian paintings embrace certain elements from French Impressionism. Another important trend is Symbolism, represented here by the paintings of Alexandre de Riquer and Joan Brull, and also seen in certain photographs by the pictorialist Pere Casas Abarca. The second generation of Modernista artists are present in depth and number, too, with works by the likes of Isidre Nonell, Marià Pidelaserra, Ricard Canals, Hermen Anglada–Camarasa, Nicolau Raurich and Joaquim Mir, among others. It was these and other artists who helped to elevate Catalan painting to reach one of its most brilliant periods around the turn of the 20th century. The collection also includes works by Spanish painters, such as Julio Romero de Torres, Joaquim Sorolla, Ignacio Zuloaga, Darío de Regoyos and José Gutiérrez Solana, the photographer Ortiz-Echagüe and the French artists Boudin, Sisley and Rodin. Particularly interesting in the section devoted to Modernista sculpture are the works of Miquel Blay and Josep Llimona, who were clearly influenced by Rodin. The collection of Modernista decorative arts includes some exceptional examples of interior decorative art by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Gaspar Homar and Antoni Gaudí from, respectively, the Amatller, Lleó Morera and Batlló houses in Barcelona’s Passeig de Gràcia; objets d'art in various specialities, such as ironwork, ceramics, glasswork and jewellery; not forgetting several items of furniture by Joan Busquets and the architect Josep Maria Jujol.\n\nThe second movement richly represented in the Museu Nacional modern art collection is Noucentisme, which embodies the quest for the essential spirit of the Mediterranean. The movement is represented by the classical compositions of Joaquín Torres García and Joaquim Sunyer, vaguely influenced by Cézanne, and the sculptural nudes of Josep Clarà and Enric Casanovas. Completing this review of Noucentisme are the sculptures by Manolo Hugué and the paintings by Xavier Nogués, notably popular in tone. In around 1920, a new generation of artists emerged, one faced by the dilemma of either continuing in the figurative tradition or making the leap to the avant-garde. Some of these, such as the painters Josep de Togores and Francesc Domingo, produced work with a style of its own within the context of international realism, a movement that gained many followers between the wars. Others, such as Torres-García himself, Rafael Barradas and Salvador Dalí, found in the Galeries Dalmau the ideal gallery at which to show their more innovative works.\n\nThe historic avant-garde is very well represented, particularly in terms of sculpture, with works including impressive sculptures by Pablo Gargallo, Julio González and Leandre Cristòfol, whilst in painting the most exceptional figure is Pablo Picasso, represented in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collection since 2007.\n\nTurning now to the field of photography, we should mention such avant-garde artists as Josep Masana, Josep Batlles, Pere Català Pic and Emili Godes, as well as Agustí Centelles for his important graphic work documenting the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by Otho Lloyd and Joaquim Gomis, whose pioneering work found its continuation in the Neorealists Francesc Català-Roca, Joan Colom, Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, among others.\n\nIn late 2004, to mark the opening of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the museum received a score of Catalan art works from the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza collection. In view of the wealth and heterogeneity of this collection, the works loaned to the Museu Nacional focus more on diversity than on unity of discourse, with the object of giving an idea, if overly concise, of the plurality of this collection.\n\nThe chronological period covered by this section spans from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, one of the most brilliant moments in the history of Catalan art. Notable amongst the 19th-century pieces is Marià Fortuny’s Bullfight, Wounded Picador, painted in 1867. As regards the Modernista movement, several of the most important artists from this period are represented, featuring \"Open-Air Interior\" (1892) and \"Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem\" (1897), both by Ramon Casas; Le Paon Blanc by Hermen Anglada-Camarasa; and \"The Cathedral of the Poor\" (in which the Church of the Sagrada Familia, under construction, is seen in the background) and The Abyss. \"Majorca\" (1901–1904) by Joaquim Mir. Equally noteworthy is the presence of Noucentisme, a movement deeply rooted in Catalonia, with paintings by Joaquim Torres-García and Joaquim Sunyer, as well as works by younger artists who continued the Noucentista spirit. Finally, this journey through the history of Catalan modern art leads to the acclaimed Antoni Tàpies.\n\nThe collections assembled from the museum's historic holdings to form the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya Cabinet of Drawings and Prints comprise some 50,000 drawings, 70,000 engravings and more than 1,000 posters. The founds combine to offer a rich and wide-ranging journey through the most important movements in the history of Catalan art, particularly since the late 18th century, thanks largely to the establishment in Barcelona in 1775 of the Free School of Design and the Fine Arts. Popularly known as \"La Llotja\", this school quickly became a reference point in the consolidation of the academic style in Catalonia. Representing the period from Neoclassicism to Realism, the Museu Nacional collections of works on paper feature a considerable number of pieces by artists linked to the school in the 19th century, including Josep Bernat Flaugier, Vicent Rodés, Claudi Lorenzale and Ramon Martí Alsina, as well as others by members of certain families, such as the Planella and the Rigalt lineages, who produced various generations of artists. From the preceding periods, we should highlight in particular the contribution made by the most outstanding Catalan baroque painter, Antoni Viladomat, who is represented by many works in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. As recently as 2003, moreover, the collection was enhanced by the acquisition of a group of Catalan baroque altar works from César Martinell's unique collection, which provide an interesting view of Catalan altarpiece art in the 17th and 18th centuries. \nHowever, there can be no doubt that one of the true highlights of these collections is the important body of works by Marià Fortuny, which include more than 1,500 drawings and 50 engravings, making the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints an essential reference for reconstructing the creative trajectory of this great 19th-century artist. From the same period, moreover, are more than 30 drawings by the history painter Eduardo Rosales, acquired in 1912, and linked to two of his finest and most characteristic historic compositions: \"The Testament of Queen Isabella the Catholic\" and \"the Death of Lucrecia\".\n\nThe Modernista and noucentista movements are also widely represented in the Cabinet holdings. The collections include more than 600 Modernista posters by renowned Catalan and foreign artists. Among the most impressive are those by Ramon Casas, one of the most illustrious of all Modernista artists. Particularly mention should be made of the famous series of charcoal sketches, a veritable portrait gallery of the leading personalities of the era in Catalonia, and which Casas himself donated to the museum in 1909. Turning now to the noucentista movement, we should draw attention in particular to Isidre Nonell, represented in the Cabinet by some 150 pieces.\n\nNor should we forget the collection of posters from the same period, largely acquired by the museum from Lluís Plandiura in 1903. Comprising more than 500 pieces among which foreign artists are also well represented, this invaluable legacy constitutes an incomparable resource for tracing the history of poster art in Catalonia.\n\nFinally, though the collection is rather uneven here, mention should be made of the printed works from the avant-garde movement. The sculptor Juli González is one of the avant-garde artists most amply represented in the Cabinet, thanks to the donation of more than 150 drawings made by his daughter in 1972. On the other hand, the presence of certain great contemporary creative artists such as Dalí and Miró, to mention but two, is little more than anecdotal.\n\nTwo acquisitions made by the old Museums Board were fundamental to forming the collections contained in the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints. The first was the collection of literary and art critic Raimon Casellas, in 1911; the second, that of Modernista artist Alexandre de Riquer, ten years later.\n\nThe collections of the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, established in 1932, now comprises more than 134,000 pieces. This rich holding is the result of a long process of acquisition by purchase, donation, legacy or deposit, which began in the first half of the 19th century and continues even today.\n\nThe coin collection comprises nearly 100,000 pieces, including examples from the main series minted from the 6th century BC to the present. The most important and interesting amongst these are, without doubt, the coins produced in Catalonia, which include many extremely rare and unique pieces. The visit to the Numismatic Cabinet begins with the series of ancient coinage, outstanding among which are those minted on the Iberian Peninsula. These include such important pieces as the coins from the Greek colonies of Emporion and Rhode and the treasure of 897 silver pieces found at the neapolis of Emporion. Dating back to the transition period between the ancient and medieval worlds is the collection of Visigoth coins, including some minted at workshops in Catalan territory, such as Barcino, Tarraco or Gerunda. Practically all the western European kingdoms are represented in the medieval Christian series, although the collections of coins from Catalonia and Aragon are the most notable. They include examples that illustrate, step by step, the historic and economic evolution of these lands. For example, the economic growth that Catalonia enjoyed in the 13th century is reflected in the minting in Barcelona for the first time of silver Peter II Croats. Finally, among the coins minted in the modern and contemporary periods, we should mention particularly those produced in Catalonia during three important historic periods: the Reapers War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the French occupation.\n\nThe medals collection is formed by more than 9,000 pieces, which range from the earliest, struck in Italy in the second half of the 15th century, to the present. The greater part of this collection is made up of works produced in Spain, mostly by well-known artists and engravers, who created medals of the highest quality. For example, the Museu Nacional medals collection features works by such outstanding 18th-century master engravers as Tomás Francisco Prieto and Gerónimo Antonio Gil. During the late 19th century, moreover, particularly after the 1888 Barcelona Exhibition, many Modernista sculptors turned to the art of medal-making, and the examples in the Cabinet fully reflect what was a splendid creative period for the genre, particularly in Catalonia. The leading artist in the field was, without doubt, Eusebi Arnau, but such sculptors as Parera, Blay, Llimona and Gargallo also created medals of the highest quality.\n\nThe central core of the MNC paper money collection, which embraces a wide range of documents of different types, is formed by its 4,100 examples of banknotes. These include the Spanish series containing all the banknotes issued by the Bank of Spain from 1874 to the present, as well as the series of paper money printed by the Catalan Government and local authorities in the country during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe Cabinet also exhibits a range of different pieces of interest due to their direct or indirect connection with numismatics. These include, amongst other things, tools used for minting coin, coin weights, scales, jettons (counters), pellofes and other types of tokens, stamps, medals and various documentary collections.\n\nThe National Palau of Montjuïc, known as \"Palau Nacional\" was constructed between 1926 and 1929, with the goal of being the main building of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, holding an Exhibition of Spanish Art named \"El Arte en España\" (The Art of Spain). More than 5,000 works came to the Exhibition from across Spain.\n\nThe Palau Nacional is a huge building (over ) which embodies the academic classical style that predominated in constructions for all the universal exhibitions of the period. Its façade is crowned by a great dome inspired by St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City in Rome, flanked by two smaller domes, while four towers modelled on Santiago de Compostela Cathedral stand at the corners of the so-called Sala Oval, or Oval Hall. This great space (2,300 m2), used as the venue for important civic and cultural events, is encircled by tiered seating, preceded by double columns; it also houses a monumental organ, one of the biggest in Europe, waiting for an important restoration work. Many of the most outstanding painters and sculptors of the day, for the most part followers of the Noucentista aesthetic and cultural movement, were commissioned to decorate the interior of the Palau. Entrance from the front is by a huge staircase leading up from Avinguda de la Reina Maria Cristina, flanked halfway by magnificent monumental illuminated fountains designed by Carles Buïgas.\nThe first projects to develop the slopes of Montjuïc, turning the mountain into the city's \"green lung\" and a leisure activity centre for the people of Barcelona, date back to the early 20th century. However, these ideas were given decisive momentum when Montjuïc was chosen as the site for the great International Exhibition organised by the city in 1929. The renowned Modernisme architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch was commissioned to direct the urban development and architectural aspects of this project, and Juan Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí landscaped the gardens. Under these plans, the Palau Nacional was to be the central palace for the exhibition. In 1923, the dictator Primo de Rivera seized power, with the result that Puig i Cadafalch was removed from the project. A competition to design and build the Palau Nacional was then won by the architects Eugenio P. Cendoya, Enric Catà and Pere Domènech i Roura. The palace was to provide the central venue for a great exhibition entitled Art in Spain and featuring original works and reproductions representing the history of Spanish art, complemented by two extensions: the Poble Espanyol (Spanish Village) architectural site, still open today, and the Palau d'Art Modern (Palace of Modern Art), which was later demolished.\n\nIn the area around the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya site, moreover, many of the buildings erected for the 1929 International Exhibition remain, whilst others have also been established. All these different elements form a complex that has become one of the most attractive cultural, commercial and leisure centres in the city. The outstanding buildings dating from the time of the International Exhibition include the pavilions housing the Barcelona Trade Fair (Fira de Barcelona), the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, refurbished for the 1992 Games, the Poble Espanyol and the Teatre Grec, a Greek amphitheatre built in a disused quarry. This gives its name to Barcelona’s summer arts festival (GREC).\n\nThe library is the most important documentation centre open to the public. Its origins go back to the books referred to by museum technicians in Barcelona when preparing for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. In the early 20th century, the Junta de Museus (Museums Board) decided that the library should be opened to the public, and decisive impetus was given to this initiative when the Special Committee for the Library was set up in 1907. From that year onwards, the library holdings were constantly enriched by legacies and donations from important private libraries.\n\nThe Museu Nacional Library collections comprise domestic and foreign books and magazines on different aspects of art: monographic works on art and artists; photography; numismatics; local history; a reserve section containing a collection of manuscripts; incunabula such as the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle; works published pre 1900; and the books of artists and collector’s editions. Sections of particular interest include that devoted to exhibition catalogues, established in 1913 and containing printed matter on shows held at galleries in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain and even further afield, and ‘The Press’, established in 1968, which brings together news items published in the daily media and of interest to the artworld.\n\nIt is thanks to the Museu Nacional publications policy, that many of these works were acquired – it aims to promote exchanges and so provide the library with copies of works published by museums and art centres all over the world.\n\nThe library facilities are designed to provide Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya technical staff, researchers, students, art professionals and all individuals interested in the art world with all the information they seek. The reading room provides access to the library catalogue, the Collective Catalogue of Universities (CCUC), several databases (Princeton University, Index of Christian Art; Bibliography of the History of Art; Art Price), and to databases available on CD-ROM and Internet.\n\nAnother important element in the Museu Nacional organisational structure is the archive, founded as a department in 1995 to standardise management of the museum’s documentary collections. With regard to the origin of these collections, the archive contains both documentation generated by the museum since 1991, when the consortium was set up, and historic documents from institutions that now form part of the Museu Nacional: the Museu d'Art de Catalunya (Art Museum of Catalonia), the Museu d'Art Modern (Museum of Modern Art), the Cabinet of Drawings and Prints, the Numismatic Cabinet of Catalonia, and the Library of Art History.\n\nThe archive also conserves invaluable historic documentation in the form of the collections built up by different organising committees for fine art exhibitions (1891–1946). Here, too, are other historic resources related to the world of art and deposited in the museum over the years.\n\nFinally, the archive also contains a section devoted to the image, comprising some 350,000 audiovisual documents, mainly photographs, on different supports and in a variety of formats.\n\nThe \"Museus secció\" are part of Museu Nacional but they go under an independent management and ownership is on the respective councils. Currently three entities comprise:\n\n\nOne of the other aspects of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has an educational service itself, which offers several resources for learning and services tailored to different audiences. Among others, a program is the museum common space of integration aimed at people at risk of exclusion and use the museum as a key integrator and software \"Museum hosts\", aimed at integrating with other training projects related to art.\n\nAnother of the best known proposals is \"Museum as an integration space\" (\"El Museu espai comú d'integració\", in Catalan), and also \"A hand of stories\" (\"Una Ma de Contes\"), a joint initiative between Televisió de Catalunya and Museu Nacional, which explains 20 short stories representing 20 paintings of Museu Nacional permanent collection, with a different look.\n\nThere are also activities which are encouraged in the relationship between children and artists active. They participated in activities such contemporary artists as Philip Stanton Gino Rubert or Lluïsa Jover.\n\nThe aim of the Department of the Restoration and Preventive Conservation is to ensure the conservation of all the works in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya collections. The Department helps to guarantee the physical conservation of all the museum’s holdings, including both works on exhibition and in storage, on deposit or on loan, whilst also seeking to delay as far as possible the ageing process that affects the materials that form the artworks. In addition, the Restoration and Preventive Conservation Department also studies the materials and the technical aspects of works with a view to providing scientific and technical assistance for art historians specialising in different periods, promoting dialogue and interdisciplinary studies.\n\nAt the centre, professionals from different specialist disciplines study problems affecting the works, or changes they are undergoing, determining the causes of deterioration and doing their utmost to eliminate any risk to the works. In this regard, a key aim is to create a stable environment and to establish the best conditions for exhibiting, storing, handling, packing and transporting works. The centre seeks to minimise deterioration to the collections by ensuring that the most appropriate environmental conditions and exhibition systems are provided, as well as exercising strict control over the movement of objects and the restoration treatments applied to individual works.\n\nMost of the activity at the centre is concerned with prevention, but due importance is also attached to reparative treatment and restoration. Restoration work is aimed at improving the aesthetic reading of pieces on which, very often, restorers from much earlier generations have previously intervened, working according to criteria very different from those applied today. Needless to say, restoration is not carried out in the hope of returning works to their original state; but rather, to take into account the passing of time and any work that has already been carried out on the piece, and which now forms part of the history of restoration in Catalonia in general.\n\nThe center exists due to the impulse that Joaquim Folch i Torres gave to the project when he sent Manuel Grau i Mas in Milan with the objective that was formed by the hand of Mauro Pelliccioli, then director of the restoration laboratories in Milan, attached to the Pinacoteca di Brera art gallery. The Milan laboratories had a decisive influence on how restoration work was carried out all over Europe. Work continues today with a view to establishing the Museu Nacional Department of Restoration and Preventive Conservation as a reference and resource, which may operate separately from the museum itself, in terms both of the working methodologies and the rigour and the criteria that the centre applies.\n\nThe centre is staffed by scientific personnel devoted to preventive conservation and chemical laboratory work, and by a team of curators and restorers specialising in various disciplines, in accordance with the types of works that form the museum collections: restoration of paint on canvas and transferred painted murals; paint on wooden panels; polychrome wood sculpture; furniture; artwork on paper and photography; and stone, metal and ceramic.\n\nList of Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya directors since its foundation \n\n\n\n"}

The party leader anticipated economic crisis in the country which he felt would set up the basis for a takeover by revolutionary nationalism. Biondini is a veteran of the international neo-nazi scene, having established a group called \"Alerta Nacional\" in 1984, which he described as 'a small part of the great worldwide socialist movement'. This group has attempted to build links between the country's various extreme right groups.\n\nThe party was re-launched as the New Triumph Party in November 1997, identifying itself as 'the political, militant and electoral expression of Argentine national socialism'. At a time when use of the internet by fringe political groups was limited but growing in popularity the New Triumph Party's online publication \"Libertad de Opinión\" broke new ground in Argentina by providing a regular forum for Argentine neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism. Ricardo Brinzoni was briefly associated with the group as his lawyer Juan Enrique Torres Bande was a member.\n\nThe party has consistently attempted to gain legal recognition but has been rejected. Nonetheless in the Argentine legislative election, 2005 two members of the party, Biondini's wife and son, featured as candidates for \"Acción Ciudadana\", a group headed by Jorge Colotto, the general commissioner of the Policía Federal Argentina.\n\nThe party supports Neo-Nazism and seeks to use Argentina as the new Nazi base. It has been claimed that Biondini believes that Adolf Hitler had identified Argentina as the future of Nazism. He has claimed that in the final days in the \"Führerbunker\" Hitler pointed to Argentina on a map and stated that 'from there the new leader will come'.\n\nThe party has also been vocal in its criticism of the major political parties and leaders, denouncing Fernando de la Rúa as a puppet of the Zionist Occupation Government. As part of this rhetoric it also emphasises its grounding in Christianity.\n\nThe ideas of the party have been summed up by them in declaration of policies which states five aims for the Argentine people.

{"id": "21541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21541", "title": "Nicene Creed", "text": "Nicene Creed\n\nThe Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: ) is a statement of belief widely used in Christian liturgy. It is called \"Nicene\" because it was originally adopted in the city of Nicaea (present day İznik, Turkey) by the First Council of Nicaea in 325. In 381, it was amended at the First Council of Constantinople, and the amended form is referred to as the Nicene or the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian churches use this profession of faith with the verbs in the original plural (\"we believe\"), but the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches convert those verbs to the singular (\"I believe\"). The Anglican and many Protestant denominations generally use the singular form, sometimes the plural.\n\nThe earlier Apostles' Creed is also used in the Latin West, but not in the Eastern liturgies. On Sundays and solemnities, one of these two creeds is recited in the Roman Rite Mass after the homily. The Nicene Creed is also part of the profession of faith required of those undertaking important functions within the Catholic Church.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, the Nicene Creed is sung or recited at the Divine Liturgy, immediately preceding the Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer), and is also recited daily at compline.\n\nThe purpose of a creed is to provide a doctrinal statement of correct belief or orthodoxy. The creeds of Christianity have been drawn up at times of conflict about doctrine: acceptance or rejection of a creed served to distinguish believers and deniers of particular doctrines. For that reason, a creed was called in Greek a σύμβολον (\"symbolon\"), which originally meant half of a broken object which, when fitted to the other half, verified the bearer's identity. The Greek word passed through Latin \"symbolum\" into English \"symbol\", which only later took on the meaning of an outward sign of something.\n\nThe Nicene Creed was adopted to resolve the Arian controversy, whose leader, Arius, a clergyman of Alexandria, \"objected to Alexander's (the bishop of the time) apparent carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation\". In reply, Alexander accused Arius of denying the divinity of the Son and also of being too \"Jewish\" and \"Greek\" in his thought. Alexander and his supporters created the Nicene Creed to clarify the key tenets of the Christian faith in response to the widespread adoption of Arius' doctrine, which was henceforth marked as heresy.\n\nThe Nicene Creed of 325 explicitly affirms the co-essential divinity of the Son, applying to him the term \"consubstantial\". The 381 version speaks of the Holy Spirit as worshipped and glorified with the Father and the Son. The later Athanasian Creed (not used in Eastern Christianity) describes in much greater detail the relationship between Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The earlier Apostles' Creed does not explicitly affirm the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit, but in the view of many who use it, this doctrine is implicit in it.\n\nThe original Nicene Creed was first adopted in 325 at the First Council of Nicaea. At that time, the text ended with the words \"We believe in the Holy Spirit\", after which various anathemas against Arian propositions were added.\n\nF. J. A. Hort and Adolf Harnack argued that the Nicene creed was the local creed of Caesarea (an important center of Early Christianity) recited in the council by Eusebius of Caesarea. Their case relied largely on a very specific interpretation of Eusebius' own account of the Council's proceedings. More recent scholarship has not been convinced by their arguments. The large number of secondary divergences from the text of the creed quoted by Eusebius make it unlikely that it was used as a starting point by those who drafted the conciliar creed. Their initial text was probably a local creed from a Syro–Palestinian source into which they awkwardly inserted phrases to define the Nicene theology. The Eusebian Creed may thus have been either a second or one of many nominations for the Nicene Creed.\n\nSoon after the Council of Nicaea, new formulae of faith were composed, most of them variations of the Nicene Symbol, to counter new phases of Arianism. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" identifies at least four before the Council of Sardica (341), where a new form was presented and inserted in the Acts of the Council, though it was not agreed on.\n\nWhat is known as the \"Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed\" or the \"Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed\" received this name because of a belief that it was adopted at the Second Ecumenical Council held in Constantinople in 381 as a modification of the original Nicene Creed of 325. In that light, it also came to be very commonly known simply as the \"Nicene Creed\". It is the only authoritative \"ecumenical\" statement of the Christian faith accepted by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and the major Protestant denominations. (The Apostles' and Athanasian creeds are not as widely accepted.)\n\nIt differs in a number of respects, both by addition and omission, from the creed adopted at the First Council of Nicaea. The most notable difference is the additional section \"And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who proceedeth from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the prophets. And [we believe] in one, holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins, [and] we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, scholars have questioned the traditional explanation of the origin of this creed, which has been passed down in the name of the council, whose official acts have been lost over time. A local council of Constantinople in 382 and the third ecumenical council (Ephesus, 431) made no mention of it, with the latter affirming the 325 creed of Nicaea as a valid statement of the faith and using it to denounce Nestorianism. Though some scholarship claims that hints of the later creed's existence are discernible in some writings, no extant document gives its text or makes explicit mention of it earlier than the fourth ecumenical council at Chalcedon in 451. Many of the bishops of the 451 council themselves had never heard of it and initially greeted it skeptically, but it was then produced from the episcopal archives of Constantinople, and the council accepted it \"not as supplying any omission but as an authentic interpretation of the faith of Nicaea\". In spite of the questions raised, it is considered most likely that this creed was in fact adopted at the 381 second ecumenical council.\n\nOn the basis of evidence both internal and external to the text, it has been argued that this creed originated not as an editing of the original Creed proposed at Nicaea in 325, but as an independent creed (probably an older baptismal creed) modified to make it more like the Nicene Creed. Some scholars have argued that the creed may have been presented at Chalcedon as \"a precedent for drawing up new creeds and definitions to supplement the Creed of Nicaea, as a way of getting round the ban on new creeds in Canon 7 of Ephesus\". It is generally agreed that the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed is not simply an expansion of the Creed of Nicaea, and was probably based on another traditional creed independent of the one from Nicaea.\n\nThe third Ecumenical Council (Council of Ephesus of 431) reaffirmed the original 325 version of the Nicene Creed and declared that \"it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different () faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicaea\" (i.e., the 325 creed). The word is more accurately translated as used by the Council to mean \"different\", \"contradictory\", rather than \"another\". This statement has been interpreted as a prohibition against changing this creed or composing others, but not all accept this interpretation. This question is connected with the controversy whether a creed proclaimed by an Ecumenical Council is definitive in excluding not only excisions from its text but also additions to it.\n\nIn one respect, the Eastern Orthodox Church's received text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed differs from the earliest text, which is included in the acts of the Council of Chalcedon of 451: The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the singular forms of verbs such as \"I believe\", in place of the plural form (\"we believe\") used by the council. Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches use exactly the same form of the Creed, since the Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong to add \"and the Son\" to the Greek verb \"ἐκπορευόμενον\", though correct to add it to the Latin \"qui procedit\", which does not have precisely the same meaning. The form generally used in Western churches does add \"and the Son\" and also the phrase \"God from God\", which is found in the original 325 Creed.\n\nThe following table, which indicates by [square brackets] the portions of the 325 text that were omitted or moved in 381, and uses \"italics\" to indicate what phrases, absent in the 325 text, were added in 381, juxtaposes the earlier (AD 325) and later (AD 381) forms of this Creed in the English translation given in Philip Schaff's compilation \"The Creeds of Christendom\" (1877).\n\nThe differences between the actual wordings (in Greek) adopted in 325 and in 381 can be presented in a similar way, as follows:\n\nIn the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the words \"and from the Son\" (\"Filioque\") to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII of the Third Ecumenical Council, since the words were not included in the text by either the Council of Nicaea or that of Constantinople. This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014. \"Filioque\" eventually became one of the main causes for the East-West Schism in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.\n\nThe Vatican stated in 1995 that, while the words καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ (\"and the Son\") would indeed be heretical if used with the Greek verb ἐκπορεύομαι—which is one of the terms used by St. Gregory of Nazianzus and the one adopted by the Council of Constantinople—the word \"Filioque\" is not heretical when associated with the Latin verb \"procedo\" and the related word \"processio.\" Whereas the verb ἐκπορεύομαι (from ἐκ, \"out of\" and πορεύομαι \"to come or go\") in Gregory and other Fathers necessarily means \"to originate from a cause or principle,\" the Latin term \"procedo\" (from \"pro\", \"forward;\" and \"cedo\", \"to go\") has no such connotation and simply denotes the communication of the Divine Essence or Substance. In this sense, \"processio\" is similar in meaning to the Greek term προϊέναι, used by the Fathers from Alexandria (especially Cyril of Alexandria) as well as others. Partly due to the influence of the Latin translations of the New Testament (especially of John 15:26), the term ἐκπορευόμενον (the present participle of ἐκπορεύομαι) in the creed was translated into Latin as \"procedentem\". In time, the Latin version of the Creed came to be interpreted in the West in the light of the Western concept of \"processio\", which required the affirmation of the \"Filioque\" to avoid the heresy of Arianism.\n\nThe view that the Nicene Creed can serve as a touchstone of true Christian faith is reflected in the name \"symbol of faith\", which was given to it in Greek and Latin, when in those languages the word \"symbol\" meant a \"token for identification (by comparison with a counterpart)\".\n\nIn the Roman Rite Mass, the Latin text of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, with \"Deum de Deo\" (God from God) and \"Filioque\" (and from the Son), phrases absent in the original text, was previously the only form used for the \"profession of faith\". The Roman Missal now refers to it jointly with the Apostles' Creed as \"the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed\", describing the second as \"the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed\".\n\nThe liturgies of the ancient Churches of Eastern Christianity (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, Church of the East and the Eastern Catholic Churches), use the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, never the Western Apostles' Creed.\nWhile in certain places where the Byzantine Rite is used, the choir or congregation sings the Creed at the Divine Liturgy, in many places the Creed is typically recited by the cantor, who in this capacity represents the whole congregation although many, and sometimes all, members of the congregation may join in rhythmic recitation. Where the latter is the practice, it is customary to invite, as a token of honor, any prominent lay member of the congregation who happens to be present, e.g., royalty, a visiting dignitary, the Mayor, etc., to recite the Creed in lieu of the cantor. This practice stems from the tradition that the prerogative to recite the Creed belonged to the Emperor, speaking for his populace.\n\nSome evangelical and other Christians consider the Nicene Creed helpful and to a certain extent authoritative, but not infallibly so in view of their belief that only Scripture is truly authoritative. Non-Trinitarian groups, such as the Church of the New Jerusalem, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, explicitly reject some of the statements in the Nicene Creed.\n\nThere are several designations for the two forms of the Nicene creed, some with overlapping meanings:\n\nIn musical settings, particularly when sung in Latin, this Creed is usually referred to by its first word, \"Credo\".\n\nThis section is not meant to collect the texts of all liturgical versions of the Nicene Creed, and provides only three, the Greek, the Latin, and the Armenian, of special interest. Others are mentioned separately, but without the texts. All ancient liturgical versions, even the Greek, differ at least to some small extent from the text adopted by the First Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople. The Creed was originally written in Greek, owing to the location of the two councils.\n\nBut though the councils' texts have \"Πιστεύομεν ... ὁμολογοῦμεν ... προσδοκοῦμεν\" (\"we\" believe ... confess ... await), the Creed that the Churches of Byzantine tradition use in their liturgy has \"Πιστεύω ... ὁμολογῶ ... προσδοκῶ\" (\"I\" believe ... confess ... await), accentuating the personal nature of recitation of the Creed. The Latin text, as well as using the singular, has two additions: \"Deum de Deo\" (God from God) and \"Filioque\" (and from the Son). The Armenian text has many more additions, and is included as showing how that ancient church has chosen to recite the Creed with these numerous elaborations of its contents.\n\nAn English translation of the Armenian text is added; English translations of the Greek and Latin liturgical texts are given at English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use.\n\nThe Latin text adds \"Deum de Deo\" and \"Filioque\" to the Greek. On the latter see The Filioque Controversy above. Inevitably also, the overtones of the terms used, such as \"\" (pantokratora) and \"omnipotentem\" differ (\"pantokratora\" meaning Ruler of all; \"omnipotentem\" meaning omnipotent, Almighty). The implications of this for the interpretation of \"\" and \"qui ... procedit\" was the object of the study \"The Greek and the Latin Traditions regarding the Procession of the Holy Spirit\" published by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in 1996.\n\nAgain, the terms \"\" and \"consubstantialem\", translated as \"of one being\" or \"consubstantial\", have different overtones, being based respectively on Greek (stable being, immutable reality, substance, essence, true nature), and Latin \"substantia\" (that of which a thing consists, the being, essence, contents, material, substance).\n\n\"Credo\", which in classical Latin is used with the accusative case of the thing held to be true (and with the dative of the person to whom credence is given), is here used three times with the preposition \"in\", a literal translation of the Greek \"\" (in unum Deum ..., in unum Dominum ..., in Spiritum Sanctum ...), and once in the classical preposition-less construction (unam, sanctam, catholicam et apostolicam Ecclesiam).\n\nEnglish translation of the Armenian version\n\nThe version in the Church Slavonic language, used by several Eastern Orthodox Churches is practically identical with the Greek liturgical version.\n\nThis version is used also by some Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches. Although the Union of Brest excluded addition of the \"Filioque\", this was sometimes added by Ruthenian Catholics, whose older liturgical books also show the phrase in brackets, and by Ukrainian Catholics. Writing in 1971, the Ruthenian Scholar Fr. Casimir Kucharek noted, \"In Eastern Catholic Churches, the \"Filioque\" may be omitted except when scandal would ensue. Most of the Eastern Catholic Rites use it.\" However, in the decades that followed 1971 it has come to be used more rarely.\n\nThe versions used by Oriental Orthodoxy and the Church of the East differ from the Greek liturgical version in having \"We believe\", as in the original text, instead of \"I believe\".\n\nThe version found in the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\" is still commonly used by some English speakers, but more modern translations are now more common. The International Consultation on English Texts published an English translation of the Nicene Creed, first in 1970 and then in successive revisions in 1971 and 1975. These texts were adopted by several churches. The Roman Catholic Church in the United States, which adopted the 1971 version in 1973, and the Catholic Church in other English-speaking countries, which in 1975 adopted the version published in that year, continued to use them until 2011, when it replaced them with the version in the \"Roman Missal third edition\". The 1975 version was included in the 1979 Episcopal Church (United States) \"Book of Common Prayer\", but with one variation: in the line \"For us men and for our salvation\", it omitted the word \"men\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "529975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529975", "title": "Rating percentage index", "text": "Rating percentage index\n\nThe rating percentage index, commonly known as the RPI, is a quantity used to rank sports teams based upon a team's wins and losses and its strength of schedule. It is one of the sports rating systems by which NCAA basketball, baseball, softball, hockey, soccer, lacrosse, and volleyball teams are ranked. This system was in use in Division I men's college basketball from 1981 through 2018 to aid in the selecting and seeding of teams appearing in the men's playoffs (see March Madness), and has been used in the women's tournament since its inception in 1982.\n\nDuring the 2018 offseason, the NCAA announced that the RPI would no longer be used in the selection process for the Division I men's basketball tournament. Effective immediately, it was replaced with the NCAA Evaluation Tool (NET). This new metric will initially be used only by the Division I men's selection committee—the Division I women's basketball committee, plus all other NCAA selection committees, continue to use their own versions of the RPI.\n\nIn its current formulation, the index comprises a team's winning percentage (25%), its opponents' winning percentage (50%), and the winning percentage of those opponents' opponents (25%). The opponents' winning percentage and the winning percentage of those opponents' opponents both comprise the strength of schedule (SOS). Thus, the SOS accounts for 75% of the RPI calculation and is 2/3 its opponents' winning percentage and 1/3 its opponents' opponents' winning percentages.\n\nThe RPI lacks theoretical justification from a statistical standpoint. Other ranking systems which include the margin of victory of games played or other statistics in addition to the win/loss results have been shown to be a better predictor of the outcomes of future games. However, because the margin of victory has been manipulated in the past by teams or individuals in the context of gambling, the RPI can be used to mitigate motivation for such manipulation.\n\nSome feel that the heavy emphasis upon strength of schedule gives an unfair advantage to teams from major conferences. Teams from \"majors\" are allowed to pick many of their non-conference opponents (often blatantly weaker teams). Teams from minor conferences, however, may only get one or two such opponents in their schedules. Also, some mid-major conferences regularly compel their member teams to schedule opponents ranked in the top half of the RPI, which could boost the strength of that conference and/or its tougher-scheduling teams. In basketball, the Missouri Valley Conference has successfully done this: It has become one of the top-rated RPI conferences, despite having very few of its teams ranked in the two national Top 25 polls. In 2006, the NCAA began to release its RPI calculations weekly starting in January. Independent sources, such as ESPN or CNN/SI, also publish their own RPI calculations, which are updated more frequently.\n\nThe current and commonly used formula for determining the RPI of a college basketball team at any given time is as follows.\n\nRPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)\n\nwhere WP is Winning Percentage, OWP is Opponents' Winning Percentage and OOWP is Opponents' Opponents' Winning Percentage.\n\nThe WP is calculated by taking a team's wins divided by the number of games it has played (i.e. wins plus losses).\n\nFor Division 1 NCAA Men's basketball, the WP factor of the RPI was updated in 2004 to account for differences in home, away, and neutral games. A home win now counts as 0.6 win, while a road win counts as 1.4 wins. Inversely, a home loss equals 1.4 losses, while a road loss counts as 0.6 loss. A neutral game counts as 1 win or 1 loss. This change was based on statistical data that consistently showed home teams in Division I basketball winning about two-thirds of the time. Note that this location adjustment applies only to the WP factor and not the OWP and OOWP factors. Only games against Division 1 teams are included for all RPI factors. As an example, if a team loses to Syracuse at home, beats them away, and then loses to Cincinnati away, their record would be 1–2. Considering the weighted aspect of the WP, their winning percentage is 1.4 / (1.4 + 1.4 + 0.6) = 0.4118\n\nThe OWP is calculated by taking the average of the WP's for each of the team's opponents with the requirement that all games against the team in question are removed from the calculation. Continuing from the example above, assume Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other teams and won. The team in question has played Syracuse twice and therefore Syracuse must be counted twice. Thus the OWP of the team is (0/1 + 0/1 + 2/2) / 3 (number of opponents – Syracuse, Syracuse, Cincinnati). OWP = 0.3333\n\nThe OOWP is calculated by taking the average of each Opponent's OWP. Note that the team in question is part of the team's OOWP. In fact, the most re-occurring opponent of your opponents is the team in question.\n\nContinuing the example above, a team has played Syracuse twice and Cincinnati once. Syracuse has played one other game and lost, while Cincinnati has played two other games and won. Next, for simplicity, assume none of the unnamed teams has played any other games.\n\nThe OOWP is calculated as (Syracuse's OWP + Syracuse's OWP + Cincinnati's OWP ) / 3.\n\nSyracuse has played and beat the team in question (which, excluding the games against Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), lost to the team in question (excluding Syracuse, only lost to Cincinnati), and lost one other game (excluding Syracuse, this team has no WP). Syracuse's OWP is (0/1 + 0/1) / 2 = 0.0000.\n\nCincinnati has played the team in question (excluding Cincinnati, they went 1–1 vs. Syracuse) and won versus two other opponents each of which have no WP when games versus Cincinnati are excluded. Cincinnati's OWP is (1/2) / 1 = 0.5000.\n\nFor the team in question, the OOWP is thus (0.0000 + 0.0000 + 0.5000) / 3 = 0.1667\n\nFor the team in question, the RPI can now be calculated:\n\nRPI = (WP * 0.25) + (OWP * 0.50) + (OOWP * 0.25)\n\nPlugging in numbers from the above example gives you\n\nRPI = (0.4117 * 0.25) + (0.3333 * 0.50) + (0.1667 * 0.25) = 0.3113\n\nAssume the following game results:\n\nHere is the calculation of the WPs, OWPs, and OOWPs for each team:\n\nWP\n\nOWP\n\nOOWP\n\nThese are then combined via the formula\nresulting in the following ratings:\n\nThe RPI formula also has many flaws. Due to the heavy weighting of opponents winning percentage, beating a team with a bad RPI may actually hurt your RPI. In addition,\nlosing to a good RPI team can help your RPI. \n\nSince 2018, one criterion for determining selection to the NCAA Tournament has been performance against certain RPI quadrants. Typically, a quadrant 1 win is considered a \"good win\", while a quadrant 4 loss is considered a \"bad loss\". The quadrants are defined as follows: \n\n\nThe quadrant system is still in use under the new NET system, with RPI ranking replaced by NET ranking.\n\nThe NCAA announced on August 22, 2018 that the RPI would no longer be used in the Division I men's basketball selection process, and would be replaced by the aforementioned NET. This new metric will take the following into account:\nGame date and order are not included in the NET—all games are treated equally, whether an early-season matchup or a conference tournament championship game. As noted above, the NET is initially being used only for the Division I men's basketball tournament.\n\nThe formula used in NCAA baseball is the same as that used in basketball except for the adjustment of home and road records. Starting in 2013, college baseball RPI formula values each road victory as 1.3 instead of 1.0. Each home win is valued at 0.7 instead of 1.0. Conversely, each home loss counts 1.3 against a team’s RPI and each road loss counts 0.7 against a team’s RPI. Neutral-site games have a value of 1.0, but the committee is studying how to determine if a game should be considered a neutral-site contest. The adjustment is based on data showing that home teams win about 62 percent of the time in Division I baseball.\" The change was made because of the discrepancy in the number of home games teams play. Some schools are able to play 35–40 of their 56 allowable games at home, while other teams, due to factors such as weather, may play only 20 home games.\n\nThis adjustment replaces the current system of bonuses or penalties that teams receive. Bonus points are awarded for beating top-75 non-conference opponents on the road and penalty points are given for losing to bottom-75 non-conference opponents at home. Bonuses and penalties are on a sliding scale, separated into groups of 25, with the top bonus for a road win against a top-25 team and the worst penalty for a home loss to a bottom-25 opponent.\n\n"}
{"id": "1512377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1512377", "title": "Sertão", "text": "Sertão\n\nThe word sertão (, plural \"sertões\", has no precise equivalent in any other language, but in English is approximated by \"outback\" or \"backcountry\". It is one of the four sub-regions of the Northeast Region of Brazil. Its borders are not precise and do not correspond to any modern Brazilian states. Like the South of the United States, it is a region that is well-known in Brazilian culture, with a rich history and much folklore.\n\nOriginally the term referred to the vast hinterlands of Asia and South America that Portuguese explorers encountered. In Brazil, it referred to backlands away from the Atlantic coastal regions where the Portuguese first settled in South America in the early sixteenth century. A Brazilian historian once referred to colonial life in Brazil as a \"civilization of crabs\", as most settlers clung to the shoreline, with few trying to make inroads into the \"sertão\". In modern terms, \"sertão\" refers to a semi-arid region in northeastern Brazil, comprising parts of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Maranhão, Piauí, and Minas Gerais.\n\nGeographically, the \"sertão\" consists mainly of low uplands that form part of the Brazilian Highlands. Most parts of the \"sertão\" are between and above sea level, with higher elevations found on the eastern edge in the Planalto da Borborema, where it merges into a sub-humid region known as agreste, in the Serra da Ibiapaba in western Ceará and in the Serro do Periquito of central Pernambuco. In the north, the \"sertão\" extends to the northern coastal plains of Rio Grande do Norte state, while to the south it ends gradually in the northern part of Minas Gerais.\n\nTwo major rivers cross the \"sertão\", the Jaguaribe and further east the Piranhas, and the larger São Francisco River is in part in the \"sertão\". Smaller rivers dry up after the end of the rainy season.\n\nThe term \"sertão\" is also used in Portuguese to refer to the Brazilian hinterland in general, regardless of region. It is this sense that corresponds to \"sertão\" music, \"música sertaneja\", roughly \"country music\". To avoid ambiguity, the region in the northeast is sometimes called the \"sertão nordestino\", while the Brazilian hinterland may also be called the \"sertania\", the land of \"sertões\".\n\nBecause the \"sertão\" lies just south of the equator, temperatures are nearly uniform throughout the year and are typically tropical, often extremely hot in the west.\n\nHowever, the \"sertão\" is distinctive in its low rainfall compared to other areas of Brazil. Because of the relatively cool temperatures in the South Atlantic Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone remains north of the region for most of the year, so that most of the year is very dry.\n\nAlthough annual rainfall averages between and over most of the \"sertão\" and on the northern coast at Fortaleza, it is confined to a short rainy season. This season extends from January to April in the west, but in the eastern \"sertão\" it generally occurs from March to June. However, rainfall is extremely erratic and in some years the rains are minimal, leading to catastrophic drought, while in others rains are extremely heavy and floods occur. This variability has caused extreme famines among subsistence farmers in the region, exacerbated by the extreme imbalance of land ownership throughout the \"sertão\". The worst of these famines, between 1877 and 1879, was said to have killed over half the region's population.\n\nIn its natural state, the \"sertão\" was covered by a distinctive scrubby caatinga vegetation, consisting generally of low thorny bushes adapted to the extreme climate. Several species of tree in the caatinga, such asthe cashew, have become valuable horticultural plants. Most of the \"sertão\" vegetation is now substantially degraded as a result of centuries of cattle ranching or clearing for cotton farming.\n\nParts of the \"sertão\" are recognized as a biodiversity hot-spot because of its unique flora.\n\n\nNonfiction\n\n\nFiction\n\n"}

In 1989–1990 it was demolished, then rebuilt at the Black Country Living Museum.\n\nThe school was designed by William Bourne, who also designed the nearby church of St James and St John. The design was intended to reflect its support from the church. The school cost just under £500 with the majority of the funds being raised by public subscription. The running costs were to be raised by annual sermons, public donations and the two pennies that the children paid for their schooling every Monday morning. The school opened in 1842 and fund raising methods included the selling of medallions in order that the school could be of sufficient size to accommodate 300 pupils with a new extension at the rear. An alternative estimate was that the two rooms, which could be divided by a partition, were the main focus for a school roll of 200 pupils. They were separated mainly by gender, either side in three or four classes. Early documents referred to each side of the partition as the boys' school and the girls' school. Religious education was emphasised by concentration on the catechism, church doctrine and principles being taught twice every week. The Bible was to be read daily.\n\nThe teachers were judged on results and records show that pupils were just taught arithmetic, reading and writing in the weeks before the exams. The teachers were paid £60 or £30 depending on whether they were male or female; female teachers were preferred as they were cheaper. In 1868 the mistress of the school was made redundant when the school management decided that the boys' and girls' schools education could be combined under the previous headmaster, Mr Westbury. In the 1890s the school was upgraded with plaster on the walls, heating and cloakrooms. In 1906 it became an infants school, preparing children for transfer to the Jessons School when they reached junior age.\n\nThe school was refurbished in 1912, the windows being enlarged substantially, after the school first became free and compulsory. It still suffered from absenteeism around the time of the hop harvest and the Dudley School Board issued medals to encourage attendance.\n\nThe school building was improved again in the 1930s. It remained in use until the early 1940s, when the children were moved out until the end of the war so that American Forces could use the building. The school was then open again until July 1972, when it finally ceased to be a school in its own right. The building remained in use as a school for a further eight years as overflow for the reorganised Jessons Middle School (formerly the junior school) until a new school building opened on the Jessons site in 1980. That was the end of the building as a school after 138 years, but it survived for another a decade at its Eve Hill site. When Jessons Middle School vacated the building, it was converted into a youth centre before falling short of modern health and safety standards and was thought to be structurally unsafe by 1989.\n\nBlack Country Museum officials decided to move the building to its current site in 1989 and the relocation was completed in October 1990, with the exhibit opening to the public in 1991. The move was funded by the Charles Hayward Trust. HRH The Duke of Gloucester carried out an official re-opening on 12 May 1992. The museum drew on the memories of former students to reconstruct how the school would have appeared in 1912, using period fixtures and fittings.\n"}

It has eight volumes; the first five were part of the original home-study correspondence course compiled in 1928 by Dr. Harlan Tarbell, the remaining three volumes being added on later.\n\nThis magic volume series was originally designed as a correspondence course for budding magicians. Once they were collected and bound, the series has become an unparalleled reference standard for magicians. In its impact on the magic world, it is second perhaps in its influence on the art of magic only to Hoffman's \"Modern Magic\", and many professional magicians have based their careers on the \"Tarbell Course\". \n\nThe entire collection comprises more than one-hundred lessons in every aspect of magic including micromagic/close-up magic, escapology, mentalism and stage illusions. It is the most comprehensive literary work in magic history. The original five volumes contained sixty correspondence lessons with more than 3,000 illustrations.\n\nIn addition to teaching specific tricks, \"The Tarbell Course\" also teaches patter, marketing, the history of magic, ethics, advertising, routining, presentation, diction and elocution, magic theory, performance theory, acting, misdirection, timing and showmanship. \n\nVolume 7 of the series was written by Harry Lorayne and compiled from contributions by other magicians; it is valued largely for its comprehensive index, subdivided by title, contributor, and properties, to the first seven volumes. \n\nVolume 8 of the series was compiled and edited by Richard J. Kaufman and Steve Burton. It collected Tarbell's widely scattered and previously uncollected writings on magic, which Kaufman then fashioned into something resembling the first six volumes of the course. Since most of the book was written and illustrated by Tarbell, it is linked more closely to the rest of the course than Volume 7.\n\nPublishers T. Grant Cooke and Walter A. Jordan hoped to produce a correspondence course in magic in the mid-1920s and approached Harlan Tarbell and Walter Baker to work on the project. Baker abandoned the project early on to concentrate on his performances. Tarbell was thus dropped from the project. \n\nCooke and Jordan then approached Harry Houdini to create the course. Houdini declined due to lack of time but recommended Tarbell. Ultimately, the publishers agreed and offered Tarbell $50,000 for the course.\n\nThe series sold 10,000 copies until Cooke and Jordan discontinued it in 1931. In 1941, Louis Tannen purchased the rights to the course and reworked the correspondence lessons into book form and ultimately added three additional volumes.\n\nD. Robbins and Co./ E-Z Magic purchased all rights from Tannens in 1962 and is the current publisher and distributor of the Tarbell Course in Magic. The Encyclopedia was also translated into the Korean and Japanese language. \n\nThe course was ultimately so successful that it became a textbook for magicians all over the world. A magician traveling in India offered to buy some of the secrets of a Hindu Fakir and was surprised to learn that they came from the Tarbell Course. In Africa, tribal medicine men asked that the volumes be sent in a plain brown wrapper to keep their followers from learning that their magic came from Chicago.\n\nFrom 2016 onward, Penguin Magic adapted the Tarbell Course for online video, with each trick and technique taught in order by magician Dan Harlan. It is released monthly, lesson-by-lesson.\n\n\n\"Volume 6\"\n\n\"Volume 7\"\n\n\"Volume 8\" - (Tarbell's Graduate Course in Magic)\n"}

{"id": "385335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385335", "title": "Writ of assistance", "text": "Writ of assistance\n\nA writ of assistance is a written order (a writ) issued by a court instructing a law enforcement official, such as a sheriff or a tax collector, to perform a certain task. Historically, several types of writs have been called \"writs of assistance\".The Writs of Assistance was finally published in October 6, 1763. Most often, a writ of assistance is \"used to enforce an order for the possession of lands\". When used to evict someone from real property, such a writ is also called a \"writ of restitution\" or a \"writ of possession\". In the area of customs, writs of assistance were first authorized by an act of the English Parliament in 1660 (12 Charles 2 c. 29), and were issued by the Court of Exchequer to help customs officials search for smuggled goods. These writs were called \"writs of assistance\" because they called upon sheriffs, other officials, and loyal subjects to \"assist\" the customs official in carrying out his duties.\n\nIn general, customs writs of assistance served as general search warrants that did not expire, allowing customs officials to search anywhere for smuggled goods without having to obtain a specific warrant. These writs became controversial when they were issued by courts in British America in the 1760s, especially the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Controversy over these general writs of assistance inspired the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids general search warrants in the United States of America.\n\nGeneral writs of assistance played an important role in the increasing tensions that led to the American Revolution and the creation of the United States of America. In 1760, Great Britain began to enforce some of the provisions of the Navigation Acts by granting customs officers these writs. In New England, smuggling had become common. However, officers could not search a person's property without giving a reason. Colonists protested that the writs violated their rights as British subjects. \nThe colonists had several problems with these writs. They were permanent and even transferable; the holder of a writ could assign it to another. Any place could be searched at the whim of the holder, and searchers were not responsible for any damage they caused. This put anyone who had such a writ above the laws.\n\nAll writs of assistance expired six months after death of the king, at which time new writs had to be obtained. With the death of King George II in October 1760, all writs would expire on 25 April 1761. The crisis began on 27 December 1760 when news of King George II's death reached Boston and the people of Massachusetts learned that all writs faced termination.\n\nWithin three weeks, the writs were challenged by a group of 63 Boston merchants represented by fiery Boston attorney James Otis, Jr. A countersuit was filed by a British customs agent Paxton, and together these are known as \"Paxton's case\". Otis argued the famous writs of assistance case at the Old State House in Boston in February 1761 and again on 16 November 1761. Although Otis technically lost, his challenge to the authority of Parliament made a strong impression on John Adams, who was present, and thereby eventually contributed to the American Revolution. In a pamphlet published three years later, in 1765, Otis expanded his argument that the general writs violated the British unwritten constitution hearkening back to Magna Carta. Any law in violation of the constitution or \"natural law\" which underlay it, was void.\n\nA writ of assistance was used in an incident known as the \"Malcom Affair\", which was described by legal scholar William Cuddihy as \"the most famous search in colonial America.\" The episode demonstrated a fundamental difference between the colonists' view of their rights and the official British view of imperial law. \"The Malcom affair was a minor matter, a comedy of blundering revenue officers and barricaded colonials,\" wrote legal historian John Phillip Reid, \"but were we to dismiss it in haste we might run the risk of dismissing much of the story of the American Revolution.\"\n\nOn 24 September 1766, customs officials in Boston, with a deputy sheriff, searched merchant Daniel Malcom's home, which was also his place of business. They claimed the authority to do so by a writ of assistance issued to customs official Benjamin Hallowell, and the information of a confidential informant. Malcom allowed them to search, but denied them access to a locked cellar, arguing that they did not have the legal authority to break it open. According to customs officials, Malcom threatened to use force to prevent them from opening the door; according to Malcom and his supporters, his threat specified resisting any \"unlawful\" forced entry.\n\nThe officials left and returned with a specific search warrant, only to find that Malcom had locked his house. A crowd supportive of Malcom had gathered around the house; Tories claimed that this \"mob\" numbered 300 or more people and was hostile to the customs officers, while Whigs insisted that this was a peaceful gathering of about 50 curious onlookers, mostly boys. No violence occurred, but reports written by Governor Francis Bernard and the customs officials created the impression in Britain that a riot had taken place. The incident furthered Boston's reputation in Britain as a lawless town controlled by \"mobs\", a reputation that would contribute to the government's decision to send troops in 1768.\n\nAlthough British officials, and some historians, described Malcom as acting in defiance of the law, John Phillip Reid argued that Malcom's actions were lawful—so precisely lawful, in fact, that Reid speculated that Malcom may have been acting under the advice of his lawyer, James Otis. According to Reid, Malcom and Otis may have been attempting to provoke a lawsuit so that they could once again \"challenge the validity of writs of assistance\" in court. This was one of several incidents when a Boston merchant resisted a search with a seemingly exact knowledge of the law; John Hancock would act in a similar manner when customs officials attempted to search his ship \"Lydia\" in 1768.\n\nUncertainty about the legality of writs of assistance issued by colonial superior courts prompted Parliament to affirm that such writs were legal in the 1767 Townshend Acts. However, most colonial courts refused to issue general writs, and the Malcom case was apparently the last time a writ of assistance was issued in Boston.\n\nWrits of assistance continue to have force in the United Kingdom and may be used by customs officers to enter any building by force and search and seize anything liable to forfeiture.\nThe officer must have reasonable grounds to suspect that goods liable for forfeiture are kept on the premises and that the goods are likely to be removed, destroyed or lost before a search warrant can be obtained and executed. Writs of assistance are issued at the start of the monarch's reign and continue in force until six months after the end of the monarch's reign.\n\nIn response to the much-hated general writs, several of the colonies included a particularity requirement for search warrants in their constitutions when they established independent governments in 1776; the phrase \"particularity requirement\" is the legal term of art used in contemporary cases to refer to an express requirement that the target of a search warrant must be \"particularly\" described in detail. Several years later, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution also contained a particularity requirement that outlawed the use of writs of assistance (and all general search warrants) by the federal government. Later, the Fourth Amendment was incorporated against the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, and writs of assistance were proscribed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "65755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65755", "title": "Yeti", "text": "Yeti\n\nIn the folklore of Nepal, the Yeti () (, ) or Abominable Snowman is an ape-like creature taller than an average human, that is said to inhabit the Himalayan and Siberian regions of East Asia. The names \"Yeti\" and \"Meh-Teh\" are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.\n\nThe scientific community has generally regarded the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of evidence of its existence. In one genetic study, researchers matched DNA from hair samples found in the Himalaya with a prehistoric bear from the Pleistocene epoch.\n\nThe word \"Yeti\" is derived from , a compound of the words \"rocky\", \"rocky place\" and () \"bear\". Pranavananda states that the words \"ti\", \"te\" and \"teh\" are derived from the spoken word 'tre' (spelled \"dred\"), Tibetan for bear, with the 'r' so softly pronounced as to be almost inaudible, thus making it \"te\" or \"teh\".\n\nOther terms used by Himalayan peoples do not translate exactly the same, but refer to legendary and indigenous wildlife:\n\n\nThe name \"Abominable Snowman\" was coined in 1921, the same year Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury led the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition which he chronicled in \"Mount Everest The Reconnaissance, 1921\". In the book, Howard-Bury includes an account of crossing the Lhakpa La at where he found footprints that he believed \"were probably caused by a large 'loping' grey wolf, which in the soft snow formed double tracks rather like a those of a bare-footed man\". He adds that his Sherpa guides \"at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of 'The Wild Man of the Snows', to which they gave the name 'metoh-kangmi'\". \"Metoh\" translates as \"man-bear\" and \"Kang-mi\" translates as \"snowman\".\n\nConfusion exists between Howard-Bury's recitation of the term \"metoh-kangmi\" and the term used in Bill Tilman's book \"Mount Everest, 1938\" where Tilman had used the words \"metch\", which does not exist in the Tibetan language, and \"kangmi\" when relating the coining of the term \"Abominable Snowman\". Further evidence of \"metch\" being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor David Snellgrove from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word \"metch\" as impossible, because the consonants \"t-c-h\" cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language.\" Documentation suggests that the term \"metch-kangmi\" is derived from one source (from the year 1921). It has been suggested that \"metch\" is simply a misspelling of \"metoh\".\n\nThe use of \"Abominable Snowman\" began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to \"The Statesman\" in Calcutta, writing under the pen name \"Kim\", interviewed the porters of the \"Everest Reconnaissance expedition\" on their return to Darjeeling. Newman mistranslated the word \"metoh\" as \"filthy\", substituting the term \"abominable\", perhaps out of artistic license. As author Bill Tilman recounts, \"[Newman] wrote long after in a letter to \"The Times\": The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two newspapers\".\n\nAccording to H. Siiger, the Yeti was a part of the pre-Buddhist beliefs of several Himalayan people. He was told that the Lepcha people worshipped a \"Glacier Being\" as a God of the Hunt. He also reported that followers of the Bön religion once believed the blood of the \"mi rgod\" or \"wild man\" had use in certain mystical ceremonies. The being was depicted as an apelike creature who carries a large stone as a weapon and makes a whistling swoosh sound.\n\nIn 1832, James Prinsep's \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal\" published trekker B. H. Hodgson's account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson concluded it was an orangutan.\n\nAn early record of reported footprints appeared in 1899 in Laurence Waddell's \"Among the Himalayas\". Waddell reported his guide's description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell thought were made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures but wrote that \"none, however, of the many Tibetans I have interrogated on this subject could ever give me an authentic case. On the most superficial investigation it always resolved into something that somebody heard tell of.\"\n\nThe frequency of reports increased during the early 20th century, when Westerners began making determined attempts to scale the many mountains in the area and occasionally reported seeing odd creatures or strange tracks.\nIn 1925, N. A. Tombazi, a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature at about near Zemu Glacier. Tombazi later wrote that he observed the creature from about , for about a minute. \"Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes. It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes.\" About two hours later, Tombazi and his companions descended the mountain and saw the creature's prints, described as \"similar in shape to those of a man, but only six to seven inches long by four inches wide... The prints were undoubtedly those of a biped.\"\nWestern interest in the Yeti peaked dramatically in the 1950s. While attempting to scale Mount Everest in 1951, Eric Shipton took photographs of a number of large prints in the snow, at about above sea level. These photos have been subject to intense scrutiny and debate. Some argue they are the best evidence of Yeti's existence, while others contend the prints are those of a mundane creature that have been distorted by the melting snow.\n\nPeter Byrne reported finding a yeti footprint in 1948, in northern Sikkim, India near the Zemu Glacier, while on holiday from a Royal Air Force assignment in India.\n\nIn 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reported seeing large footprints while scaling Mount Everest. Hillary would later discount Yeti reports as unreliable. In his first autobiography Tenzing said that he believed the Yeti was a large ape, and although he had never seen it himself his father had seen one twice, but in his second autobiography he said he had become much more sceptical about its existence.\nDuring the \"Daily Mail\" Snowman Expedition of 1954, the mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson made the first trek from Everest to Kanchenjunga in the course of which he photographed symbolic paintings of the Yeti at Tengboche gompa. Jackson tracked and photographed many footprints in the snow, most of which were identifiable. However, there were many large footprints which could not be identified. These flattened footprint-like indentations were attributed to erosion and subsequent widening of the original footprint by wind and particles.\nOn 19 March 1954, the \"Daily Mail\" printed an article which described expedition teams obtaining hair specimens from what was alleged to be a Yeti scalp found in the Pangboche monastery. The hairs were black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The hair was analysed by Professor Frederic Wood Jones, an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the hairs were bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking microphotographs of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the hairs were not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche \"scalp\") running from the base of the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche hairs were taken. He was, however, convinced that the hairs were not of a bear or anthropoid ape. He suggested that the hairs were from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.\n\nSławomir Rawicz claimed in his book \"The Long Walk\", published in 1956, that as he and some others were crossing the Himalayas in the winter of 1940, their path was blocked for hours by two bipedal animals that were doing seemingly nothing but shuffling around in the snow.\n\nBeginning in 1957, an American Tom Slick funded a few missions to investigate Yeti reports. In 1959, supposed Yeti feces were collected by one of Slick's expeditions; fecal analysis found a parasite which could not be classified. The United States government thought that finding the Yeti was likely enough to create three rules for American expeditions searching for it: obtain a Nepalese permit, do not harm the Yeti except in self-defense, and let the Nepalese government approve any news reporting on the animal's discovery. In 1959, actor James Stewart, while visiting India, reportedly smuggled the so-called Pangboche Hand, by concealing it in his luggage when he flew from India to London.\n\nIn 1960, Sir Edmund Hillary mounted an expedition to collect and analyze physical evidence of the Yeti. Hillary borrowed a supposed Yeti scalp from the Khumjung monastery then himself and Khumjo Chumbi (the village headman), brought the \"scalp\" back to London where a small sample was cut off for testing. Marca Burns made a detailed examination of the sample of skin and hair from the margin of the alleged Yeti scalp and compared it with similar samples from the serow, blue bear and black bear. Burns concluded the sample \"was probably made from the skin of an animal closely resembling the sampled specimen of Serow, but definitely not identical with it: possibly a local variety or race of the same species, or a different but closely related species.\"\n\nUp to the 1960s, belief in the yeti was relatively common in Bhutan and in 1966 a Bhutanese stamp was made to honor the creature. However, in the twenty-first century belief in the being has declined.\n\nIn 1970, British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling Annapurna. According to Whillans, while scouting for a campsite, he heard some odd cries which his Sherpa guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. The next day, he observed a few human-like footprints in the snow, and that evening, viewed with binoculars a bipedal, ape-like creature for 20 minutes as it apparently searched for food not far from his camp.\n\nIn 1983, Himalayan conservationist Daniel C. Taylor and Himalayan natural historian Robert L. Fleming Jr. led a yeti expedition into Nepal's Barun Valley (suggested by discovery in the Barun in 1972 of footprints alleged to be yeti by Cronin & McNeely). The Taylor-Fleming expedition also discovered similar yeti-like footprints (hominoid appearing with both a hallux and bipedal gait), intriguing large nests in trees, and vivid reports from local villagers of two bears, \"rukh balu\" ('tree bear', small, reclusive, weighing about ) and \"bhui balu\" ('ground bear', aggressive, weighing up to ). Further interviews across Nepal gave evidence of local belief in two different bears. Skulls were collected, these were compared to known skulls at the Smithsonian Institution, American Museum of Natural History, and British Museum, and confirmed identification of a single species, the Asiatic black bear, showing no morphological difference between 'tree bear' and 'ground bear.' (This despite an intriguing skull in the British Museum of a 'tree bear' collected in 1869 by Oldham and discussed in the \"Annals of the Royal Zoological Society\".)\n\nIn 2004, Henry Gee, editor of the journal \"Nature\", mentioned the Yeti as an example of a legend deserving further study, writing, \"The discovery that \"Homo floresiensis\" survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth.\"\n\nIn early December 2007, American television presenter Joshua Gates and his team (Destination Truth) reported finding a series of footprints in the Everest region of Nepal resembling descriptions of Yeti. Each of the footprints measured in length with five toes that measured a total of across. Casts were made of the prints for further research. The footprints were examined by Jeffrey Meldrum of Idaho State University, who believed them to be too morphologically accurate to be fake or man-made, before changing his mind after making further investigations. Later in 2009, Gates made another investigation during which he discovered hair samples. A forensic analyst concluded that the hair contained an unknown DNA sequence.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, the BBC reported that hairs collected in the remote Garo Hills area of North-East India by Dipu Marak had been analyzed at Oxford Brookes University in the UK by primatologist Anna Nekaris and microscopy expert Jon Wells. These initial tests were inconclusive, and ape conservation expert Ian Redmond told the BBC that there was similarity between the cuticle pattern of these hairs and specimens collected by Edmund Hillary during Himalayan expeditions in the 1950s and donated to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and announced planned DNA analysis. This analysis has since revealed that the hair came from the Himalayan goral.\n\nA group of Chinese scientists and explorers in 2010 proposed to renew searches in the Shennongjia Forestry District of Hubei province, which was the site of expeditions in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAt a 2011 conference in Russia, participating scientists and enthusiasts declared having \"95% evidence\" of the Yeti's existence. However, this claim was disputed later; American anthropologist and anatomist Jeffrey Meldrum, who was present during the Russian expedition, claimed the \"evidence\" found was simply an attempt by local officials to drum up publicity.\n\nA yeti was reportedly captured in Russia in December 2011. Initially the story claimed that a hunter reported having seen a bear-like creature, trying to kill one of his sheep, but after he fired his gun, the creature ran into a forest on two legs. The story then claimed that border patrol soldiers captured a hairy two-legged female creature similar to a gorilla that ate meat and vegetation. This was later revealed as a hoax or possibly a publicity stunt for charity.\n\nThe misidentification of Himalayan wildlife has been proposed as an explanation for some Yeti sightings, including the \"chu-teh\", a langur monkey living at lower altitudes; the Tibetan blue bear; or the Himalayan brown bear or \"dzu-teh\", also known as the Himalayan red bear.\n\nA well publicized expedition to Bhutan initially reported that a hair sample had been obtained which by DNA analysis by Professor Bryan Sykes could not be matched to any known animal. Analysis completed after the media release, however, clearly showed the samples were from a brown bear (\"Ursus arctos\") and an Asiatic black bear (\"Ursus thibetanus\").\n\nIn 1986, South Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner claimed to have had a face-to-face encounter with a Yeti. He wrote a book, \"My Quest for the Yeti\", and claims to have killed one. According to Messner, the Yeti is actually the endangered Himalayan brown bear, \"Ursus arctos isabellinus\", or Tibetan blue bear, \"U. a. pruinosus\", which can walk both upright or on all fours.\n\nThe 1983 Barun Valley discoveries prompted three years of research on the 'tree bear' possibility by Taylor, Fleming, John Craighead and Tirtha Shrestha. From that research the conclusion was that the Asiatic black bear, when about two years old, spends much time in trees to avoid attack by larger male bears on the ground ('ground bears'). During this tree period that may last two years, young bears train their inner claw outward, allowing an opposable grip. The imprint in the snow of a hind paw coming over the front paw that appears to have a hallux, especially when the bear is going slightly uphill so the hind paw print extends the overprint backward makes a hominoid-appearing track, both in that it is elongated like a human foot but with a “thumb” and in that a four-footed animal’s gait now appears bipedal. This \"yeti discovery\", in the words of \"National Geographic Magazine\" editor Bill Garrett, \"[by] on-site research sweeps away much of the 'smoke and mirrors' and gives us a believable yeti\".\n\nThis fieldwork in Nepal's Barun Valley led directly to initiating in 1984 Makalu-Barun National Park that protected over half a million acres in 1991, and across the border with China the Qomolangma national nature preserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region that protected over six million acres. In the words of Honorary President of the American Alpine Club, Robert H. Bates, this yeti discovery \"has apparently solved the mystery of the yeti, or at least part of it, and in so doing added to the world’s great wildlife preserves\" such that the shy animal that lives in trees (and not the high snows), and mysteries and myths of the Himalayas that it represents, can continue within a protected area nearly the size of Switzerland.\n\nIn 2003, Japanese researcher and mountaineer Dr. Makoto Nebuka published the results of his twelve-year linguistic study, postulating that the word \"Yeti\" is a corruption of the word \"meti\", a regional dialect term for a \"bear\". Nebuka claims that ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear as a supernatural being. Nebuka's claims were subject to almost immediate criticism, and he was accused of linguistic carelessness. Dr. Raj Kumar Pandey, who has researched both Yetis and mountain languages, said \"it is not enough to blame tales of the mysterious beast of the Himalayas on words that rhyme but mean different things.\"\n\nSome speculate these reported creatures could be present-day specimens of the extinct giant ape \"Gigantopithecus\". However, the Yeti is generally described as bipedal, and most scientists believe \"Gigantopithecus\" to have been quadrupedal, and so massive that, unless it evolved specifically as a bipedal ape (like \"Oreopithecus\" and the hominids), walking upright would have been even more difficult for the now extinct primate than it is for its extant quadrupedal relative, the orangutan.\n\nIn 2013, a call was put out by scientists from the universities of Oxford and Lausanne for people claiming to have samples from these sorts of creatures. A mitochondrial DNA analysis of the 12S RNA gene was undertaken on samples of hair from an unidentified animal from Ladakh in northern India on the west of the Himalayas, and one from Bhutan. These samples were compared with those in GenBank, the international repository of gene sequences, and matched a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago. The result suggests that, barring hoaxes of planted samples or contamination, bears in these regions may have been taken to be yeti. Professor of evolutionary genetics at the University of Cambridge Bill Amos doubted the samples were of polar bears in the Himalayas, but was \"90% convinced that there is a bear in these regions that has been mistaken for a yeti\". Professor Bryan Sykes whose team carried out the analysis of the samples at Oxford university has his own theory. He believes that the samples may have come from a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. A research of 12S rRNA published in 2015 revealed that the hair samples collected are most likely those of brown bears. In 2017, a new analysis compared mtDNA sequences of bears from the region with DNA extracted from hair and other samples claimed to have come from yeti. It included hair thought to be from the same preserved specimen as the anomalous Sykes sample, and showed it to have been a Himalayan brown bear, while other purported yeti samples were actually from the Tibetan blue bear, Asiatic black bear and a domestic dog.\n\nIn 2017, Daniel C. Taylor published a comprehensive analysis of the century-long Yeti literature, giving added evidence to the (\"Ursus thibetanus\") explanation building on the initial Barun Valley discoveries. Importantly, this book under the Oxford University imprint gave a meticulous explanation for the iconic Yeti footprint photographed by Eric Shipton in 1950, also the 1972 Cronin-McNeely print, as well all other unexplained Yeti footprints. To complete this explanation, Taylor also located a never-before published photograph in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, taken in 1950 by Eric Shipton, that included scratches that are clearly bear nail marks.\n\nThe Yeti has regularly been depicted in films, literature, music, and video games:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5952413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5952413", "title": "Yunjing", "text": "Yunjing\n\nThe Yunjing () is one of the two oldest existing examples of a Chinese rhyme table – a series of charts which arrange Chinese characters in large tables according to their tone and syllable structures to indicate their proper pronunciations. Current versions of the \"Yunjing\" date to AD 1161 and 1203 editions published by Zhang Linzhi (張麟之). \nThe original author(s) and date of composition of the \"Yunjing\" are unknown. Some of its elements, such as certain choices in its ordering, reflect features particular to the Tang dynasty, but no conclusive proof of an actual date of composition has yet been found.\n\nThe \"Yunjing\" contains 43 tables (), each of which tabulates combinations of a particular final rhyme (listed in rows) with various initials (listed in columns), in up to four tones, to show in a grid pattern all possible syllables. Empty circles on the grid denote that the author(s) were unaware of any word with that particular pronunciation. By locating a character in \"Yunjing\", a reader could identify its initial consonant (by looking at its column) and its \"rhyme\", or main vowel and ending consonant (by looking at its row), and combine the two to obtain the word's pronunciation. Zhang Linzhi's prefaces list a total of 36 possible initial consonants () – by comparison, modern Standard Mandarin only has 23.\n\nHistorical Chinese phonology uses the \"Yunjing\" as an accurate representation of Late Middle Chinese (10th – 12th century) phonology. The \"Yunjing\"'s use of this system represents a significant advancement in the Chinese' analysis of their own language, and is believed to have been inspired by their studies of Sanskrit phonological treatises and Buddhist mantras written in the Siddham script during in the Sui and Tang dynasties.\n\nEach of the 43 tables in the \"Yunjing\" is first divided into four large rows that correspond to the four tones of Middle Chinese: the level tone (), the rising tone (), the departing tone (), and the entering tone (). They are not explicitly marked as such, but the four characters are taken from each of the tone categories of the \"Guangyun\" rhyme dictionary. In the image at right, the first row – the level tone – is occupied by the level tone rhyme \"dōng\" 東, the second row – the rising tone – by the \"dǒng\" 董 rhyme, the third row – the departing tone – by \"sòng\" 送, and the fourth row – the entering tone – by \"wū\" 屋 (Cantonese: uk).\n\nEach large row is further subdivided into four grades or divisions (), forming four rows within each larger row. Characters' placement in the first through fourth grade seems to be related to their medial (glide) and main vowel, though their exact distinction is unclear.\n\nEach table is divided into six large columns representing syllables' place of articulation:\n\nLarge columns are further subdivided into two to five smaller columns, which can represent one of four possible sub-categories:\n\nThe \"Yunjing\" tables have only 23 columns – some columns represent more than one of the 36 possible initial consonants. Other rhyme tables, such as the \"Qieyun zhizhangtu\" (), do not combine the initials and have 36 full columns.\n\n\n\n"}
