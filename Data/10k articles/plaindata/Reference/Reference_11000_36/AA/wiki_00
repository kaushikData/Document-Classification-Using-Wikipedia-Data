Siamese force under the Ayutthaya Kingdom had overrun Khmer Empire many times, leaving a big scar over Cambodia. Siam also occupied Cambodia on the history as well, turning Cambodians against Thais.\n\nAnti-Thai sentiment began to flare in Cambodia because of Cambodians' fear of Thai designs on western Cambodia. That led to a violent protest in January 2003 in which the Thai embassy was burned and Thai businesses were vandalised after a Cambodian newspaper article falsely alleged that a Thai actress had claimed that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand and that it should take over the ancient temple. The hatred towards Thai people from the Cambodians would escalate in 2008, when both countries were involved in the conflict on the ownership of Preah Vihear Temple.\n\nAnimosity towards the Thai in China 1934 followed discrimination of Chinese in Thailand by Thai authorities. Some of the Chinese who had been deported from Thailand began to spread anti-Thai sentiment in China and called for an immediate boycott from the Chinese authorities to all products that been imported from Thailand.\n\nSince ancient times, Laos has been against Siamese territorial expansions although both shared the similar religion and there was even a request from Laotians to the French colonial authorities for a recovery of lost territory on the Khorat Plateau and of the Emerald Buddha from Siam. After achieving independence under communism, the present Laos government are much more sympathetic to Vietnam, and there is a rejection from Laotians towards Thailand, which is a democratic country.\n\nBoth nations shared the same religion and were involved in several wars in the past. In the present, there is more anti-Myanmar sentiment in Thailand than anti-Thai sentiment in Myanmar, as is shown by the publications of Thai school textbooks, films and media reports. The Myanmar government does not regard Thailand as its main enemy but does not consider Thailand as a \"trusted friend\" either.\n\nWestern expatriates have some anti-Thai sentiment, mainly because of their difficulties in integrating to Thai society as well as both sides' social superiority complex.\n\n"}

{"id": "35457863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35457863", "title": "Budapest Museum Quarter", "text": "Budapest Museum Quarter\n\nThe Budapest Museum Quarter is a proposed new cultural and tourist site to be located on Andrássy út in Budapest, Hungary, and has at its core the merger of the Hungarian National Gallery with the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike.\n\nNational museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state–owned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy as specialized complementary institutions to the original Hungarian National Museum. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system — including the Museum of Natural History, Museum of Ethnography, Museum of Applied Arts, Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery and pre–World War II, the National Library and Archives — operated autonomously with their own board and endowment. However, with the introduction of Communism into Hungary in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture. \nThe Hungarian National Museum is an important symbol of national identity because it played a major role in the anti-Habsburg Revolution of 1848 when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events.\n\nAfter winning a two–thirds parliamentary majority in the 2010 elections, Fidesz or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a \"hands–on cultural policy\" that included appointing a media watchdog \"that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals\". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center–right government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok) when the prior, Socialist–appointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. Francesca Von Habsburg was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front–runner in the selection process. However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture Géza Szőcs (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire Gábor Gulyás, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nIn 2011, László Harsanyi, the director of the Holocaust Memorial Center and his chief historical adviser, Judit Molnár, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, András Levente Gál, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary’s interwar leader Miklós Horthy. Saying that \"this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension,\" Gál drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Molnár, \"we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history.\" A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee László Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Győrgy Szabó, director of Trafó — a leading contemporary art center — by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest’s Új Szinház theater, István Márta by György Dörner, an actor with extreme right–wing political affiliations. According to art historian Éva Forgács, “the government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.” However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition.\n\nIn 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Karácsony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the Hungarian National Museum system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, amendments created in the spring of 2011 by Fidesz to the Hungarian Constitution took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the European Union and the United States. Some of these changes included \"a preamble committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation\", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the electoral process. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest. Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was \"high time\" for the changes to be made. To support his May 2010 remarks that “Hungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations”, as well as publicize the legislative changes, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán opened a special government–organized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state–commissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orbán himself.\n\nFacing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid–January 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal.\n\nThe concept of a separate museum district within Budapest was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the Western Railway Station to the current Museum of Fine Arts, located on Heroes' Square, to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The Museum of Ethnography would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to \"serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre\" and be realized over a period of 15 years. The proposal was unveiled by István Tarlós, who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became mayor of Budapest later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that \"the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue\".\n\nIn 2008, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the National Gallery, due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and contemporary fine art, much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas. After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the Museum of Fine Arts — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a \"special museum island\" that would complement the Museum of Fine Arts and the Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.\n\nIn September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture Géza Szőcs officially announced plans to build a new structure along Andrássy út close to City Park and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok). This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery. This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andrássy Quarter. The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian–only zone that hasn't existed on Andrássy út since the late nineteenth century. In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on Andrássy út, there would also be changes made to City Park. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after Harry Houdini, whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion HUF. After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014.\n\nThe architectural design for this \"New Gallery\" will be chosen based on an international competition.\n\nAccording to the Hungarian News Agency (MTI), on October 1, 2011 László Baán was appointed to a two–year term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the Museum of Fine Arts. In his new post, Baán will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay. He will be responsible for “preparing the concept, execution and architectural design–tender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest’s 56–ers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Gallery\".\n\nBaán has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.\n\nIn early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the Hungarian National Gallery since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the Museum of Fine Arts— called the merge process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011. As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the Hungarian National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.\n\nThis is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location. The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány. However, that proposal — which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources — was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area.\nThere was speculation by historian András Gerő that Fidesz's recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti–communist stance, which \"is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation\".\n\nThe resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Csák was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition \"Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary\" which he criticized by saying, “The government shouldn’t have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn’t be getting involved in politics.”\n\nMoving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the Buda Castle empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.\n\nIn November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to junk status by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter.\n\nAddressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, László Baán defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are \"making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated.\" However, he also added that \"it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega–project of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message\".\n\nThere is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the City Park is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The zoning laws are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.\n\nIn addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off Andrássy út also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree–lined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty — a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy — and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists.\n\nArt professionals have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled \"Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts\" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures. On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.\n\nBaán dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre–1957 state and give it more prominence.\n\nDespite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location.\n\nThe Museumplein of Amsterdam — a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events — lies in the heart of the museum quarter in Amsterdam surrounded by the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk and the Concertgebouw.\n\nFive institutions that are all part of the Berlin State Museums are located on the northern half of an island in the Spree River in Berlin, Germany and make up what is referred to as Museum Island.\n\nMore than a dozen museums in Frankfurt, Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the Museumsufer.\n\nOpened in 2001, the Museum Quarter in Vienna is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area. It is also home to restaurants, cafés and shops, attracting about 3.8 million visitors a year. It was created in order to coordinate the work of various museums after the establishment of a federal museum law. \n\nChicago's Museum Campus, which houses the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, Adler Planetarium, and Soldier Field, came to be in 1998 when the area next to Lake Michigan was replanned and landscaped with the intention of tying the institutions together with the use of green space.\n\nThe Dallas Arts District was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the Dallas Museum of Art, opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Crow Collection of Asian Art, the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and the AT&T Performing Arts Center have all been moved or newly built in the area. In 2012, the City Performance Hall will complete the planned additions to the district.\n\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex contains another cluster of cultural sites at the Fort Worth Cultural District. It is not only home to five museums such as the Kimbell Art Museum, National Cowgirl Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, but the overall park-like setting also contains the local performing arts centers like symphony, ballet and theater.\n\nThe pedestrian–friendly Museum District in Houston, Texas links 18 cultural institutions and attracts 8.7 million visitors each year. It is home to such facilities as the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the Children's Museum of Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum of Houston, along with restaurants, shops and offices.\n\nExposition Park in Los Angeles contains several sporting venues, museums and recreational facilities within its 60 acres. Visitors will find the LA Coliseum and Memorial Sports Arena, as well as the Natural History Museum, California Science Center and African American Museum alongside the Expo Center.\n\nThe National Mall is a central green space in Washington, DC that is defined by the structures of the US Capitol on one end and the Jefferson Memorial on the other. Between these two points, visitors will find numerous memorials and monuments, as well as many museums belonging to the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution including the Quadrangle Museums Project, designed in 1987. It opens south from the Smithsonian Castle building and contains two small buildings which are staging areas for two underground museums, the Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, and the National Museum of African Art, and another smaller kiosk–like building which provides the entrance for the S. Dillon Ripley Center.\n\nIn addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's cultural heritage management.\n\nA new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the Kossuth Square in front of the Parliament building. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, Attila József would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister Gyula Andrássy. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that \"the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.” However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space \"without asking the people\".\n\nIn addition to the statues of Kossuth Square being in danger, the fate of the Ethnographic Museum that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back. According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the Institute of Political History that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion HUF, but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount\".\n\nIn mid–2011, the Hungarian Natural History Museum was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space. A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the Hungarian Natural History Museum to the completed Museum Quarter.\nA private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on Andrássy út in September 2011 as part of the new Southeast Asian Gold Museum. One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of \"museum\" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits. The collection is both complimentary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum István Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest Museum of Applied Arts) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the György Ráth Museum is uncertain. Due to financial constraints, they are both only open for half–days on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments (MNG).\n\nWhile Krásna Hôrka Castle is a National Cultural Monument of the Slovak Republic, it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections. Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.\n\n\n"}

The scale was developed by staff at the COPINE (\"Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe\") project. The COPINE Project was founded in 1997, and is based in the Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, Ireland.\n\nThe COPINE scale was originally developed for therapeutic psychological purposes. \n\nMore specifically, it is used to distinguish between child erotica and child pornography.\n\nProfessor Max Taylor, one of the academics working for the COPINE project, stated: \"The significance of this distinction is to emphasise the potential sexual qualities of a whole range of kinds of photographs (and other material as well) not all of which may meet obscenity criteria.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, the COPINE project at the University College Cork, in cooperation with the Paedophile Unit of the London Metropolitan Police, developed a typology to categorize child abuse images for use in both research and law enforcement. The ten-level typology was based on analysis of images available on websites and internet newsgroups. Other researchers have adopted similar ten-level scales.\n\nThe 2002 case of \"Regina v. Oliver\" in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales established a scale by which indecent images of children could be \"graded\".

It is based on COPINE terminology and is often mistakenly referred to as such.\n\nThe SAP document gives a detailed explanation of how the COPINE scale was adapted. It also states that the COPINE scale was intended for therapeutic use and not designed for use in court. Examination of the categories will show that categories 2–5 of the SAP scale obviously correspond to categories 7–10 of the COPINE scale. Category 1 of the SAP scale seems to correspond vaguely to categories 4–6 of the COPINE scale. COPINE category 1 (indicative) was left off the SAP scale because \"images of this nature would not be classed as indecent.\" The board found COPINE categories 2 & 3 to be disputable as to whether or not they can be classified as indecent.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, a new scale, replacing the SAP scale, was adopted for sentencing in England and Wales for crimes relating to indecent images of children, put into place by page 75 of the Sentencing Council's Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline.\n\n"}

The tables below compare many popular archive formats.\n\nThe table compares various features column-by-column below:\n\nArchive formats are used for backups, mobility, and archiving. Many archive formats compress the data to consume less storage space and result in quicker transfer times as the same data is represented by fewer bytes. Another benefit is that files are combined into one archive file which has less overhead for managing or transferring.\n\nThere are numerous compression algorithms available to losslessly compress archived data and some algorithms work better (smaller archive or faster compression) with particular data types.\n\nArchive formats are also used by most operating systems to package software for easier distribution and installation than binary executables.\n\nThe DOS and Windows operating systems required filenames to include an extension (of at least one, and typically 3 characters) to identify the file type and use. Filename extensions must be unique for each type of file. Many operating systems identify a file's type from its contents without the need for an extension in its name. However, the use of three-character extensions has been embraced as a useful and efficient shorthand for identifying file types.\n\nArchive files are often stored on magnetic media, which is subject to data storage errors. Early tape media had a higher rate of errors than they do today. Many archive formats contain extra error-correction information to detect storage or transmission errors, and the software used to read the archive files contains logic to detect and possibly correct errors.\n\nMany archive formats contain redundant data embedded in the files in order to detect data storage or transmission errors, and the software used to read the archive files contains logic to detect and correct errors.\n\nIn order to protect the data being stored or transferred from being read if intercepted, many archive formats include the capability to encrypt the data. There are multiple mathematical algorithms available to encrypt data.\n\n While the original tar format uses the ASCII character encoding, current implementations use the UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding, which is backwards compatible with ASCII.\n\n Not to be confused with the archiver JAR written by Robert K. Jung, which produces \".j\" files.\n\n Compression is not a built-in feature of the formats, however, the resulting archive can be compressed with any algorithm of choice. Several implementations include functionality to do this automatically\n\n"}

The \"Genealogisches Handbuch bürgerlicher Familien\" was started in 1889 and prior to 1943, 119 volumes covering around 1,200 families were published under the original title. From 1956, the series were continued under the title \"Deutsches Geschlechterbuch\". In 2007, the 219th and latest volume was published.

To some extent it corresponds to \"Burke's Landed Gentry\" in the United Kingdom, although it could also be said to be the equivalent of \"Burke's Peerage\" in its coverage of Hanseatic and patrician families who comprised the highest class in the former city-republics.\n\n"}
{"id": "18869298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18869298", "title": "Douen", "text": "Douen\n\nThe Douen is a mythological entity from Trinidad and Tobago folklore. It is believed that they are the lost souls of children who have not yet been baptized or christened. Their most recognized characteristic is their feet are said to be backwards, with the heel facing the front and the knees are backwards, too. If they hear a child's name, then they will call to the child in a parent's voice and try to lure the child into the forest. They wear a big, floppy straw hat to hide the fact that they have no face except for a small mouth to speak with. Largely mischievous, they play pranks on people, raid gardens, and seem to enjoy leading children astray until they are thoroughly lost in the woods.\n\nDouen (pronounced Dwen) are considered to be the ‘lost souls’ of children that were not baptized or christened before death. It is said that they are destined to wander the earth eternally while practicing their collection of pranks. Neither male nor female, douens live in the forest, swamps and near rivers in Trinidad and Tobago. Their manifestation is that of a naked child never growing more than two or three feet in height. They wear a large floppy straw hat and have an entirely undistinguished face with the exception of a small mouth. The one characteristic that allows them to be recognized as douens are their feet, which are turned backwards with the heel facing forward. Douens roam the land in the pursuit of children that are not yet baptized, or christened in anticipation of luring them away deep into the woods until they are lost. They charm the children when the moon is full and have a mesmerizing whooping sound. A child who plays with a douen may consider it to be a regular child while the douen slowly but surely leads the child further and further away from the protection of home. Some children may be found the next morning in a precarious arrangement if they are found at all. Douens also have been known to come to people’s houses crying and whimpering for the love of a mother. They feed off cultivated gardens and seem to have a bizarre fondness for water crabs. Often thought to be evil spirits and malevolent creatures, douens do have a good natured side. They have been known to be of assistance to Papa Bois in the forest when an animal is trapped and injured by imitating animal calls to throw hunters off track. To avert the douens from calling your children into the forest it is said that you should never call a child’s name in open places for the douens will then in turn call the child’s name to attract them away into the forest never to return. There have been actual reports of douen encounters from children in rural areas of Trinidad such as Piparo, Penal and Barrackpore. These spirits have been reported to manifest themselves in the homes of people who have been talking about either the Douen or similar creatures. Reports suggest that open talk summons the creatures or creates a positive pull towards those who look for them. Manifestation in one's home could either be by seeing images of a child or by childish-seeming \"pranks\" being played on individuals. These creatures once called upon, can be very tricky to get rid of as they tend to be very clingy like real children would be. Natives report that religious intervention is typically called upon to remove the creatures from one's home.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago folklore is primarily of African foundation, with French, Spanish and English influences. Religious or semi-religious cults of African origin have undeniably contributed much to the Island's folklore. Many of the supernatural folklore characters are identical with those of African deities. It is exceedingly complicated to draw a line between the stern religious elements and what may be described as traditions. Nevertheless, in the African tradition, stories were meant to instill values in the children.\n\n\n\nDONALD R.

Gossett (January 15, 1930 – January 21, 1985), better known as Eddie Graham, was an American professional wrestler. He was also the promoter and booker for Championship Wrestling from Florida and President of the NWA in the 1970s.\n\nGossett started wrestling in 1947 in Texas at the age of 17 after being trained by Clarence \"Cowboy\" Luttrall. He was sometimes billed as the brother of \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers under the name of Rip Rogers. He lost a loser-leaves-town match to Pepper Gomez in May 1958 in Texas.\n\nIn June 1958, he changed his ring name to Eddie Graham and was billed as the brother of Dr. Jerry Graham and \"Crazy\" Luke Graham. Jerry and Eddie were a very successful villainous tag team on the east coast of the United States. They had popular feuds with teams such as the Fabulous Kangaroos, the Bastien Brothers, Mark Lewin and Don Curtis, and Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez. They held the NWA United States Tag Team Championship \"(Northeast version) together in Capitol Wrestling (the forerunner of World Wrestling Entertainment) four times, winning the belts three times in victories over Lewin and Curtis, and once against Red and Lou Bastien.\n\nIn the spring of 1960, Eddie left the team and went to the National Wrestling Alliance's territory in Florida to wrestle. While there, in 1966, he had a feud with Professor Boris Malenko.\n\nEddie took over booking and promoting for Championship Wrestling from Florida in 1971. He wrestled with his son, Mike Graham, until 1977, when he retired from the ring due to health problems. He made a one-shot return to the ring for one final match in 1979 when he defeated Killer Khan by pinfall after the referee was knocked out and subsequent interference by Mr. Hito and Kazuo Sakurada on Khan's behalf was fought off by Mike Graham and Ray Stevens.\n\nHe was the President of the NWA from 1976 to 1978, thanks in part to Gordon Solie and Dusty Rhodes. Graham was absent as NWA President in 1977 and 1978 due to serious health problems he suffered from, and was forced to step down as a result.\n\nHe was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 29, 2008. He was inducted posthumously by Dusty Rhodes, while his son, Mike Graham, accepted the honor on behalf of his father.\n\nGraham was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nIn 1968, Graham was lacing his boots in the locker room and a 75-lb steel window fell on his head, detaching both of his retinas and causing him an injury that required three hundred stitches. The Florida Legislature awarded him $23,000 for the incident. According to Jim Wilson in his book \"Chokehold\", Graham's eyesight was poor because of blade jobs, and because he needed surgery to correct the problem and could not afford the money, he had some wrestlers tamper with the window in order to pass it off as though it was the responsibility of the building. This allegation is disputed by eyewitnesses. Also, \"blading\" does not cause eye damage according to noted optometrist Dr. Robert W. McCullough and other eye doctors. Due to the injury, Graham was unable to wrestle for fifteen months.\n\nHe remained as the promoter in Florida until January 21, 1985, when he committed suicide by gunshot after a lifelong battle with alcoholism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "912426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=912426", "title": "Folk etymology", "text": "Folk etymology\n\nFolk etymology or reanalysis – sometimes called pseudo-etymology, popular etymology, or analogical reformation – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one. The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or morphemes. Rebracketing is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or \"bracketed\" into a new set of supposed elements. Back-formation, creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.\n\nThe term \"folk etymology\" is a loan translation from German Volksetymologie, coined by Ernst Förstemann in 1852. Folk etymology is a productive process in historical linguistics, language change, and social interaction. Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to loanwords or words that have become archaic or obsolete.\n\nExamples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form \"sparrowgrass\", originally from Greek (\"asparagus\") remade by analogy to the more familiar words \"sparrow\" and \"grass\", or the word \"burger\", originally from \"Hamburg\" + \"-er\" (\"thing connected with\"), but understood as \"ham\" + \"burger\".\n\nThe technical term \"folk etymology\" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the German term \"Volksetymologie\", coined by Ernst Förstemann. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in philology, there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms. Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying sound changes, the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.\n\nBelieving a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin. This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include \"crayfish\" or \"crawfish\", which are not historically related to \"fish\" but come from Middle English \"crevis\", cognate with French \"écrevisse\". Likewise \"chaise lounge\", from the original French \"chaise longue\" (\"long chair\"), has come to be associated with the word \"lounge\".\n\nRebracketing is a process of language change in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *\"ham\" in \"hamburger\") are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word \"ham\"). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the Old French word \"orenge\" (\"orange tree\") comes from Arabic \"an nāranj\" (\"the orange tree\"), with the initial \"n\" of \"nāranj\" understood as part of the article.\n\nIn back-formation a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be affixes. For example, Italian \"pronuncia\" (\"pronunciation; accent\") is derived from the verb \"pronunciare\" (\"to pronounce; to utter\") and English \"edit\" derives from \"editor\". Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.\n\nIn linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation. Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.\n\nThere are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.\n\nThe spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, \"\" borrowed from Old French was variously spelled \"aundyre\" or \"aundiren\" in Middle English, but was altered by association with \"iron\". Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include \"belfry\" (from \"berfrei\") by association with \"bell\", \"female\" (from \"femelle\") by \"male\", and \"penthouse\" (from \"apentis\") by \"house\". The variant spelling of \"licorice\" as \"liquorice\" comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid. Anglo-Norman \"licoris\" (influenced by \"licor\" \"liquor\") and Late Latin \"liquirītia\" were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek \"\" (glycyrrhiza) \"sweet root\".\n\nReanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word \"cockroach\", for example, was borrowed from Spanish \"cucaracha\" but was assimilated to the existing English words \"cock\" and \"roach\". \"Jerusalem artichoke\", from Italian \"girasole\", is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to artichokes and does not come from Jerusalem. The phrase \"forlorn hope\" originally meant \"storming party, body of skirmishers\" from Dutch \"verloren hoop\" \"lost troop\". But confusion with English \"hope\" has given the term an additional meaning of \"hopeless venture\".\n\nSometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the \"serviceberry\", \"service tree\", and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name \"sorbus\". The plants were called \"syrfe\" in Old English, which eventually became \"service\". Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.\n\nA seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of \"Welsh rarebit\", a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it \"Welsh rabbit\". The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 Francis Grose suggested in \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" that the dish is \"a Welch rare bit\", though the word \"rarebit\" was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.\n\nWhen a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.\n\nSome compound words from Old English were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include \"bridegroom\" from Old English \"brydguma\" \"bride-man\". The word \"gome\" \"man\" from Old English \"guma\" fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word \"groom\" \"male servant\". A similar reanalysis caused \"sandblind\", from Old English \"sāmblind\" \"half-blind\" with a once-common prefix \"sām-\" \"semi-\", to be respelled as though it is related to \"sand\". The word \"island\" derives from Old English \"igland\". The modern spelling with the letter \"s\" is the result of comparison with the synonym \"isle\" from Old French and ultimately Latin \"insula\", though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related. In a similar way, the spelling of \"wormwood\" was likely affected by comparison with \"wood\".\n\nThe phrase \"curry favour\", meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English \"curry favel\", \"groom a chestnut horse\". This was an allusion to a fourteenth century French morality poem, \"Roman de Fauvel\", about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to \"favour\" as early as 1510.\n\nWords need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word \"shamefaced\" was originally \"shamefast\". The original meaning of \"fast\" \"fixed in place\" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as \"stuck fast\", \"hold fast\", and \"play fast and loose\". The songbird \"wheatear\" or \"white-ear\" is a back-formation from Middle English \"whit-ers\" \"white arse\", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species. Although both \"white\" and \"arse\" are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be euphemism.\n\nReanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of \"hangnail\" referred to a corn on the foot. The word comes from Old English \"ang-\" + \"nægel\" (\"anguished nail\" or \"compressed spike\"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier. Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn cuticle near a fingernail or toenail.\n\nSeveral words in Medieval Latin were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word \"widerdonum\" meaning \"reward\" was borrowed from Old High German \"widarlōn\" \"repayment of a loan\". The \"l→d\" alteration is due to confusion with Latin \"donum\" \"gift\". Similarly, the word \"baceler\" or \"bacheler\" (related to modern English \"bachelor\") referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor. This was later re-spelled \"baccalaureus\", probably reflecting a false derivation from \"bacca laurea\" \"laurel berry\", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.\n\nIn the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb \"savoir\" (\"to know\") as \"sçavoir\" on the false belief it was derived from Latin \"scire\" \"to know\". In fact it comes from \"sapere\" \"to be wise\".\n\nThe Italian word \"liocorno\" \"unicorn\" derives from 13th century \"lunicorno\" (\"lo\" \"the\" + \"unicorno\" \"unicorn\"). Folk etymology based on \"lione\" \"lion\" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal \"liofante\" \"elephant\" was likewise altered from \"elefante\" by association with \"lione\".\n\nThe Dutch word for \"hammock\" is \"hangmat\". It was borrowed from Spanish \"hamaca\" (ultimately from Arawak \"amàca\") and altered by comparison with \"hangen\" and \"mat\", \"hanging mat\". German \"Hängematte\" shares this folk etymology.\n\nThe Finnish compound word for \"jealous\" \"mustasukkainen\" literally means \"black-socked\" (\"musta\" \"black\" and \"sukka\" \"sock\"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish \"svartsjuk\" \"black-sick\". The Finnish word \"sukka\" fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish \"sjuk\"\n\"Islambol\", a folk etymology meaning \"full of Islam\", is one of the names of Istanbul used after the Ottoman conquest of 1453.\n\nAn example from Persian is the word shatranj (chess), which is derived from the Sanskrit chaturanga (2nd century BCE), and after losing the \"u\" to syncope, becomes \"chatrang\" in Middle Persian (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as \"shat\" (hundred) + \"ranj\" (worry / mood), or \"a hundred worries\".\n\n"}

In some cases the Hermitage's works have been supplemented by items from other collections, including (as in the case of \"Peter Paul Rubens: A Touch of Brilliance\") from the Courtauld Institute Gallery.\n\nIn 2005 the future of the Hermitage Rooms became uncertain after the Hermitage announced its plans to withdraw its loans of artworks overseas. This was the result of an international loan crisis prompted by the seizure in November of paintings belonging to the Pushkin Museum in Moscow as hostages in a trade dispute between a Geneva-based company and the Russian state (owners of both the Hermitage and the Pushkin).\n\nThe rooms were closed until June 2007 when a new exhibition was put into place. This ran until November 2007 and was titled \"France in Russia: Empress Josephine's Malmaison Collection\".\n\n\n"}

Before arriving in the United States, in his native Greece young Londos was a shepherd. His father, Theophilos was an amateur wrestler of considerable reputation, and is credited with having instructed his young son in some of the fundamentals. At age thirteen he ran away from home and eventually emigrated to the United States. Working whenever he could, Theofilou took several odd jobs including cabin boy, construction jobs, and posing nude for figure drawing classes. Theofilou landed a job as a catcher in a carnival acrobatic act. It was during this period that he was exposed to professional wrestling and began training.\n\nLondos' first matches, from 1912, were as \"The Wrestling Plasterer\" Christopher Theophelus, a gimmick that saw him coming to the ring in overalls. After a number of years, he dropped this in favour of wrestling under the name Jim Londos and being a no-nonsense professional wrestler.\n\nTo compensate for his lack of wrestling ability, Londos traded on his good looks and well-muscled physique. He capitalized on this by having himself matched up against the ugliest opponents he could find. This worked very well and Londos became one of the most popular wrestlers in the 1930s & early 1940s while continuing to attract large crowds until 1959.\n\nJust before his retirement he married American woman Avra C. Rochwite (1912-1998), who was born in Clayton, Montana. At the time of their marriage, Rochwite was described in press reports as a \"St. Louis Aviatrix.\" The couple had three daughters: Diana, Demetra, and Christina. The Londos family moved to Escondido, California, where they settled on a 10-acre site nestled in an avocado grove. There, Londos quietly managed his orchard and other investments; he devoted the rest of his public life to charity.\n\nLondos was considered a national hero in Greece. When he traveled there, one of his matches drew a crowd estimated as nearly 100,000 fans.\n\nLondos retired in 1953. He spent the rest of his life working for charitable organizations. His favorite charity was Greek war orphans of World War II. He was honored by both United States President Richard Nixon and King Paul of Greece for his philanthropic efforts.\n\nLondos died of a heart attack August 19, 1975 and is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park in Escondido, California.\n\n\n"}

Located in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, it is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. The mission was the headquarters of all Alta California missions from 1797 until 1833. It was headed by Saint Junípero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784. It was also the seat of the second \"presidente\", Father Fermin Francisco de Lasuen, who was in charge of completing nine more mission churches.\n\nThe mission buildings and lands were secularized by the Mexican government in 1833. They fell into disrepair by the mid-19th century. The chapel was saved from total destruction when the roof was rebuilt in 1884. In 1886, ownership of the mission was transferred from a group of Franciscans to the Diocese of Monterey. The mission has been a parish within that diocese ever since. Beginning in 1931, Harry Downie began restoring the mission and worked continuously on the project for the next 50 years. It is the only Spanish mission in California that has its original bell and bell tower.\n\nMission Carmel ( as the Carmel Mission), was the second mission built by Franciscan missionaries in Upper California. It was first established as Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, California near the native village of \"Tamo\" on June 3, 1770. It was named for Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, Italy, and was the site of the first Christian confirmation in Alta California. When the mission moved, the original building continued to operate as the Royal Presidio chapel and later became the current Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo.\n\nPedro Fages, who served as military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, kept his headquarters in the polity's capitol, at the Presidio of Monterey. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on behalf of Rages' soldiers, and the two men did not get along. Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. The soldiers raped the Indian woman and kept them as concubines. Serra wanted to put some distance between the missions neophytes and Fages' soldiers.\n\nSerra found that the land near the mouth of the Carmel River (named \"Río del Carmelo\" by Vizcaíno in 1603) was better suited for farming. In May 1771, Spain's viceroy approved Serra's petition to relocate the mission. The mission was established in the new location on August 1, 1771; the first mass was celebrated on August 24, and Serra officially took up residence in the newly constructed buildings on December 24.\n\nThe name of the relocated mission was extended to \"Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Río Carmelo\". It was within a short distance of the Rumsen Ohlone villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel. The mission was about from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen.\n\nAfter the Carmel mission was moved to Carmel Valley, the Franciscans began to baptize some natives. By the end of 1771, the population of mission was 15 with an additional 22 baptized Indians, out of a total population of northern California of 60.\n\nFarming was not very productive and for several years the mission was dependent upon the arrival of supply ships. Historian Jame Culleton wrote in 1950, \"The summer of '73 came without bringing the supply ship. Neither Carmel nor Monterey was anything like self-supporting.\"\n\nTo improve baptismal rates, they sought to convert key members of the Esselen and Rumsen tribes, including chiefs. On May 9, 1775, Junípero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, \"Pach-hepas\", who was the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. His baptism took place at Xasáuan, 10 leagues (about ) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name. This persuaded some Indians to follow them to the mission.\n\nThe Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes. In 1794, the population reached its peak of 927, but by 1823 the total had dwindled to 381. There was extensive \"comingling of the Costanoan with peoples of different linguistic and cultural background during the mission period.\"\n\nIn the beginning, the mission relied on bear meat from Mission San Antonio de Padua and supplies brought by ship from Mission San Diego de Alcalá.\n\nIn 1779, the natives Americans at Carmel Mission harvested 1660 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of barley, 165 bushels of beans, and 85 bushels of maize. Four years later, the native laborers produced enough crops to support 700 people. The mission had more than 500 cattle and sheep.\n\nCarmel mission continued to grow during most of the 18th century. The largest population was neophytes was 876 in 1795. By 1800, agriculture production at Carmel Mission was near its peak. The Mission reported to Mexico that it had 2180 horses and cattle, and 4160 smaller livestock including sheep. The total grain harvested was about 3700 bushels per year with a high of 7400 in 1797.\n\nIn December 1832, the mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,100 cattle, 3,300 sheep, 410 horses, and 8 mules.\n\n\"Mission Carmel\", as it came to be known, was Serra's favorite and, because it was close to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, he chose it as his headquarters. When he died on August 28, 1784, he was interred beneath the chapel floor. After Serra's death, Father Fermin Lasuén replaced the adobe structure with one made of stone quarried from the nearby Santa Lucia Mountains.\n\nEight months later, in August 1833, the newly independent Mexican government secularized the mission and all its lands. It stipulated that half the mission lands should be awarded to the native people, but this purpose was never accomplished. Most mission property was bought by government officials or their wealthy friends. The priests could not maintain the missions without the Indians' forced labor and the mission and lands were soon abandoned. The Indians were forced from the mission. Some attempted to return to their native ways, and others found work as ranch hands or servants on farms and ranches.\n\nBy 1850, the mission was nearly a ruin. The stone chapel building was deteriorating while most of the adobe buildings were eroding away. The roof collapsed in 1852. The U.S. federal government returned the mission and its lands to the Catholic Church in 1859.\n\nWhen Mexico ceded California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored, but required that the owners provide legal proof of their title. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany filed a claim on February 19, 1853 on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. He sought return of all former mission lands in the State. The state agreed to return the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens to the church.\n\nWhen the Roman Catholic Church gained full control of the buildings on October 19, 1859, the mission was in ruins. In 1884 Father Angel Casanova was able to gather enough private funds to replace the roof on the chapel sufficient to preserve it until the 1930s. In 1931 Monsignor Philip Scher hired master cabinet maker Henry John (\"Harry\") Downie who had an excellent reputation for restoring Spanish antiques. Scher initially asked Downie to restore some statues at the Carmel Mission but his job quickly expanded and he was put in charge of restoring the entire mission. Two years later, the church transferred the mission from the Franciscans to the local diocese and it became a regular parish church. Downie lived nearby in Carmel and worked almost daily for almost 50 years to restore the mission, ancillary buildings, walls, and grounds. He painstakingly researched the church's architecture and site, often relying on original Spanish sources, and gathered genuine artifacts from across California.\n\nHe first restored the padres' quarters, then the roof of the chapel in 1936, and over the next five years the interior of the basilica. In 1941, he oversaw restoration of the former soldiers' quarters on the east side of the quadrangle. In 1943 he began restoration of a building that had been on the south side of the quadrangle, although nothing was left but the eroded adobe foundation and a few ruined walls. The building was originally a segregated, locked dormitory for girls called the monjero (nunnery). They were separated from their families at age 8. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.\n\nThe building was reconstructed and made into classrooms for Junipero Serra Elementary School. In 1946, the ruin on the east side of the quadrangle that had been the original padre's kitchen and a blacksmith shop was rebuilt. It is used today as a chapel. Downie also consulted on the restoration of the missions that are considered the most authentic, including San Luis Obispo, San Juan Bautista, and San Buenaventura. He also helped the Native Daughters of the Golden West to reconstruct Mission Soledad. He was knighted by Pope Pius and by King Juan Carlos of Spain.\n\nIn 1960, the mission was designated as a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII. In 1987, Pope John Paul II visited the mission as part of his U.S. tour.\n\nThe original bell nicknamed Ave Maria was made in Mexico City in 1807. It was placed at the Mission in 1820. When the mission was secularized in 1834, the bell was removed and held onto by local Native Americans for safekeeping. It was finally lost and relocated once again during restoration. It was re-installed in the mission bell tower in 1925.\n\nAs a result of Downie's dedicated efforts to restore the buildings, the Carmel mission church is one of the most authentically restored of all the mission churches in California. Mission Carmel has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. It is an active parish church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey.\n\nIn addition to its activity as a place of worship, Mission Carmel also hosts concerts, art exhibits, lectures and numerous other community events. In 1986, then-pastor Monsignor Eamon MacMahon acquired a Casavant Frères organ with horizontal trumpets. Its hand-painted casework is decorated with elaborate carvings and statuary reflecting the Spanish decorative style seen on the main altar.\n\nThe mission also serves as a museum, preserving its own history and the history of the area. There are four specific museum galleries: the Harry Downie Museum, describing restoration efforts; the Munras Family Heritage Museum, describing the history of one of the most important area families; the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery, hosting rotating art exhibits as well as the monumental bronze and travertine cenotaph (1924) sculpted by Jo Mora; and the Convento Museum, which holds the cell Serra lived and died in, as well as interpretive exhibits. At one end of the museum is a special chapel room containing some of the vestments used by Serra.\n\nThe mission grounds are also the location of the Junipero Serra School, a private Catholic school for kindergartners through 8th grade.\n\nIn 2012, the Carmel Mission Foundation began a project to restore the roof of the basilica installed during a restoration in 1937. The project was the third major reconstruction of the basilica since it was built in 1797. The contractor installed additional wood and steel beams to reinforce and tie the roof structure together. To strengthen the walls, they drilled over 300 center-cored vertical and horizontal holes in the thick walls, into which they inserted steel rods that were grouted in place. The project also updated the electrical system and added a fire suppression system. The interior lighting was replaced and custom-made chandeliers were added. The project upgraded the radiant heating system and included construction of an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant restroom. The project was funded by the Carmel Mission Foundation, which raised about $6.2 million.\n\nIn 2016, the foundation funded reconstruction of the Quadrangle Courtyard at a cost of $2.0 million. The uneven, cracked concrete surface was a hazard. It was removed and new water and fire lines, drains, sewer, electrical, and communications lines were installed before a new concrete, durable concrete surface was poured.\n\nThe foundation is planning a larger $20 million project in time for the 250th anniversary of the basilica in 2020. It includes seismic retrofits, infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the several historic structures, including the Downie Museum and Orientation Center, Mora Chapel Museum, Convento Museum (including the museum store), and Blessed Sacrament Chapel.\n\nOn September 27, 2015, in response to Serra's canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized. The statue of Serra was toppled and splattered with paint, and the cemetery, the mission doors, a fountain, and a crucifix were as well. The message \"Saint of Genocide\" was put on Serra's tomb, and similar messages were painted elsewhere in the mission courtyard.\n\nSeveral notable people are buried in the church and churchyard.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United Sta\nThis is a church tecknicly"}

The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26th of January as Independence Day. The flag of India was hoisted publicly across India by Congress volunteers, nationalists and the public.\n\nBefore 1930, Indian political parties had openly embraced the goal of political independence from the United Kingdom. The All India Home Rule League had been advocating \"Home Rule\" for India: dominion status within the British Empire, as granted to Australia, Canada, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland, New Zealand, and South Africa. The All India Muslim League favoured dominion status as well, and opposed calls for outright Indian independence. The Indian Liberal Party, by far the most pro-British party, explicitly opposed India's independence and even dominion status if it weakened India's links with the British Empire. The Indian National Congress, the largest Indian political party of the time, was at the head of the national debate. Congress leader and famous poet Hasrat Mohani was the first activist to demand complete independence (Poorna Swaraj) from the British in 1921 from an All-India Congress Forum. Veteran Congress leaders such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Aurobindo and Bipin Chandra Pal had also advocated explicit Indian independence from the Empire.\n\nFollowing the 1919 Amritsar Massacre, there was considerable public outrage against British rule. Europeans, (civilians and officials) were targets and victims of violence across India. In 1920, Gandhi and the Congress committed themselves to \"Swaraj\", described as political and spiritual independence. At the time, Gandhi described this as the basic demand of all Indians; he specifically said that the question of whether India would remain within the Empire or leave it completely would be answered by the behaviour and response of the British. Between 1920 and 1922, Mahatma Gandhi led the Non-Cooperation movement: nationwide civil disobedience to oppose the Rowlatt Acts and the exclusion of Indians from the government, and the denial of political and civil freedoms.\n\nIn 1928, the British government further outraged people across India by appointing a seven-man committee led by Sir John Simon, it was an all - European commission Simon Commission to deliberate on constitutional and political reforms for India. Indian political parties were neither consulted nor asked to involve themselves in the process. Upon arrival in India, Chairman Sir John Simon and other commission members were met with angry public demonstrations, which followed them everywhere. The death of a prominent Indian leader, Lala Lajpat Rai, from severe beatings by British police officials further outraged the Indian public.\n\nThe Congress appointed an all-Indian commission to propose constitutional reforms for India. Members of other Indian political parties joined the commission led by Congress President Motilal Nehru. The Nehru Report demanded that India be granted self-government under the dominion status within the Empire. While most other Indian political parties supported the Nehru commission's work, it was opposed by the Indian Liberal Party and the All India Muslim League. The British ignored the commission, its report and refused to introduce political reform.\n\nBut the Nehru Report was also controversial within the Congress. Younger nationalist leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanded that the Congress resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British. Jawaharlal Nehru had been influenced by the idea of Bhagat Singh (\"total independence\"), which Singh had introduced a resolution demanding in 1927, which was rejected because of Gandhi's opposition. Now Bose and Nehru opposed dominion status, which would retain the Monarch of the United Kingdom as the constitutional head of state of India (although in the separate capacity as King of India), and preserve political powers for the British Parliament in Indian constitutional affairs. They were supported in their stand by a large number of rank-and-file Congressmen.\n\nIn December 1928, Congress session was held in Kolkata and Mohandas Gandhi proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years. After Some time Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one. Jawaharlal Nehru voted for the new resolution, while Subhash Bose told his supporters that he would not oppose the resolution, and abstained from voting himself. The All India Congress Committee voted 118 to 45 in its favour (the 45 votes came from supporters of a complete break from the British). However, when Bose introduced an amendment during the open session of Congress that sought a complete break with the British, Gandhi admonished the move:\n\nYou may take the name of independence on your lips but all your muttering will be an empty formula if there is no honour behind it. If you are not prepared to stand by your words, where will independence be? \n\nThe amendment was rejected, by 1350 to 973, and the resolution was fully adopted.\n\nOn 31 October 1929, the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin announced that the government would meet with Indian representatives in London for a Round Table Conference. To facilitate Indian participation, Irwin met with Mohandas Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and out-going Congress President Motilal Nehru to discuss the meeting. Gandhi asked Irwin if the conference would proceed on the basis of dominion status and Irwin said he could not assure that, resulting in the end of the meeting.\n\nAs a result of the denial of reforms and political rights, and the persistent ignorance of Indian political parties, the Indian National Congress grew increasingly cohesive – unified in the desire to oust the British from India completely. A very large number of Congress volunteers and delegates, members of other political parties and an especially large public gathering attended the session convened in Lahore. Despite the bitterly cold weather, Pattabhi Sitaramayya records that:\n\nThe heat of passion and excitement, the resentment at the failure of negotiation, the flushing of faces on hearing the war drums – oh, it was all in marked contrast to the weather.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru was elected President and veteran leaders like Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel returned to the Congress Working Committee. They approved a declaration of independence, which stated:\n\nThe British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually... Therefore...India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence.\n\nAt midnight on New Year's Eve, President Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore, which later became part of Pakistan. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of public attending the ceremony were asked if they agreed with it, and the vast majority of people were witnessed to raise their hands in approval. One hundred seventy two Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 26 January 1930. Gandhi and other Indian leaders would immediately begin the planning of a massive national non-violence would encourage the common people not to attack Britishers even if they attacked them. Subsequently, the \"Salt Satyagraha\" was initiated by Mahatma Gandhi on 12 March 1930 and what followed gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and sparked off the nationwide Non Cooperation Movement.\n\nThe resolution was a short 750-word document; it does not have a legal/constitutional structure – instead, it reads more like a manifesto. The document called for severing ties with the British and claimed ‘Purna Swaraj’ or completes independence. It indicted British rule and succinctly articulated the resulting economic, political and cultural injustice inflicted on Indians. The document spoke on behalf of Indians and made its intention of launching the civil disobedience movement clear.\n\nThere is some dispute as to who drafted the text of the declaration. Gandhi directly claimed authorship in 1940, while other sources either cite Nehru as a major editor or attribute it to Nehru outright.\n\nThe Congress regularly observed 26 January as the Independence Day of India – commemorating those who campaigned for Indian independence. In 1947, the British agreed to transfer power and political finesse to India, and 15 August became the official Independence Day. However, the new Constitution of India, as drafted and approved by the Constituent Assembly, was mandated to take effect on 26 January 1950, to commemorate the 1930 declaration. On that day in 1950, India became a republic. 26 January is now celebrated as Republic Day of India every year.\n\n"}

{"id": "36692953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36692953", "title": "Rigveda", "text": "Rigveda\n\nThe Rigveda (Sanskrit: ', from ' \"praise\" and ' \"knowledge\") is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns along with associated commentaries on liturgy, ritual and mystical exegesis. It is one of the four sacred canonical texts (\"śruti\") of Hinduism known as the Vedas. \n\nThe core text, known as the \"Rigveda Samhita\", is a collection of 1,028 hymns ('s) in about 10,600 verses (called ', eponymous of the name \"Rigveda\"), organized into ten books (\"\"s).\n\nIn the eight books that were composed the earliest, the hymns are mostly praise of specific deities. The younger books (books 1 and 10) in part also deal with philosophical or speculative questions, with the virtue of dāna (charity) in society and with other metaphysical issues in their hymns.\n\nThe oldest layers of the Rigveda Samhita are among the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language, perhaps of similar age as certain Hittite texts. Philological and linguistic evidence indicates that the bulk of the Rigveda Samhita was composed in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, most likely between 1500 and 1200 BC, although a wider approximation of 1700–1100 BC has also been given. The initial codification of the Rigveda took place during the early Kuru kingdom (c. 1200–900 BC).\n\nSome of its verses continue to be recited during Hindu rites of passage celebrations (such as weddings) and prayers, making it probably the world's oldest religious text in continued use.\n\nThe associated material has been preserved from two shakhas or \"schools\", known as \nand . The school-specific commentaries are known as Brahmanas (\"Aitareya-brahmana\" and \"Kaushitaki-brahmana\") Aranyakas (\"Aitareya-aranyaka\" and \"Kaushitaki-aranyaka\"), \nand Upanishads (partly excerpted from the Aranyakas: \"Bahvrca-brahmana-upanishad\", Aitareya-upanishad, \"Samhita-upanishad\", \"Kaushitaki-upanishad\").\n\nThe text is organized in ten \"books\", or \"maṇḍala\"s (\"circles\"), of varying age and length.\nThe text clearly originates as oral literature, and \"books\" may be a misleading term, the individual mandalas are, much rather, standalone collections of hymns that were intended to be memorized by the members of various groups of priests.\n\nThis is particularly true of the \"family books\", mandalas 2–7, which form the oldest part of the Rigveda and account for 38% of the entire text. They are called \"family books\" because each of them is attributed to an individual rishi,\nand was transmitted within the lineage of this rishi's family, or of his students. \n\nThe hymns within each of the family books are arranged in collections each dealing with a particular deity: \"Agni\" comes first, \"Indra\" comes second, and so on. They are generally arranged by decreasing number of hymns within each section.\nWithin each such collection, the hymns are arranged in descending order of the number of stanzas per hymn. If two hymns in the same collection have equal numbers of stanzas then they are arranged so that the number of syllables in the metre are in descending order. The second to seventh mandalas have a uniform format.\n\nThe eighth and ninth mandalas, comprising hymns of mixed age, account for 15% and 9%, respectively. The ninth manadala is entirely dedicated to Soma and the Soma ritual.\nThe hymns in the ninth mandala are arranged by both their prosody structure (chanda) and by their length.\n\nThe first and the tenth mandalas are the youngest; they are also the longest books, of 191 suktas each, accounting for 37% of the text. Nevertheless, some of the hymns in mandalas 8, 1 and 10 may still belong to an earlier period and may be as old as the material in the family books. \nThe first mandala has a unique arrangement not found in the other nine mandalas. The first 84 hymns of the tenth mandala have a structure different than the remaining hymns in it.\n\nEach mandala consists of hymns or 's (', literally, \"well recited, eulogy\") intended for various rituals. \nThe s in turn consist of individual stanzas called ' (\"praise\", \"pl.\" '), which are further analysed into units of verse called \"\" (\"foot\" or step).\n\nThe meters most used in the are the gayatri (3 verses of 8 syllables), anushtubh (4x8), trishtubh (4x11) and jagati (4x12). The trishtubh meter (40%) and gayatri meter (25%) dominate in the Rigveda.\n\nFor pedagogical convenience, each mandala is divided into roughly equal sections of several sūktas, called \"\" (\"recitation\"), which modern publishers often omit. \nAnother scheme divides the entire text over the 10 mandalas into ' (\"eighth\"), ' (\"chapter\") and \"\" (\"class\"). Some publishers give both classifications in a single edition.\n\nThe most common numbering scheme is by book, hymn and stanza (and pada \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" ..., if required). E.g., the first verse is in three times eight syllables (gayatri):\n\nTradition associates a rishi (the composer) with each of the Rigveda. Most sūktas are attributed to single composers. The \"family books\" (2–7) are so-called because they have hymns by members of the same clan in each book; but other clans are also represented in the Rigveda. In all, 10 families of rishis account for more than 95% of the ; for each of them the Rigveda includes a lineage-specific \"\" hymn (a special sūkta of rigidly formulaic structure, used for rituals.\n\nThe original text (as authored by the Rishis) is close to but not identical to the extant \"Samhitapatha\", but metrical and other observations allow reconstruction (in part at least) of the original text from the extant one, as printed in the Harvard Oriental Series, vol. 50 (1994).\n\nThe surviving form of the Rigveda is based on an early Iron Age collection that established the core 'family books' (mandalas 2–7, ordered by author, deity and meter ) and a later redaction, co-eval with the redaction of the other Vedas, dating several centuries after the hymns were composed. This redaction also included some additions (contradicting the strict ordering scheme) and orthoepic changes to the Vedic Sanskrit such as the regularization of sandhi (termed \"orthoepische Diaskeuase\" by Oldenberg, 1888).\n\nAs with the other Vedas, the redacted text has been handed down in several versions, most importantly the \"Padapatha\", in which each word is isolated in pausa form and is used for just one way of memorization; and the \"Samhitapatha\", which combines words according to the rules of sandhi (the process being described in the \"Pratisakhya\") and is the memorized text used for recitation.\n\nThe \"Padapatha\" and the \"Pratisakhya\" anchor the text's true meaning, and the fixed text was preserved with unparalleled fidelity for more than a millennium by oral tradition alone. In order to achieve this the oral tradition prescribed very structured enunciation, involving breaking down the Sanskrit compounds into stems and inflections, as well as certain permutations. This interplay with sounds gave rise to a scholarly tradition of morphology and phonetics. The Rigveda was probably not written down until the Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries AD), by which time the Brahmi script had become widespread (the oldest surviving manuscripts are from AD ~1040, discovered in Nepal). The oral tradition still continued into recent times.\nThere is a widely accepted timeframe for the initial codification of the \"Rigveda\" by compiling the hymns very late in the Rigvedic or rather in the early post-Rigvedic period, including the arrangement of the individual hymns in ten books, coeval with the composition of the younger Veda Samhitas. This time coincides with the early Kuru kingdom, shifting the center of Vedic culture east from the Punjab into what is now Uttar Pradesh. \nThe fixing of the samhitapatha (by enforcing regular application of sandhi) and of the padapatha (by dissolving Sandhi out of the earlier metrical text), occurred during the later Brahmana period, in roughly the 6th century BC.\n\nSeveral shakhas (\"branches\", i. e. recensions) of Rig Veda are known to have existed in the past. Of these, Śākalya is the only one to have survived in its entirety. Another shakha that may have survived is the Bāṣkala, although this is uncertain.\n\nThe surviving padapatha version of the Rigveda text is ascribed to Śākalya. The recension has 1,017 regular hymns, and an appendix of 11 \"\" hymns which are now customarily included in the 8th mandala (as 8.49–8.59), for a total of 1028 hymns. The recension includes 8 of these hymns among its regular hymns, making a total of 1025 regular hymns for this śākhā. In addition, the recension has its own appendix of 98 hymns, the Khilani.\n\nIn the 1877 edition of Aufrecht, the 1028 hymns of the Rigveda contain a total of 10,552 s, or 39,831 padas. The Shatapatha Brahmana gives the number of syllables to be 432,000, while the metrical text of van Nooten and Holland (1994) has a total of 395,563 syllables (or an average of 9.93 syllables per pada); counting the number of syllables is not straightforward because of issues with sandhi and the post-Rigvedic pronunciation of syllables like súvar as svàr.\n\nThree other shakhas are mentioned in \"Caraṇavyuha\", a pariśiṣṭa (supplement) of Yajurveda: Māṇḍukāyana, Aśvalāyana and Śaṅkhāyana. The Atharvaveda lists two more shakhas. The differences between all these shakhas are very minor, limited to varying order of content and inclusion (or non-inclusion) of a few verses. The following information is known about the shakhas other than Śākalya and Bāṣkala:\n\n\nWriting appears in India around the 3rd century BC in the form of the Brāhmī script, but texts of the length of the Rigveda were likely not written down until much later, and the oldest extant manuscripts date to AD ~1040, discovered in Nepal. While written manuscripts were used for teaching in medieval times, they were written on birch bark or palm leaves, which decompose and therefore were routinely copied over the generations to help preserve the text. Some Rigveda commentaries may date from the second half of the first millennium AD. The hymns were thus composed and preserved by oral tradition for several millennia from the time of their composition until the redaction of the Rigveda, and the entire Rigveda was preserved in shakhas for another 2,500 years from the time of its redaction until the \"editio princeps\" by Rosen, Aufrecht and Max Müller.\n\nThere are, for example, 30 manuscripts of Rigveda at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, collected in the 19th century by Georg Bühler, Franz Kielhorn and others, originating from different parts of India, including Kashmir, Gujarat, the then Rajaputana, Central Provinces etc. They were transferred to Deccan College, Pune, in the late 19th century. They are in the Sharada and Devanagari scripts, written on birch bark and paper. The oldest of them is dated to 1464. The 30 manuscripts of Rigveda preserved at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune were added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2007.\n\nOf these 30 manuscripts, 9 contain the samhita text, 5 have the padapatha in addition. 13 contain Sayana's commentary. At least 5 manuscripts (MS. no. 1/A1879-80, 1/A1881-82, 331/1883-84 and 5/Viś I) have preserved the complete text of the Rigveda. MS no. 5/1875-76, written on birch bark in bold Sharada, was only in part used by Max Müller for his edition of the Rigveda with Sayana's commentary.\n\nMüller used 24 manuscripts then available to him in Europe, while the Pune Edition used over five dozen manuscripts, but the editors of Pune Edition could not procure many manuscripts used by Müller and by the Bombay Edition, as well as from some other sources; hence the total number of extant manuscripts known then must surpass perhaps eighty at least.\n\nThe various Rigveda manuscripts discovered so far show some differences. Broadly, the most studied Śākala recension has 1017 hymns, includes an appendix of eleven \"valakhīlya\" hymns which are often counted with the 8th mandala, for a total of 1,028 metrical hymns. The Bāṣakala version of Rigveda includes eight of these \"vālakhilya\" hymns among its regular hymns, making a total of 1025 hymns in the main text for this śākhā. The Bāṣakala text also has an appendix of 98 hymns, called the \"Khilani\", bringing the total to 1,123 hymns. The manuscripts of Śākala recension of the Rigveda have about 10,600 verses, organized into ten Books (\"Mandalas\"). Books 2 through 7 are internally homogeneous in style, while Books 1, 8 and 10 are compilation of verses of internally different styles suggesting that these books are likely a collection of compositions by many authors.\n\nThe first mandala is the largest, with 191 hymns and 2,006 verses, and it was added to the text after Books 2 through 9. The last, or the 10th Book, also has 191 hymns but 1,754 verses, making it the second largest. The language analytics suggest the 10th Book, chronologically, was composed and added last. The content of the 10th Book also suggest that the authors knew and relied on the contents of the first nine books.\n\nThe Rigveda is the largest of the four Vedas, and many of its verses appear in the other Vedas. Almost all of the 1,875 verses found in Samaveda are taken from different parts of the Rigveda, either once or as repetition, and rewritten in a chant song form. The Books 8 and 9 of the Rigveda are by far the largest source of verses for Sama Veda. The Book 10 contributes the largest number of the 1,350 verses of Rigveda found in Atharvaveda, or about one fifth of the 5,987 verses in the Atharvaveda text. A bulk of 1,875 ritual-focussed verses of Yajurveda, in its numerous versions, also borrow and build upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda.\n\nAltogether the Rigveda consists of:\nIn western usage, \"Rigveda\" usually refers to the Rigveda Samhita, while the Brahmanas are referred to as the \"Rigveda Brahmanas\" (etc.). Technically speaking, however, \"the Rigveda\" refers to the entire body of texts transmitted along with the Samhita portion. Different bodies of commentary were transmitted in the different shakhas or \"schools\".\nOnly a small portion of these texts has been preserved: The texts of only two out of five shakhas mentioned by the Rigveda Pratishakhya have survived.\nThe late (15th or 16th century) \"Shri Guru Charitra\" even claims the existence of twelve Rigvedic shakhas.\nThe two surviving Rigvedic corpora are those of the \" Śākala\" and the \" Bāṣkala\" shakhas.\n\nThe Rigvedic hymns are dedicated to various deities, chief of whom are Indra, a heroic god praised for having slain his enemy Vrtra; Agni, the sacrificial fire; and Soma, the sacred potion or the plant it is made from. Equally prominent gods are the Adityas or Asura gods Mitra–Varuna and Ushas (the dawn). Also invoked are Savitr, Vishnu, Rudra, Pushan, Brihaspati or Brahmanaspati, as well as deified natural phenomena such as Dyaus Pita (the shining sky, Father Heaven), Prithivi (the earth, Mother Earth), Surya (the sun god), Vayu or Vata (the wind), Apas (the waters), Parjanya (the thunder and rain), Vac (the word), many rivers (notably the Sapta Sindhu, and the Sarasvati River). The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Sadhyas, Ashvins, Maruts, Rbhus, and the Vishvadevas (\"all-gods\") as well as the \"thirty-three gods\" are the groups of deities mentioned.\n\n\nOf the Brahmanas that were handed down in the schools of the \"\" (i.e. \"possessed of many verses\"), as the followers of the Rigveda are called, two have come down to us, namely those of the Aitareyins and the Kaushitakins. The \"Aitareya-brahmana\" and the \"Kaushitaki-\" (or \"Sankhayana-\") \"brahmana\" evidently have for their groundwork the same stock of traditional exegetic matter. They differ, however, considerably as regards both the arrangement of this matter and their stylistic handling of it, with the exception of the numerous legends common to both, in which the discrepancy is comparatively slight. There is also a certain amount of material peculiar to each of them.\nThe Kaushitaka is, upon the whole, far more concise in its style and more systematic in its arrangement features which would lead one to infer that it is probably the more modern work of the two. It consists of thirty chapters (\"adhyaya\"); while the Aitareya has forty, divided into eight books (or pentads, \"pancaka\"), of five chapters each. The last ten adhyayas of the latter work are, however, clearly a later addition though they must have already formed part of it at the time of Pāṇini (c. 5th century BC), if, as seems probable, one of his grammatical sutras, regulating the formation of the names of Brahmanas, consisting of thirty and forty adhyayas, refers to these two works. In this last portion occurs the well-known legend (also found in the Shankhayana-sutra, but not in the Kaushitaki-brahmana) of Shunahshepa, whom his father Ajigarta sells and offers to slay, the recital of which formed part of the inauguration of kings.\n\nWhile the Aitareya deals almost exclusively with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushitaka, in its first six chapters, treats of the several kinds of \"haviryajna\", or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, etc., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7–10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11–30 the recitations (\"shastra\") of the hotar. Sayana, in the introduction to his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya (i.e. son of Itara), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the opinion of the sage Kaushitaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it is just what one of the manuscripts calls it—the Brahmana of Sankhayana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushitaki.\n\nEach of these two Brahmanas is supplemented by a \"forest book\", or Aranyaka. The \"Aitareyaranyaka\" is not a uniform production. It consists of five books (\"aranyaka\"), three of which, the first and the last two, are of a liturgical nature, treating of the ceremony called \"mahavrata\", or great vow. The last of these books, composed in sutra form, is, however, doubtless of later origin, and is, indeed, ascribed by Hindu authorities either to Shaunaka or to Ashvalayana. The second and third books, on the other hand, are purely speculative, and are also styled the \"Bahvrca-brahmana-upanishad\". Again, the last four chapters of the second book are usually singled out as the Aitareya Upanishad, ascribed, like its Brahmana (and the first book), to Mahidasa Aitareya; and the third book is also referred to as the \"Samhita-upanishad\". As regards the \"Kaushitaki-aranyaka\", this work consists of 15 adhyayas, the first two (treating of the mahavrata ceremony) and the 7th and 8th of which correspond to the 1st, 5th, and 3rd books of the Aitareyaranyaka, respectively, whilst the four adhyayas usually inserted between them constitute the highly interesting Kaushitaki (Brahmana-) Upanishad, of which we possess two different recensions. The remaining portions (9–15) of the Aranyaka treat of the vital airs, the internal Agnihotra, etc., ending with the \"vamsha\", or succession of teachers.\n\nThe Vedic Sanskrit text of the redacted version of the Rig Veda was transmitted remarkably unchanged, preserving, apart from certain prosodic changes (the systematic application of sandhi rules) the linguistic stage of the Late Bronze Age.\nBecause of the faithful preservation of the text, the language was no longer immediately understandable to scholars of Classical Sanskrit by about 500 BC, necessitating commentaries interpreting the meaning of the text of the hymns. \nThe Brahmanas contain numerous misinterpretations, due to this linguistic change, some of which were characterised by Sri Aurobindo as \"grotesque nonsense.\"\n\nThe earliest text were composed in greater Punjab (northwest India and Pakistan), and the more philosophical later texts were most likely composed in or around the region that is the modern era state of Haryana.\n\nPhilological estimates tend to date the bulk of the text to the second half of the second millennium.\n\nBeing composed in an early Indo-Aryan language, the hymns must post-date the Indo-Iranian separation, dated to roughly 2000 BC. A reasonable date close to that of the composition of the core of the Rigveda is that of the Mitanni documents of c. 1400 BC, which contain Indo-Aryan nomenclature. Other evidence also points to a composition close to 1400 BC.\n\nThe Rigveda's core is accepted to date to the late Bronze Age, making it one of the few examples with an unbroken tradition. Its composition is usually dated to roughly between c. 1500–1200 BC.\n\nThe \"Rigveda\" is far more archaic than any other Indo-Aryan text. For this reason, it was in the center of attention of western scholarship from the times of Max Müller and Rudolf Roth onwards. The \"Rigveda\" records an early stage of Vedic religion. There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the early Iranian Avesta, deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian times, often associated with the early Andronovo culture (or rather, the Sintashta culture within the early Andronovo horizon) of c. 2000 BC.\n\nThe Rigveda offers no direct evidence of social or political system in Vedic era, whether ordinary or elite. Only hints such as cattle raising and horse racing are discernible, and the text offers very general ideas about the ancient Indian society. There is no evidence, state Jamison and Brereton, of any elaborate, pervasive or structured caste system. Social stratification seems embryonic, then and later a social ideal rather than a social reality. The society was pastoral with evidence of agriculture since hymns mention plow and celebrate agricultural divinities. There was division of labor, and complementary relationship between kings and poet-priests but no discussion of relative status of social classes. Women in Rigveda appear disproportionately as speakers in dialogue hymns, both as mythical or divine Indrani, Apsaras Urvasi, or Yami, as well as Apāla Ātreyī (RV 8.91), Godhā (RV 10.134.6), Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī (RV 10.39.40), Romaśā (RV 1.126.7), Lopāmudrā (RV 1.179.1-2), Viśvavārā Ātreyī (RV 5.28), Śacī Paulomī (RV 10.159), Śaśvatī Āṅgirasī (RV 8.1.34). The women of Rigveda are quite outspoken and appear more sexually confident than men, in the text. Elaborate and esthetic hymns on wedding suggest rites of passage had developed during the Rigvedic period. There is little evidence of dowry and no evidence of sati in it or related Vedic texts.\n\nThe Rigvedic hymns mention rice and porridge, in hymns such as 8.83, 8.70, 8.77 and 1.61 in some versions of the text, however there is no discussion of rice cultivation. The term \"ayas\" (metal) occurs in the Rigveda, but it is unclear which metal it was. Iron is not mentioned in Rigveda, something scholars have used to help date Rigveda to have been composed before 1000 BC. Hymn 5.63 mentions \"metal cloaked in gold\", suggesting metal working had progressed in the Vedic culture.\n\nSome of the names of gods and goddesses found in the \"Rigveda\" are found amongst other belief systems based on Proto-Indo-European religion, while words used share common roots with words from other Indo-European languages.\n\nThe horse (ashva), cattle, sheep and goat play an important role in the Rigveda. There are also references to the elephant (Hastin, Varana), camel (Ustra, especially in Mandala 8), ass (khara, rasabha), buffalo (Mahisa), wolf, hyena, lion (Simha), mountain goat (sarabha) and to the gaur in the Rigveda. The peafowl (mayura), the goose (hamsa) and the chakravaka (\"Tadorna ferruginea\") are some birds mentioned in the Rigveda.\n\nThe Vedas as a whole are classed as \"shruti\" in Hindu tradition.\nThis has been compared to the concept of divine revelation in Western religious tradition, \nbut Staal argues that \"it is nowhere stated that the Veda was revealed\", and that \"shruti\" simply means \"that what is heard, in the sense that it is transmitted from father to son or from teacher to pupil\". \nThe Rigveda, or other Vedas, do not anywhere assert that they are apauruṣeyā, and this reverential term appears only centuries after the end of the Vedic period in the texts of the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy. \nThe text of Rigveda suggests it was \"composed by poets, human individuals whose names were household words\" in the Vedic age, states Staal.\n\nBy the period of Puranic Hinduism, in the medieval period, the language of the hymns had become \"almost entirely unintelligible\", and their interpretation mostly hinged on mystical ideas and sound symbolism.\n\nAccording to Hindu tradition, the Rigvedic hymns along with the other Vedas, the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Puranas\" were compiled by sage . According to the \"\", the number of syllables in the \"Rigveda\" is 432,000, but the surviving Rigveda does not confirm this number. The Rigveda does have embedded numerical patterns such as 10,800 stanzas, which corresponds to 30 times 360, and a fourth of 432 that appears in many Hindu contexts (108 Upanishads). The \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" claims that there are 10,800,000 stars in the sky. According to Thomas McEvilley, an Art Historian and academic who compared Greek and Indian literature, the numbers such as 432 and 108 may be of significance to the Hindus, but many numerology claims do not verify and the \"believer is left with the consolation of thinking that the missing\" are there \"but unmanifest\".\n\nThe authors of the literature discussed and interpreted the Vedic ritual. Yaska was an early commentator of the \"Rigveda\" by discussing the meanings of difficult words. In the 14th century, wrote an exhaustive commentary on it.\n\nA number of other commentaries (\"s\") were written during the medieval period, including the commentaries by Skandasvamin (pre-Sayana, roughly of the Gupta period), Udgitha (pre-Sayana), Venkata-Madhava (pre-Sayana, c. 10th to 12th centuries) and Mudgala Purana (after Sayana, an abbreviated version of Sayana's commentary).\n\nIn the 19th- and early 20th-centuries, some reformers like Swami Dayananda Saraswati – founder of the Arya Samaj, Sri Aurobindo – founder of Sri Aurobindo Ashram, discussed the Vedas, including the Rig veda, for their philosophies. According to Robson, Dayanand believed \"there were no errors in the Vedas (including the Rigveda), and if anyone showed him an error, he would maintain that it was a corruption added later\".\n\nDayananda and Aurobindo interpret the Vedic scholars had a monotheistic conception. Aurobindo attempted to interpret hymns to Agni in the \"Rigveda\" as mystical. Aurobindo states that the Vedic hymns were a quest after a higher truth, define the \"Rta\" (basis of Dharma), conceive life in terms of a struggle between the forces of light and darkness, and sought the ultimate reality.\n\nRigveda, in contemporary Hinduism, has been a reminder of the ancient cultural heritage and point of pride for Hindus, with some hymns still in use in major rites of passage ceremonies, but the literal acceptance of most of the textual essence is long gone. Louis Renou wrote that the text is a distant object, and \"even in the most orthodox domains, the reverence to the Vedas has come to be a simple raising of the hat\". Musicians and dance groups celebrate the text as a mark of Hindu heritage, through incorporating Rigvedic hymns in their compositions, such as in \"Hamsadhvani\" and \"Subhapantuvarali\" of Carnatic music, and these have remained popular among the Hindus for decades. However, the contemporary Hindu beliefs are distant from the precepts in the ancient layer of Rigveda samhitas:\nIn contemporary Hindu nationalism, the Rigveda has also been adduced in the \"Indigenous Aryans\" debate (see Out of India theory). These theories are controversial.\n\nWhile the older hymns of the Rigveda reflect sacrifical ritual typical of polytheism, \nits younger parts, specifically mandalas 1 and 10, have been noted as containing monistic or henotheistic speculations.\nA widely-cited example of such speculations is hymn 1.164.46:\nMax Muller notably introduced the term \"henotheism\" for the philosophy expressed here, avoiding the connotations of \"monotheism\" in Judeo-Christian tradition. \nOther widely-cited examples of monistic tendencies include hymns 1.164, 8.36 and 10.31, Other scholars state that Rigveda includes an emerging diversity of thought, including monotheism, polytheism, henotheism and pantheism, the choice left to the preference of the worshipper. and the Nasadiya Sukta (10.129), one of the most widely cited Rigvedic hymns in popular western presentations. \n\nRuse (2015) commented on the old discussion of \"monotheism\" vs. \"henotheism\" vs. \"monism\" by noting an \"atheistic streak\" in hymns such as .\n\nExamples from Mandala 1 adduced to illustrate the \"metaphysical\" nature of the contents of the younger hymns include:\n1.164.34: \"What is the ultimate limit of the earth?\", \"What is the center of the universe?\", \"What is the semen of the cosmic horse?\", \"What is the ultimate source of human speech?\";\n1.164.34: \"Who gave blood, soul, spirit to the earth?\", \"How could the unstructured universe give origin to this structured world?\";\n1.164.5: \"Where does the sun hide in the night?\", \"Where do gods live?\";\n1.164.6: \"What, where is the unborn support for the born universe?\";\n.20 (a hymn that is widely cited in the Upanishads as the parable of the Body and the Soul): \"Two birds with fair wings, inseparable companions; Have found refuge in the same sheltering tree. One incessantly eats from the fig tree; the other, not eating, just looks on.\".\n\nThe first published translation of any portion of the Rigveda in any European language was into Latin, by Friedrich August Rosen (\"Rigvedae specimen\", London 1830). Predating Müller's \"editio princeps\" of the text by 19 years, Rosen was working from manuscripts brought back from India by Colebrooke. H. H. Wilson was the first to make a complete translation of the Rig Veda into English, published in six volumes during the period 1850–88. Wilson's version was based on the commentary of . Müller's Rig Veda Sanhita in 6 volumes Muller, Max, ed. (W. H. Allen and Co., London, 1849) has an English preface The birch bark from which Müller produced his translation is held at The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune, India.\nLike all archaic texts, the Rigveda is difficult to translate into modern language, \"There are no closely contemporary extant texts, which makes it difficult to interpret.\" \nand early translations contained straightforward errors. \nAnother issue is the choice of translation for technical terms such as \"mandala\", conventionally translated \"book\", but more literally rendered \"cycle\". \n\nSome notable translations of the Rig Veda include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He took a First in Classical Moderations in 1854 and a First in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1856. In 1858 he became fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and in 1870 professor of Latin at University College, London. In 1876 he returned to Oxford, where from 1883 to 1893 he held the university readership in Latin. In 1893 he succeeded Henry Nettleship as Corpus Professor of Latin.\n\nHis chief work was on Catullus, whom he began to study in 1859. In the course of his research he used an important early manuscript of Catullus, named the \"Codex Oxoniensis\" (many sources credit him with a discovery here, but that exact codex is already mentioned in an edition of Catullus made by Friedrich Wilhelm Doering in 1822). However, Ellis did not recognise the importance of that codex, and failed to consult it for his \"Commentary on Catullus\" (1876), thereby attracting criticism (Emil Baehrens first recognised the importance of the Oxoniensis and published his conclusions two years earlier, in 1874). In 1889 Ellis produced a second, enlarged edition, which resulted its author's recognition as an authority on Catullus. Professor Ellis quoted largely from the early Italian commentators, maintaining that the land where the Renaissance originated had done more for scholarship than is commonly recognized. He supplemented his critical work by a translation (1871, dedicated to Alfred Tennyson), \"The Poems and Fragments of Catullus in the Metres of the Original\".\n\nAnother author to whom Professor Ellis devoted many years' study was Manilius, the astrological poet. In 1891 he published \"Noctes Manilianae\", a series of dissertations on the \"Astronomica\", with emendations. He also treated Avianus, Velleius Paterculus and the Christian poet Orientius, whose poem \"Commonitorium\" he edited for the \"Vienna Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum\". He edited the \"Ibis\" of Ovid, the \"Aetna\" of the younger Lucilius, and contributed to the \"Anecdota Oxoniensia\" various unedited Bodleian and other manuscripts. In 1907 he published \"Appendix Vergiliana\" (an edition of the minor poems); in 1908 \"The Annalist Licinianus\".\n\n"}
{"id": "466528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=466528", "title": "Somerset House", "text": "Somerset House\n\nSomerset House is a large Neoclassical building situated on the south side of the Strand in central London, overlooking the River Thames, just east of Waterloo Bridge. The Georgian building, which was built on the site of a Tudor palace belonging to the Duke of Somerset, was designed by Sir William Chambers in 1776. It was further extended with Victorian wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively. The East Wing is now part of the adjacent Strand campus of King's College London. Somerset House stood directly on the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment was built in the late 1860s. \n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Strand, the north bank of the Thames between the City of London and the Palace of Westminster was a favoured site for the mansions of bishops and aristocrats, who could commute from their own landing stages upriver to the court or downriver to the City and beyond. In 1539, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (died 1552), obtained a grant of land at \"Chester Place, outside Temple Bar, London\" from his brother-in-law King Henry VIII. When his nephew the young King Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, Seymour became Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector. In about 1549 he pulled down an old Inn of Chancery and other houses which stood on the site and began to build himself a palatial residence, making liberal use of other nearby buildings including some of the chantry chapels and cloisters at St Paul's Cathedral, which were demolished partly at his behest as part of the ongoing dissolution of the monasteries. It was a two-storey house built around a quadrangle with a gateway rising to three storeys and was one of the earliest examples of Renaissance architecture in England. It is not known who designed the building.\n\nBefore it was finished, however, the Duke of Somerset was overthrown, attainted by Parliament and in 1552 was executed on Tower Hill. Somerset Place, as the building was referred to, then came into the possession of the Crown. The duke's royal nephew's half-sister, the future Queen Elizabeth I, lived there during the reign of her half-sister Queen Mary I (1553–1558). The process of completion and improvement was slow and costly. As late as 1598 John Stow refers to it as \"yet unfinished\".\n\nIn the 17th century, the house was used as a residence by queens consort. During the reign of King James I, the building became the London residence of his wife, Anne of Denmark, and was renamed Denmark House. She commissioned a number of expensive additions and improvements, some to designs by Inigo Jones. In particular, during the period between 1630 and 1635, he built a chapel where Henrietta Maria of France, wife of King Charles I, could exercise her Roman Catholic religion. This was in the care of the Capuchin Order and was on a site to the southwest of the Great Court. A small cemetery was attached and some of the tombstones are still to be seen built into one of the walls of a passage under the present quadrangle.\n\nRoyal occupation of Somerset House was interrupted by the Civil War, and in 1649 Parliament tried to sell it. They failed to find a buyer, although a sale of the contents realised the very considerable sum (for that time) of £118,000. Use was still found for it however. Part of it served as an army headquarters, with General Fairfax (the Parliamentarians' commander-in-chief) being given official quarters there; lodgings were also provided for certain other Parliamentarian notables. It was in Somerset House that Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell's body lay in state after his death in 1658.\n\nTwo years later, with the Restoration, Queen Henrietta Maria returned and in 1661 began a considerable programme of rebuilding, the main feature of which was a magnificent new river front, again to the design of the late Inigo Jones, who had died at Somerset House in 1652. However she returned to France in 1665 before it was finished. It was then used as an occasional residence by Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II. During her time it received a certain notoriety as being, in the popular mind, a hot-bed of Catholic conspiracy. Titus Oates made full use of this prejudice in the fabricated details of the Popish Plot and it was alleged that Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, whose murder was one of the great mysteries of the age, had been killed in Somerset House before his body had been smuggled out and thrown into a ditch below Primrose Hill.\n\nSomerset House was refurbished by Sir Christopher Wren in 1685. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Somerset House entered on a long period of decline, being used (after Queen Catherine left England in 1692) for grace and favour residences. In the conditions of the time this meant almost inevitably that little money could be found for its upkeep, and a slow process of decay crept in. During the 18th century, however, the building ceased its royal associations. Though the view from its terraced riverfront garden, open to the public, was painted twice on his London visit by Canaletto (looking up- and downriver), it was used for storage, as a residence for visiting overseas dignitaries and as a barracks for troops. Suffering from neglect, Old Somerset House began to be demolished in 1775.\n\nSince the middle of the 18th century there had been growing criticism that London had no great public buildings. Government departments and the learned societies were huddled away in small old buildings all over the city. Developing national pride found comparison with the capitals of continental Europe disquieting. Edmund Burke was the leading proponent of the scheme for a \"national building\", and in 1775 Parliament passed an act for the purpose of, \"inter alia\", \"erecting and establishing Offices in Somerset House, and for embanking Parts of the River Thames lying within the bounds of the Manor of Savoy\". The list of public offices mentioned in the act comprised \"The Salt Office, The Stamp Office, The Tax Office, The Navy Office, The Navy Victualling Office, The Publick Lottery Office, The Hawkers and Pedlar Office, The Hackney Coach Office, The Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, The Auditors of the Imprest Office, The Pipe Office, The Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, The Office of the Duchy of Cornwall, The Office of Ordnance, The King's Bargemaster's House, The King's Bargehouses\".\n\nSomerset House was still technically a royal palace and therefore Crown property. By an earlier Act of Parliament, it had been placed in trust for the use of Queen Charlotte in the event that her husband King George III predeceased her. Therefore the 1775 act annulled this arrangement and instead provided for another property, Buckingham House, to be vested in trust for the Queen on the same terms. (Provision was made for the King, who had privately purchased Buckingham House some years earlier, to be duly compensated). In due course, the King outlived the Queen and the property (later known as Buckingham Palace) reverted 'to the use of His Majesty, his heirs and successors'.\n\nSir William Chambers, Surveyor-General of Works, was appointed at a salary of £2,000 per year to design and build the new Somerset House. He spent the last two decades of his life, beginning in 1775, in several phases of building at the present Somerset House. Thomas Telford, then a stonemason, but later an eminent civil engineer, was among those who worked on its construction. One of Chambers's most famous pupils, Thomas Hardwick Jnr, helped build parts of the building during his period of training and later wrote a short biography of Chambers. By 1780 the North Wing, fronting the Strand, was complete; its design was based on Inigo Jones's drawings for the riverfront of the former building. Construction of the riverside wing followed; it was completed in 1786 and the East and West Wings were occupied from 1788.\n\nIt is not certain at what pace the rest of the construction progressed, but it is clear that the outbreak of war with France in 1793 caused delays through lack of money. Chambers died in 1796, whereupon James Wyatt took over as architect. By 1801 the building was deemed to be complete, but there are indications that as late as 1819 some decorative work still needed to be completed. The building (which did not yet include the \"New Wing\" and King's College, situated behind the West and East Wings of the quadrangle respectively) cost £462,323.\n\nAt the time of construction, the Thames was not embanked and the river lapped the South Wing, where a great arch allowed boats and barges to penetrate to landing places within the building. The design influenced other great buildings: Charles Bulfinch's Massachusetts State House, begun in 1795, has been described as a work \"frankly derivative\" of Somerset House.\n\nThe North Wing of Somerset House was initially fitted out to house the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. The Royal Academy took up residence first, in 1779, followed by the other two institutions the following year. The Royal Academy occupied the western half of the wing and the Royal Society the eastern half; their main entrances faced each other across the central vestibule leading from the Strand to the courtyard, topped by busts (of Michelangelo and Isaac Newton respectively) which are still in place today. The Society of Antiquaries was also accommodated in the eastern half of the wing, though its premises were limited to a first-floor meeting room, a ground-floor library, an apartment in the attic and a kitchen in the basement.\n\nThe Geological Society was also accommodated in the Somerset House from 1828, as was the Royal Astronomical Society from 1834.\n\nThe annual Royal Academy Exhibition was held in Somerset House from 1780 onwards, until the Academy moved out in 1837 (initially to rooms in the new National Gallery, then to Burlington House, Piccadilly). Its former accommodation was given over to a newly-established Government School of Design (which was much later to become the Royal College of Art); it remained in the complex from 1837 until, in 1853, the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths needed to expand its office space and the School relocated to Marlborough House.\n\nIn 1857, the Royal Society moved out of Somerset House, followed in 1874 by the Society of Antiquaries, the Geological Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; they were all provided with new purpose-built accommodation in Burlington House.\n\nA key reason for rebuilding Somerset House was to provide accommodation for a diverse variety of government offices.\n\nIn 1789 the Navy Board moved into grand riverside rooms in the western half of the newly-completed South Wing. It was soon followed by its subsidiary Boards, the Victualling Commissioners and the Sick and Hurt Commissioners, which (along with the Navy Pay Office) occupied the West Wing; they had all hitherto been based in the City of London. Thus the various Navy offices occupied around a third of Chambers' completed building.\n\nIn 1832 the Navy Board and its subsidiaries were abolished and their departments placed under the direct oversight of the Admiralty. Their administrative staff remained in Somerset House, but communications with the Admiralty (based a mile away in Whitehall) were problematic as what became known as the 'civil departments' of the Admiralty guarded their independence. In 1868, the Admiralty took the decision to move all their staff from Somerset House to Whitehall; this necessitated reconfiguring what had been a set of residences there pertaining to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty into office accommodation. Nevertheless, the move was completed by 1873, and the expanding Inland Revenue immediately took over the vacated space in Somerset House.\n\nFrom the beginning of the new Somerset House there was a fiscal presence in the shape of the Stamp Office and the Tax Office, the former occupying the eastern part of the South Wing from 1789 and the latter occupying part of the East Wing. The Stamp Office had the task of applying an impressed duty stamp to various specific items to show that the required duty had been paid. For example, up until 1855 (when the relevant duty was abolished) every newspaper produced in the country had to be brought to Somerset House to be stamped. The Tax Office administered and collected various taxes, including income tax (first levied in 1799). Introduced as a means of raising revenue in wartime, it was collected during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars; though repealed in 1816, it was reintroduced in peacetime (in 1842) and has been collected ever since.\n\nThe Inland Revenue was created by a merger of the Stamp and Taxes Office and the Excise Office in 1849; in 1854 the Excise Office staff were moved from their old headquarters in the City of London into the newly-built New Wing.\n\nSomerset House continued in use by the Inland Revenue throughout the 20th century. In 2005, the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise; its successor HM Revenue & Customs continued to occupy much of the building, although its executive and senior management moved to 100 Parliament Street shortly after the merger. Various divisions and directorates of HMRC continued to occupy the East Wing until 2009, the West Wing until 2011 and the New Wing until March 2013, by which time all staff had been relocated (with most moving across the street to the southwest wing of Bush House). This brought to an end a 224-year association of the revenue services with Somerset House.\n\nIn 1837, following the establishment of civil registration in the United Kingdom, the Registrar General of Births, Marriages and Deaths set up his office in the North Wing of Somerset House, establishing a connection that lasted for over 130 years. This office held all birth, marriage and death certificates in England and Wales until 1970, when the Registry and its associated archives were moved to nearby St Catherine's House at Aldwych.\n\nIn 1842, the Excise Office had established a laboratory within its Broad Street headquarters for the prevention of the adulteration of tobacco products. It had started as basically a one-man operation by an employee of the Excise, George Phillips. After the Excise Office had been merged with the Office of Stamps and Taxes to form the Inland Revenue, the latter took over the laboratory; by 1858 it was reestablished in Somerset House as the Inland Revenue Laboratory (with Phillips remaining in charge). It was also known as the Somerset House Laboratory. Under the Inland Revenue, the Laboratory's work expanded to encompass the testing of many different substances, including food, beer and spirits, as well as tobacco.\n\nPhillips retired as principal chemist in 1874. James Bell was then the principal chemist of Somerset House Laboratory until his retirement in 1894. He was replaced as principal chemist by Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe. At the same time, the laboratory was amalgamated with a similar facility that had been established within HM Customs and it was renamed the Government Laboratory. In 1897, Thorpe moved the Government Laboratory from Somerset House to a new building of his own design.\n\nIn addition to the learned societies, the ground floor rooms of the North wing housed the Hawkers and Pedlars Office (on the west side) and the Hackney Coach Office, the Lottery Office, the Privy Seal and Signet Offices (on the east side). The Hackney Coach commissioners had been established on a permanent footing in 1694, while the Board of Commissioners of Hawkers, Pedlars and Petty Chapmen dated from 1698; the latter was abolished in 1810 and its work taken over by the Hackney Coach Office until its abolition in 1831, whereupon responsibility for licensing both of hackney carriages and of travelling traders passed to the Stamp Office. The Lottery Office, established in 1779, was also abolished in 1831 and its residual business likewise passed to the Stamp Office. The Signet Office was abolished in 1851 and the Privy Seal Office in 1884.\n\nOne of the first occupants of the building had been the Duchy of Cornwall Office. It was accommodated in the East Wing along with the Tax Office and various Exchequer offices (including the Pipe Office, the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's Office and the Office of the Clerk of the Estreats). As early as 1795 the Exchequer was requesting that more space be made available; Sir John Soane was engaged to redesign their offices, and as part of the scheme the Duchy was relocated to another part of the East Wing, prompting complaints from its officers. Pipe rolls and other ancient records of the Treasury and Exchequer (which had been moved to Somerset House from the Palace of Westminster in 1793) remained stored in the basements until the establishment of the Public Record Office in 1838.\n\nThe office of Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer ceased to exist in 1833 and the Pipe Office was abolished in 1834; however space in Somerset House continued to be at a premium: in 1854 an Act of Parliament was passed (the Duchy of Cornwall Office Act 1854) noting that the Duchy's rooms in Somerset House were now needed 'for the use of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, whose present office is insufficient for the Business thereof, and adjoins the said Office of the Duchy of Cornwall'. The Act provided for the Duchy Office to move to new, purpose-built premises in Pimlico: now known as 10 Buckingham Gate, the building still serves as head office for the Duchy.\n\nThe Commissioners for Auditing Public Accounts were also housed in the East Wing, as was the Duchy of Lancaster Office (having moved there from accommodation in Gray's Inn) until it moved in 1823 to new offices across the road in Lancaster Place. The Surveyor of Crown Lands also had his office here until the early 19th century. The Salt Office initially occupied rooms in the West Wing, alongside the naval offices, but it was abolished in 1798 (administration of the salt tax having been transferred to the Board of Excise).\n\nDuring the 19th century Somerset House contained the offices of the Poor Law Commissioners (1834–1847) the Tithe Commissioners (1836–1851) and, from 1859 until 1998, the Principal Registry of the Court of Probate and its successors.\n\nMagnificent as the new building was, it was something short of what Chambers had intended, for he had planned for additional wings to the east and west of the quadrangle. Cost had been the inhibiting factor. Eventually King's College London was erected to the east (the government granting the land on condition that the design conformed to Chambers' original design) by subscription between 1829 and 1834.\n\nThen, increasing demand for space led to another and last step. The western edge of the site was occupied by a row of houses used as dwellings for Admiralty officials who worked in the South Wing. Between 1851 and 1856 these were demolished and a further wing erected. 150 years later this part of the building is still known as the \"\"New\" Wing\".\n\nIn 1891 a headquarters building was constructed in the West Court (between the West Wing and the New Wing) for the Civil Service Rifles, a Rifle Volunteer Corps.\n\nBy the start of the First World War the Civil Service Rifles, by then renamed the 15th (Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles) Battalion, The London Regiment, had its own Morris tube firing range (where the calibre of the rifle is reduced for indoor operation by a use of a tube) fitted with vanishing and running targets at Somerset House.\n\nSomerset House had its share of trials and tribulations during the London blitz in the Second World War. Apart from comparatively minor blast effects at various times, sixteen rooms and the handsome rotunda staircase (the Nelson Stair) were completely destroyed in the South Wing, and a further 27 damaged in the West Wing by a direct hit in October 1940.\n\nStill more windows were shattered and balustrades toppled, but the worst was over by the end of May 1941. It was not until the 1950s that this damage to the South Wing was repaired. The work required skilled masons, whose services were hard to come by in the early post-war years. Sir Albert Richardson was appointed architect for the reconstruction. He skillfully recreated the Nelson Room and rebuilt the Nelson Stair. The work was completed in 1952 at a cost of (then) £84,000.\n\nIn 1984 the Somerset House Act was passed, legislating the way for Somerset House to be redeveloped as a centre for the arts. In 1997 the Somerset House Trust was established as a charity to maintain the building and develop it as a centre for arts and culture.\n\nIn the late 20th century the building began to be reinvigorated as a centre for the visual arts. The first institution to move in (in 1989) was the Courtauld Institute of Art, including the Courtauld Gallery, which has an important collection of old master and impressionist paintings. The Courtauld occupies the North Wing.\n\nThe main courtyard, which had been used as a civil service car park, and the main terrace overlooking the Thames were refurbished and opened to the public; these alterations being overseen by the conservation architects Donald Insall & Associates. Grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund financed the conversion of the South Wing between 1999 and 2003: a visitor centre featuring audio-visual displays on the history of the building, the gilded state barge of the Lord Mayor of the City of London and a shop and café were opened, overlooking the river. The Gilbert Collection of decorative arts, and the Hermitage Rooms, which stage exhibitions of items loaned from the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, moved into the same area. The last Hermitage exhibition took place in 2007 and the Gilbert Collection galleries closed in 2008; the collection moved into new galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in June 2009. Somerset House now puts on a programme of art exhibitions drawing on various sources.\n\nIn stages from 2009 to 2013, HM Revenue and Customs withdrew from the other parts of the building; since March 2013 the Somerset House Trust has had oversight of the entire complex. Its management policy has been to rent out the upper floors at a commercial rate to 'creative businesses' whilst devoting the ground floor to 'public realm' activities. The trust receives no public subsidy and relies on income from rent and private hire to fund the upkeep of the estate and relies on ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship to fund its artistic and cultural programme.\n\nSomerset House is now residence to over a hundred tenants, comprising a large and diverse collection of creative organisations and artists including the British Fashion Council, 7Wonder, Hofesh Shechter Company and the Royal Society of Literature. The largest tenant is King's College London whose Cultural Institute, Executive Centre and Dickson Poon School of Law occupy a large part of the East Wing. For a time the Representative of Anguilla (the diplomatic mission of the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla) was accommodated in part of the West Wing.\nIn the winter the central courtyard is home to a popular open air ice rink, as seen during the opening credits of the 2003 Christmas-themed film \"Love Actually\". At other times, an array of fountains display 55 vertical jets of water rising to random heights.\nThe courtyard is also used as a concert venue. A series of music events called the 'Summer series' are held in July each year. These have included performances from artists such as Lily Allen.\n\nSomerset House is a popular filming location with its exterior featuring in several big budget Hollywood films. Among these include two James Bond films, \"GoldenEye\" and \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", and several scenes of the 2003 film, \"Shanghai Knights\" starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson were filmed in the courtyard of Somerset House. The courtyard was also used in the 1991 comedy \"King Ralph\". Elements of the 2008 film \"The Duchess\" starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes were filmed in October 2007. Somerset House was also used as a filming location in several Sherlock Holmes films, including the 1970 film \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\", and more recently, \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009) starring Jude Law and Robert Downey, Jr. directed by Guy Ritchie. Exterior shots of Somerset House were also used in the 1999 Tim Burton horror film, \"Sleepy Hollow\" starring Johnny Depp and the 2006 film, \"Flyboys\". It was used as a filming location in the 2012 Bollywood film \"Jab Tak Hai Jaan\", starring Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, and directed by Yash Chopra. Somerset House Courtyard was also used in the 2008 movie \"Last Chance Harvey\" with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Scenes were filmed in Somerset House in the \"Olympus Has Fallen\" sequel, \"London Has Fallen\".\n\nSomerset House was also the main location for the BBC's \"New Year Live\" television show, presented by Natasha Kaplinsky, which celebrated the arrival of the year 2006.\n\n\n"}

Along with a few photographs in the Auschwitz Album, they are the only ones known to exist of events around the gas chambers.\n\nThe images were taken within 15–30 minutes of each other by an inmate inside Auschwitz-Birkenau, the extermination camp within the Auschwitz complex. Usually named only as Alex, a Jewish prisoner from Greece, the photographer was a member of the \"Sonderkommando\", inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers. Several sources identified him as Alberto Errera, a Greek naval officer. He took two shots from inside one of the gas chambers and two outside, shooting from the hip, unable to aim the camera with any precision. The Polish resistance smuggled the film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube.\n\nThe photographs were numbered 280–283 by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Nos. 280 and 281 show the cremation of corpses in a fire pit, shot through the black frame of the gas chamber's doorway or window. No. 282 shows a group of naked women just before they enter the gas chamber. No. 283 is an image of trees, the result of the photographer aiming too high.\n\nThe \"Sonderkommando\" (\"special commandos\") in Auschwitz were mostly Jewish inmates, and at one point a few Russian prisoners-of-war, who were forced to work in the crematoria. The crematoria contained the \"Entkleidungskammer\" (undressing rooms), gas chambers and furnaces. In the summer of 1944 the camp had up to 1,000 \"Sonderkommando\" working in four crematoria (nos. II-V), and a bunker with extra gas chambers, housed in a thatched brick building known as the \"little white house\".\n\nAfter inmates had been \"selected\" as unfit for work by the SS, the \"Sonderkommando\" usually took them to the undressing room, then walked them to the gas chamber, telling them they were being taken to the bathing and disinfection room. To avoid panic, inmates were given a numbered hook for their belongings in the undressing room to make them believe they would be returning.\n\nAfterwards the \"Sonderkommando\" moved the bodies out of the gas chamber, removed gold fillings, false teeth, hair, jewellery and spectacles, and disposed of the corpses, at first in mass graves, and later in furnaces and fire pits. Then they cleaned the gas chamber for the next arrivals.\n\nThe photographer is usually named only as Alex, a Jewish inmate from Greece. Several sources have identified him as Alberto Errera, a Greek naval officer who was shot and killed after striking an SS officer. Errera's code name was Alekos Alexandridis. Other members of the \"Sonderkommando\" in the camp's crematorium V—Alter Fajnzylberg (also known as Stanislaw Jankowski), brothers Shlomo and Josel Dragon, and David Szmulewski—helped obtain and hide the camera, and acted as look-outs. Fajnzylberg, who had worked at crematorium V since July 1943, described how the photographs came to be taken:\n\nOn the day on which the pictures were taken ... we allocated tasks. Some of us were to guard the person taking the pictures. In other words, we were to keep a careful watch for the approach of anyone who did not know the secret, and above all for any SS men moving about in the area. At last the moment came. We all gathered at the western entrance leading from the outside to the gas-chamber of Crematorium V: we could not see any SS men in the watchtower overlooking the door from the barbed wire, nor near the place where the pictures were to be taken. Alex, the Greek Jew, quickly took out his camera, pointed it towards a heap of burning bodies, and pressed the shutter. This is why the photograph shows prisoners from the \"Sonderkommando\" working at the heap. One of the SS was standing beside them, but his back was turned towards the crematorium building. Another picture was taken from the other side of the building, where women and men were undressing among the trees. They were from a transport that was to be murdered in the gas-chamber of Crematorium V.\n\nFajnzylberg recalled that the camera looked like a German Leica. Szmulewski had hidden it in a bucket, and stayed on the roof of the crematorium as a look-out while Alex shot the film. Fajnzylberg stressed that, although Alex had pressed the shutter, all five men had been present and had acted together. According to Szmulewski, speaking in 1987 to Jean-Claude Pressac, the four photographs were taken within 15–30 minutes of each other. The black frame of the gas chamber's doorway or window, probably doorway, is visible in photographs 280 and 281.\n\nThe film was smuggled out of the camp by the Polish underground, hidden inside a tube of toothpaste by Helena Dantón, who worked in the SS canteen. A note dated 4 September 1944 and signed Stakło, written by political prisoners Józef Cyrankiewicz and Stanisław Kłodziński, was attached to the film. It asked that the photographs be sent to \"Tell\", Teresa Łasocka-Estreicher of the underground in Kraków:\n\nUrgent. Send two metal rolls of film for 6x9 as fast as possible. Have possibility of taking photos. Sending you photos of Birkenau showing prisoners sent to gas chambers. One photos shows one of the stakes at which bodies were burned when the crematoria could not manage to burn all the bodies. The bodies in the foreground are waiting to be thrown into the fire. Another picture shows one of the places in the forest where people undress before 'showering'—as they were told—and then go to the gas-chambers. Send film roll as fast as you can. Send the enclosed photos to Tell—we think enlargements of the photos can be sent further.\n\nWhen the photographs were first distributed by the Polish resistance, they were cropped to focus on the figures, with the black frames in the two fire-pit images removed. Photography historian Janina Struk writes that Teresa Łasocka-Estreicher (\"Tell\" in the note from the camp) asked Polish photographer to make prints, and it is assumed that it was Mucha who decided to crop them.\n\nSome of the cropped images were published in 1945, attributed to the \"Sonderkommando\" member David Szmulewski, in a report on Auschwitz-Birkenau by Jan Sehn, a Polish judge. One was exhibited at Auschwitz in 1947, and others were published in 1958 in Warsaw in a book by Stanisław Wrzos-Glinka, Tadeusz Mazur and Jerzy Tomaszewski, \"1939–1945: Cierpienie i walka narodu polskiego\" (published in English as \"1939–1945: We Have Not Forgotten\"). Some of the figures had been retouched to make them clearer.\n\nStruk writes that, in 1960, Władyslaw Pytlik of the resistance movement in Brzeszcze offered testimony about his wartime experiences to the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, and brought along three prints of the cropped photographs. It was only in 1985, after Pytlik died and his wife donated his photographs to the museum, including the uncropped versions, that the museum realized the prints they had seen before had been cropped.\n\nCommentators have argued that the cropping offers a distorted view of events, giving the impression that the photographer was able to use his camera openly. In fact he and the rest of the group placed themselves in great danger by taking the shots; in two of them, 282 and 283, it is clear that he was not even able to look through the lens. The art historian Georges Didi-Huberman argues that the cropping makes the photographs appear safe and erases the act of resistance and the phenomenology of the images, the process that \"made them an event\":\n\nThe \"mass of black\" that surrounds the sight of the cadavers and the pits, this mass where \"nothing is visible\" gives in reality a \"visual mark\" that is just as valuable as all the rest of the exposed surface. That mass where nothing is visible is the space of the gas chamber: the \"dark room\" into which one had to retreat, to step back, in order to give light to the work of the \"Sonderkommando\" outside, above the pyres. That mass of black gives us the situation itself, the space of possibility, the condition of existence of the photographs themselves.\n\nThe photographs were referenced in the 2015 Hungarian movie \"Son of Saul\".\n\n"}

Owing to this, he created a brief epilogue to the series, in which he explained many of his choices, such as his choice of Emma of the Jane Austen novels. He also explained regrettable exclusions, such as All That Is, Gravity's Rainbow, Crash, A Confederacy of Dunces, Slaughterhouse Five, All the Pretty Horses, Wise Blood, The Pursuit of Love, Rebecca and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. He also commented on purposeful exclusions owing to his personal preference, such as books by Elizabeth Gaskell, Norman Mailer, Kingsley Amis, John Fowles, Walter Scott and Iris Murdoch, the latter of which had caused a surge of controversy in the disclusion of The Black Prince. He aroused controversy again, however, in, at the end of this article, including a list of his opinion of the ten greatest novels of all: Emma, Wuthering Heights, Moby-Dick, Middlemarch, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Heart of Darkness, The Rainbow, Ulysses, Mrs Dalloway, The Great Gatsby. 3.\n\nOne of the most frequent complaints was that, of the 100, only 21 were by women. One reviewer desired Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton, Harriett Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Erica Jong's Fear of Flying, Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale, books by Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers, Willa Cather and Margaret Kennedy. She was also frustrated by the disclusion of Angela Carter, saying, 'Carter’s influence cannot be overstated: her allegorical, taboo-breaking narratives have been genuinely influential.' She favoured taking out The Thirty-Nine Steps, and replacing it with The Talented Mr. Ripley, and taking out Joy in the Morning, preferring either Nancy Mitford's The Pursuit of Love, or E. M. Delafield's Diary of a Provincial Lady. 4.\n\nAnother criticism was a lack of Irish authors. Many complained of there being only nine books- Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift (1726), The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman by Laurence Sterne (1759), The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (1891); Dracula by Bram Stoker (1897), Ulysses by James Joyce (1922), Murphy by Samuel Beckett (1938), At Swim-Two-Birds by Flann O’Brien (1939), The Heat of the Day by Elizabeth Bowen (1948) and Amongst Women by John McGahern (1990). Claire Armistead compiled complaints of no works by these authors: Edna O'Brien, William Trevor, John Banville, Colm Tóibín, David Lodge, Maria Edgeworth, J. G. Farrell and Sheridan le Fanu. The first mentioned exclusion caused perhaps the most controversy. 5. 6.\n\nThe Guardian asked readers a fortnight after the conclusion of McCrum's list to name the novels that they wish had been on the list. The book with the highest amount of votes was Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, the second Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, and the third Toni Morrison's Beloved. The fourth was Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, fifth, Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, then Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance, followed by David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, then Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, nine with J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, concluding the top ten with Glen Duncan's I, Lucifer, eleventh being J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, twelfth, Alasdair Gray's , thirteenth, Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A Heinlein, penultimately Alice Walker's The Colour Purple, and finally, Woman on the Edge of Time by Marge Piercy. 7.\n\n"}

The project complements Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad's 'Malaysia Boleh!' (\"Malaysia Can!\" in English) campaign. As with the Guinness World Records, there is an annually published book listing the records.\n\nThe MBR is a project formed in line with the peoples Vision 2020.\n\nRealising that feats and record attempts were not recorded, Datuk Danny Ooi, (founder of The Malaysia Book of Records) felt that recognition should be given to record achievements by Malaysians. As the National Record-Keeper, MBR is an official body that recognises record-holders, record-breakers, and record creators in the country. Upon confirmation of a record, the MBR will issue certificates to the record holder as a recognition for their efforts.\n\nThe idea was conceived in 1990 when Danny Ooi stumbled upon questions regarding extraordinary feats by Malaysians. He recalled seeing a man cycling for days at the Merdeka Stadium, trying to set a world record, and another individual, who travelled from state to state by walking. The latter was hoping his attempt could be entered in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nRealising that none of these feats would be recorded, Mr. Ooi felt that recognition should be given to such determination exhibited by Malaysians.\n\nAchievements were compiled for publication into the MBR and were also included in its production shown in a TV series called The Malaysia Book of Records' weekly TV series, which debuted on October 6, 1996 on RTM TV2. The MBR will serve as a medium with which to acknowledge Malaysians who have promoted their country by creating records.\n\nThe first record book entitled \"The Malaysia Book of Records' First Edition\" was launched on December 9, 1998, unveiling the Malaysian records in one book for the first time.\n\nMBR Awards Night at National and State Level started in December 1998, when the Malaysia Book of Records organised a national level and two states' level, Sabah and Melaka respectively at MBR Awards Night.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The highlight was an open house and Centennial Ball on April 13, 1970. The anniversary was organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary Committee, chaired by Trustee Roswell Gilpatric and including Museum President Arthur A. Houghton, Trustees Brooke Astor, C. Douglas Dillon, and Arthur K. Watson, advertising\nexecutive David Ogilvy, CBS President Frank Stanton, socialite and representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights Marietta Tree, and collector and future Museum Trustee Jayne Wrightsman. Events were held both at the Museum and beyond, reaching cities throughout the United States and overseas.\n\n\"The Great Age of Fresco: Giotto to Pontormo,\" which was on view for only two months in the fall of 1968, was the first exhibition at the Museum to have corporate sponsorship. Olivetti’s underwriting of the exhibition was seen as a model for the pursuit of corporate sponsors for the Centennial exhibitions being planned at that time.\n\nCentennial special events at the Museum centered around five exhibitions celebrating the breadth of the Museum’s collecting over the previous one hundred years: “New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970” (sponsored by Xerox), \"The Year 1200,\" \"19th-Century America\" (opened by First Lady Pat Nixon), “Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America,” and “Masterpieces of Seven Centuries.” \"New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970\" was the Museum’s first exhibition of contemporary American art, curated by Henry Geldzahler to mark the inauguration of the newly established department of Contemporary Arts. It elicited reactions ranging from shock to relief at the new direction of collecting that it signaled. For each exhibition, a contemporary American composer was commissioned to create an orchestral fanfare. These included \"Shivaree\" by Leonard Bernstein (for \"Before Cortes: Sculpture Of Middle America\"), \"Ceremonial Fanfare For Brass Ensemble\" by Aaron Copland (for \"Masterpieces Of Fifty Centuries\"), \"Ceremonial Fanfare\" by Walter Piston (for \"The Year 1200\"), \"Anniversary Fanfare\" by William Schuman (for \"19th Century America\"), and \"Metropolitan Museum Fanfare: Portrait Of An American Artist\" by Virgil Thomson (for \"New York Painting And Sculpture: 1940-1970\"). \n\nAs part of the Museum’s expanded outreach programs, the Centennial was marked with loan exhibitions to museums in the United States and overseas, including Expo ’70 in Osaka, Japan. \"Treasures from the Cloisters and the Metropolitan Museum of Art\" traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. \"Prints by Nine New York Painters\" was seen in Jerusalem and seven other cities, while \"Masterpieces of Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\" traveled to The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which celebrated its own centennial in 1970. Many objects shown in \"Before Cortés: Sculpture of Middle America\" originated from Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Historia as part of a 25-year reciprocal loan and cultural program with the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nApril 13, 1970 marked the 100th anniversary of the granting of the Metropolitan Museum’s charter by the State of New York. On April 10 the Museum hosted a reception for staff members, before which Director Thomas Hoving presented the Museum’s “Comprehensive Plan for the Second Century,” which would guide building and program efforts in the coming decades. On April 13, the Museum held an open house for New York residents from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., including a receiving line of political dignitaries, special programs, refreshments, and entertainment in the Museum and on its Fifth Avenue plaza. The Centennial Ball that evening was hosted by Museum trustee Brooke Astor and featured reduced ticket prices for staff members and their families. Four ballrooms were set up in the Museum, each decorated by a noted New York interior decorator around the theme of a specific historical event or artistic period.\n\nIn celebration of the Centennial the Museum published eighteen new books, twelve directly related to the anniversary and six to other aspects of its collections. Among them were \"Merchants and Masterpieces: The Story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\", written by \"New Yorker\" staff writer Calvin Tomkins and published in 1970, which serves as an official history of the institution, and a centennial issue of the Metropolitan Museum Journal published to coincide with the celebrations’ conclusion in 1971. Other initiatives included educational programs, book publishing, television programs, film projects, and receptions to coincide with meetings of professional organizations including the American Association of Museums.\n\n“Cinémathèque at the Metropolitan Museum,” which was jointly sponsored by the Museum and City Center of Music and Drama, showed seventy films dating from the medium’s first seventy-five years on thirty-five consecutive evenings from July 29 to September 3, 1970. The films were selected by Cinémathèque Française founder and director Henri Langlois, from its archive of more than 50,000 films. Chosen for their significance and contributions to the history of filmmaking, they included work from official film industries as well as current and early avant garde directors. The program was the most diverse film exhibition held in the United States to date, and was the Museum’s first major undertaking in film. Television projects associated with the centennial included \"Masterpieces of Fifty Centuries” narrated by noted art historian Sir Kenneth Clark, a one-hour NBC program prepared by Aline Saarinen, and a network television report each evening during the week of October 6, 1969 on one of the five centerpiece centennial exhibitions.\n\nSpecially tailored Museum visits were organized for members of other museums and cultural organizations across the United States to see the Centennial exhibits and participate in related programming. An intensive advertising, promotion, and public relations campaign publicized the events to a wide range of visitors and distant supporters through newspapers, magazines, and other print publications, as well as television and local store window displays. A free year-long course in art history, composed of thirty lectures, was developed and offered to the public by the Education Department. Artist Frank Stella was commissioned to create a Centennial logo, and medals incorporating the design were struck to mark the occasion. Remodeled and refurbished galleries in the Museum opened during this period, including the Ancient Near Eastern Art and Egyptian Art departments and the Costume Institute in the fall of 1970, and a reinstallation of the Musical Instruments collections. The extent of air-conditioned gallery space was doubled, to include almost two-thirds of the Museum’s exhibition spaces. Considerable emphasis was also put on fundraising for the expenses associated with the Centennial celebrations.\n\n"}
{"id": "23157981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23157981", "title": "The Toy Shop", "text": "The Toy Shop\n\nThe Toy Shop is an exhibit building at Shelburne Museum, which is located in Shelburne, Vermont. Toy Shop houses 19th- and early 20th-century playthings, including miniature transportation toys, penny banks, and music boxes.\n\nThe Shelburne Museum built the Toy Shop in the early 1950s as an extension to Variety Unit. Built in 1835, Variety Unit, the only structure original to the Museum grounds, is an example of “continuous” architecture common to New England farmhouses. As more space was needed, farmers added new wings to their house. Farmers would merge farm and household buildings in one continuous structure that not only kept everything centralized but, also made it unnecessary to go outside in inclement weather. Built onto the rear of Variety Unit, the Toy Shop extends this tradition.\n\nThe impulse to play is universal, and throughout human history people not immediately preoccupied with survival have created playthings. Toys of earlier eras offer important clues to the lives of their makers and owners.\n\nShelburne Museum’s collection of toys, which includes both European and American examples from the early nineteenth century through the first decades of the twentieth century, encompasses a broad range of both handmade and manufactured examples.\n\nSimple toys, both homemade and commercially produced, such as clay or glass marbles and cloth, wood, leather, or rubber balls, were widely available for purchase and would often reappear in new materials as manufacturing technology improved. Educational games, that began to appear in the late eighteenth century, document the skills and subjects that children were expected to master. The abundance of commercially produced American and European toys that appeared throughout the nineteenth century attests to technological advances and to changing perceptions of childhood and leisure.\n\nColonial American toys included those of European manufacture as well as homemade examples. Cottage industries on both continents produced wooden blocks, hobby and rocking horses, puppets, dolls, and other simple toys of paper, cloth, wood, and metal. After the Civil War, Americans developed increasingly efficient ways to manufacture playthings and quickly emerged as leaders in the manufacture of cast-iron banks; miniature boats and wagons of tin, cast iron, or wood; and lithographed optical toys and board games.\n\nAlthough the United States dominated commercial toy manufacturing by 1900, individuals continued to make playthings by hand for a variety of reasons. Some toys, like whistles made from spring willow twigs or dandelion stems, simply could not be commercially produced. While those who could not afford store-bought toys often created homemade toys, even the affluent sometimes chose to carve a miniature cradle or a hobby horse, or to stitch a doll dress or a puppet as a special gift. Children also enjoy making toys and the nineteenth century saw an emergence of pattern books and instructional magazines for their use.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "160237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160237", "title": "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum", "text": "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\n\nTheatrum Orbis Terrarum (, \"Theatre of the World\") is considered to be the first true modern atlas. Written by Abraham Ortelius, strongly encouraged by Gillis Hooftman and originally printed on May 20, 1570, in Antwerp, it consisted of a collection of uniform map sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. The Ortelius atlas is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century cartography. The publication of the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" (1570) is often considered as the official beginning of the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography (approximately 1570s–1670s).\n\nThe atlas contained virtually no maps from the hand of Ortelius, but 53 bundled maps of other masters, with the source as indicated. Previously, only the pooling of disparate maps were released as custom on order. The Ortelius atlas, however, dropped the maps for this all in the same style and on the same size on copper plates, logically arranged by continent, region and State. He provided the maps in addition to a descriptive comment and referrals on the reverse. As such, this was the first time that the entirety of Western European knowledge of the world was brought together in one book.\n\nIn the bibliography, the section Catalogue Auctorum, not only were the 33 cartographers mentioned, whose work in the Theatrum was recorded (at that time not yet the habit), but also the total of 87 cartographers of the 16th century that Ortelius knew. This list grew in every Latin Edition, and included no less than 183 names in 1601. Among the sources are mentioned among other things the following: for the world map the \"World Map\" (1561) by Giacomo Gastaldi, the \"porto Avenue of the Atlantic coast\" (1562) by Diego Gutierrez, the \"world map\" (1569) of Gerardus Mercator, which have 8 maps derived from the Theatrum.\n\nFor the map of Europe, \"wall map\" (1554). of the Mercator \"map of Scandinavia\" (1539) by Olaus Magnus, map of Asia was derived from his own \"Asia-map\" from 1567, which in turn was inspired by that of Gastaldi (1559). Also for the Africa map he referred to Gastaldi.\n\nThis work by Ortelius, consisted of a collection of the best maps, refined by himself, combined into one map or split across multiple, and on the same size (folios of approximately 35 x 50 cm). The naming and location coordinates were not normalized.\n\nAfter the initial publication of \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\", Ortelius regularly revised and expanded the atlas, reissuing it in various formats until his death in 1598. From its original seventy maps and eighty-seven bibliographic references in the first edition (1570), the atlas grew through its thirty-one editions to encompass 183 references and 167 maps in 1612. \n\nThe online copy of the 1573 volume held by the State Library of New South Wales contains 70 numbered double-page sheets, tipped onto stubs at the centerfold, with 6 maps combined with descriptive letterpress on the recto of each first leaf. The legends of most maps name the author whose map Ortelius adapted. In the preface Ortelius credits Franciscus Hogenberg with engraving nearly all the maps.\n\nThe 1573 \"Additamentum\" to the atlas is notable for containing Humphrey Llwyd's \"Cambriae Typus\", the first map to show Wales on its own. \n\nFrom the 1630s, the Blaeu family issued their work under a similar title, \"Theatrum orbis terrarum, sive, Atlas Novus\".\n\nAll those editions had the same structure. They started with an allegorical title page, on which the five known continents, were presented by allegorical women, with Europe as the Queen. Then a command to Philip II, King of Spain and the low countries, and a poem by Adolphus Mekerchus (Adolf of Meetkercke). From 1579, the editions contain a portrait of Ortelius by Philip Galle, an introduction by Ortelius, in the Latin editions followed by a recommendation by Mercator. This is followed by the bibliography (\"Auctorum Catalog\"), an index (\"Index Tabularum\"), the cards with text on the back, starting from 1579 in the Latin editions followed by a register of place names in ancient times (\"Nomenclator\"), the treatise, the \"Mona Druidum insula\" of the Welsh scientist Humphrey Lhuyd (Humphrey Llwyd) over the Anglesey coat of arms, and finally the privilege and a colophon.\n\nThe moneyed middle class, which had much interest in knowledge and science, turned out to be very much interested in the convenient size and the pooling of knowledge. For buyers who were not strong in Latin, published at the end of 1572, in addition to three Latin, there were a Dutch, German and French 2nd Edition. \nThis rapid success prompted the Ortelius Theatrum constantly continued to expand and improve. In 1573, he released 17 more additional maps under the title \"Additamentum Theatri Orbis Terrarum\", which in these master works were published, bringing the total at 70 maps. By Ortelius' death in 1598, there were twenty-five editions that appeared in seven different languages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35246903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35246903", "title": "Tsentsak", "text": "Tsentsak\n\nTsentsak are invisible pathogenic projectiles or magical darts utilized in indigenous and mestizo shamanic practices for the purposes of sorcery and healing throughout much the Amazon Basin. Anthropologists identify them as objects referenced in emic accounts that represent indigenous beliefs. \"Tsentak\" are not recognized in scientific medicine.\n\nThe term \"tsentsak\" is derived from the Shuar language, which belongs to the Jivaroan language family. The Shuar are members of the Jivaroan peoples who reside in the Amazon rainforest of Peru and Ecuador. This term is also used interchangeably with \"virote\" (primarily by mestizo shamans), a Spanish term for crossbow bolt which was applied to the blow darts made by the Jivaroans from the spines of the \"Bactris\" and \"Astrocaryum\" palms.\n\n\"Tsentsak\" are stored by the shaman in his or her \"yachay\", or phlegm, located in the chest and stomach. The \"tsentsak\" are embedded within this phlegm and either the \"tsentsak\" or the \"yachay\" may be projected out of the shaman into a victim to cause illness and death. This phlegm is the materialization of the shaman's power; it is used to remove \"tsentsak\" from the bodies of victims as well as to protect the shaman from being harmed by the \"tsentsak\" of others.\n\n\"Tsentsak\" are only visible under the influence of a psychoactive substance called \"natemä\", which is the \"Jívaro\" word for \"ayahuasca\". When the shaman imbibes \"natemä\", the world of spirits becomes visible. It is at this time that sorcerers and bewitching shamans can send \"tsentsak\" to their victims, while conversely, healers and curing shamans can remove \"tsentsak\" from their afflicted patients. \n\n\"Tsentsak\" are believed to possess their own agency and volition as living spirits that constantly desire to kill and consume human flesh. A shaman must learn to control their darts lest they escape and cause unintended harm. To facilitate control of \"tsentsak\" they must be nourished by the consumption of \"mapacho\" (Nicotiana rustica), which can be smoked or imbibed as an infusion.\n\nA shaman who does not possess the necessary restraint to swallow their \"tsentsak\" when they rise to the back of their throat will become a sorcerer or bewitching shaman, while a shaman who can learn to control these urges will become a healer or curing shaman.\n\nAn apprentice shaman who receives their first \"tsentsak\" from a predominantly bewitching shaman is likely to become a sorcerer, while the apprentice that receives their first \"tsentsak\" from a curing shaman will most likely become a healer.\n\nThroughout much of the Amazon, \"tsentsak\" are believed to be the primary cause of illness and nonviolent death. These magical darts are utilized by \"brujos\", (shamans specializing in attack sorcery) to bring suffering and death to their victims. The darts can be regurgitated at will by the sorcerer and projected from the mouth into the body of the victim. If the dart passes entirely though the victim they will die in three to seven days, however, if the dart becomes lodged in the victim's body, it may be removed by a curing shaman.\n\nThe shaman can collect plants, insects and many other objects small enough to be swallowed, which he may then convert into \"tsentsak\". Each variety of \"tsentsak\" possesses its own specific attributes and degree of ability to cause illness. The amount and variety of \"tsentsak\" collected by a shaman is directly proportional to his power and ability to kill and heal.\n\nWhile sorcerers may use \"tsentsak\" for malevolent purposes, healing shamans use these magic darts to create a barrier of protection around their body. They also possess the ability to suck \"tsentsak\" from the body of a victim, which can then be sent back to the sorcerer from whom it originated. The healing shaman must imbibe \"ayahuasca\" to make the darts visible in the victim's body in order to remove them.\n\nTo remove the malevolent \"tsentsak\" the curing shaman must suck it out of the victim's body. In preparation for this act the shaman must first regurgitate two of his own \"tsentsak\" into the back of his throat. The first is used to block the shaman from accidentally ingesting the malevolent \"tsentsak\", which would most likely lead to his death. The second is used to absorb or dissolve the malevolent \"tsentsak\" which the shaman then spits out or sends back to the sorcerer.\n\nA shaman will typically receive his first \"tsentsak\" from a practicing shaman to whom he has apprenticed. The practicing shaman will regurgitate some of his \"yachay\" containing the \"tsentsak\", which the apprentice must then swallow. The apprentice can then keep the darts in his stomach indefinitely. Many shamans will travel great distances to trade \"tsentsak\" with other powerful shamans from distant regions. They may also buy and sell \"tsentsak\" to increase the potency of their power.\n\nTo transfer \"tsentsak\" to another individual, both the buyer and seller must consume \"ayahuasca\" to make the \"tsentsak\" visible. The seller must then drink an infusion of \"Nicotiana rustica\" to regurgitate the \"tsentsak\", which is then displayed to the buyer. The buyer then swallows the \"tsentsak\", thereby adding it to his collection. \"Tsentsak\" may also be sold in the more tangible forms of tree thorns, insects, small stones, and even pieces of razor blade.\n\nIn the context of Jivaroan shamanism, an apprentice shaman must abstain from sexual intercourse and follow a special diet for a period of at least three months after receiving their first \"tsentsak\". If these restrictions are broken, the darts will leave the body of the shaman and the process must be started from the beginning. To gain the power to kill and cure, a shaman must observe these restrictions for a period of five months.\n\nMestizo shamans adhere to a similar restrictive diet in preparation for the consumption of ayahuasca before shamanic rituals. These restrictions help to instill self-control and emotional mastery in preparation for a career as a healer. A shaman who breaks the restrictions cannot control the urges of their \"tsentsak\" and will become a sorcerer.\n\n\n</div>\n\n"}

It was originally located in Vergennes, Vermont.\n\nThe town of Vergennes, Vermont built the schoolhouse about 1840 on land leased from General Samuel Strong, an American Revolutionary War officer and descendant of one of Addison County’s first families. In the terms of the lease Strong stipulated that the town pay him an annual rent of one kernel of Indian corn and use the property for educational purposes.\n\nThe schoolhouse, although built at the height of Greek Revival’s popularity, reflects an amalgamation of architectural styling. Moderate classical elements include the arched door, sash windows, and projecting bell tower, while the split-gable and octagonal shape of the bell tower’s cupola reflect 19th-century Eclecticism that developed as local builders and craftsmen freely combined elements from different architectural styles. On the exterior, the bricklayer ornamented the one-room structure with a simple patterning of six rows of stretchers (horizontally-laid bricks) and one row of headers (end-laid bricks) that formed subtle bands circling the building.\n\nWhen the Shelburne Museum relocated the Schoolhouse to its present site in 1947, the structure had been in disuse for many years. In preparation for the building’s restoration, the Museum created architectural drawings of the building’s exterior before removing the belfry and dismantling the brickwork piece-by-piece. The Museum replaced the original tinwork of the belfry’s dome with stronger copper, repaired its acorn finial, replaced missing windows, resurfaced the plastered interior walls, and re-hung the bell. The inclusion of desks, benches, and maps reflect the modest furnishings of a 19th-century rural school.\n\nOne-room schools were commonplace throughout rural portions of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In most rural (country) and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single teacher taught academic basics to five to eight grade levels of elementary-age boys and girls. \"For more information see\" One-room school\n\nThe early school room was about 20 feet square with a huge fireplace in the front. Later heat was supplied by an iron wood stove. Two privies were out back, one for the boys and one for the girls. Drinking water was ladled out of a wooden pail. The buildings were dark and often dirty, with no insulation to keep out the winter cold. There were no playgrounds and often no shade. There were few text books. Children used slates and a Bible as school supplies.\n\nSeats were often arranged with the smallest in the front and the tallest in the back so the teacher could see each head.\n\nSchools were only open a few months a year and consisted of winter and summer sessions (usually December–March and then mid-May to August). The older boys were usually working in the fields during the summer, so they only attended in the winter.\n\nMen predominated as teachers until the early 19th century, but by the mid-19th century most teachers were women. Women could be teachers only if they were unmarried; as soon as they married, another teacher was hired. Women were paid half the salaries as men.\n\nStudents ranged in age from 4 or 5 to 21 and sometimes toddlers went to school with older siblings who were caregivers. In 1870 in Vermont the average cost to educate one student was $13.60 per year.\n\nGrading did not exist. Curriculum consisted of the fundamentals of reading, spelling, writing, and calculating. Students recited the alphabet, the definitions of spelling words, the rules of grammar, arithmetic facts, and long prose passages. Few students went beyond the fundamentals taught in the one-room schoolhouse. Teachers were themselves often 14 or 15 years old with no advanced training.\n\nCorrect conduct was considered the most important part of a student’s education. Boys entered the school room, took off their hats, and bowed to the teacher and others. On leaving school they would bow again. Girls would enter, bow or curtsey, and repeat on leaving.\n\n\n"}
