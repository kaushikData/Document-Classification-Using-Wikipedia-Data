At the time of his death, Coleman was believed to be the oldest professional wrestler in the world.\n\nKelmer was born to a Jewish family in Żychlin, Poland in 1905. His father was a coal-seller. Kelmer had 15 older brothers and sisters, some of whom perished in the Holocaust. In 1923, he emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and later moved to New York City in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Online Explorer's Greg Oliver, there is debate regarding Kelmer's debut in professional wrestling. In 1929, local promoter Rudy Miller offered Coleman $25 to wrestle after seeing him work out in a Brooklyn gym. Despite this, an \"Abe Coleman\" wrestled to a draw with George Deslonchamps on March 19, 1928, at Madison Square Garden, but it is unknown if it was Kelmer or another wrestler with the same ring name.\n\nColeman is also credited with the invention of the dropkick, claiming the move was inspired by kangaroos he saw on a tour of Australia in 1930.\n\nColeman was never a champion, but was regarded as a solid midcard worker. In the 1930s, Coleman defeated Jim Londos in a match in a Mexico City bullring in front of 60,000 spectators. During a 1936 match against Man Mountain Dean in front of 36,000 people, Coleman slammed Dean to the ground, breaking the ring mat and dropping the pair down to the arena floor.\n\nFollowing his retirement from active in-ring competition, Coleman became a professional wrestling referee. He also promoted several wrestling shows with Bill Johnston.\n\nFollowing his retirement from wrestling, Kelmer inspected license plates for the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nKelmer met June Miller in 1936, stating he met her in Madison Square Garden when he landed in her lap after being thrown from the ring. They married three years later in 1939. The couple had no children, and Miller died in 1987. Kelmer lived in Forest Hills, New York. It was in Forest Hills that Kelmer subdued two attempted muggers when he was in his 80s.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Kelmer's interests included poker and horse racing.\n\nIn his final years, Kelmer was confined to a wheelchair and lived at the Meadow Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Flushing, New York. Kelmer died on March 28, 2007, in a nursing home in Queens, New York, of kidney failure.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1877, the original was rediscovered by the German historian Georg Waitz at the Oxford Bodleian Library (\"Laud Misc. 633\"). The University of Göttingen shelves a 17th-century copy.\n\nThe \"Annales\" fall in the Christian tradition of universal history and are an important source for the history of high medieval Saxony as pictured in the later Saxon World Chronicle. Nevertheless, they have little to say about the history of Pöhlde itself, despite the fact that it was the site of an imperial palace under the Ottonian dynasty.\n\nThe early centuries, from the beginning of the world, are covered by adapting text from the early twelfth-century chroniclers Honorius of Autun, Ekkehard of Aura and Sigebert of Gembloux. Only from the year 469 onwards is the text mostly unique, although parts are based on Paul the Deacon. The last annals concentrate on the history of the German kingdom down to the exile of Duke Henry the Lion in 1182. An annex lists all Popes and Holy Roman Emperors since the birth of Christ down to Emperor Frederick II (1220). Some supplements on the history of Pöhlde Abbey and the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg reach up to the year 1421.\n\nThe \"Annales Palidenses\" are the only source to claim that Roger II of Sicily became a monk shortly before his death. They are also the first to mention the epithet of King Henry the Fowler (i.e., one who hunts with fowl).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8781924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8781924", "title": "Archival processing", "text": "Archival processing\n\nArchival processing is the act of surveying, arranging, describing, and performing basic preservation activities on the recorded material of an individual, family, or organization, after they are permanently transferred to an archive. A person engaging in this activity is known as an \"archival processor, archival technician,\" or archivist.\n\nIdeally, when an archives receives a collection of papers or a group of records, they will have been arranged by the originator (the original person, persons, or organization that created or assembled the collection or records) and boxed up for the move to the archives in such a way that this order has been preserved. However, collections and record groups are often semi-organized, and sometimes lack any discernible organization. Observing the organization of delivered materials, imposing organization where it is lacking, then describing the organized material are tasks covered by the terms \"archival processing\", \"arrangement and description\", \"archival listing\", or \"cataloguing\".\n\nThe first step in archival processing is to survey the collection. The goal of a survey is to gain an understanding of the originator, determine the context of the creation of the collection, to observe the material's overall size and scope, to ascertain if the collection has access limitations, to locate any existing finding aids submitted with the collection, and to discover any underlying organizational scheme in the collection or record group. \n\nCollection surveys should be carried out with an archival principle, \"respect des fonds,\" in mind. In following with \"respect des fonds\", which may be translated as \"taking into consideration the entirety of the collection,\" the survey must include activity to ascertain whether the materials in hand are all, or only a portion, of the entire \"fonds\". If the archivist is in a repository that holds other parts of the \"fonds\", he or she should assemble a plan of work that encompasses, or at least acknowledges, the entire set of materials from the same originator. \n\nSurveying collections is a strictly observational task, without making any changes or rearrangements to the materials. Because many organizations require use of a template or worksheet to ensure the surveys are thorough and consistent, the typical end products of a collection survey is a completed survey worksheet and a processing plan. After the completion of the survey, the materials may be made available to researchers without additional processing, stored for future processing when resources are available, or progress to processing immediately. \n\nArrangement of materials should be completed with two archival principles that fall within \"respect des fonds\" in mind: \"provenance\" and o\"riginal order\". \n\nAccording to the principle of \"provenance,\" an originator’s materials should be maintained together and separated from those of other originators. Under the rules of \"provenance\", maintenance of the materials must include making them searchable and retrievable together (known as their intellectual arrangement) and could include keeping them physically together, if it is practical to do so. Additionally, if the materials have changed hands beyond the originator, the provenance of an item includes all those who came after the creator and any changes they make to the collection such as insertions, deletions, rearranging. \n\nAccording to the principle of \"original order\", the originator’s arrangement of the materials holds value, because it reflects how they originally used and accessed the collection, as well as how the records relate to each other, which can both inform the initial purpose of the records. Depending on the collection, rearrangement of the materials may not be required if a logical original order appears to have been maintained, the arrangement provides contextual clues about the purpose of the records and the arrangement does not interfere with researcher access to the materials. If rearrangement is required, archival processors will arrange the materials at the collection level, series level, subseries level, box level, folder level, or item level. The level of arrangement is determined by a number of factors, which include but are not limited to the orderliness of the material, the probable researcher interest and research value in the collection, and the policy and resources of the repository.\n\nIf arrangement tasks are required, arrangement is the first phase of physically processing the materials after the survey. In addition to rearranging the materials, there may also be weeding of material that does not meet a repository's collecting guidelines, as well as the preservation activities described below. \n\nMore detailed descriptions than that which results from a collection survey of the material are generally attempted. Beyond the survey, the individual processing the collection may create a listing of the \"series\" and \"sub-series,\" listing of box contents (also called box-level description), folder lists (folder-level description), or even complete inventories that include administrative histories or biographical notes, scope notes, acquisition information, and information as to the archival processing treatment the material has received. Some repositories will conduct item-level description of selected documents within a collection or group of records, if the research value is deemed to be extremely high, heavy use is expected, or the risk of theft is heightened.\n\nThe written description of a collection is generically termed a finding aid. The main purpose of a finding aid is to facilitate access to a collection of materials by users, and can also useful for other archivists who provide reference services to the materials currently and in the future. The earliest finding aids were known as \"calendars\" and generally consisted of a listing of individual documents in chronological order, which was the preferred organizational method of historians, who were their primary users at the time. Currently used forms of finding aids vary in length and fall into several categories by type, with the inventory predominating in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Many archives post their finding aids online to widen exposure to their holdings and some are encoded (see Standards section below) to facilitate recognition by web search engines. \n\nSeveral standards govern archival description, some national and some international. ISAD(G), the General International Standard Archival Description, defines the elements that should be included in a finding aid. Other content standards also pertain. In the United States, proper names may be checked against the Library of Congress Name Authority Files and subject headings are drawn from the LCSH. Genre terms are often taken from the Art & Architecture Thesaurus. Many finding aids are encoded (marked up) in XML; in such cases, the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) standard can be used. In addition, repositories may follow local practices designed to make finding aids serve their particular mission.\n\nThe Society of American Archivists (SAA) has published a number of best practices for American archivists; two important ones are \"Archives, Personal Papers and Manuscripts\", often abbreviated as APPM, and \"\" (DACS). SAA's publication \"Standards for Archival Description: A Handbook\" provides an overview of relevant standards for all phases of archival and manuscripts processing. The Research Libraries Group has published a best practices document for use with EAD.\n\nThe Archives and Records Association, the British equivalent of the SAA, has published a number of best practices for U.K. archivists on topics ranging from school records retention to historical accounting records.\n\nThe Australian Society of Archivists published \"Describing Archives in Context: A Guide to Australasian Practice\" in 2004, which provides the basis for description using the Australian Series System. Series description is based on the primacy of the series as a basis for arrangement and description, rather than on fonds as is the practice in other jurisdictions.\n\nArchival processing often includes basic preservation practices such as removing staples and paperclips, placing materials in acid-free folders and boxes, isolating acidic materials to avoid acid migration, photocopying damaged or acidic documents, and unfolding papers. There has been a trend for archives and manuscript repositories in the past few years to try new ways to reduce backlogs and provide access to materials as quickly as possible, described and encouraged by the 2005 article, “More Product, Less Process: Revamping Traditional Archival Processing” by Mark A. Greene and Dennis Meissner. Their method discourages these basic practices in the interest of accelerating processing to provide quicker access to researchers.Their argument also acknowledges the assumption of proper climate control in modern institutions, which would slow the deterioration of acidic paper and rusting of metal fasteners.\n\n\n"}

The institute holds the largest botanical collection in western India.\n\nThe Herbarium was founded by the Jesuit priest and taxonomist, Ethelbert Blatter, SJ. It was renamed in his honour in 1941 by his associate and director of the Herbarium, Father Henry Santapau, SJ. Father Santapau went on to direct the Botanical Survey of India, and was recognized by the Indian Government with a Padmashri in 1964 for his services to Indian botany.\n\nThe two priests are regarded as pioneers in Indian plant taxonomy, and contributed over 500 scientific articles to various journals.

Its first designer was Jean-François Oeben, the master cabinet maker of the royal arsenal. The first step in its construction was the fabrication of an extremely detailed miniature model in wax. The full scale desk was finished in 1769 by his successor, Jean Henri Riesener, who had married Oeben's widow. \n\nMade for the new \"Cabinet du Roi\" at the Palace of Versailles, it was transferred to the Louvre Museum in Paris after the French Revolution, but has been returned to the Palace of Versailles in the 20th century where it stands again in the room where it was standing before the Revolution, i.e. the \"Cabinet intérieur du Petit Appartement\" (\"Inner study of the Private Apartments\"), the famous study room where kings Louis XV and Louis XVI carried out their daily work, and where King Louis XVI decided to support the American insurgents in 1777. Secret diplomatic papers were kept inside the secretary's secret drawers, whose only key the king always carried with him.\n\nThe desk is covered with intricate marquetry of a wide variety of fine woods. In an oval reserve at the center of its 'public' side, away from the king himself, is the marquetry head of Silence, with forefinger to lips, a reminder of the discretion required in the king's business. Gilt-bronze moldings of plaques, statuettes, miniature busts and vases, even integral scrolling gilt-bronze candle stands, further adorn the surfaces of the desk. The original design was to have a miniature bust of Louis XV on top, but it was replaced by Minerva after his death in 1770.\n\nRiesener later executed a simplified second version of the Bureau du Roi for Pierre-Gaspard-Marie Grimod, comte d'Orsay; today this may be seen in the Wallace Collection in London. His copy was the first of a number of replicas that were produced from the 1870s onwards by leading cabinetmakers in Paris, including four examples by François Linke.\n\n"}
{"id": "5751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5751", "title": "Chinese language", "text": "Chinese language\n\nChinese (; or ) is a group of related, but in many cases not mutually intelligible, language varieties, forming the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Chinese is spoken by the Han majority and many minority ethnic groups in China. About 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their first language.\n\nThe varieties of Chinese are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a language family.\nThe internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the Romance languages, but may be even more varied. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken by far is Mandarin (about 960 million, e.g. Southwestern Mandarin), followed by Wu (80 million, e.g. Shanghainese), Min (70 million, e.g. Southern Min), Yue (60 million, e.g. Cantonese), etc. Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, and even dialect groups within Min Chinese may not be mutually intelligible. Some, however, like Xiang and certain Southwest Mandarin dialects, may share common terms and a certain degree of intelligibility. All varieties of Chinese are tonal and analytic.\n\nStandard Chinese \"(Pǔtōnghuà/Guóyǔ/Huáyǔ)\" is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. It is the official language of China and Taiwan, as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. The written form of the standard language (; \"Zhōngwén\"), based on the logograms known as Chinese characters (/; \"Hànzì\"), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.\n\nThe earliest Chinese written records are Shang dynasty-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 BCE. The phonetic categories of Archaic Chinese can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the Northern and Southern dynasties period, Middle Chinese went through several sound changes and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. \"Qieyun\", a rime dictionary, recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a koiné language (Guanhua) based on Nanjing dialect of Lower Yangtze Mandarin. Standard Chinese was adopted in the 1930s, and is now the official language of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.\n\nMost linguists classify all varieties of Chinese as part of the Sino-Tibetan language family, together with Burmese, Tibetan and many other languages spoken in the Himalayas and the Southeast Asian Massif.\nAlthough the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as Indo-European or Austroasiatic.\nDifficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.\nIn addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, and are often also sensitive border zones.\nWithout a secure reconstruction of proto-Sino-Tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.\nA top-level branching into Chinese and Tibeto-Burman languages is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.\n\nThe first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the Shang dynasty. As the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible. In reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.\n\nThe earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones from around 1250 BCE in the late Shang dynasty.\nOld Chinese was the language of the Western Zhou period (1046–771 BCE), recorded in inscriptions on bronze artifacts, the \"Classic of Poetry\" and portions of the \"Book of Documents\" and \"I Ching\".\nScholars have attempted to reconstruct the phonology of Old Chinese by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the \"Classic of Poetry\" and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters.\nAlthough many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differs from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids.\nMost recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into tone distinctions in Middle Chinese.\nSeveral derivational affixes have also been identified, but the language lacks inflection, and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and grammatical particles.\n\nMiddle Chinese was the language used during Northern and Southern dynasties and the Sui, Tang, and Song dynasties (6th through 10th centuries CE).\nIt can be divided into an early period, reflected by the \"Qieyun\" rime book (601 CE), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by rhyme tables such as the \"Yunjing\" constructed by ancient Chinese philologists as a guide to the \"Qieyun\" system.\nThese works define phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent.\nLinguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern varieties of Chinese, borrowed Chinese words in Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and transcription evidence.\nThe resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect. Most linguists now believe it represents a diasystem encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.\n\nThe relationship between spoken and written Chinese is rather complex. Its spoken varieties have evolved at different rates, while written Chinese itself has changed much less. Classical Chinese literature began in the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song dynasty, and during the reign of the Jin (Jurchen) and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech (now called Old Mandarin) developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital.\nThe \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" (1324) was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new \"sanqu\" verse form in this language.\nTogether with the slightly later \"Menggu Ziyun\", this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects.\n\nUp to the early 20th century, most of the people in China spoke only their local variety.\nAs a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\" (/, literally \"language of officials\").\nFor most of this period, this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect.\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.\n\nIn the 1930s a standard national language \"Guóyǔ\" (/ \"national language\") was adopted.\nAfter much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932.\nThe People's Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard, calling it \"pǔtōnghuà\" (/ \"common speech\").\nThe national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both Mainland China and Taiwan.\nIn Hong Kong and Macau, because of their colonial and linguistic history, the language used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local Cantonese, although the standard language has become very influential and is being taught in schools.\n\nThe Chinese language has spread to neighbouring countries through a variety of means.\nNorthern Vietnam was incorporated into the Han empire in 111 BCE, marking the beginning of a period of Chinese control that ran almost continuously for a millennium.\nThe Four Commanderies were established in northern Korea in the first century BCE, but disintegrated in the following centuries.\nChinese Buddhism spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in Literary Chinese.\nLater Korea, Japan, and Vietnam developed strong central governments modeled on Chinese institutions, with Literary Chinese as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in Korea and (to a lesser extent) Japan, and the early 20th century in Vietnam.\nScholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using Literary Chinese.\n\nAlthough they used Chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called Sino-Xenic pronunciations.\nChinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies.\nThis massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of moraic structure in Japanese and the disruption of vowel harmony in Korean.\n\nBorrowed Chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of Latin and Ancient Greek roots in European languages.\nMany new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name Western concepts and artifacts.\nThese coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages.\nThey have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.\nOften different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries.\nThe proportion of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language.\nFor example, in Japan, Sino-Japanese words account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.\n\nVietnam, Korea, and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on Chinese characters, but later replaced with the \"Hangul\" alphabet for Korean and supplemented with \"kana\" syllabaries for Japanese, while Vietnamese continued to be written with the complex \"Chữ nôm\" script.\nHowever, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century.\nToday Japanese is written with a composite script using both Chinese characters (\"Kanji\") and kana. Korean is written exclusively with Hangul in North Korea, and supplementary Chinese characters (\"Hanja\") are increasingly rarely used in South Korea.\nVietnamese is written with a Latin-based alphabet.\n\nExamples of loan words in English include \"tea\", from Hokkien (Min Nan) \"\" (), \"dim sum\", from Cantonese \"dim sam\" and \"kumquat\", from Cantonese \"gamgwat\" ().\n\nJerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. These varieties form a dialect continuum, in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely. Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the North China Plain. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, Wuzhou is about upstream from Guangzhou, but the Yue variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of Taishan, southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers. In parts of Fujian the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken.\nThe vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America spoke the Taishan dialect, from a small coastal area southwest of Guangzhou.\n\nLocal varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials:\n\nThe classification of Li Rong, which is used in the \"Language Atlas of China\" (1987), distinguishes three further groups:\n\nSome varieties remain unclassified, including Danzhou dialect (spoken in Danzhou, on Hainan Island), Waxianghua (spoken in western Hunan) and Shaozhou Tuhua (spoken in northern Guangdong).\n\nStandard Chinese, often called Mandarin, is the official standard language of China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore (where it is called \"Huáyŭ\" or simply Chinese). Standard Chinese is based on the Beijing dialect, the dialect of Mandarin as spoken in Beijing. The governments of both China and Taiwan intend for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.\n\nIn mainland China and Taiwan, diglossia has been a common feature. For example, in addition to Standard Chinese, a resident of Shanghai might speak Shanghainese; and, if he or she grew up elsewhere, then he or she is also likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area. A native of Guangzhou may speak both Cantonese and Standard Chinese. In addition to Mandarin, most Taiwanese also speak Minnan, Hakka, or an Austronesian language. A Taiwanese may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from Mandarin and other Taiwanese languages, and this mixture is considered normal in daily or informal speech.\n\nThe official Chinese designation for the major branches of Chinese is \"fāngyán\" (, literally \"regional speech\"), whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called \"dìdiǎn fāngyán\" (/ \"local speech\"). Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use \"dialect\" for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) and \"dialect group\" for a regional grouping such as Mandarin or Wu. Because varieties from different groups are not mutually intelligible, some scholars prefer to describe Wu and others as separate languages. Jerry Norman called this practice misleading, pointing out that Wu, which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion, and that the same is true for each of the other groups.\n\nMutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language, although others do not regard it as decisive, particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with Chinese. As explains, linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. prestige variety, such as Standard Mandarin), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity. John DeFrancis argues that it is inappropriate to refer to Mandarin, Wu and so on as \"dialects\" because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. On the other hand, he also objects to considering them as separate languages, as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive \"religious, economic, political, and other differences\" between speakers that exist, for example, between French Catholics and English Protestants in Canada, but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China, owing to China's near-uninterrupted history of centralized government.\n\nBecause of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed: ISO 639-3 follows \"Ethnologue\" in assigning individual language codes to the 13 main subdivisions, while Chinese as a whole is classified as a 'macrolanguage'. Other options include \"vernacular\", \"lect\" \"regionalect\", \"topolect\", and \"variety\".\n\nMost Chinese people consider the spoken varieties as one single language because speakers share a common culture and history, as well as a shared national identity and a common written form. To Chinese nationalists, the idea of Chinese as a language family may suggest that the Chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than it actually is and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative. Additionally, some of whose supporters promote the local Taiwanese Hokkien variety.\n\nThe phonological structure of each syllable consists of a nucleus that has a vowel (which can be a monophthong, diphthong, or even a triphthong in certain varieties), preceded by an onset (a single consonant, or consonant+glide; zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a coda consonant; a syllable also carries a tone. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in Cantonese, where the nasal sonorant consonants and can stand alone as their own syllable.\n\nIn Mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final glide is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals , , , the retroflex approximant , and voiceless stops , , , or . Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as Standard Chinese, are limited to only , and .\n\nThe number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from Middle Chinese. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.\n\nAll varieties of spoken Chinese use tones to distinguish words. A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is Shanghainese which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned pitch accent system much like modern Japanese.\n\nA very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese is the application of the four tones of Standard Chinese (along with the neutral tone) to the syllable \"ma\". The tones are exemplified by the following five Chinese words:\n\nStandard Cantonese, in contrast, has six tones in open syllables and three tones in syllables ending with stops:\nChinese is often described as a \"monosyllabic\" language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing Classical Chinese and Middle Chinese; in Classical Chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. In the modern varieties, it is usually the case that a morpheme (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; In contrast, English has plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as \"seven\", \"elephant\", \"para-\" and \"-able\".\n\nSome of the conservative southern varieties of modern Chinese have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary. In modern Mandarin, however, most nouns, adjectives and verbs are largely disyllabic. A significant cause of this is phonological attrition. Sound change over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. In modern Mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in Vietnamese (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in English.\n\nThis phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of homophones. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary lists six words that are commonly pronounced as \"shí\" (tone 2): \"ten\"; / \"real, actual\"; / \"know (a person), recognize\"; \"stone\"; / \"time\"; \"food, eat\". These were all pronounced differently in Early Middle Chinese; in William H. Baxter's transcription they were \"dzyip\", \"zyit\", \"syik\", \"dzyek\", \"dzyi\" and \"zyik\" respectively. They are still pronounced differently in today's Cantonese; in Jyutping they are \"sap9\", \"sat9\", \"sik7\", \"sek9\", \"si4\", \"sik9\". In modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is; Yuen Ren Chao's modern poem Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced \"shi\". As such, most of these words have been replaced (in speech, if not in writing) with a longer, less-ambiguous compound. Only the first one, \"ten\", normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, \"shíjì\" / (lit. \"actual-connection\"); \"rènshi\" / (lit. \"recognize-know\"); \"shítou\" / (lit. \"stone-head\"); \"shíjiān\" / (lit. \"time-interval\"); \"shíwù\" (lit. \"food-thing\"). In each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another morpheme, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, \"head\", \"thing\"), the purpose of which is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected.\n\nHowever, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, \"shí\" alone, not \"shítou\" /, appears in compounds meaning \"stone-\", for example, \"shígāo\" \"plaster\" (lit. \"stone cream\"), \"shíhuī\" \"lime\" (lit. \"stone dust\"), \"shíkū\" \"grotto\" (lit. \"stone cave\"), \"shíyīng\" \"quartz\" (lit. \"stone flower\"), \"shíyóu\" \"petroleum\" (lit. \"stone oil\").\n\nMost modern varieties of Chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character compounds. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in \"kūlong\" from \"kǒng\" 孔; this is especially common in Jin.\n\nChinese morphology is strictly bound to a set number of syllables with a fairly rigid construction. Although many of these single-syllable morphemes (\"zì\", ) can stand alone as individual words, they more often than not form multi-syllabic compounds, known as \"cí\" (/), which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese \"cí\" (\"word\") can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.\n\nFor example:\n\nAll varieties of modern Chinese are analytic languages, in that they depend on syntax (word order and sentence structure) rather than morphology—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word's function in a sentence. In other words, Chinese has very few grammatical inflections—it possesses no tenses, no voices, no numbers (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few articles (i.e., equivalents to \"the, a, an\" in English).\n\nThey make heavy use of grammatical particles to indicate aspect and mood. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like \"le\" (perfective), \"hái\" / (\"still\"), \"yǐjīng\" / (\"already\"), and so on.\n\nChinese has a subject–verb–object word order, and like many other languages of East Asia, makes frequent use of the topic–comment construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of classifiers and measure words, another trait shared with neighboring languages like Japanese and Korean. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of serial verb construction, pronoun dropping and the related subject dropping.\n\nAlthough the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.\n\nThe entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. However Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words. Because most Chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more Chinese words than characters. A more accurate equivalent for a Chinese character is the morpheme, as characters represent the smallest grammatical units with individual meanings in the Chinese language.\n\nEstimates of the total number of Chinese words and lexicalized phrases vary greatly. The \"Hanyu Da Zidian\", a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including bone oracle versions. The \"Zhonghua Zihai\" (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The CC-CEDICT project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD), based on CC-CEDICT, contains over 84,000 entries.\n\nThe most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volume \"Hanyu Da Cidian\", records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised \"Cihai\", a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.\n\nThe 7th (2016) edition of \"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\", an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in mainland China, has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.\n\nLike any other language, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of loanwords from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.\n\nSome early Indo-European loanwords in Chinese have been proposed, notably \"mì\" \"honey\", / \"shī\" \"lion,\" and perhaps also / \"mǎ\" \"horse\", / \"zhū\" \"pig\", \"quǎn\" \"dog\", and / \"é\" \"goose\".\nAncient words borrowed from along the Silk Road since Old Chinese include \"pútáo\" \"grape\", \"shíliu\"/\"shíliú\" \"pomegranate\" and / \"shīzi\" \"lion\". Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including \"Fó\" \"Buddha\" and / \"Púsà\" \"bodhisattva.\" Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as \"hútòng\" \"hutong\". Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as \"grape,\" generally have Persian etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from Sanskrit or Pāli, the liturgical languages of North India. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the Gobi, Mongolian or northeast regions generally have Altaic etymologies, such as \"pípá\", the Chinese lute, or \"lào\"/\"luò\" \"cheese\" or \"yoghurt\", but from exactly which source is not always clear.\n\nModern neologisms are primarily translated into Chinese in one of three ways: free translation (\"calque\", or by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound), or a combination of the two. Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and international scientific vocabulary. Any Latin or Greek etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding Chinese characters (for example, \"anti-\" typically becomes \"\", literally \"opposite\"), making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word \"telephone\" was loaned phonetically as / (Shanghainese: \"télífon\" , Mandarin: \"délǜfēng\") during the 1920s and widely used in Shanghai, but later / \"diànhuà\" (lit. \"electric speech\"), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent ( is in fact from the Japanese \"denwa\"; see below for more Japanese loans). Other examples include / \"diànshì\" (lit. \"electric vision\") for television, / \"diànnǎo\" (lit. \"electric brain\") for computer; / \"shǒujī\" (lit. \"hand machine\") for mobile phone, / \"lányá\" (lit. \"blue tooth\") for Bluetooth, and / \"wǎngzhì\" (lit. \"internet logbook\") for blog in Hong Kong and Macau Cantonese. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as / \"hànbǎobāo\" ( \"hànbǎo\" \"Hamburg\" + \"bāo\" \"bun\") for \"hamburger\". Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes (phono-semantic matching), such as / \"tuōlājī\" \"tractor\" (lit. \"dragging-pulling machine\"), or / Mǎlì'ào for the video game character Mario. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example / \"bēnténg\" (lit. \"dashing-leaping\") for Pentium and / \"Sàibǎiwèi\" (lit. \"better-than hundred tastes\") for Subway restaurants.\n\nForeign words, mainly proper nouns, continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, \"Israel\" becomes \"Yǐsèliè\", \"Paris\" becomes \"Bālí\". A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including / \"shāfā\" \"sofa\", / \"mǎdá\" \"motor\", \"yōumò\" \"humor\", / \"luóji\"/\"luójí\" \"logic\", / \"shímáo\" \"smart, fashionable\", and \"xiēsīdǐlǐ\" \"hysterics\". The bulk of these words were originally coined in the Shanghai dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin may be quite off from the English. For example, / \"sofa\" and / \"motor\" in Shanghainese sound more like their English counterparts. Cantonese differs from Mandarin with some transliterations, such as \"so faa\" \"sofa\" and \"mo daa\" \"motor\".\n\nWestern foreign words representing Western concepts have influenced Chinese since the 20th century through transcription. From French came \"bāléi\" \"ballet\" and \"xiāngbīn\", \"champagne\"; from Italian, \"kāfēi\" \"caffè\". English influence is particularly pronounced. From early 20th century Shanghainese, many English words are borrowed, such as / \"gāoěrfū\" \"golf\" and the above-mentioned / \"shāfā\" \"sofa\". Later, the United States soft influences gave rise to \"dísikē\"/\"dísīkē\" \"disco\", / \"kělè\" \"cola\", and \"mínǐ\" \"mini [skirt]\". Contemporary colloquial Cantonese has distinct loanwords from English, such as \"kaa tung\" \"cartoon\", \"gei lou\" \"gay people\", \"dik si\" \"taxi\", and \"baa si\" \"bus\". With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, / \"fěnsī\" \"fans\", \"hēikè\" \"hacker\" (lit. \"black guest\"), and \"bókè\" \"blog\". In Taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as \"hàikè\" for \"hacker\" and \"bùluògé\" for \"blog\" (lit. \"interconnected tribes\").\n\nAnother result of the English influence on Chinese is the appearance in Modern Chinese texts of so-called / \"zìmǔcí\" (lit. \"lettered words\") spelled with letters from the English alphabet. This has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites, and on TV: / \"3rd generation cell phones\" ( \"sān\" \"three\" + G \"generation\" + / \"shǒujī\" \"mobile phones\"), \"IT circles\" (IT \"information technology\" + \"jiè\" \"industry\"), HSK (\"Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì\", /), GB (\"Guóbiāo\", /), / (CIF \"Cost, Insurance, Freight\" + / \"jià\" \"price\"), \"e-home\" (e \"electronic\" + \"jiātíng\" \"home\"), / \"wireless era\" (W \"wireless\" + / \"shídài\" \"era\"), \"TV watchers\" (TV \"television\" + \"zú\" \"social group; clan\"), / \"post-PC era\" (/ \"hòu\" \"after/post-\" + PC \"personal computer\" + /), and so on.\n\nSince the 20th century, another source of words has been Japanese using existing kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Japanese re-molded European concepts and inventions into , and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, \"jīngjì\" (/; \"keizai\" in Japanese), which in the original Chinese meant \"the workings of the state\", was narrowed to \"economy\" in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this loaning, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin and shared among European languages.\n\nThe Chinese orthography centers on Chinese characters, which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns. Chinese characters denote morphemes independent of phonetic change. Thus the character (\"one\") is uttered \"yī\" in Standard Chinese, \"yat\" in Cantonese and \"it\" in Hokkien (form of Min). Vocabularies from different major Chinese variants have diverged, and colloquial nonstandard written Chinese often makes use of unique \"dialectal characters\", such as and for Cantonese and Hakka, which are considered archaic or unused in standard written Chinese.\n\nWritten colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging amongst Hong-Kongers and Cantonese-speakers elsewhere. It is considered highly informal, and does not extend to many formal occasions.\n\nThe Chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early rime books and dictionaries. Early Indian translators, working in Sanskrit and Pali, were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some rudimentary Latin transcription systems, based on the Nanjing Mandarin dialect.\n\nIn Hunan, women in certain areas write their local language in Nü Shu, a syllabary derived from Chinese characters. The Dungan language, considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in Cyrillic, and was previously written in the Arabic script. The Dungan people are primarily Muslim and live mainly in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia; some of the related Hui people also speak the language and live mainly in China.\n\nEach Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen classified characters into six categories, namely pictographs, simple ideographs, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as \"rén\" (human), \"rì\" (sun), \"shān\" (mountain; hill), \"shuǐ\" (water). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as \"chōng\" (pour), combining a phonetic component \"zhōng\" (middle) with a semantic radical (water). Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century Kangxi Dictionary recognized 214 radicals.\n\nModern characters are styled after the regular script. Various other written styles are also used in Chinese calligraphy, including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.\n\nThere are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants.\n\nSingapore, which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the \"de facto\" standard for younger ethnic Chinese in Malaysia. The Internet provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified.\n\nA well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a Mainland newspaper. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000. A large unabridged dictionary, like the Kangxi Dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.\n\nRomanization is the process of transcribing a language into the Latin script. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western Christian missionaries in the 16th century.\n\nToday the most common romanization standard for Standard Chinese is \"Hanyu Pinyin\", often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the People's Republic of China, and later adopted by Singapore and Taiwan. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across America, Australia and Europe. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the Pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.\n\nThe second-most common romanization system, the Wade–Giles, was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an Anglicization, it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade–Giles was found in academic use in the United States, particularly before the 1980s, and until recently was widely used in Taiwan.\n\nWhen used within European texts, the tone transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade–Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade–Giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with \"Beijing\" than they will be with \"Běijīng\" (pinyin), and with \"Taipei\" than \"T'ai²-pei³\" (Wade–Giles). This simplification presents syllables as homophones which really are none, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.\n\nHere are a few examples of \"Hanyu Pinyin\" and Wade–Giles, for comparison:\nOther systems of romanization for Chinese include Gwoyeu Romatzyh, the French EFEO, the Yale (invented during WWII for U.S. troops), as well as separate systems for Cantonese, Min Nan, Hakka, and other Chinese varieties.\n\nChinese varieties have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The 'Phags-pa script, for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of Chinese.\n\nZhuyin (colloquially \"bopomofo\"), a semi-syllabary is still widely used in Taiwan's elementary schools to aid standard pronunciation. Although zhuyin characters are reminiscent of katakana script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that Katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. A comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the zhuyin article. Syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:\n\nThere are also at least two systems of cyrillization for Chinese. The most widespread is the Palladius system.\n\nWith the growing importance and influence of China's economy globally, Mandarin instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the United States, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the Western world, as in the UK.\n\nIn 1991 there were 2,000 foreign learners taking China's official Chinese Proficiency Test (also known as HSK, comparable to the English Cambridge Certificate), while in 2005, the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660. By 2010, 750,000 people had taken the Chinese Proficiency Test. By 2017, 6.5 million candidates had taken the Chinese Proficiency Test of various kinds.\n\nAccording to the Modern Language Association, there were 550 elementary, junior high and senior high schools providing Chinese programs in the United States in 2015, which represented a 100% increase in two years. At the same time, enrollment in Chinese language classes at college level had an increase of 51% from 2002 to 2015. On the other hand, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages also had figures suggesting that 30,000 – 50,000 students were studying Chinese in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, more than half a million Chinese students pursued post-secondary education overseas, whereas 400,000 international students came to China for higher education. Tsinghua University hosted 35,000 students from 116 countries in the same year.\n\nWith the increase in demand for Chinese as a second language, there are 330 institutions teaching Chinese language globally according to the Chinese Ministry of Education. The establishment of Confucius Institutes, which are the public institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China, aims at promoting Chinese language and culture as well as supporting Chinese teaching overseas. There were more than 480 Confucius Institutes worldwide as of 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Discovered in a poor condition in 1960 during restoration work in the central Bulgarian village of Enina, the partially preserved parchment manuscript is housed in the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library in Sofia. It is the oldest Cyrillic manuscript currently held by any Bulgarian collection.\n\nThe Enina Apostle was discovered in 1960 during the restoration of the old Church of Saint Paraskeva in the village of Enina. The village lies in south central Bulgaria, north of Kazanlăk, and is administratively part of Stara Zagora Province. The manuscript was initially in a very poor condition, with only 39 leaves and parts of leaves extant, and hardly a single leaf preserved in its entirety.\n\nFrom its discovery to 1964 the Enina Apostle was housed in the Kazanlăk Museum. In 1964, the manuscript was transferred to the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library in the capital Sofia, where it has been housed ever since as MS №1144. The Enina Apostle is part of the library′s collection of 1,500 Slavic manuscripts. Among these, it is of utmost importance because of its antiquity, as well as its palaeographic and linguistic features. In December 2010, a commemorative plaque dedicated to the Enina Apostle was installed in the courtyard of the Church of Saint Paraskeva in honour of the 50th anniversary of the manuscript′s discovery.\n\nThe Enina Apostle is a short Apostolos lectionary, written on parchment in the second half of the 11th century, which makes it the oldest Cyrillic manuscript currently part of a Bulgarian collection. The leaves are in size, and the written area . It was written by a single scribe in a sloping uncial using dark brown ink. Ff.6r and 38r feature decorative headpieces of geometric and floral design. Additional decoration includes 18 initials, which are mostly geometric, though sometimes floral or interlaced. An initial on f.3 depicts a bird′s head, while ff.28v and 36v both have a Glagolitic letter Ⰱ as the initial letter of a reading.\n\nThe Enina Apostle is thought to have originally consisted of circa 215–220 leaves, of which only 39 have been at least partially preserved. Both the beginning and the end of the manuscript are missing, and there are no surviving marginal notes. The surviving text of the manuscript consists of readings from the Acts and Epistles for Saturdays and Sundays from the 35th Sunday after Pentecost until Great Saturday and for selected feasts from 1 September until 3 October, the feast day of Dionysius the Areopagite. The language of the text is classified as either Old Church Slavonic or as belonging to a category that chronologically immediately follows Old Church Slavonic.\n\n"}

This means that it should be possible to exchange subject authority data between systems. If a user looks up a specific subject in a catalog and wants to look in other places, he or she should not have to worry about translating the query, since the system would be able to recognize the underlying thema and automatically translate it into the relevant nomen. One way to understand this is to think about how a subject can be described in different ways. For example, if one looks at a work about the city Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, there are many ways to describe Stockholm. First, one must distinguish between the city Stockholm and the many other meanings of the word; for example, Stockholm is also the name of other cities, a record label, and a syndrome. When the thema is established in an authority file, it is possible to translate across systems. The nomen for Stockholm could be anything from \"Stockholm\", \"Stockholm (City)\", \"Tukholma\" - the Finnish spelling of Stockholm - or a range of Zip-codes, or the longitude and latitude, or a picture of the city, or a sound. FRSAR, if implemented, enables users to perform specific and precise subject searching across multiple systems.\n\nWorks and themas have a many-to-many relationship, meaning that any work can have more than one subject, and any subject can be expressed in one or more works. The same is true for the relationship between thema and nomen. A thema can be expressed in many different ways and a nomen can express many different themas, all depending on the given system. Besides these relationships, the workgroup has so far identified several other thema-thema and nomen-nomen relationships. Two nomens can, for example, be said to have an equivalence relationship, if they both are appellations of the same thema.\n\nThe workgroup conducted two user studies in 2006 and 2007, and based on the results of these studies, four subject authority data user tasks were defined (2008 FRSAR News Report to IFLA):\n\nFind: to find an entity (thema or nomen) or set of entities corresponding to stated criteria \n\nIdentify: to identify an entity (thema or nomen) based on certain attributes / characteristics\n\nSelect: to select an entity (thema or nomen)\n\nExplore: to explore any relationships between entities (thema or nomen), correlations to other subject vocabularies and structure of a subject domain\n\n\n"}

The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Vermont takes its name, in part, from Marsh. His 1864 book \"Man and Nature\" had a great impact in many parts of the world.\n\nGeorge Perkins Marsh was born in Woodstock, Vermont, to a prominent family. His father, Charles Marsh, had been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. George Marsh graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, in 1816 and from Dartmouth College with highest honors in 1820. He studied law in Burlington, Vermont, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and practiced law in Burlington. He also devoted himself to philological studies. In 1835 he was appointed to the Executive Council of Vermont, and from 1843 to 1849 was a Whig representative in Congress. He served as an editor of \"Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley\" which was published in 1848.\n\nIn 1849 President Zachary Taylor appointed Marsh United States minister resident in the Ottoman Empire. He rendered valuable service to the cause of civil and religious toleration in that empire. In 1852–1853, he discharged a mission to Greece in connection with the imprisonment of American missionary Jonas King. He accomplished this task with a vigor that surprised the diplomats of Athens and showed a masterly knowledge of the Greek constitution and legislation, as well as of international law.\n\nMarsh was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.\n\nHe returned to Vermont in 1854. In 1857 he was appointed by the governor of Vermont to make a report to the legislature in regard to the artificial propagation of fish. He had previously been appointed one of the commissioners to rebuild the state house at Montpelier and in 1857 was appointed as the state railroad commissioner, succeeding Charles Linsley.\n\nIn 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Marsh the first United States minister to the Kingdom of Italy. Marsh would go on to be the longest-serving chief of mission in U.S. history, serving as envoy for 21 years until his death at Vallombrosa in 1882. He is buried at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.\n\nMarsh was an able linguist, able to both speak and write fluently in Swedish and half a dozen other European languages. He was a remarkable philologist for his day, and a scholar of great breadth, knowing much of military science, engraving and physics, as well as Icelandic, which was his specialty. He wrote many articles for Johnson's \"Universal Cyclopaedia\", and contributed many reviews and letters to \"The Nation\". \n\nHe was an admirer of the Goths, whose presence he traced in whatever is great and peculiar in the character of the founders of New England. He owned the finest collection of Scandinavian literature outside of Scandinavia. Part of it ultimately became the property of the University of Vermont, through the liberality of Frederick Billings. During the winter of 1858/9 he began a course of thirty lectures on the English language at Columbia University, and a year later he delivered a second course, on the grammatical history of English literature, before the Lowell Institute, in Boston. Marsh played a role in the creation of the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary by acting as Coordinator of the American readers.\n\nHis book \"Man and Nature\" (1864) constituted an early work of ecology, and played a role in the creation of the Adirondack Park. Marsh argued that deforestation could lead to desertification. Referring to the clearing of once-lush lands surrounding the Mediterranean, he asserted \"the operation of causes set in action by man has brought the face of the earth to a desolation almost as complete as that of the moon.\" He argued that welfare is secured as long as man manages resources and keep them in good condition. Welfare of future generations should be one of resource management determinants. Resource scarcity is a result of misbalancing an environmental equilibrium. In other words: it comes from unreasonable human action rather than is determined by some absolute resource scarcity.\n\n\nHe prepared an American edition of Hensleigh Wedgwood's \"Dictionary of English Etymology\" (New York, 1862), to which he made large additions and annotations. He translated Rask's \"Icelandic Grammar\".\n\nHis second wife, Caroline (Crane) Marsh (1816–1901), whom he married in 1839, published \"Wolfe of the Knoll and other Poems\" (1860), and the \"Life and Letters of George Perkins Marsh\" (New York, 1888). This last work was left incomplete, the second volume never having been published. She also translated from the German of Johann C. Biernatzki (1795–1840), \"The Hallig; or the Sheepfold in the Waters\" (1856). (See \"Hallig\").\n\nMarsh actively studied and collected engravings, including European Old Master prints. His collection included more than a thousand prints by various artists, dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries, representing works by Rembrandt, Albrecht Dürer, William Hogarth and others. In 1849, the Smithsonian Institution purchased a large group of Marsh's European prints and art books, which was transferred on deposit to the Library of Congress in 1865. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Smithsonian got some of the Marsh Collection returned, but part of it still remains at the Library of Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, human trafficking is defined as follows: “Trafficking in persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.”\n\nAccording to Kapstein in the journal of Foreign Affairs, the industrial states have failed to put in much effort to alleviate the issue. He believes that the problem is not one of political capability, but political will. A challenge in combating human trafficking in Middle Eastern countries is that the governments deny there is a problem. The lack of political will is partially the result of empty threats from the international community, but most of it can be attributed to deeper economic forces and sociological factors at play. In her article in \"Global Tides,\" Stephanie Doe states that sex trafficking is a sensitive topic in the Middle East for various reasons. On one level, it suggests moral corruption, which implies the waning influence of Islamic values in society. On a more significant level, in most Middle Eastern countries, because the governments are responsible for preserving tradition and upholding Islamic authority, it challenges their ability to retain a nation unified by Islam. Consequently, if the government was to acknowledge sex trafficking as a problem, it could be interpreted as alluding to the state’s diminishing power. It is difficult to quantify how large the problem of human trafficking is because trafficked persons are usually kept out of sight and in inaccessible locations. Human trafficking is an underground activity and the victims are referred to as a “hidden population.” The profits from this industry often go through a process of money laundering, making it difficult to trace the activities of traffickers. Girls and women who are sexually exploited by rape, forced prostitution, or sexual slavery are tainted with social stigmas for the rest of their lives. The link to sexual immorality further exacerbates this stigma. Once that link is created, the damage the woman's reputation can never be undone. In 2003, a study published in the \"Journal of Trauma Practice\" found that 89 percent of women in prostitution wanted to escape. Additionally, 60-75 percent of women in prostitution had been raped and 70-95 percent had been physically assaulted.\n\nFor the majority of the 1990s, human trafficking was incorrectly defined as illegal migration, smuggling, or sex work. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons defines trafficking comprehensively: its focus is on coercion for the purpose of exploitation, and it precludes the possibility of legal consent by the victims of traffickers. In the Middle East, some of the most prevalent forms of human trafficking are forced labor of migrant workers, sexual enslavement and forced prostitution and camel jockeying of young boys.\n\nToday slavery typically involves women and children being sold into involuntary servitude by the means of violence and deprivation. There is a clear lack of labor protection laws for domestic workers in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. The international community recognizes the trafficking of women and children as a modern form of slavery. Many migrant people, mainly from Asian states, are tricked into coming to the Middle East, where they find themselves in a forced labor situation or working for very low wages. Traffickers trap their victims by coercion, force, or fraud. The forced labor of migrant workers is especially prevalent in the oil-rich Persian Gulf states of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The workers are frequently held to pay off the debt they have accumulated from the costs of travel and housing. Trafficking from South Asia to the Middle East is a serious problem, with about 200,000 persons trafficked over 20 years, and 3,400 children over the last 10 years. The International Labor Organization estimates the minimum number of persons in forced labor in the Middle East and North Africa is around 230,000.\n\nMost commonly, but not exclusively, human trafficking is exploitation in the form of forced prostitution or sexual enslavement. State authorities have typically confused sex trafficking with prostitution. Some young impoverished women are attracted to the sex industry because it appears to offer quick and easy money. Traffickers often lure desperate young women with the promise of a better paying job or higher education into a destination country where their documentation and passports are forcibly taken from them as soon as they arrive. These women often find themselves in slave-like situations. Once trafficked into the sex industry, traffickers control the women through physical and psychological means. Prostitution in the Middle East is strictly illegal, along with all sexual activity outside lawful marriage. The religious outlawing of extramarital sex reinforces this trade and consequently further bolsters the demand for prostitution. The issue is exacerbated by the lack of legislative actions taken by states to control prostitution and trafficking.\n\nEven though the most common forms of human trafficking are sexual enslavement and forced labor, these are not the only cases. The type of trafficking that is quite unique to the Middle East is the forced camel jockeying of young boys. Camel racing is a particularly dangerous and violent practice that young boys are forced into against their will. Boys from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are recruited around five years of age to be camel jockeys in Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates. Their parents normally sell them to agents who go around poor districts in these countries and offer to take male children away to the UAE to work. These agents tell parents that the children will earn large sums of money that will be sent home to the families. The parents are typically deceived about the conditions of work. They are led to believe that the children are going to obtain good jobs and will have a better future than if they remain at home. Usually the boys do not know who is taking them abroad or for what purpose. Most of the boys are not aware they will become camel jockeys against their will. When they arrive in the UAE, the children are transferred to \"azbas\", which are camel training complexes in the desert. The children are subject to several forms of abuse during their stay, including punishments such as a lack of food and electric shocks. Lack of food is a common practice because their owners try to maintain their weight at less than 20 kg (44 lbs) for racing purposes. Deaths and injuries of children during racing is another major concern. If children accidentally die during a race they are buried straight away to avoid police investigations of the death. The conditions in the azbas are very restricting. Children are not allowed to leave the camel training complex. They sleep on cardboard boxes, making them very prone to scorpion bites. The children rise at 4:00am to begin exercising the camels. Every day they take the camels for rides until 11:00am. Then they are allowed to rest for two hours before feeding and cleaning the camels. Then they exercise the camels again until nightfall. The children are supposed to be paid for their work but that is almost never the case. The agent usually takes the salary and keeps it without allocating any to the child or his family. Running away is a virtual impossibility for children deployed as camel jockeys since the azbas are usually in remote desert locations. Usually children leave when they become too old or heavy and are no longer considered suitable for camel racing. Other children are sent home because they become seriously injured from racing. Police or immigration rescues are virtually unknown in the azbas.\n\nOne of the major forces driving human trafficking in the Middle East is the large influx of foreign migration. Research conducted in 1996 on the routes of illegal migration, smuggling and trafficking concluded that over the period 1992-97, the majority of illegal migrants to Europe had originated from Iraq, China, Pakistan, India or Africa. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) notes trafficking of women from Ghana to Lebanon, Libya and EU countries, women for domestic service from Central and West Africa to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and even voluntary migrations of women from Ethiopia to the Middle East, where working conditions are considered to be virtual slavery. The Middle East is a destination region for men and women trafficked for the purpose of commercial and sexual exploitation. Wealthy Arab men from the Persian Gulf area have been known to rent flats that are ‘furnished with housemaids’ for anywhere from a few hours to a few months. Most of the prostitutes and human trafficking victims tend to be from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Very few countries in the Middle East are devoid of the commercial sex industry.\n\nOf the many locations where human trafficking is prevalent in the Middle East, most are characterized by poverty. Human trafficking is a market fueled by principles of supply and demand. Therefore, where there is poverty, there is a likely supply to meet the growing demand for sexual entertainment. Economic vulnerability increases the likelihood of women becoming sexual commodities for wealthy Arabs in the Persian Gulf area. Although there are overwhelming social implications, there also seem to be regional financial patterns that perpetuate this trend. Fewer work opportunities for women have led to prostitution as an alternative. For example, in Egypt, women from lower-class backgrounds see that a few nights in prostitution generates more money than one month’s work in the public sector. This makes Egypt a popular location for international sex tourism. Despite sex tourism being illegal, Egyptians find it hard to turn away Gulf hard currency due to their crumbling economy. The proliferation of prostitution, sex tourism, and misyar marriages can be understood as the consequence of uneven economic development, further exacerbated by principles of supply and demand. Persian Gulf nationals have the will and the means to pursue sexual entertainment, and poorer Muslim communities can supply services in return for financial security.\n\nTo avoid the repercussions of sex outside marriage, Middle Eastern men and women in certain countries engage in a common practice by the name of \"misyar marriage\", also called Nikah Misyar. This type of marriage was born for the sole purpose of physical pleasure. It can be defined as a “temporary marriage,” or its literal translation, “traveling marriage.” Misyar marriages do not require cohabitation of the husband and wife, long-term commitment, welfare provisions to the wife, or the intention of procreating, which are all the elements of a traditional Islamic marriage. While misyar marriages do have a technical contract, the duration of the marriage is not explicitly stated in the contract but instead implied. Misyar marriages have been commonly referred to as “legal prostitution,” A marriage of this kind is not an option for a woman who wants to be viewed as respectable because it compromises many of her rights and basic values. Despite its controversial nature, misyar marriages are both religiously and legally accepted as valid marriages. According to Syed Ahmad, misyar marriages are popular in Islamic countries because it legitimizes sexual relations outside conventional marriages. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, a leading authority and one of the few remaining figures of Islamic scholarship, states that the misyar marriage is religiously legitimate. Al-Qaradawi adds that “there is no doubt that such marriage may be somehow socially unacceptable, but there is a big difference between what is Islamically valid and what is socially acceptable.” He is indicating that as long as both parties accept the terms of the marriage contract, they are legally married in the eyes of Allah. Misyar marriages purportedly prevent unmarried youth and widows from fulfilling their sexual desires outside marriage, which would traditionally be considered sinful. Misyar legitimizes these acts that would otherwise be seen as unlawful. The Middle East is well known for its strict observation of moral codes and sensitivity to the taboo subject of sex. In most societies of the Middle East where Islam is the dominant religion, premarital and extramarital sex is considered fornication. In a few countries, fornicators receive one hundred lashes of a whip with a crowd of witnesses for sins such as premarital sex. \"Zina\" is the word in many Middle Eastern countries for the concept of sexual misconduct by men and women. Despite all of these repercussions for extramarital sex, media coverage and human rights groups are revealing that prostitution is present and thriving in the Middle East. Misyar marriages also tend to exploit the economic vulnerability of women in poverty.\n\n"}

{"id": "24921390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24921390", "title": "Legendary creature", "text": "Legendary creature\n\nA legendary, mythical, or mythological creature, traditionally called a fabulous beast or fabulous creature, is a fictitious, imaginary and often supernatural animal, often a hybrid, sometimes part human, whose existence has not or cannot be proved and that is described in folklore or fiction but also in historical accounts before history became a science.\n\nIn the classical era, monstrous creatures such as the cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity. Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures, for example dragons, griffins, and unicorns. Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, which supposedly grew tethered to the earth.\n\nA variety of mythical animals appear in the art and stories of the Classical era. For example in the \"Odyssey\", monstrous creatures include the Cyclops, Scylla and Charybdis for the hero Odysseus to confront. In other tales there appear the Medusa to be defeated by Perseus, the (human/bull) Minotaur to be destroyed by Theseus, and the Hydra to be killed by Heracles, while Aeneas battles with the harpies. These monsters thus have the basic function of emphasizing the greatness of the heroes involved.\n\nSome classical era creatures, such as the (horse/human) centaur, chimaera, Triton and the flying horse, are found also in Indian art. Similarly, sphinxes appear as winged lions in Indian art and the Piasa Bird of North America.\n\nIn medieval art, animals, both real and mythical, played important roles. These included decorative forms as in medieval jewellery, sometimes with their limbs intricately interlaced. Animal forms were used to add humor or majesty to objects. In Christian art, animals carried symbolic meanings, where for example the lamb symbolized Christ, a dove indicated the Holy Spirit, and the classical griffin represented a guardian of the dead. Medieval bestiaries included animals regardless of biological reality; the basilisk represented the devil, while the manticore symbolised temptation.\n\nOne function of mythical animals in the Middle Ages was allegory. Unicorns, for example, were described as extraordinarily swift and uncatchable by traditional methods. It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling. Then, the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep, at which point a hunter could finally capture it. In terms of symbolism, the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ. Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity. In the King James Bible, Psalm 92:10 states, \"My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn.\" This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word re'em as unicorn. Later versions translate this as wild ox. The unicorn's small size signifies the humility of Christ.\n\nAnother common legendary creature which served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the dragon. Dragons were identified with serpents, though their attributes were greatly intensified. The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals. It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom. Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil, and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages. Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India, based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations.\n\nPhysical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting such animals, and medieval bestiaries were not conceived as biological categorizations. Creatures like the unicorn and griffin were not categorized in a separate \"mythological\" section in medieval bestiaries, as the symbolic implications were of primary importance. Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach. It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings. Nona C. Flores explains, \"By the tenth century, artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation, and abandoned naturalistic depictions.\" Similarly, the historian Richard Kieckhefer explains, \"Magic is not meant to work but to express wishes, or to encode in symbols a perception of how things do or should work.\"\n\n\n"}

She later became the successful author of a series of murder mysteries and a number of works on U.S. First Ladies and First Families, including biographies of her father, President Harry S. Truman and mother Bess Truman. She was married to journalist Clifton Daniel, managing editor of \"The New York Times\". The couple were prominent New York socialites who often hosted events for the New York elite.\n\nMary Margaret was born in Independence, Missouri, on February 17, 1924, and was christened Mary Margaret Truman (for her aunt Mary Jane Truman and maternal grandmother Margaret Gates Wallace) but was called Margaret from early childhood. She attended school in Independence until her father's 1934 election to the United States Senate, after which her education was split between schools in Washington, D.C. and Independence.\n\nIn 1942, she matriculated at George Washington University, where she was a member of Pi Beta Phi and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in History in 1946. In June 1944, she christened the battleship USS \"Missouri\" at Brooklyn Navy Yard, and spoke again in 1986 at the ship's recommissioning.\n\nAfter classical vocal training, Truman's singing career began with a debut radio recital in March 1947 followed shortly thereafter with her professional concert debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. She sang professionally for the next decade, appearing with major American orchestras and giving several national concert tours. Some of her credits include concert appearances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the National Symphony Orchestra, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburg Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Saint Louis Symphony among others. While she never performed in staged operas, she did perform opera arias in concert. Her performances were mainly of both sacred and secular art songs, lieder, and works from the concert soprano repertoire. In 1951 she recorded an album of American Art Songs for RCA Victor. She also made recordings of German lieder for NBC. A 1951 \"Time Magazine\" cover featured Truman with a single musical note floating by her head. She performed on stage, radio, and television through 1956.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, critical reviews of Truman’s singing were positive or diplomatic in tone, with one later reviewer speculating that negative opinions were held back out of deference for her father as a current sitting United Stares President. This practice was broken in 1950 when \"Washington Post\" music critic Paul Hume wrote that Truman was \"extremely attractive on the stage... [but] cannot sing very well. She is flat a good deal of the time. And still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.\" The review angered President Truman who wrote to Hume, \"Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!\" His response was published by \"The Washington Post\" and drew international headlines, becoming a minor scandal for the Truman administration. Reviewers after that, felt more free to be honest in their reviews of her performances, with mixed criticism for her singing thereafter.\n\nTruman's professional acting debut occurred April 26, 1951. She co-starred with James Stewart in the \"Jackpot\" episode of \"Screen Directors Playhouse\" on NBC radio. On March 17, 1952, Truman was guest soloist on \"The Railroad Hour\" in a presentation of \"Sari\".\n\nTruman also performed on the NBC Radio program \"The Big Show\". There she met writer Goodman Ace, who gave her advice and pointers; Ace became a lifelong friend, advising Truman even after \"The Big Show\".\nShe became part of the team of NBC Radio's \"Weekday\" show that premiered in 1955, shortly after its \"Monitor\" program made its debut. Paired with Mike Wallace, she presented news and interviews aimed at a female listening audience.\n\nShe appeared several times as a panelist (and twice as a mystery guest) on the game show \"What's My Line?\" and guest-starred more than once on NBC's \"The Martha Raye Show\".\n\nIn 1957, she sang and played piano on \"The Gisele MacKenzie Show\"\n\nTruman's full-length biography of her father, published shortly before his death, was critically acclaimed. She also wrote a personal biography of her mother and histories of the White House and its inhabitants (including first ladies and pets). A series of murder mysteries, the Capital Crimes series, set in and around Washington, D.C., were published under her name; they were ghostwritten, first by William Harrington (according to Harrington).\n\nAfter Harrington's apparent suicide, a self-written obituary was found in which he referred to Margaret Truman and others as his \"clients\". Harrington's literary agent (who was also Truman's agent) denied any collaboration with Truman, while somewhat obliquely acknowledging Harrington had \"worked on\" books credited to another author. Harrington has been \"squarely\" credited by at least one verifiable source with ghostwriting all the books published by the child of another United States president, Elliott Roosevelt and then, allegedly, those published by Donald Bain.\n\nTruman published regularly into her eighties. She served on the board of directors for the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum and the Board of Governors of the Roosevelt Institute.\n\nOn April 21, 1956, Truman married Clifton Daniel, a reporter for \"The New York Times\" and later editor, at Trinity Episcopal Church in Independence; he died in 2000. They had four sons:\n\nIn later life, Truman lived in her Park Avenue home. She died on January 29, 2008, in Chicago (to which she was relocating to be nearer her son Clifton). She was said to have been suffering from \"a simple infection\" and had been breathing with the assistance of a respirator. Her ashes, and those of her husband, were interred in Independence, in her parents' burial plot on the grounds of the Truman Library.\n\n"}

Occurring on set occasions, the ceremony involves two groups of locals fighting against one another using wooden canes and sticks. Both groups are masked, one as 'beautiful' and the other as 'ugly' Perchte.\n\nIn the state of Styria, Southeastern Austria, all of the \"Perchtln\" were played by women right into the 19th century. As a part of this, they blackened their faces, wore their hair long and sometimes exposed their breasts. In the mid-20th century, one old woman was recorded as saying that when she was young she remembered seeing a female \"Perchtln\" from the Styrian municipality of Donnersbach who carried a swaddled baby. She related that many of the women dressed as \"Perchtln\" would let one breast hang out, but that they were so well disguised that \"no one needed to be ashamed.\"\n\nIn January 1977, the German anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr attended the \"Perchtenlaufen\" in Styria, noting that by that time there were no more female \"Perchtln\", with youths instead having taken up all of those roles.\n\nThe Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg made reference to the \"perchtenlaufen\" in his book \"The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries\" (1966, English translation 1983). He noted similarities between the \"perchtenlaufen\" and the \"benandanti\", a visionary tradition which existed in Early Modern Friuli, a province in Northeastern Italy, which was the primary focus of \"The Night Battles\". He remarked that the \"perchtenlaufen\" was \"undoubtedly a remnant of the ancient ritual battles\" which he believed had originally been based around the fertility of the crops.\n\nGinzburg's comparison between the \"perchtenlaufen\" and the \"benandanti\" was adopted by the German anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr in his book \"Dreamtime: Concerning the Boundary between Wilderness and Civilization\" (1978, English translation 1985). He also compared it to the case of the Livonian werewolf, arguing that they all represent a clash between the forces of order and chaos.\n\n"}

Wallich went on extended leave in 1828 to supervise the printing and hand-colouring of the illustrations in England. Foremost of the watercolour artists who executed the original paintings were two Indian artists, Vishnupersaud, responsible for 114 plates and Gorachand for 87. Vishnupersaud (occasionally referred to as Vishnu Prasad) was an Indian artist frequently employed by naturalists working in India, such as John Forbes Royle and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. Vishnupersaud’s skill was legendary and Wilfrid Blunt included one of his watercolours in his book \"The Art of Botanical Illustration\" as displaying great craftsmanship. The remaining plates were done by Charles M. Curtis (7), William Griffith (3), Sarah Drake, and various others. A double-page engraved map of India created by John Arrowsmith, showed the routes followed by various botanists. A noteworthy point is that plate number 6 is an engraving by H. Weddell, and not a lithograph.\n\n\"Plantae Asiaticae\" was seen to follow naturally on William Roxburgh's \"Plants of the coast of Coromandel\" (London: 1795–1820) and was sponsored by the East India Company who subscribed to 40 copies.

Rancho La Brea consisted of one square league of land of what is now Wilshire's Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and parts of West Hollywood. The grant included the famous La Brea Tar Pits.\n\nThe title awarded by the Alcalde in 1828 was confirmed by José María de Echeandía, Governor of Alta California; in 1840, it was reconfirmed by Governor Juan Alvarado.\n\nWith the cession of California to the United States after the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed by Antonio José Rocha, José Jorge Rocha, and Josefa de la Merced de Jordan with the Public Land Commission in 1852, but was rejected in 1860. As a lawyer and surveyor, Henry Hancock worked for the Rocha family to aid them with their efforts to prove their claim to Rancho La Brea. The Rochas finally won their claim (the grant was recorded as patented to \"A. J. Rocha et al.\" in 1873). The grant included the famous La Brea Tar Pits.\n\nAs happened to other rancheros, the claimants' legal expenses left them broke. In 1860, Antonio José Rocha's son, José Jorge Rocha, deeded Rancho La Brea to Henry Hancock. Hancock paid $20,000 for the Mexican grants (at $2 or $3 per acre) with his profits from the sale of gold he had found in a rich placer mine. He engaged in the commercial development of the tar deposits on Rancho La Brea. He shipped considerable quantities to San Francisco by schooner.

The Woman of Bletchley Park were a secret team put together by the government, made to sign a Secrets Act confirming that they would not tell anyone about their work there. During her time at Bletchley, Ruth Bournes' job was not only to work on the German code, but to be a bombe operator. She was one of the Wrens responsible for dismantling the bombes wire by wire after the war had ended in 1945. \n\nAged 17 at the time, Ruth was a trainee Wren when she was told that she would be joining the Woman of Bletchley Park. She was offered to sign a contract that tied her into endless hours of work, no social life and no way to exit once she had agreed. Ruth was recruited to be a member of the HMS Pembroke 5 team as part of the SDX special duties. Bletchley Park workers consisted of two different teams the 'y station', the woman responsible for picking up the German code and the 'x station' those who were responsible for bomb disposal, like Ruth herself. \n\nMajority of the woman recruited had no previous experience of bombe operation and were going in to the job blindsighted. The workers were only shown a few machines for training purposes on recruitment of the job. They were told not to ask any questions. The role itself included \"preparing the machines each day, turning the drums on the front and plugging up the boards at the back according to settings laid out in a menu\". While Ruth was a checker she would be in charge of waiting for information to come through as 'confirmed'. When this happened she would then have to make a call to report the stop on the code menu which would be checked by other members of Bletchley. . \nRuths job meant that she was on her feet all day and there was little time for breaks.. There was a term 'mustard' , that meant the workers at Bletchley park were told what they was going to do without any discussion or choice of their own. From the very first day of her work as a bombe operator to when her time at Bletchley ended, Ruth did what she was told on demand . Despite the little amount of agency the workers had at Bletchley, Bourne says herself that it was very satisfying to know that we were helping to break German codes. Her work as a bombe operator began in early 1944 and continued until the end of the war in 1945.\n\nIn 1945 when World War II ended, all of the workers of Bletchley Park were told that they must continue to keep their work there a secret. It wasn't until 30 years after the war (1970's) when the book \"The Enigma Secret\" was published that she, along with other Bletchley Park workers, were able to tell their families about their involvement in bringing down Hitler. Ruth describes what it was like when the news finally broke saying that \"you got so used to not talking to anyone\" that even after they were allowed to disclose their roles she still wouldn't talk about her experience in depth.\n"}
{"id": "50227895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50227895", "title": "Sexual racial preference", "text": "Sexual racial preference\n\nSexual racial preference is the individual's sexual preference of specific races. It is an inclination towards potential sexual or romantic partners on the basis of perceived racial identity. Not everyone agrees that this should be classified as racism, some argue that distinguishing among partners on the basis of perceived race is not racism at all but a justifiable personal preference. The origins of sexual racism can be explained by looking at its history, especially in the US, where the abolition of slavery and the Reconstruction Era had significant impacts on interracial mixing. Attitudes towards interracial relationships, and indeed marriage, have increased in positivity in the last 50 years. In 1968, 73% of US citizens disapproved of the right to marry inter-racially, whereas this figure dropped to 17% by 2007, this illustrating the reduction in discriminatory attitudes towards interracial dating. Irrespective of this, there still remains the issue of sexual racism in the online dating world, in that preferences appear to follow a racial hierarchy. Sharing the basic premise, originating from the 'taboo' nature of interracial relations, individuals of other racial groups are classified as forbidden sexual objects; the result of a racial fetish.\n\nAfter the abolition of slavery in 1865, the white Americans showed an increasing fear of racial mixture. The remnants of the racial divide became stronger post-slavery as the concept of whiteness developed. There was a widely held belief that uncontrollable lust threatens the purity of the nation. This increased white anxiety about interracial sex, and has been described through Montesquieu's climatic theory in his book the Spirit of the Laws, which explains how people from different climates have different temperaments, \"The inhabitants of warm countries are, like old men, timorous; the people in cold countries are, like young men, brave.\" At the time, black women held the jezebel stereotype, which claimed black women often initiated sex outside of marriage and were generally sexually promiscuous. This idea stemmed from the first encounters between European men and African women. As the men were not used to the extremely hot climate they misinterpreted the women's lack of clothing for vulgarity. Similarly, black men were stereotyped for having a specific lust for white women. This created tension, as if white men were having sex with black women because they were more lustful, this meant black men would lust after white women in the same way, this threatened the white male dominance that was apparent at the time, increasing the fear of interracial interactions.\n\nThere are a few potential reasons as to why such strong ideas on interracial sex developed. The Reconstruction Era following the Civil War started to disassemble traditional aspects of Southern society. The Southerners who were used to being dominant were now no longer legally allowed to run their farms using slavery. Many whites struggled with this reformation and attempted to find loopholes to continue the exploitation of black labour. Additionally, the white Democrats were not pleased with the outcome and felt a sense of inadequacy among white men. This led to them taking out their frustration on the black population. This radical reconstruction of the South was deeply unpopular and slowly unravelled leading to the introduction of the Jim Crow laws. There was an increased the sense of white dominance and sexual racism among the Southern people.\n\nThere were general heightened tensions following the end of the failed civil war in 1865, and this increased the sexual anxiety in the population. Races did not want to mix, the whites were feeling inadequate and wanted to take back control. The Ku Klux Klan then formed in 1867, which led to violence and terrorism targeting the black population. There was a rise in lynch mob violence where many black men were accused of rape. This was not just senseless violence, but an attempt to preserve 'whiteness' and prevent racial blur, the whites wanted to remain dominant and make sure there was no interracial sexual activity. For example, mixed race couples that chose to live together were sought out and lynched by the KKK. The famous case of Emmett Till who was lynched at the age of fourteen for supposedly whistling at a white women shows the prominence of white male anxiety in the 1950s. When the Jim Crow laws were eventually overturned, it took years for the court to resolve the numerous acts of discrimination.\n\nSexual racism exists in both the heterosexual and homosexual communities across the globe. The prevalence of interracial couples demonstrate how attitudes have changed in the last 50 years. A case that has perhaps received heightened publicity is that of Mildred and Richard Loving. The couple lived in Virginia yet had to marry outside the state due to the anti-miscegenation laws present in nearly half of the US states in 1958. Once married, the pair returned to Virginia, and were both arrested in their home for the infringement of the Racial Integrity Act, and each sentenced to a year in prison. Prior to the repeal of these laws in 2000, several attempts were made to void the sentence, ultimately the couple resorted to relocation to avoid further prejudice. \n\nAround a similar time was the controversy surrounding Seretse and Ruth Khama. Seretse was the chief of an eminent Botswanan tribe, and Ruth an English student. The pair married in 1948 but experienced frequent discrimination from the onset of the relationship, including Seretse's removal from his tribal responsibilities as chief. For nearly 10 years, Seretse and Ruth lived as exiles in Britain, as the racism towards their relationship remained strong. British officials hoped that their asylum in the country would reduce their desire to continue the marriage. Once the couple were allowed to return home in 1956, they became prominent figures the movement for racial and social justice, contributing to Seretse's election as president of Botswana in 1966. Later, they both continued to fight laws surrounding interracial marriage.\n\nMore recent examples portray the increasingly accepting attitudes of the majority to interracial relationships and marriage. In 2013, Bill de Blasio was elected as Mayor of New York City, accompanied by his wife, Chirlane McCray. The pair are one of the first interracial couples to stand in power side by side. Both de Blasio and McCray are active political figures, and although they are not exempt from racial discrimination, the attitudes of the world to interracial marriage are much more positive and optimistic than in previous decades. Across much of the world, it is ever increasingly the situation that interracial couples can live, marry and have children without prosecution that was previously rife, due to major changes in law along with reductions in discriminatory attitudes. Sexual racism also exists in the heterosexual community in online dating.\n\nIn the last 15 years, online dating has overtaken previously preferred methods of meeting with potential partners, surpassing both the occupational setting and area of residence as chosen locations. This spike is consistent with an increase in access to the internet in homes across the globe, in addition to the number of dating sites available to individuals differing in age, gender, race, sexual orientation and ethnic background. Along with this, there has been a rise in online sexual racism, whereby partner race is now the most highly selected preference chosen by users when creating their online profiles, displacing both educational and religious characteristics. Research has indicated a progressive acceptance of interracial relationships by White individuals. The majority of White Americans are not against interracial relationships and marriage, however these beliefs are not illustrated in subsequent marital rates between interracial couples, such that no more than 4% of White Americans will wed outside their own race. In fact, less than 46% of White Americans are willing to date an individual of any other race. Overall, African Americans appear to be the most open to interracial relationships, yet are the least preferred partner by other racial groups. However, regardless of stated preferences, racial discrimination still occurs in online dating.\n\nEach group significantly prefers to date intra-racially. White Americans are the least open to interracial dating, and select preferences in the order of Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and then African American individuals last at 60.5%, 58.5% and 49.4% respectively. African American preferences follow a similar pattern, with the most preferred partner belonging to the Hispanic group (61%), followed by White individuals (59.6%) and then Asian Americans (43.5%). Both Hispanic and Asian Americans prefer to date a White individual (80.3% and 87.3%, respectively), and both are least willing to date African Americans (56.5% and 69.5%). In all significant cases, Hispanic Americans are preferred to Asian Americans, and Asian Americans are significantly preferred over African Americans. Hispanic Americans are less likely to be excluded in online dating partner preferences by whites seeking a partner, as Latinos are often viewed as a racial group that is increasingly assimilating more into White American culture.\n\nIn addition to general racism in online dating, there is further exclusion differences between certain genders within racial groups, such that women of any race are significantly less likely to date inter-racially than a male of any race. Specifically, Asian men and Black women face more obstacles to acceptance online. White women are most likely to exclude Asian men, likely due to their amplified effeminate portrayal in the media. This exclusion remains present even when considering high earning Asian individuals with an advanced educational background. Increased education does however influence choices in the other direction, such that a higher level of schooling is associated with more optimistic feelings towards interracial relationships. White men are most likely to exclude Black women, as opposed to women of another race. High levels of previous exposure to a variety of racial groups creates a more accepting attitude. Sexual racism in online dating, in addition to the outside world, is also influenced by the partner selectors area of residence. Those residing in more Southern regions, particularly in American states, are less likely to have been in an interracial relationship, and are unlikely to inter-racially date in the future. Location is also related to the individuals current and previous religious practices; those who engaged in regular religious customs at age 12 are less likely to inter-racially date. Moreover, those from a Jewish background are significantly more likely to enter an interracial relationship than those from a Protestant background, indicating differences in levels of sexual racism present, which translate into the virtual world of online dating.\n\nCurrently, there are websites specifically targeted to different couple matches, such that singles can sign up online and focus on one particular partner quality, such as race, religious beliefs or ethnicity. In addition to this, there are online dating services that target race-specific partner choices, and a selection of pages dedicated to interracial dating that allow users to select partners based on age, gender and particularly race. Online dating services experience controversy in this context as debate is cast over whether statements such as \"no Asians\" or \"not attracted to Asians\" in user profiles, are racist or just signify individual preference. Ethnic minorities who feel they lack dating prospects as a result of their race, sometimes refer to themselves as \"ethnicels\".\n\nAsian men are often represented in media, both mainstream and LGBT, as being feminized and desexualized. LGBT Asian men often report sexual racism from white LGBT men. The gay Asian-Canadian author Richard Fung has written that while black men are portrayed as hypersexualized, gay Asian men are portrayed as being undersexed. Fung also wrote about feminizing depictions of Asian men in gay pornography, which often focuses on gay Asian men's submission to the pleasure of white men. According to Fung, gay Asian men tend to ignore or display displeasure with races such as Arabs, blacks, and other Asians but seemingly give sexual acceptance and approval to gay white men. White gay men are more frequently than other racial groups to state \"No Asians\" when seeking partners. In interracial gay male pornography, Asian men are usually portrayed as submissive \"bottoms\".\n\nAsian American women also report similar discrimination in lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) communities. According to a study by Sung, Szymanski, and Henrichs-Beck (2015), Asian American participants who identified as lesbian or bisexual often reported invisibility, stereotyping, and fetishism in LGB circles and the larger U.S. culture. This is in addition to the heterosexism and invisibility they felt in Asian American communities.\n\nRacial sexism is also prevalent in gay online dating. Phua and Kaufman (2003) noted that men seeking men online were more likely than men seeking women to look at racial traits. Race is often used to advertise oneself or as a criterion in seeking a partner, according to a study looking at Manhunt profiles. In Callander, Newman, and Holt's (2012) study, White participants self-disclosed their racial identity less often than non-White participants, with the implication that Whiteness was the norm and non-Whites expected to self-disclose their racial identity. They cite one profile description as an example: \"I shouldn't have to ask for a picture, or your age, or your ethnicity. Have it available straight away or I'll just pass over your profile.\"\n\nIn a qualitative study conducted by Paul, Ayala, and Choi (2010) with Asian and Pacific Islanders (API), Latino, and African American men seeking men, participants interviewed endorsed racial preference as a common criteria in online dating partner selection. This reflects the racist power hierarchies often seen in broader spheres of society where Eurocentric discourses are often the standard, and non-Eurocentric discourses are the exceptions.\n\nIn another study by Callander, Newman, and Holts, researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism was often tolerated, with many participants feeling that racial preference was not racism. They quoted Watts from the Huffington Post, who argued that sexual attraction and racism are not the same:\n\nThis suggests that people find it possible to view larger systemic racial preference as problematic, while viewing racial preferences in romantic or sexual personal relationships as not problematic. Researchers noted that there is a general hesitation to call racial preference \"racist\", with many defending racial preference as saving time.\n\nIn that same study, researchers found that attitudes towards sexual racism were similar to attitudes about generic racism. That is, patterns of sexual racism seems to follow similar patterns of general racism. For example, they found that higher levels of education was associated with more positive attitudes about multiculturalism and less positive attitudes about racial sexism. They also found that experiences of exclusion online due to race was correlated with more accepting views of multiculturalism and less accepting attitudes about sexual racism, regardless of racial identity. These findings suggest that being more aware of racism in general, due to experience or education, and racism's impact had an effect on racial preference such that it was seen as less desirable.\n\nAs well as race-based sexual rejection, sexual racism also manifests in the form of the hypersexualisation of specific ethnic groups. Freudians theorize that sexual fetishism, people of one race can form sexual fixations towards individuals of a separate generalised racial group. This collective stereotype is established through the perception that an individual's sexual appeal derives entirely from their race, and is therefore subject to the prejudices that follow.\n\nRacial fetishism as a culture is often perceived, in this context, as an act or belief motivated by sexual racism. The objectification and reductionist perception of different races, for example, East Asian women, or African American men, relies greatly on their portrayal in forms of media that depict them as sexual objects. An example of such a medium includes pornography. An instance of this hypersexualisation is commented upon in Artist and Designer Donna Choi's illustrative series targeting the specific fetishisation of Asian women, named, \"Does Your Man Suffer From Yellow Fever?\" (2013). In said illustration, Choi uses satire to depict a white man's harmful perception of a \"china doll stereotype\" towards Asian woman and how she is an object to his desires. Choi's intention comes across through implying the presence of an obvious dehumanisation of Asian women in the eyes of another race. This is a deliberate commentary on the fetishisation rooted within the social issue of sexual racism.\n\nThe effects of Racial Fetishism as a form of Sexual Racism, is discussed in research conducted by Plummer. Plummer used qualitative interviews within given focus groups, and found that specific social locations came up as areas in which sexual racism commonly manifest. These mentioned social locations included pornographic media, gay clubs and bars, casual sex encounters as well as romantic relationships. This high prevalence was recorded within Plummer's research to be consequentially related to the recorded lower self-esteem, internalised sexual racism, and increased psychological distress in participants of colour. People subject to this form of racial discernment are targeted in a manner well put by Hook. Hook's historical overview of J.M. Coetzee's novel, largely addressed Coetzee's depictions of racial otherness within South Africa. Additionally, Coetzee goes on to write about how the otherness and social detachment from the colonials was what fabricated present racial stereotypes. Such stereotypes are what is said to encourage the perception of other racial groups as \"fantasmatic objects\"; a degrading and generalising view of different racial populations.\n"}

Slaughter\n\nRobert Rudolph Remus (born August 27, 1948) better known by his ring name Sgt. Slaughter, is an American retired professional wrestler currently signed in WWE in the ambassador program.\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Slaughter had success in the National Wrestling Alliance, American Wrestling Association, and the World Wrestling Federation. He won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and headlined WrestleMania VII, in 1991. Slaughter also captured the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship twice. He is a Hall of Famer, inducted as part of the class of 2004. As Sgt. Slaughter, Remus became known for his dark sunglasses, his large hat, and his Vietnam War–era military fatigues. In the 1980s, an alternate version of the Sgt. Slaughter character was incorporated into the \"\" toy line as well as its and .\n\nThough Remus was born in Detroit, Michigan, he was raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he attended Eden Prairie High School in Eden Prairie, where he wrestled and played football. Remus legitimately enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and was a drill instructor at Parris Island, South Carolina, prior to his professional wrestling career.\n\nSgt. Slaughter held numerous regional titles early in his career and experienced his first major success in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) capturing the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Don Kernodle in 1982. During the late 1970s, Remus worked the American Wrestling Association (AWA) territory under a mask as Super Destroyer Mark II with manager Lord Alfred Hayes, whom he dismissed and replaced with Bobby Heenan, leading to a feud between the two managers with Hayes as the babyface.\n\nHe then signed with the WWF and was pushed as a villainous character. Between 1980 and 1981, Slaughter wrestled in the WWF under the guidance of the Grand Wizard. He quickly rose to the status of number one contender on the strength of his \"cobra clutch\" challenges where he would seat wrestlers in a chair in the ring, and apply the hold, offering $5,000 to anyone who could break it. He would eventually face Bob Backlund for the World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Championship across the WWF territory in 1980, earning two-or-three main event matches in most markets. Slaughter was the only WWF-based challenger not to do the honors for Backlund at MSG (Backlund defeated him at the Meadowlands, but never in the Garden). Slaughter then engaged in a feud with Pat Patterson, which stemmed from Slaughter calling Patterson \"yellow\" and offering him $10,000 (double the usual amount) to try to break the cobra clutch. Patterson accepted on television and was escaping from the hold when Slaughter released it and put a beat-down on Patterson, starting a hot feud which culminated in an \"Alley Fight\" in New York, New York's Madison Square Garden between the two that is widely regarded as the best \"hardcore\" match of the Kayfabe era.\n\nIn September 1981, Slaughter joined the National Wrestling Alliance, mainly wrestling for its Mid-Atlantic territory. In October 1981, he took part in a tournament to determine a new NWA United States Heavyweight Champion; he defeated Johnny Weaver, Jay Youngblood, and Ricky Steamboat in the tournament to win the vacant title. He would hold onto the title for over seven months, before losing the title to Wahoo McDaniel in May 1982.\n\nIn September 1982, Slaughter and partner Don Kernodle were awarded the NWA World Tag Team Championship, claiming a title victory over Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba in Tokyo. They would be in a heated rivalry with the team of Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, which culminated in March 1983, losing the titles to Steamboat and Youngblood in a steel cage match. After the rivalry ended, Slaughter left the NWA.\n\nSlaughter returned to the WWF in March 1983, and again took on the Grand Wizard as his manager. He immediately targeted Backlund, who was still the reigning WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Slaughter turned up the feud another notch when he attacked Backlund at a television taping; Backlund was in the process of completing the Harvard Step Test before Slaughter beat him repeatedly with his riding crop, leaving bruises on his back. Although he won several matches by disqualification, Slaughter was never able to win the title from Backlund.\n\nIn early 1984, Slaughter's career took off after he turned face and defended America's honor against the hated Iron Sheik. Slaughter and the Iron Sheik engaged in many matches throughout the year, culminating in a boot camp match which took place before a sold out Madison Square Garden that summer. However, with the emergence of Hulk Hogan as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion and lead face within the company, Slaughter left for the AWA. On Vince McMahon's \"McMahon DVD,\" Slaughter said he was fired by McMahon in Toronto after no-showing an event in protest of McMahon's refusal to give him six weeks of paid vacation. Other interviews with Slaughter and McMahon have revealed that Slaughter left the company more over a dispute that emerged due to the WWF not allowing Slaughter's role in the G.I. Joe toy line. At the time of his departure Slaughter was easily the second biggest \"face\" in the company, surpassing Jimmy Snuka, and even André the Giant, with his popularity rivaling that of Hulk Hogan's.\n\nHe received a considerable push in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) throughout 1985 and 1986, becoming the AWA America's Heavyweight Champion, defeating Larry Zbyszko shortly after his arrival. He defended the title against wrestlers like Zbyszko, Kamala, Boris Zukhov, and Nick Bockwinkel (before the belt was retired) and feuded with Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey and his stable of wrestlers, The Road Warriors, and Colonel DeBeers. He even challenged Stan Hansen for the AWA title. He was also involved in the short lived Pro Wrestling USA Promotion. This was a brief attempt at pulling together the remaining wrestling talent to go up against the rising WWF. Slaughter in this company won a large 25 man battle royal by eliminating Kamala, winning the right to challenge Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn 1988, Slaughter returned to wrestling in the AWA, resuming some of his past feuds with the likes of Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissey, the Iron Sheik, and Col. DeBeers. He also became a top contender to the AWA World title during Larry Zbyszko's reign in 1989 and was a team captain for the AWA's ill-fated Team Challenge Series during the first half of 1990. The AWA even teased fans with Slaughter appearing to win the World title from Zbyszko live on ESPN, only to have the decision reversed on a technicality (a booking practice the AWA had been employing for years).\n\nAfter WrestleMania VI, Slaughter sent a letter to Vince McMahon saying he loved the program and was interested in returning. McMahon told Slaughter he wanted a heel, and his new gimmick would be that Slaughter turned on the United States due to its acceptance of the Russian Nikolai Volkoff. According to Slaughter, he found it difficult to do the anti-American promos associated with this gimmick.\n\nThe August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Ba'athist Iraq triggered a political crisis that would lead to the 1991 Gulf War, in which Kuwait was freed by a U.S.-led military coalition. A decision was made to have Slaughter support the Iraqi cause, not for the actual political reasons, but more for the fact that Slaughter liked \"brutality\" and the Iraqi government was \"brutal\" while the US regime was said by Slaughter to have become \"soft\" and \"weak\". Slaughter aligned himself with a kayfabe Iraqi military general, General Adnan (his old rival who left the AWA shortly after Slaughter did), and entered a feud with Volkoff (which saw Slaughter win the majority of their encounters at house shows), leading to a match at that year's Survivor Series which saw The Alliance (Volkoff, Tito Santana, and The Bushwhackers) defeat The Mercenaries (Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express). As part of his character change, Slaughter began wearing Arab headdresses to the ring, adopted the Camel Clutch as one of his finishers, and was (kayfabe) photographed meeting with Saddam Hussein. Slaughter also infamously adopted a move where he would grind the tip of one of his knuckles into his opponent's temple (the childhood noogie). It was reported that while Slaughter was portraying a turncoat, he had received numerous death threats and could not go anywhere in public without wearing a bullet-proof vest and had to be surrounded with security personnel at all times. According to Slaughter, Vince asked him to burn the American flag, but Slaughter refused to, so Slaughter suggested he burn Hulk Hogan's shirt.\n\nAs 1990 ended, Slaughter began challenging for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship that had been held by The Ultimate Warrior since WrestleMania VI. Slaughter got his chance at the Royal Rumble in January 1991, days after the Gulf War air campaign had begun. He defeated the Warrior when \"Macho King\" Randy Savage, who had also been feuding with the Warrior at the time, struck the champion in the head with his royal scepter. Slaughter thus became the thirteenth WWF World Heavyweight Champion and was immediately challenged by Royal Rumble winner Hulk Hogan, who was furious that Slaughter had (kayfabe) desecrated the American flag (off-screen) as part of his victory celebration. Hogan demanded a match against Slaughter at WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles, California, and Slaughter accepted. Slaughter was defeated by Hogan, thus losing his championship. After WrestleMania Slaughter introduced his newest ally, Colonel Mustafa (The Iron Sheik, Slaughter's old nemesis). Slaughter and company went on to feud with Hogan for months, including having a three-on-two handicap match at SummerSlam 1991, which saw the team of Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior prevail over Slaughter, Adnan, and Mustafa.\n\nAfter finishing the Hogan feud, Slaughter became a face again, appearing in vignettes next to American landmarks, saying, \"I want my country back\". During an episode of \"Superstars\", Jim Duggan was under attack from The Nasty Boys, and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months. Slaughter's last regular WWF match, which was against Nailz, was in October 1992 and ended in no contest when Nailz viciously attacked Slaughter before the match could begin.\n\nSlaughter started appearing as an on-air official from October 1992 to June 1994. He made his first wrestling appearance in over a year when he appeared on a house show version of a Royal Rumble that was held on January 17, 1994 at Madison Square Garden. After helping to eliminate Adam Bomb he in turn was tossed out by Crush. Later that year he would later wrestle on four house shows in July in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, facing and defeating Quebecer Pierre. He left the company in September.\n\nAfter a hiatus, he returned to WWF television on the August 4, 1997 episode of \"Raw Is War\" to assume the role of on-air commissioner by (kayfabe) President Gorilla Monsoon who in reality retired from being on camera due to health issues. Initially popular, he eventually became the target of D-Generation X, who called him \"Sgt. Slobber\". On an episode of \"Raw Is War\", he put Shawn Michaels and Triple H in a match for Michaels' European Championship. Michaels dropped the belt to Helmsley, by lying down in the ring. Slaughter challenged Triple H to a Boot Camp match at the , which he lost. His feud with Triple H continued into WrestleMania XIV where he handcuffed himself to Chyna to prevent her from interfering with Helmsley's match against Owen Hart. But Slaughter's efforts ultimately proved futile, as Chyna threw powder into his eyes, interfered with the match anyway, and hurled Slaughter into the front row.\n\nIn 1998, Slaughter turned heel, joined Vince McMahon along with Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson, and became the on-screen lackeys of McMahon; running errands for him and dishing out punishment to McMahon's rivals, namely Steve Austin. In late 1998, Slaughter relinquished the role of commissioner to Shawn Michaels and largely disappeared from television.\n\nSlaughter still appeared from time to time in the ring, mostly at house shows. He appeared on \"Raw\" to put over younger wrestlers, such as Kurt Angle and Randy Orton. Slaughter also made an appearance at WrestleMania X-Seven, in the gimmick Battle Royal, which was won by The Iron Sheik. Slaughter got his revenge after the match by locking the Sheik in the cobra clutch. He also appeared on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" on occasion during the Invasion storyline in non-wrestling roles, usually in conjunction with Vince McMahon.\n\nHe made a special appearance on June 13, 2005 episode of \"Raw\" to challenge Chris Masters in his \"Master Lock Challenge\", which Slaughter lost. Then, he returned again on December 5 episode of \"Raw\", where he and Michael Hayes confronted Edge. He also appeared on the July 4, 2006 episode of \"Raw\" for a \"Diva Boot Camp\" segment, as a part of the 2006 Diva Search Competition.\n\nHe re-appeared on October 2 episode of \"Raw\", defeating Nicky from the Spirit Squad with a roll-up when D-Generation X distracted him from up on the TitanTron. Slaughter appeared on the October 23 \"Raw\" in the corner of Ric Flair as he faced Kenny of the Spirit Squad. After Kenny cheated to gain the victory, Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Roddy Piper cleared the tag champions from the ring. Slaughter was one of three options between himself, Roddy Piper, and Dusty Rhodes that fans could vote for as a tag partner for Ric Flair at \"Cyber Sunday\", but did not win the vote. At \"Survivor Series\", Slaughter teamed with Flair, Ron Simmons, and Dusty Rhodes to take on four members of the Spirit Squad in a Survivor Series match. Slaughter was eliminated in the match, but his team won, with Flair as the sole survivor.\n\nOn December 18, 2006, Slaughter participated in a 30-man battle royal for a chance to face John Cena in the main event for the WWE Championship, but he was eliminated from the match and did not get the title shot. At the pay-per-view in June 2007, he faced Deuce 'n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship, alongside Jimmy Snuka. They were unsuccessful in their attempt for the titles. He challenged Randy Orton on July 30 episode of \"Raw\", only to become another victim of the \"Legend Killer\", and was wheeled out on a stretcher. On \"Raw XV\", the 15th-anniversary \"Raw\" special on December 10, 2007, Slaughter participated in the 15th Anniversary Battle Royal. On March 31, 2008, on an episode of \"Raw\", Slaughter paid tribute to longtime friend Ric Flair at the end of the show. He appeared on \"Raw\"'s 800th episode in Kung Fu Naki's dance off and also made an appearance in the Slammy Awards.\n\nSlaughter, who had been working as a producer for WWE for the past several years, was released from his backstage producer duties with the company on January 13, 2009. He was the special guest host on \"Raw\" on August 10, 2009 where he made fun of Canadians and saying how the USA is the greatest country in the world. He made an appearance on the \"Decade of SmackDown\" on October 2, 2009 where he had an altercation with the Iron Sheik about which country was the greatest, USA or Iran. He later appeared on December 31, 2012 edition of \"Raw\", where he was challenged by then United States Champion Antonio Cesaro in a match for the WWE United States Championship. He lost the match and failed to capture the title. He then made an appearance on Old School RAW, serving as the special guest referee for The Great Khali vs Damien Sandow match after he got the most votes.\n\nSlaughter made an appearance on November 24, 2014 edition of \"Raw\", where he confronted United States Champion Rusev and his valet, Lana, and attempted to force Lana and Rusev to recite the Pledge of Allegiance (with the alternative, per an edict from Daniel Bryan, who was running the show that night, being that he would be forced to defend his title against the entire \"Raw\" roster). Rusev refused and had a stare down with Slaughter, who wouldn't back down; however, Jack Swagger and his manager, Zeb Colter, ran down to the ring and fended Rusev off. Swagger, Colter, and Slaughter then finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.\nSlaughter returned at the \"Tribute to the Troops\" show on December 17, 2014 and helped Dean Ambrose beat Bray Wyatt by giving Dean his steel-toe boot to use on Wyatt.\n\nSlaughter voices an adult version of himself in the animated WWE Network Exclusive show \"Camp WWE\".\n\nFictionalized versions of Sgt. Slaughter were part of the \"\" toyline, cartoon and comic books, as a member of the \"G.I. Joe\" team and first appeared in the five-part TV episode entitled \"Arise, Serpentor, Arise!\" Along with the traditional merchandising of WWE superstars, Sgt. Slaughter is one of only a few real people to be immortalized as a \"G.I. Joe\" figure, (among the others being NFL football player William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, pro-wrestler Roddy Piper, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin), and even appeared in \"\".\n\nSlaughter also appeared twice as a special guest on \"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!\", which starred fellow wrestler Captain Lou Albano. Sgt. Slaughter appeared in 2 episodes of the Super Mario Brother Super Show (1989-1990). Sgt Slaughter played himself in the Mario Bros Plumbing live action skits before and after the cartoon with Captain Lou Albano (Mario) and Danny Wells (Luigi). He appeared in the episodes \"All Steamed Up\" and \"Caught in a draft\".\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, Sgt. Slaughter released a full-length LP, \"Sgt. Slaughter and Camouflage Rocks America\". It featured a number of original songs, including \"The Cobra Clutch,\" as well as a cover of Neil Diamond's \"America\".\n\nA brief cross promotional stint in the late 1980s had Sgt. Slaughter and his \"battling battalion\" pit against the Big Foot Monster Truck in a tug-of-war challenge. It is featured on Blood, Sweat, & Gears USHRA home video. This stunt was recently attempted again with Sgt. Slaughter using fans from the crowd at a Monster Truck show to tug-o-war with the Bear Foot Monster Truck.\n\nIn the animated series \"Code Monkeys\", Slaughter appeared as Sgt. Murder. He and Bulk Brogan (Hulk Hogan), \"Manly Man\" Ricky Ravage (Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage), and Sergei the Giant (André the Giant) were hired by a video game company to take on their rivals. His brother, Tommy Murder, was killed by \"The Black Shadow\", who was actually Black Steve, the company's accountant.\n\nHe appeared on episode #3.6 of Comedy Central's \"Tosh.0\", when he clotheslined Daniel Tosh and put David Wills (a.k.a. YouTube's \"Crying Wrestling Fan\") in a Cobra Clutch during Wills' \"Web Redemption\" segment.\n\nIn 2014, Sgt. Slaughter made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial \"The '80s Called\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18449452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18449452", "title": "Tate Britain", "text": "Tate Britain\n\nTate Britain (known from 1897 to 1932 as the National Gallery of British Art and from 1932 to 2000 as the Tate Gallery) is an art museum on Millbank in the City of Westminster in London. It is part of the Tate network of galleries in England, with Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives. It is the oldest gallery in the network, having opened in 1897. It houses a substantial collection of the art of the United Kingdom since Tudor times, and in particular has large holdings of the works of J. M. W. Turner, who bequeathed all his own collection to the nation. It is one of the largest museums in the country.\n\nThe gallery is situated on Millbank, on the site of the former Millbank Prison. Construction, undertaken by Higgs and Hill, commenced in 1893, and the gallery opened on 21 July 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art. However, from the start it was commonly known as the Tate Gallery, after its founder Sir Henry Tate, and in 1932 it officially adopted that name. Before 2000, the gallery housed and displayed both British and modern collections, but the launch of Tate Modern saw Tate's modern collections move there, while the old Millbank gallery became dedicated to the display of historical and contemporary British art. As a consequence, it was renamed Tate Britain in March 2000.\n\nThe front part of the building was designed by Sidney R. J. Smith with a classical portico and dome behind, and the central sculpture gallery was designed by John Russell Pope. Tate Britain includes the Clore Gallery of 1987, designed by James Stirling, which houses work by J. M. W. Turner. The Clore Gallery has been regarded as an important example of Postmodern architecture, especially in the use of contextual irony: each section of the external facade quotes liberally from the building next to it in regard to materials and detailing.\n\nCrises during its existence include flood damage to work from the River Thames, and bomb damage during World War II. However, most of the collection was in safe storage elsewhere during the war, and a large Stanley Spencer painting, deemed too big to move, had a protective brick wall built in front of it.\n\nIn 1970, the building was given Grade II* listed status.\n\nIn 2012, Tate Britain announced that it had raised the £45 million required to complete a major renovation, largely thanks to a £4.9 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £1 million given by Tate Members. The museum stayed open throughout the three phases of renovation. Completed in 2013, the newly designed sections were conceived by the architects Caruso St John and included a total of nine new galleries, with reinforced flooring to accommodate heavy sculptures. A second part was unveiled later that year, the centrepiece being the reopening of the building's Thames-facing entrance as well as a new spiral staircase beneath its rotunda. The circular balcony of the rotunda's domed atrium, closed to visitors since the 1920s, was reopened. The gallery also now has a dedicated schools' entrance and reception beneath its entrance steps on Millbank and a new archive gallery for the presentation of temporary displays.\n\nThe front entrance is accessible by steps. A side entrance at a lower level has a ramp for wheelchair access. The gallery provides a restaurant and a café, as well as a Friends room, open only to members of the Tate. This membership is open to the public on payment of an annual subscription. As well as administration offices the building complex houses the Prints and Drawings Rooms (in the Clore galleries), as well as the Library and Archive in the Hyman Kreitman Reading Rooms. The restaurant features a mural by Rex Whistler.\n\nTate Britain and Tate Modern are now connected by a high speed boat along the River Thames, which runs from Millbank Millennium Pier immediately outside Tate Britain. The boat is decorated with spots, based on paintings of similar appearance by Damien Hirst. The lighting artwork incorporated in the pier's structure is by Angela Bulloch.\n\nThe main display spaces show the permanent collection of historic British art, as well as contemporary work. It has rooms dedicated to works by one artist, such as: Tracey Emin, John Latham, Douglas Gordon, Sam Taylor-Wood, Tacita Dean, Marcus Gheeraerts II, though these, like the rest of the collection, are subject to rotation.\n\nThe gallery also organises career retrospectives of British artists and temporary major exhibitions of British Art. Every three years the gallery stages a Triennial exhibition in which a guest curator provides an overview of contemporary British Art. The 2003 Tate Triennial was called \"Days Like These\". \"Art Now\" is a small changing show of a contemporary artist's work in a dedicated room.\n\nTate Britain is the home of the annual and usually controversial Turner Prize exhibition, featuring four artists selected by a jury chaired by the director of Tate Britain. This is spread out over the year with the four nominees announced in May, the show of their work opened in October and the prize itself given in December. Each stage of the prize generates media coverage, and there have also been a number of demonstrations against the prize, notably since 2000 an annual picket by Stuckist artists. In recent years the exhibition and award ceremony have taken place at locations other than in Tate Britain: for example in Liverpool (2007), Derry-Londonderry (2013), Glasgow (2015) and Hull (2017).\n\nTate Britain has attempted to reach out to a different and younger audience with \"Late at Tate Britain\" on the first Friday of every month, with half-price admission to exhibitions, live music and performance art. Other public involvement has included the display of visitors', as opposed to curators', interpretation of certain artworks.\n\nRegular free tours operate on the hour, and at 1.15 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday short 15-minute talks are given on paintings, artists and artistic styles.\n\nTate Britain is the national gallery of British art from 1500 to the present day. As such, it is the most comprehensive collection of its kind in the world (only the Yale Center for British Art can claim similar expansiveness, but with less depth). More recent artists include David Hockney, Peter Blake and Francis Bacon. Works in the permanent Tate collection, which may be on display at Tate Britain include:\n\nWhen the Pre-Raphaelite painter and President of the Royal Academy, John Everett Millais, died in 1896, the Prince of Wales (later to become King Edward VII) chaired a memorial committee, which commissioned a statue of the artist. This was installed at the front of the gallery in the garden on the east side in 1905. On 23 November that year, \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" called it \"a breezy statue, representing the man in the characteristic attitude in which we all knew him\".\n\nIn 1953, Tate Director, Sir Norman Reid, attempted to have it replaced by Rodin's \"John the Baptist\", and in 1962 again proposed its removal, calling its presence \"positively harmful\". His efforts were frustrated by the statue's owner, the Ministry of Works. Ownership was transferred from the Ministry to English Heritage in 1996, and by them in turn to the Tate. In 2000 the statue was removed to the rear of the building.\n\n"}

{"id": "980001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=980001", "title": "Teylers Museum", "text": "Teylers Museum\n\nTeylers Museum () is an art, natural history, and science museum in Haarlem, Netherlands. Established in 1778, Teylers Museum was founded as a centre for contemporary art and science. The historic centre of the museum is the neoclassical Oval Room (1784), which was built behind the house of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778), the so-called \"Fundatiehuis\" (Foundation House). Pieter Teyler was a wealthy cloth merchant and banker of Scottish descent, who bequeathed his fortune for the advancement of religion, art, and science. He was a Mennonite and follower of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nIn his will, Pieter Teyler stipulated that his collection and part of his fortune should be used to establish a foundation for their promotion: Teylers Stichting. The Teyler legacy to the city of Haarlem was split into two societies: Teylers First or Theological Society (Dutch: \"Teylers Eerste of Godgeleerd Genootschap\"), intended for the study of religion and Teylers Second Society (Dutch: \"Teylers Tweede Genootschap\"), which was to concern itself with physics, poetry, history, drawing, and numismatics.\n\nThe executors of Teyler's will, the first directors of Teylers Stichting, decided to establish a centre for study and education. Under a single roof, it would house all manner of suitable artifacts, such as books, scientific instruments, drawings, fossils, and minerals. The concept was based on a revolutionary ideal derived from the Enlightenment: that people could discover the world independently, without coercion by church or state. The example that guided the founders in establishing Teylers Museum was the \"Mouseion\" of classical antiquity: a “temple for the muses of the arts and sciences” that could also serve as a meeting place for scholars and the venue for various collections.\n\nIn 1779, Leendert Viervant started on the design of an \"art and book room\" behind Teyler’s residence. This neoclassical room, whose shape quickly led it to be called the Oval Room, was designed for research and study; here, scientific experiments would be conducted, public demonstrations held, and books, drawings, and prints viewed by the public. The Oval room was opened in 1784, with the scientist Martin van Marum as its first director.\n\nA showcase in the centre displays a mineralogical collection from the 18th century and the showcases around hold 18th-century scientific instruments. The upper gallery, which was designed to let in the maximum amount of light for viewing purposes, has 12 built-in bookcases, largely containing period encyclopaedias and periodicals.\n\nOver the ensuing centuries, the museum was gradually extended. The arrangement of each new part was consistent with the insights of the day; thereafter it remained almost wholly unchanged. In the 19th century, the museum was expanded with two painting galleries: Teylers First Painting Gallery in 1838 and Paintings Gallery II in 1892. In 1878, to mark the first centenary, a new entrance on the Spaarne (the current main entrance) was designed by the Viennese architect Christian Ulrich. It opened in 1885. The rooms behind it – the Instrument Room, and Fossil Room I and, behind it, Fossil Room II – were designed by the Haarlem architect A. van der Steur. At the same time, the library was extended and a 150-seat auditorium was added. Over a century later, in 1996, a large new wing was added; this was the design of Hubert-Jan Henket. In 2002, an adjoining property was added to the museum to serve as the museum shop and multimedia room.\n\nTeylers Museum holdings include fossils (some are the first ever discovered of \"Archaeopteryx\"), minerals, scientific instruments, medals, coins, and paintings.\n\nThe museum’s first director, Martinus van Marum contributed to and used the facilities at Teylers Museum to research static electricity. To study fossils, he purchased fossil material such as the \"Mosasaurus\". To demonstrate the principles of hydraulics, he commissioned models of mills and cranes.\nTo disseminate natural and cultural knowledge, public experiments were conducted, such as those with van Marum’s large electrostatic generator built in 1784 by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam (the largest in the world). Lectures were given and scientific literature published.\n\nThe collection of Teylers Museum holdings include works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Guercino, and Claude Lorrain. The museum contains graphic work of Rembrandt and Adriaen van Ostade. \n\nThe Painting Galleries show a collection of works from the Dutch Romantic School and the later Hague and Amsterdam Schools, including major works by Barend Cornelis Koekkoek, Andreas Schelfhout, Cornelis Springer, Hendrik Willem Mesdag, Jan Willem Pieneman, Anton Mauve, Jacob Maris, Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, George Hendrik Breitner, Jozef Israëls, and Isaac Israëls. \n\nIn 2007, the works of John James Audubon were displayed. \n\nThe original mission of the second society included research, as well as education. After the death of van Marum, Teylers continued to attract scientists of high standing as caretakers. The theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner Hendrik Lorentz was appointed Curator of Teylers Physics Cabinet in 1910, a position he held until his death in 1928. At the time of his appointment, Lorentz was at the height of his scientific career and was a central figure in the international community of physicists. Under his leadership, the Teylers Museum conducted scientific research in such diverse fields as optics, electromagnetism, radio waves, and atom physics. Lorentz was succeeded by the physicist and musician Adriaan Fokker. Physicist Wander Johannes de Haas served as conservator in the 1920s.\n\nThe museum’s entire archives have also survived intact. They include the complete series of accounts for all acquisitions, extensions, salaries and day-to-day purchases since 1778, the complete series of visitors’ books since 1789, and the minutes of all meetings of the museum board since 1778.\n\nThe museum is open six days a week; Tuesdays-Saturday 10:00-17:00, and Sundays 12:00-17:00.\n\nThe museum is on the top 100 Dutch heritage sites list compiled by the Department for Conservation in 1990. It was nominated on 12 December 2011 by the Dutch Cabinet for UNESCO world heritage status, based on its long history as a public knowledge institute and its continued efforts to preserve public access to its collections. However, the nomination was withdrawn in 2013.\n\nMarjan Scharloo is the museum director and Michiel Plomp is the conservator of the museum.\n\nThe museum had a record number of 157,843 visitors in 2016, which was around 20,000 more than the year before and 10,000 more than the previous record in 2012.\n\nTeylers Museum is a member of the Museumvereniging (Museum Association).\n\n\n\n"}

It is primarily a cookbook which attempts to modernize Ashkenazic Jewish cuisine. The book contains 98 recipes.\n\n\"The Gefilte Manifesto\" draws its namesake from the mission statement of The Gefilteria, the business owned and operated by the authors. The word 'gefilte' is Yiddish for 'stuffed', and references gefilte fish, an Ashkenazi delicacy which is unpopular among American Jews.\n\nThe book, and the recipes and discussions it contains, are expressly a rejection of mass-produced Jewish food, and the stigma which has come with it. Yoskowitz, who wrote his college thesis on the kosher food industry, has even called the kosher aisle at grocery stores \"the place where Jewish food goes to die\", and in \"The Gefilte Manifesto\", he and Alpern attempt to make Jewish Cuisine accessible to home cooks without sacrificing convenience.\n\nThe publishing of \"The Gefilte Manifesto\" coincides and contributes to what The New York Times called a \"Golden Age\" of American Jewish food, and in an interview with Joel Rose on National Public Radio, Yoskowitz stated that his and Alpern's mission was to \"revitalize [Ashkenazi Jewish] cuisine\".\n\n\"The Gefilte Manifesto\" has been featured in numerous publications and media outlets, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, National Public Radio, Forward, and +972. USA Today named \"The Gefilte Manifesto\" one of the top 16 food and beverage books of 2016. The Jewish Book Council named it a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in Contemporary Jewish Life and Practice.\n\nReviews have been mostly positive. In J., Howard Freedman said of the book: \"The emphasis is not on reproducing the foods of the shtetl. Rather, the thrust is on developing an appreciation of the foods and of the spirit of those who cooked them\". Paula Forbes wrote in Epicurious: \"There are... modern updates on classic flavors... So whether you're looking to preserve your own Jewish traditions or are simply a fan of borscht, this is the book for you\". Bari Weiss, of The Wall Street Journal, said on NY1's \"The Book Reader\": \"Alpern and Yoskowitz recover and reinvent Eastern European Jewish classics and add a bunch of recipes that likely would have baffled their great-grandparents\". \"Publishers Weekly\", however, writes: \"Some readers will be disappointed that Alpern and Yoskowitz, purveyors of a pop-up dining service called the Gefilteria, provide exactly three gefilte fish recipes\", though it goes on to say: \"The authors have actually dug deeper than the title implies, providing a comprehensive and joyful survey of Eastern European Jewish cuisine\".\n"}
{"id": "52382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52382", "title": "Watergate scandal", "text": "Watergate scandal\n\nThe Watergate scandal was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States during the early 1970s, following a break-in by five men at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972, and President Richard Nixon's administration's subsequent attempt to cover up its involvement. After the five burglars were caught, and the conspiracy was discovered—chiefly through the work of a few journalists, Congressional staffers and an election-finance watchdog official—Watergate was investigated by the United States Congress. Meanwhile, Nixon's administration resisted its probes, which led to a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe term \"Watergate\", by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included such dirty tricks as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious. Nixon and his close aides also ordered investigations of activist groups and political figures, using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as political weapons. \n\nThe scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by members of the Nixon administration, an impeachment process against the president that led to articles of impeachment, and Nixon's resignation. The scandal also resulted in the indictment of 69 people, with trials or pleas resulting in 48 being found guilty, many of whom were top Nixon officials.\n\nThe affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday, June 17, 1972. The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), the official organization of Nixon's campaign. In July 1973, evidence mounted against the president's staff, including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee. The investigation revealed that Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations.\n\nAfter a series of court battles, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled that the president was obligated to release the tapes to government investigators (\"United States v. Nixon\"). The tapes revealed that Nixon had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in, and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation.\nFacing virtually certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and equally certain conviction by the Senate, Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, preventing the House from impeaching him. On September 8, 1974, his successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him.\n\nThe name \"Watergate\" and the suffix \"-gate\" have since become synonymous with political and non-political scandals in the United States, and some other parts of the world.\n\nOn January 27, 1972, G. Gordon Liddy, Finance Counsel for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP) and former aide to John Ehrlichman, presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's Acting Chairman Jeb Stuart Magruder, Attorney General John Mitchell, and Presidential Counsel John Dean that involved extensive illegal activities against the Democratic Party. According to Dean, this marked \"the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency\".\n\nMitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, he was alleged to have approved a reduced version of the plan, including burgling the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. — ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation, but has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates, which included former CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become the CRP chairman.\n\nIn May, McCord assigned former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin III to carry out the wiretapping and monitor the telephone conversations afterward. McCord testified that he selected Baldwin's name from a registry published by the FBI's Society of Former Special Agents to work for the Committee to re-elect President Nixon. Baldwin first served as bodyguard to Martha Mitchell — John Mitchell's wife, who was living in Washington. Baldwin accompanied Martha Mitchell to Chicago. Martha did not like Baldwin and described him as the \"gauchest character [she'd] ever met\". The Committee replaced Baldwin with another security man.\n\nOn May 11, McCord arranged for Baldwin, whom investigative reporter Jim Hougan described as \"somehow special and perhaps well known to McCord\", to stay at the Howard Johnson's motel across the street from the Watergate complex. Room 419 was booked in the name of McCord's company. At behest of G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, McCord and his team of burglars prepared for their first Watergate break-in, which began on May 28.\n\nTwo phones inside the DNC headquarters' offices were said to have been wiretapped. One was Robert Spencer Oliver's phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman Larry O'Brien. The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged; however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver's phone.\n\nDespite successfully installing the listening devices, the Committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs. They planned a second \"burglary\" in order to take care of the situation.\n\nSometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard Frank Wills noticed tape covering the latches on some of the complex's doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked. He removed the tape, thinking nothing of it. When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had retaped the locks, he called the police. Responding to the call was an unmarked car with three plainclothes officers working the overnight \"bum squad\" – dressed as hippies and on the lookout for drug deals and other street crimes. The burglars' sentry across the street, Alfred Baldwin, was distracted watching TV and didn't notice the arrival of the police car in front of the hotel or the plainclothes officers investigating the DNC's sixth floor suite of 29 offices. By the time Baldwin noticed unusual activity on the sixth floor and radioed the burglars, it was already too late. The police apprehended five men, later identified as Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis. They were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. \"The Washington Post\" reported that \"police found lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence...a short wave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35 millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns.\" \n\nThe following morning, Sunday, June 18th, G. Gordon Liddy called Jeb Magruder in Los Angeles and informed him that \"the four men arrested with McCord were Cuban freedom fighters, whom Howard Hunt recruited.\" Initially, Nixon's organization and the White House quickly went to work to cover up the crime and any evidence that might have damaged the president and his reelection.\n\nThree months later, on September 15th, a grand jury indicted the five office burglars, as well as Hunt and Liddy, for conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws. The burglars were tried by a jury, with Judge John Sirica officiating, and pled guilty or were convicted on January 30, 1973.\n\nWithin hours of the burglars' arrest, the FBI discovered E. Howard Hunt's name in Barker and Martínez's address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the \"White House Plumbers\", which was set up to stop security \"leaks\" and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman ordered him to \"deep six\" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and the FBI's Acting Director L. Patrick Gray (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.\n\nNixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his Chief of Staff, H. R. Haldeman, in which Nixon asked, \"Who was the asshole that did?\" However, Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.\n\nA few days later, Nixon's Press Secretary, Ron Ziegler, described the event as \"a third-rate burglary attempt.\" On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, \"I can say categorically that ... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.\" On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, \"The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there.\"\n\nOn June 19, 1972, the press reported that one of the Watergate burglars was a Republican Party security aide. Former Attorney General John Mitchell, who at the time was the head of the CRP, denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in or knowledge of the five burglars. On August 1, a $25,000 ($ today) cashier's check was found to have been deposited in the US and Mexican bank accounts of one of the Watergate burglars, Bernard Barker. Made out to the Finance Committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by Kenneth H. Dahlberg. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary/wire tapping team's expenses, hardware, and supplies.\n\nMr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the monies being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.\n\nDonations totaling $86,000 ($ today) were made by individuals who thought they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the Federal Reserve Check Clearing System).\n\nThe banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.\n\nThe investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, Hugh Sloan.\n\nAs a private organization, the committee followed normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.\n\nLiddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker, and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. What Barker, Liddy, and Sloan did not know was that the complete record of all such transactions were held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.\n\nAll five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.\n\nOn September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, the FBI reported the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the President was re-elected in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.\n\nThe connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by \"The Washington Post\", \"Time\", and \"The New York Times\". The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, \"Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.\n\nChief among the \"Post's\" anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as William Mark Felt, Sr., deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All of the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with \"Time\" magazine, the \"Washington Daily News\" and other publications.\n\nDuring this early period, most of the media failed to grasp the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election. Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein's scoops; the crosstown \"Washington Star-News\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the \"Post's\" articles. After the \"Post\" revealed that H.R. Haldeman made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House's denial of the story the following day. The White House also sought to isolate the \"Post's\" coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the New York Times and Time Magazine.\n\nAfter it was learned that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. \"Time\" magazine described Nixon as undergoing \"daily hell and very little trust.\" The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the Vietnam War. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.\n\nNixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to \"get\" (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations. Such actions had been taken before. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of \"Newsday\", after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of Charles \"Bebe\" Rebozo, a friend of Nixon.\n\nThe Administration and its supporters accused the media of making \"wild accusations\", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration. Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter Baruch Korff that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, \"Watergate would have been a blip.\" The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.\n\nApplications to journalism schools reached an all-time high in 1974.\n\nRather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.\n\nOn March 28, on Nixon's orders, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General Richard Kleindienst that nobody in the White House had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.\n\nJohn Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees' recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.\n\nTwo days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorneys. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.\n\nOn April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were later both indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired White House Counsel John Dean, who went on to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.\n\nWriting from prison for \"New West\" and \"New York\" magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.\n\nThe President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:\n\nOn the same day, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular Justice Department hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named Archibald Cox to the position.\n\nOn February 7, 1973, the United States Senate voted 77-to-0 to approve 93 and establish a select committee to investigate Watergate, with Sam Ervin named chairman the next day. The hearings held by the Senate committee, in which Dean and other former administration officials testified, were broadcast from May 17 to August 7, 1973. The three major networks of the time agreed to take turns covering the hearings live, each network thus maintaining coverage of the hearings every third day, starting with ABC on May 17 and ending with NBC on August 7. An estimated 85% of Americans with television sets tuned into at least one portion of the hearings.\n\nOn Friday, July 13, 1973, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel Donald Sanders asked White House assistant Alexander Butterfield if there was any type of recording system in the White House. Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally stated there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and others, as well as Nixon's private office in the Old Executive Office Building.\n\nOn Monday, July 16, 1973, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel Fred Thompson asked Butterfield whether he was \"aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President.\" Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his executive privilege as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.\n\nOn October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon's order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being \"perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job.\" Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.\n\nThese actions met considerable public criticism. Responding to the allegations of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 Associated Press managing editors at Disney's Contemporary Resort on November 17, 1973, Nixon stated emphatically, \"I'm not a crook.\" He needed to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor; Bork chose Leon Jaworski to continue the investigation.\n\nOn March 1, 1974, a grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the \"Watergate Seven\"—H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell, Charles Colson, Gordon C. Strachan, Robert Mardian, and Kenneth Parkinson—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a President can only be indicted after he leaves office. John Dean, Jeb Stuart Magruder, and other figures had already pled guilty. On April 5, 1974, Dwight Chapin, the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted Ed Reinecke, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of California, on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.\n\nThe Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where \"expletive deleted\" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.\n\nInitially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President Gerald Ford said, \"While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand.\" The Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said the transcripts revealed a \"deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral\" performance on the part of the President and his former aides. The House Republican Leader John Jacob Rhodes agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he \"ought to consider resigning as a possible option.\"\n\nThe editors of \"The Chicago Tribune\", a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, \"He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.\" The \"Providence Journal\" wrote, \"Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.\" This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to \"Time\" magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.\n\nThe issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in \"United States v. Nixon\", the Court ruled unanimously (8 to 0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.\n\nThe tapes revealed several crucial conversations that took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a \"cancer on the presidency.\" The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: \"That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice.\" Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: \"... just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have—handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon? … you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options.\"\n\nAt the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: \"Well ... they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid.\" During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.\n\nOn December 7, 1973, investigators found that an -minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.\n\nNixon's position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the House of Representatives approved giving the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate impeachment of the President. On July 27, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted 27-to-11 to recommend the first article of impeachment against the president: obstruction of justice. The Committee recommended the second article, abuse of power, on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: contempt of Congress. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rep. 93–1305, which included the text of the resolution impeaching Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.\n\nOn August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office where they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing their investigation of the break-in, as they recognised that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal may be revealed.\n\nHaldeman introduced the topic as follows:\n\n... the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have ... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas ... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.\n\nAfter explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: \"the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this ... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'\"\n\nNixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: \"All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest.\" Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: \"You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it.\"\n\nNixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.\n\nBefore the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as John Mitchell. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, Fred Buzhardt and James St. Clair, that \"the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years.\" The tape, which Barber Conable referred to as a \"smoking gun,\" proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.\n\nIn the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.\n\nThe release of the \"smoking gun\" tape destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House.\n\nOn the night of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.\n\nRealizing that he had no chance of staying in office and that public opinion was not in his favor, Nixon decided to resign. In a from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:\n\nThe morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, \"As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?\" At Andrews, he and his family boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.\n\nWith Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility both on the federal and state level. Nixon was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had \"committed or may have committed or taken part in\" as president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family's situation \"is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\"\n\nNixon proclaimed his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he \"was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy.\"\n\nSome commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford's loss of the presidential election of 1976. Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on October 17, 1974.\n\nIn his autobiography \"A Time to Heal\", Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.\n\nCharles Colson pled guilty to charges concerning the Daniel Ellsberg case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the Committee to Re-elect the President was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974. On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.\n\nHaldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977. Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.\n\nThe Watergate scandal resulted in 69 government officials being charged and 48 being found guilty, including:\n\nTo defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state bar associations or courts), the American Bar Association (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing Model Code of Professional Responsibility (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983 it replaced it with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The MRPC have been adopted in part or in whole by 49 states (and is being considered by the last one, California). Its preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved law schools take a course in professional responsibility (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.\n\nOn June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a grand jury. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the -minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Aided by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the historian Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the Nixon White House tapes, sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Kutler's request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal. They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.\n\nTexas A&M University–Central Texas professor Luke Nichter wrote the chief judge of the federal court in Washington to release hundreds of pages of sealed records of the Watergate Seven. In June 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice wrote the court that it would not object to their release with some exceptions. On November 2, 2012, Watergate trial records for G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord were ordered unsealed by Federal Judge Royce Lamberth.\n\nAccording to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at University of Texas at Austin, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a \"minor footnote.\"\n\nWhen Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended state of emergency since 1950. Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the suffix \"-gate.\"\n\nDisgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the November 1974 Senate and House elections, which took place three months after Nixon's resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed \"Watergate Babies\"). Congress passed legislation that changed campaign financing, to amend the Freedom of Information Act, as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the Ethics in Government Act). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.\n\nFord's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the 1976 presidential election against Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn 1977, Nixon arranged an interview with British journalist David Frost in the hopes of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.\n\nIn the aftermath of Watergate, \"follow the money\" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book \"All the President's Men\" and did not become associated with it until the movie of the same name was released in 1976.\n\nThe parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011. In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site's significance would be memorialized within the new complex.\n\nDespite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the \"United States v. Liddy\" trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns. The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of Larry O'Brien, the DNC Chairman. However, O'Brien's name was not on Alfred C. Baldwin III's list of targets that was released in 2013. Among those listed were senior DNC official R. Spencer Oliver, Oliver's secretary Ida \"Maxine\" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.\n\nBased on these revelations, Texas A&M history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of the \"New York Times\", who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.\n\nIn 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President Hubert Humphrey to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by Howard Hughes to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, Donald Nixon, was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked John H. Meier, an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the 1960 presidential election campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment. From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.\n\nMeier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.\n\nJames F. Neal, who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon's surprised reaction when he was told about it.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam criticised the Watergate scandal during Question Time in May 1973. Just two years later, in November 1975, Australia experienced its own constitutional crisis which led to the dismissal of Whitlam by the Australian Governor-General, Sir John Kerr.\n\nChinese then-Premier Zhou Enlai said in October 1973 that the scandal did not affect the relations between China and the United States. According to Thai then-Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj of Thailand in July 1975, Chairman Mao Zedong called the Watergate scandal \"the result of 'too much freedom of political expression in the U.S. Mao called it \"an indication of American isolationism, which he saw as 'disastrous' for Europe.\" He further said, \"Do Americans really want to go isolationist? ... In the two world wars, the Americans came [in] very late, but all the same, they did come in. They haven't been isolationist in practice.\"\n\nIn August 1973, then-Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka said that the scandal had \"no cancelling influence on U.S. leadership in the world.\" Tanaka further said, \"The pivotal role of the United States has not changed, so this internal affair will not be permitted to have an effect.\" In March 1975, Tanaka's successor, Takeo Miki, said at a convention of the Liberal Democratic Party, \"At the time of the Watergate issue in America, I was deeply moved by the scene in the House Judiciary Committee, where each member of the committee expressed his own or her own heart based upon the spirit of the American Constitution. It was this attitude, I think, that rescued American democracy.\"\n\nThen-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in August 1973, \"As one surprising revelation follows another at the Senate hearings on Watergate, it becomes increasingly clear that the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), today is in no position to offer the moral or strong political and economic leadership for which its friends and allies are yearning.\" Moreover, Lee said that the scandal may have led the United States to lessen its interests and commitments in world affairs, to weaken its ability to enforce the Paris Peace Accords on Vietnam, and to not react to violations of the Accords. Lee said further that the United States \"makes the future of this peace in Indonesia an extremely bleak one with grave consequence for the contiguous states.\" Lee then blamed the scandal for economic inflation in Singapore because the Singapore dollar was pegged to the United States dollar at the time, assuming the U.S. dollar was stronger than the British pound sterling.\n\nIn June 1973, when Chairman Leonid Brezhnev arrived in the United States to have a one-week meeting with Nixon, Brezhnev told the press, \"I do not intend to refer to that matter—[the Watergate]. It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it. ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect.\" When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were \"weakened\" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, \"It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair.\" Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's \"realistic and constructive approach to Soviet Union–United States relations ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations\".\n\nTalks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.\n\nIranian then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi told the press in 1973, \"I want to say quite emphatically ... that everything that would weaken or jeopardize the President's power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world.\" An unnamed Kenyan senior official of Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, \"American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a .\" Cuban then-leader Fidel Castro said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by the Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were \"probably the least of [them].\"\n\nAfter the fall of Saigon ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May 1975 that, if the scandal had not caused Nixon to resign, and Congress had not overridden Nixon's veto of the War Powers Resolution, North Vietnam would not have captured South Vietnam. Kissinger told the National Press Club in January 1977 that Nixon's presidential powers weakened during his tenure, (rephrased by the media) \"prevent[ing] the United States from exploiting the [scandal].\"\n\nThe publisher of \"The Sacramento Union\", John P. McGoff, said in January 1975 that the media overemphasized the scandal, though he called it \"an important issue,\" overshadowing more serious topics, like a declining economy and an energy crisis.\n\n\n\n"}
