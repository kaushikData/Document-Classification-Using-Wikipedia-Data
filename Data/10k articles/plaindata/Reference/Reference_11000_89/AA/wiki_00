It covers the history of Britain, extending from its invasion by Julius Caesar (60 B.C.) to the making of Normandy in 914. Like the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", it is chiefly concerned with Anglo-Saxon history, but it differs from it in adopting a distinct East Anglian perspective on certain events and weaving a significant amount of Frankish history into its narrative.\n\nContrary to what the modern title may suggest, the work was not compiled at St Neots (Huntingdonshire). It owes its present title to antiquary John Leland, who in the 1540s – at the time of the dissolution – discovered the sole surviving manuscript at St Neots Priory. Palaeographical analysis has shown that two hands using Late Caroline script were at work, Scribe A for the first quire (pp. 1–18) and Scribe B for the remaining part. The script is typical of the first half of the 12th century and both hands have been detected in other manuscripts from Bury St Edmunds. According to Dumville, the evidence suggests then that the manuscript was compiled at Bury St Edmunds between \"c\". 1120 and \"c\". 1140.\n\nAfter Leland's discovery, the manuscript passed into the possession of Matthew Parker (d. 1575), Archbishop of Canterbury, who supplied various annotations. Later, the dean of the college, Thomas Neville, donated the manuscript to Trinity College, Cambridge, where it is preserved up to this day, under the shelfmark R.7.28. It is bound together with several unrelated documents, forming the first 74 leaves of the compilation.\n\n"}

Its key ingredient is a nontrivial fixed point of the theory's renormalization group flow which controls the behavior of the coupling constants in the ultraviolet (UV) regime and renders physical quantities safe from divergences. Although originally proposed by Steven Weinberg to find a theory of quantum gravity, the idea of a nontrivial fixed point providing a possible UV completion can be applied also to other field theories, in particular to perturbatively nonrenormalizable ones. In this respect, it is similar to quantum triviality.\n\nThe essence of asymptotic safety is the observation that nontrivial renormalization group fixed points can be used to generalize the procedure of perturbative renormalization. In an asymptotically safe theory the couplings do not need to be small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial UV fixed point. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in scattering amplitudes. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the bare action and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.\n\nAs for gravity, the standard procedure of perturbative renormalization fails since Newton's constant, the relevant expansion parameter, has negative mass dimension rendering general relativity perturbatively nonrenormalizable. This has driven the search for nonperturbative frameworks describing quantum gravity, including asymptotic safety which — in contrast to other approaches—is characterized by its use of quantum field theory methods, without depending on perturbative techniques, however. At the present time, there is accumulating evidence for a fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety, while a rigorous proof of its existence is still lacking.\n\nGravity, at the classical level, is described by Einstein's field equations of general relativity,\nformula_1. These equations combine the spacetime geometry encoded in the metric formula_2 with the matter content comprised in the energy–momentum tensor formula_3. The quantum nature of matter has been tested experimentally, for instance quantum electrodynamics is by now one of the most accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the mass dimension of Newton's constant is formula_4. The problem occurs as follows. According to the traditional point of view renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in loop integrals. Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number. As this inevitably leads to an infinite number of free parameters to be measured in experiments, the program is unlikely to have predictive power beyond its use as a low energy effective theory.\n\nIt turns out that the first divergences in the quantization of general relativity which cannot be absorbed in counterterms consistently (i.e. without the necessity of introducing new parameters) appear already at one-loop level in the presence of matter fields. \nAt two-loop level the problematic divergences arise even in pure gravity.\nIn order to overcome this conceptual difficulty the development of nonperturbative techniques was required, providing various candidate theories of quantum gravity.\nFor a long time the prevailing view has been that the very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful in the case of the other fundamental interactions — is doomed to failure for gravity. By way of contrast, the idea of asymptotic safety retains quantum fields as the theoretical arena and instead abandons only the traditional program of perturbative renormalization.\n\nAfter having realized the perturbative nonrenormalizability of gravity, physicists tried to employ alternative techniques to cure the divergence problem, for instance resummation or extended theories with suitable matter fields and symmetries, all of which come with their own drawbacks. In 1976, Steven Weinberg proposed a generalized version of the condition of renormalizability, based on a nontrivial fixed point of the underlying renormalization group (RG) flow for gravity.\nThis was called asymptotic safety.\n\nThe idea of a UV completion by means of a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization groups had been proposed earlier by Kenneth G. Wilson and Giorgio Parisi in scalar field theory \n(see also Quantum triviality).\nThe applicability to perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories was first demonstrated explicitly for the Non-linear sigma model and for a variant of the Gross-Neveu model.\n\nAs for gravity, the first studies concerning this new concept were performed in formula_5 spacetime dimensions in the late seventies. In exactly two dimensions there is a theory of pure gravity that is renormalizable according to the old point of view. (In order to render the Einstein–Hilbert action formula_6 dimensionless, Newton's constant formula_7 must have mass dimension zero.) For small but finite formula_8 perturbation theory is still applicable, and one can expand the beta-function (formula_9-function) describing the renormalization group running of Newton's constant as a power series in formula_8. Indeed, in this spirit it was possible to prove that it displays a nontrivial fixed point.\n\nHowever, it was not clear how to do a continuation from formula_5 to formula_12 dimensions as the calculations relied on the smallness of the expansion parameter formula_8. The computational methods for a nonperturbative treatment were not at hand by this time. For this reason the idea of asymptotic safety in quantum gravity was put aside for some years. Only in the early 90s, aspects of formula_14 dimensional gravity have been revised in various works, but still not continuing the dimension to four.\n\nAs for calculations beyond perturbation theory, the situation improved with the advent of new functional renormalization group methods, in particular the so-called \"effective average action\" (a scale dependent version of the effective action). Introduced in 1993 by Christof Wetterich and Tim R Morris for scalar theories, and by Martin Reuter and Christof Wetterich for general gauge theories (on flat Euclidean space), it is similar to a Wilsonian action (coarse grained free energy) and although it is argued to differ at a deeper level, it is in fact related by a Legendre transform. The cutoff scale dependence of this functional is governed by a functional flow equation which, in contrast to earlier attempts, can easily be applied in the presence of local gauge symmetries also.\n\nIn 1996, Martin Reuter constructed a similar effective average action and the associated flow equation for the gravitational field.\nIt complies with the requirement of background independence, one of the fundamental tenets of quantum gravity. This work can be considered an essential breakthrough in asymptotic safety related studies on quantum gravity as it provides the possibility of nonperturbative computations for arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It was shown that at least for the Einstein–Hilbert truncation, the simplest ansatz for the effective average action, a nontrivial fixed point is indeed present.\n\nThese results mark the starting point for many calculations that followed. Since it was not clear in the pioneer work by Martin Reuter to what extent the findings depended on the truncation ansatz considered, the next obvious step consisted in enlarging the truncation. This process was initiated by Roberto Percacci and collaborators, starting with the inclusion of matter fields.\nUp to the present many different works by a continuously growing community – including, e.g., formula_15- and Weyl tensor squared truncations – have confirmed independently that the asymptotic safety scenario is actually possible: The existence of a nontrivial fixed point was shown within each truncation studied so far. Although still lacking a final proof, there is mounting evidence that the asymptotic safety program can ultimately lead to a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity within the general framework of quantum field theory.\n\nThe asymptotic safety program adopts a modern Wilsonian viewpoint on quantum field theory. Here the basic input data to be fixed at the beginning are, firstly, the kinds of quantum fields carrying the theory's degrees of freedom and, secondly, the underlying symmetries. For any theory considered, these data determine the stage the renormalization group dynamics takes place on, the so-called theory space. It consists of all possible action functionals depending on the fields selected and respecting the prescribed symmetry principles. Each point in this theory space thus represents one possible action. Often one may think of the space as spanned by all suitable field monomials. In this sense any action in theory space is a linear combination of field monomials, where the corresponding coefficients are the coupling constants, formula_16. (Here all couplings are assumed to be dimensionless. Couplings can always be made dimensionless by multiplication with a suitable power of the RG scale.)\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) describes the change of a physical system due to smoothing or averaging out microscopic details when going to a lower resolution. This brings into play a notion of scale dependence for the action functionals of interest. Infinitesimal RG transformations map actions to nearby ones, thus giving rise to a vector field on theory space. The scale dependence of an action is encoded in a \"running\" of the coupling constants parametrizing this action, formula_17, with the RG scale formula_18. This gives rise to a trajectory in theory space (RG trajectory), describing the evolution of an action functional with respect to the scale. Which of all possible trajectories is realized in Nature has to be determined by measurements.\n\nThe construction of a quantum field theory amounts to finding an RG trajectory which is infinitely extended in the sense that the action functional described by formula_19 is well-behaved for all values of the momentum scale parameter formula_18, including the infrared limit formula_21 and the ultraviolet (UV) limit formula_22. Asymptotic safety is a way of dealing with the latter limit. Its fundamental requirement is the existence of a fixed point of the RG flow. By definition this is a point formula_23 in the theory space where the running of all couplings stops, or, in other words, a zero of all beta-functions: formula_24 for all formula_25. In addition that fixed point must have at least one UV-attractive direction. This ensures that there are one or more RG trajectories which run into the fixed point for increasing scale. The set of all points in the theory space that are \"pulled\" into the UV fixed point by going to larger scales is referred to as \"UV critical surface\". Thus the UV critical surface consists of all those trajectories which are safe from UV divergences in the sense that all couplings approach finite fixed point values as formula_26. The key hypothesis underlying asymptotic safety is that only trajectories running entirely within the UV critical surface of an appropriate fixed point can be infinitely extended and thus define a fundamental quantum field theory. It is obvious that such trajectories are well-behaved in the UV limit as the existence of a fixed point allows them to \"stay at a point\" for an infinitely long RG \"time\".\n\nWith regard to the fixed point, UV-attractive directions are called relevant, UV-repulsive ones irrelevant, since the corresponding scaling fields increase and decrease, respectively, when the scale is lowered. Therefore, the dimensionality of the UV critical surface equals the number of relevant couplings. An asymptotically safe theory is thus the more predictive the smaller is the dimensionality of the corresponding UV critical surface.\n\nFor instance, if the UV critical surface has the finite dimension formula_27 it is sufficient to perform only formula_27 measurements in order to uniquely identify Nature's RG trajectory. Once the formula_27 relevant couplings are measured, the requirement of asymptotic safety fixes all other couplings since the latter have to be adjusted in such a way that the RG trajectory lies within the UV critical surface. In this spirit the theory is highly predictive as infinitely many parameters are fixed by a finite number of measurements.\n\nIn contrast to other approaches, a bare action which should be promoted to a quantum theory is not needed as an input here. It is the theory space and the RG flow equations that determine possible UV fixed points. Since such a fixed point, in turn, corresponds to a bare action, one can consider the bare action a prediction in the asymptotic safety program. This may be thought of as a systematic search strategy among theories that are already \"quantum\" which identifies the \"islands\" of physically acceptable theories in the \"sea\" of unacceptable ones plagued by short distance singularities.\n\nA fixed point is called \"Gaussian\" if it corresponds to a free theory. Its critical exponents agree with the canonical mass dimensions of the corresponding operators which usually amounts to the trivial fixed point values formula_30 for all essential couplings formula_31. Thus standard perturbation theory is applicable only in the vicinity of a Gaussian fixed point. In this regard asymptotic safety at the Gaussian fixed point is equivalent to perturbative renormalizability plus asymptotic freedom. Due to the arguments presented in the introductory sections, however, this possibility is ruled out for gravity.\n\nIn contrast, a nontrivial fixed point, that is, a fixed point whose critical exponents differ from the canonical ones, is referred to as \"non-Gaussian\". Usually this requires formula_32 for at least one essential formula_31. It is such a non-Gaussian fixed point that provides a possible scenario for quantum gravity. As yet, studies on this subject thus mainly focused on establishing its existence.\n\nQuantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is the generic name for any quantum field theory of gravity that (regardless of its bare action) takes the spacetime metric as the dynamical field variable and whose symmetry is given by diffeomorphism invariance. This fixes the theory space and an RG flow of the effective average action defined over it, but it does not single out a priori any specific action functional. However, the flow equation determines a vector field on that theory space which can be investigated. If it displays a non-Gaussian fixed point by means of which the UV limit can be taken in the \"asymptotically safe\" way, this point acquires the status of the bare action.\n\nThe primary tool for investigating the gravitational RG flow with respect to the energy scale formula_18 at the nonperturbative level is the effective average action formula_35 for gravity. It is the scale dependent version of the effective action where in the underlying functional integral field modes with covariant momenta below formula_18 are suppressed while only the remaining are integrated out. For a given theory space, let formula_37 and formula_38 denote the set of dynamical and background fields, respectively. Then formula_35 satisfies the following Wetterich-Morris-type functional RG equation (FRGE):\n\nHere formula_41 is the second functional derivative of formula_42 with respect to the quantum fields formula_37 at fixed formula_38. The mode suppression operator formula_45 provides a formula_18-dependent mass-term for fluctuations with covariant momenta formula_47 and vanishes for formula_48.\nIts appearance in the numerator and denominator renders the supertrace formula_49 both infrared and UV finite, peaking at momenta formula_50. The FRGE is an exact equation without any perturbative approximations. Given an initial condition it determines formula_42 for all scales uniquely.\n\nThe solutions formula_42 of the FRGE interpolate between the bare (microscopic) action at formula_22 and the effective action formula_54 at formula_21. They can be visualized as trajectories in the underlying theory space. Note that the FRGE itself is independent of the bare action. In the case of an asymptotically safe theory, the bare action is determined by the fixed point functional formula_56.\n\nLet us assume there is a set of basis functionals formula_57 spanning the theory space under consideration so that any action functional, i.e. any point of this theory space, can be written as a linear combination of the formula_58's. Then solutions formula_42 of the FRGE have expansions of the form\n\nInserting this expansion into the FRGE and expanding the trace on its right-hand side in order to extract the beta-functions, one obtains the exact RG equation in component form: formula_61. Together with the corresponding initial conditions these equations fix the evolution of the running couplings formula_62, and thus determine formula_42 completely. As one can see, the FRGE gives rise to a system of \"infinitely many\" coupled differential equations since there are infinitely many couplings, and the formula_9-functions can depend on all of them. This makes it very hard to solve the system in general.\n\nA possible way out is to restrict the analysis on a finite-dimensional subspace as an approximation of the full theory space. In other words, such a \"truncation of the theory space\" sets all but a finite number of couplings to zero, considering only the reduced basis formula_57 with formula_66. This amounts to the ansatz\n\nleading to a system of finitely many coupled differential equations, formula_68, which can now be solved employing analytical or numerical techniques.\n\nClearly a truncation should be chosen such that it incorporates as many features of the exact flow as possible. Although it is an approximation, the truncated flow still exhibits the nonperturbative character of the FRGE, and the formula_9-functions can contain contributions from all powers of the couplings.\n\nAs described in the previous section, the FRGE lends itself to a systematic construction of nonperturbative approximations to the gravitational beta-functions by projecting the exact RG flow onto subspaces spanned by a suitable ansatz for formula_35. In its simplest form, such an ansatz is given by the Einstein–Hilbert action where Newton's constant formula_71 and the cosmological constant formula_72 depend on the RG scale formula_18. Let formula_2 and formula_75 denote the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. Then formula_35 reads, for arbitrary spacetime dimension formula_77,\n\nHere formula_79 is the scalar curvature constructed from the metric formula_2. Furthermore, formula_81 denotes the gauge fixing action, and formula_82 the ghost action with the ghost fields formula_83 and formula_84.\n\nThe corresponding formula_9-functions, describing the evolution of the dimensionless Newton constant formula_86 and the dimensionless cosmological constant formula_87, have been derived for the first time in reference for any value of the spacetime dimensionality, including the cases of formula_77 below and above formula_89 dimensions. In particular, in formula_12 dimensions they give rise to the RG flow diagram shown on the left-hand side. The most important result is the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety. It is UV-attractive both in formula_91- and in formula_92-direction.\n\nThis fixed point is related to the one found in formula_93 dimensions by perturbative methods in the sense that it is recovered in the nonperturbative approach presented here by inserting formula_93 into the formula_9-functions and expanding in powers of formula_8. Since the formula_9-functions were shown to exist and explicitly computed for any real, i.e., not necessarily integer value of formula_77, no analytic continuation is involved here. The fixed point in formula_12 dimensions, too, is a direct result of the nonperturbative flow equations, and, in contrast to the earlier attempts, no extrapolation in formula_8 is required.\n\nSubsequently, the existence of the fixed point found within the Einstein–Hilbert truncation has been confirmed in subspaces of successively increasing complexity. The next step in this development was the inclusion of an formula_101-term in the truncation ansatz.\nThis has been extended further by taking into account polynomials of the scalar curvature formula_102 (so-called formula_15-truncations),\nand the square of the Weyl curvature tensor.\nMoreover, the impact of various kinds of matter fields has been investigated.\nAlso computations based on a field reparametrization invariant effective average action seem to recover the crucial fixed point.\nIn combination these results constitute strong evidence that gravity in four dimensions is a nonperturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory, indeed with a of reduced dimensionality, coordinatized by only a few relevant couplings.\n\nResults of asymptotic safety related investigations indicate that the effective spacetimes of QEG have fractal-like properties on microscopic scales. It is possible to determine, for instance, their spectral dimension and argue that they undergo a dimensional reduction from 4 dimensions at macroscopic distances to 2 dimensions microscopically.\nIn this context it might be possible to draw the connection to other approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. to causal dynamical triangulations, and compare the results.\n\nPhenomenological consequences of the asymptotic safety scenario have been investigated in many areas of gravitational physics. As an example, asymptotic safety in combination with the Standard Model allows a statement about the mass of the Higgs boson and the value of the fine structure constant.\nFurthermore, it provides possible explanations for particular phenomena in cosmology and astrophysics, concerning black holes or inflation, for instance. These different studies take advantage of the possibility that the requirement of asymptotic safety can give rise to new predictions and conclusions for the models considered, often without depending on additional, possibly unobserved, assumptions.\n\n\n"}

Bliss (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the United States, it was more commonly adopted by British libraries. A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.\n\nHenry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the City College of New York Library as Assistant Librarian. He was a critic of Melvil Dewey's work with the Dewey Decimal System and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs. Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of \"alternative location,\" in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.\n\nBliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, \"A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives\". This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, \"Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences\" was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.\n\nThe four broad underlying policies of the BC system are: \nBliss deliberately avoided the use of the decimal point because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric typewriter.\n\nIn 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of faceted classification. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.\n\nThe City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the Library of Congress system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.\n\nThe case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers’ colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries.

Television advertisements would utilize \"tabletop stop-motion animation and CG product photography.\" Colossal Pictures was the animation studio, located in San Francisco, who produced the commercial. Carl Willat directed the spots and performed the stop-motion animation with Gordon Clark. John Dunn, Hershey's brands manager, oversaw the production and helped develop the last-minute idea to create the \"Christmas Bells\" advertisement. Leah Longan, former marketing director for Hershey, told \"the New York Times\" in 1994 they continued to run the advertisement because they \"don't wear out like normal commercials,\" as they are only shown seasonally.\n\n"}
{"id": "39958046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39958046", "title": "Chronicon Aquitanicum", "text": "Chronicon Aquitanicum\n\nThe Chronicon Aquitanicum is a set of annals covering the years 830 to 930 with several gaps and an added notice on the year 1025. It is found in the \"great encyclopedia codex\", BN lat. 5239, of the Abbey of Saint Martial at Limoges. Its entries are annotations on an Easter cycle.\n\nThe \"Chronicon\" was first published by Philippe Labbe in 1653. It was next published in 1717 by Edmond Martène and Ursin Durand under the title \"Breve chronicon Normannicum sive Britannicum\" (\"Short Chronicle of the Northmen, or Britons\"). Georg Pertz edited it for a third time for the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\" in 1829, using the title by which it is most commonly known.\n\nThe \"Chronicon\" draws on the \"Annales Engolismenses\" for much of its information. Both sets of annals were used by Adhemar of Chabannes in composing his \"Historiae\". In 1025, while copying from BN lat. 5239, he added marginal notes of his own to the codex. He returned to Limoges in 1026/7 to add a notice for the year 1025 to the \"Chronicon\", recording the deaths of Emperors Henry II (who actually died in 1024) and Basil II. His notice appears right beneath another already added by another scribe, recording the death of the Viscount Guy of Limoges on 27 October of that year and his burial at Saint Martial's. The notice for 1025 is the only one added after the annals were compiled late in the tenth century. The \"false precision\" of Adhemar's annal—Henry did not die in the same twelve-month period as Basil, nor did Conrad immediately succeed him—indicates a \"sense of global drama and continuity\" characteristic of the \"excited optimism that reigned at Limoges\".\n\n"}

{"id": "344068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344068", "title": "Dirty War", "text": "Dirty War\n\nThe Dirty War () is the name used by the military junta or civic-military dictatorship of Argentina () for the period of state terrorism in Argentina from 1974 to 1983 as a part of Operation Condor, during which military and security forces and right-wing death squads in the form of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA, or Triple A) hunted down any political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism, left-wing Peronism or the Montoneros movement.\n\nAbout 30,000 people disappeared, many of whom were impossible to formally report due to the nature of state terrorism. The justification for the Dirty War was the armed actions of the Montoneros and the ERP. From 1969 to 1979, there were 239 kidnappings and 1,020 murders by the guerrillas. Therefore, the targets were students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and anyone suspected to be a left-wing activist, included Peronist guerrillas. The \"disappeared\" (victims kidnapped, tortured and murdered whose bodies were disappeared by the military government) included those thought to be politically or ideologically a threat to the military junta even vaguely, or contrary to the plan of neoliberal economic policies dictated by Operation Condor. They were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the social and political opposition.\n\nMany of the members of the juntas are currently in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nIn the decades before the 1976 coup, the Argentinian military, supported by the Argentine establishment, opposed Juan Domingo Perón's populist government and attempted a coup in 1951 and two in 1955 before succeeding with the self-proclaimed \"Revolución Libertadora\" (Liberating Revolution). After taking control, the armed forces proscribed Peronism, a decision that triggered the organization of Peronist resistance in workplaces and trade unions, as the working classes sought to protect the economic and social improvements obtained under Perón's rule. Soon after the coup, Peronist resistance began organizing in workplaces and trade unions as the working classes sought economic and social improvements. Over time, as democratic rule was partially restored, but promises of legalizing the expression and political liberties for Peronism were not respected, guerrilla groups began to operate in the 1960s, namely \"Uturuncos\" and the \"EGP\" (People's Guerrilla Army). Both were small and quickly defeated.\n\nAs Perón returned from exile in 1973, the Ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance between left- and right-wing factions of Peronism. In 1974, Perón withdrew his support for the Montoneros shortly before his death. During the presidency of his widow Isabel, the far-right paramilitary death squad Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA, or Triple A) emerged. In 1975, Isabel signed a number of decrees empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" left-wing activists. In 1976, her government was overthrown as a part of Operation Condor by a military coup led by General Jorge Rafael Videla.\n\nThe junta, calling itself the National Reorganization Process, organized and carried out strong repression of political dissidents (or perceived as such) through the government's military and security forces. They were responsible for the arrest, torture, killings and/or forced disappearances of an estimated 30,000 people. The junta would dictate Argentina's future. With the help of Washington, the junta was aided with $50 million in military aid. Another group in the far right that was responsible for the death of many was, Alianza Anticomunista Argentina other wise known as Triple A. Triple A was ruled under Jose Lopez Rega, the Minister of Social Welfare who used Triple A as a death squad regime. Both the junta and Triple A targeted young professionals, high school and college students and trade union members. These groups of people became main targets because of their involvement in political organizations that exploited the work of the right-wing group. Assassination occurred domestically in Argentina via mass shootings and the throwing of live citizens from airplanes to death in the South Atlantic. Additionally, 12,000 prisoners, many of whom had not been convicted through legal processes, were detained in a network of 340 secret concentration camps located throughout Argentina. Triple A partnered with the army, navy and the air force to terrorize the population. Navy captains such as Adolfo Scilingo performed massive number of executions. These actions against victims called \"desaparecidos\" because they simply \"disappeared\" without explanation were confirmed via Scilingo, who has publicly confessed his participation in the Dirty War, stating that the Argentinian military \"did worse things than the Nazis\". In 1983, the National commission on Disappeared People forced Scilingo to testify where he described how \"prisoners were drugged, loaded onto military planes, and thrown, naked and semi-conscious, into the Atlantic Ocean\". A vast majority of those who were killed left with no trace or record of their disappearance.\n\nThe junta referred to their policy of suppressing opponents as the National Reorganization Process (\"Proceso de Reorganización Nacional\"). Argentine military and security forces also created paramilitary death squads, operating behind \"fronts\" as supposedly independent units. Argentina coordinated actions with other South American dictatorships as in Operation Condor. Faced with increasing public opposition and severe economic problems, the military tried to regain popularity by occupying the disputed Falkland Islands. During the resulting Falklands War, the military government lost any remaining favour after its defeat by Britain, forcing it to step aside in disgrace and allow for free elections to be held in late 1983.\n\nThe democratic government of Raúl Alfonsín was elected to office in 1983. Alfonsín organized the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (\"Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas\", CONADEP) to investigate crimes committed during the Dirty War, and heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses and began to develop cases against offenders. The commission organized a tribunal to conduct a transparent prosecution of offenders, holding the Trial of the Juntas in 1985. Among the nearly 300 people prosecuted, many of the leading officers were charged, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.\n\nThe Argentinan armed forces opposed subjecting more of its personnel to the trials, threatening the civilian leadership with another coup. In 1986, the military forced the passage of the \"Ley de Punto Final\" (Full Stop Law) in 1986, which \"put a line\" under previous actions and ended prosecutions for crimes committed by the National Reorganization Process. Fearing military uprisings, Argentina's first two Presidents sentenced only the two top Dirty War former commanders. The Punto Final Law stated that military personnel involved in torture were doing their \"jobs\". In 1994, President Carlos Menem praised the military in their \"fight against subversion\".\n\nIn 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional. Under the presidency of Nestor Kirchner, the Argentine government re-opened its investigations on crimes against humanity and genocide in 2006 and began the prosecution of military and security officers.\n\nThe term \"Dirty War\" was used by the military junta, which claimed that a war, albeit with \"different\" methods (including the large-scale application of torture and rape), was necessary to maintain social order and eradicate political subversives. This explanation has been questioned in court by human rights NGOs, as it suggests that a \"civil war\" was going on and implies justification for the killings. During the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, public prosecutor Julio Strassera suggested that the term \"Dirty War\" was a \"euphemism to try to conceal gang activities\" as though they were legitimate military activities.\n\nAlthough the junta said its objective was to eradicate guerrilla activity because of its threat to the state, it conducted wide-scale repression of the general population, it worked against all political opposition and those it considered on the left: trade unionists (half of the victims), students, intellectuals including journalists and writers, rights activists and other civilians and their families. Many others went into exile to survive and many remain in exile today despite the return of democracy in 1983. During the Trial of the Juntas, the prosecution established that the guerrillas were never substantial enough to pose a real threat to the state and could not be considered a belligerent as in a war:\nThe guerrilla had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population's support.\n\nThe program of extermination of dissidents was referred to as genocide by a court of law for the first time during the trial of Miguel Etchecolatz, a former senior official of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police.\n\nCrimes committed during this time (genocide of civilian population and other crimes against humanity) are not covered under the laws of war (\"jus in bello\"), which shields enlisted personnel from prosecution for acts committed under orders given by a superior officer or the state. Estela de Carlotto, president of the Argentine human rights non-governmental organization Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo states:\n[That term] is a way to minimize state terrorism and is a term born outside the country. It is a totally wrong concept; there was no war, dirty nor clean.\n\nSince former army officer Juan Perón was ousted from the presidency by a coup in 1955 (\"Revolución Libertadora\"), military hostility to Peronism and populist politics dominated Argentine politics. The 1963 Aramburu decree prohibited the use of Perón's name and when General Lanusse, who was part of the Argentine Revolution, called for elections in 1973, he authorized the return of political parties. However, Perón, who had been invited back from exile, was barred from seeking office.\n\nIn May 1973, Peronist Héctor José Cámpora was elected as President, but everyone understood that Perón was the real power behind him. Peronism has been difficult to define according to traditional political classifications and different periods must be distinguished. A populist and nationalist movement, it has sometimes been accused of fascist tendencies as Perón's admiration for Benito Mussolini is often cited in support of that assertion. After World War II, Argentina became a popular country of exile for escaped Nazi war criminals who entered clandestinely via various ratlines. Following nearly two decades of weak civilian governments, economic decline and military interventionism, Perón returned from exile on the 20th of June in 1973, as the country was becoming engulfed in immense financial, social and political disorder. The months preceding his return were marked by important social movements as in the rest of South America and in particular of the Southern Cone before the military intervention of the 1970s, thus during Héctor Cámpora's first months of government (May–July 1973) approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.\n\nUpon Perón's arrival at Buenos Aires Airport, snipers opened fire on the crowds of left-wing Peronist sympathizers. Known as the 1973 Ezeiza massacre, this event marked the split between left-wing and right-wing factions of Peronism. Perón was re-elected in 1973, backed by a broad coalition that ranged from trade unionists in the center to fascists on the right (including members of the neo-fascist \"Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara\") and socialists like the Montoneros led by Mario Firmenich on the left. Following the Ezeiza massacre and Perón's denouncing of \"bearded immature idealists\", Perón sided with the Peronist right, the trade unionist bureaucracy and Radical Civic Union of Ricardo Balbín, Cámpora's unsuccessful rival at the May 1973 elections. Some leftist Peronist governors were deposed, among them Ricardo Obregón Cano, governor of Córdoba, who was ousted by a police coup in February 1974. According to historian Servetto, \"the Peronist right... thus stimulated the intervention of security forces to resolve internal conflicts of Peronism\".\n\nPerón died on 1 July 1974 and was replaced by his Vice President and third wife, Isabel Perón, who ruled Argentina until overthrown in March 1976 by the military. The 1985 CONADEP human rights commission counted 458 assassinations from 1973 to 1975 in its report \"Nunca Más\" (\"Never Again\"): 19 in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, carried out by paramilitary groups, who acted mostly under the José López Rega's Triple A death squad (according to \"Argenpress\", at least 25 trade-unionists were assassinated in 1974). However, the repression of the social movements had already started before the attempt on Yrigoyen's life: on 17 July 1973, the CGT section in Salta was closed while the CGT, SMATA and Luz y Fuerza in Córdoba were victims of armed attacks. Agustín Tosco, Secretary General of Luz y Fuerza, successfully avoided arrest and went into hiding until his death on 5 November 1975.\n\nTrade unionists were also targeted by the repression in 1973 as Carlos Bache was assassinated on 21 August 1973; Enrique Damiano, of the Taxis Trade Union of Córdoba, on 3 October; Juan Avila, also of Córdoba, the following day; Pablo Fredes, on 30 October in Buenos Aires; and Adrián Sánchez, on 8 November 1973 in the Province of Jujuy. Assassinations of trade unions, lawyers and so on continued and increased in 1974 and 1975 while the most combative trade unions were closed and their leaders arrested. In August 1974, Isabel Perón's government took away the rights of trade unionist representation of the \"Federación Gráfica Bonaerense\", whose Secretary General Raimundo Ongaro was arrested in October 1974. During the same month of August 1974, the SMATA Córdoba trade-union, in conflict with the company Ika Renault, was closed by the national direction of trade unions and the majority of its leaders and activists arrested. Most of them, including its Secretary General René Salamanca, were assassinated during the 1976–1983 dictatorship. Atilio López, General Secretary of the CGT of Córdoba and former Vice Governor of the Province, was assassinated in Buenos Aires on 16 September 1974.\n\nPeronist guerrillas, estimated on 300 to 400 active members (Montoneros) at 1977 (and 2000 at his peak in 1975, though almost half of them related to militia), committed a number of delicts in this period such as bombings at Goodyear and Firestone distributors, Riker and Eli pharmaceutical laboratories, Xerox Corporation, and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies. Director-general of the Fiat Concord company in Argentina was kidnapped by ERP guerrillas in Buenos Aires on 21 March 1972 and found murdered on 10 April. On 73' a Ford Motor Company executive was killed in a kidnapping attempt; a Peugeot representative was kidnapped and later released for a reported US$200,000., and FAP guerrillas killed John Swint, the American general manager of a Ford Motor Company. On December, the director of Peugeot in Argentina was kidnapped. \nOn 1974, FAP guerrillas killed Ricardo Goya, the labour relations manager of the IKA-Renault Motor Company in Córdoba; On 1975 Rodolfo Saurnier, manager of an auto parts factory and a production manager of Mercedes-Benz were kidnapped by Montoneros, and an executive of the US Chrysler Corporation and a manager of the Renault plant in Córdoba were killed. On 1976, Enrique Aroza Garay of German-owned Borgward automobile factory and a Chrysler executive were killed. In all, 83 servicemen and policemen were killed in left-wing guerrilla incidents.\n\nIn 1975, the Guevarist People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho and inspired by Che Guevara's foco theory, began a small rural insurgency in the province of Tucumán; with a campaign of no more than 100 men and women. which the Argentine Army defeated; Ítalo Luder, President of the National Assembly who acted as interim President substituting himself to Isabel Perón who was ill for a short period, signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to illegally neutralize and/or \"annihilate\" the insurgency in Tucumán, the smallest province of Argentina. \"Operativo Independencia\" granted power to the armed forces to \"execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán\". Extreme right-wing death squads used their hunt for far-left guerrillas as a pretext to exterminate any and all ideological opponents on the left and as a cover for common crimes.\n\nIn July, there was a general strike. The government, presided temporarily by Italo Luder from the Peronist party, issued three decrees, 2770, 2771 and 2772, that created a Defense Council headed by the president and including his ministers and the chiefs of the armed forces. It was given the command of the national and provincial police and correctional facilities and its mission was to \"annihilate [...] subversive elements throughout the country\".\n\nIsabel Perón's government ordered a raid on 20 March 1975, which involved 4,000 military and police officers, in Villa Constitución, Santa Fe in response to various trade-unionist conflicts. Many citizens and 150 activists and trade unionists leaders were arrested while the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica's subsidiary in Villa Constitución was closed down with the agreement of the trade unions' national direction, headed by Lorenzo Miguel. Repression affected trade unionists of large firms such as Ford, Fiat, Renault, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot and Chrysler and was sometimes carried on with support from the firms' executives and from the trade unionist bureaucracies.\n\nThe sentence of the Trials to the Junta states: \"The subversives had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population's support\". However, the supposed threat was used for the coup.\n\nIn 1975, President Isabel Perón, under pressure from the military establishment, appointed Jorge Rafael Videla commander-in-chief of the Argentine Army. \"As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure\", falsely declared Videla in 1975 in support of the death squads. He was one of the military heads of the coup that overthrew Isabel Perón on 24 March 1976. In her place, a military junta was installed, which was headed by Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera, who stepped out in September 1978, General Orlando Agosti and Videla himself.\n\nThe junta, which dubbed itself National Reorganization Process, systematized the repression, in particular through the way of \"forced disappearances\" (\"desaparecidos\"), which made it very difficult as in Augusto Pinochet's Chile to file legal suits as the bodies were never found. This generalization of state terror tactics has been explained in part by the information received by the Argentine militaries in the infamous School of Americas and also by French instructors from the secret services, who taught them \"counter-insurgency\" tactics first experimented during the Algerian War (1954–1962).\n\nBy 1976, Operation Condor, which had already centralized information from South American intelligence agencies for years, was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again and had to seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General Carlos Prats had already been assassinated by the Chilean DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former DINA agents Michael Townley and Enrique Arancibia. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous \"Automotores Orletti\" torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the \"Grupo de Tareas 18\", headed by Aníbal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery and answered directly to the General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino. \"Automotores Orletti\" was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of the survivors, José Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.\n\nAccording to John Dinges's \"Los años del Cóndor\", Chilean MIR prisoners in Orletti center told José Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, Jesús Cejas Arias and Crescencio Galañega, tortured by Gordon's group and interrogated by a man who came one day from Miami to interrogate them. The two Cuban diplomats, charged with the protection of the Cuban ambassador to Argentina Emilio Aragonés, had been kidnapped on 9 August 1976 by 40 armed SIDE agents who blocked off all sides of the street with their Ford Falcons, the cars used by the security forces during the dictatorship. According to John Dinges, the FBI as well as the CIA were informed of their abduction. In his book, Dinges published a cable sent by Robert Scherrer, an FBI agent in Buenos Aires on 22 September 1976, where he mentions in passing that Michael Townley, later convicted of the assassination on 21 September 1976 of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., had also taken part to the interrogation of the two Cubans. Former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge María Servini de Cubría on 22 December 1999, in Santiago de Chile, the presence of Townley and Cuban Guillermo Novo Sampoll in the Orletti center. The two men traveled from Chile to Argentina on 11 August 1976 and \"cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two Cuban diplomats\". According to the \"terror archives\" discovered in Paraguay in 1992, 50,000 persons were murdered in the frame of Condor, 9,000–30,000 disappeared (desaparecidos) and 400,000 incarcerated.\n\nDuring this period of neoliberal policies the level of the Argentine debt exploded; The economic policy of Martinez de Hoz, Minister of Economy of the dictatorship, applied from April 2, 1976, marks the beginning of a process of destruction of the productive apparatus of the Argentina. In \"Your Money or your Life\", historian and political scientist Éric Toussaint writes:\nThe main Argentine public oil company, YPF (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales), was forced to borrow abroad despite the fact that it had sufficient resources for its own development. At the time of the military coup of 24 March 1976, YPF's external debt was 372 million dollars. Seven years later at the end of the dictatorship, this debt reached 6,000 million dollars. The indebtedness had multiplied by 16 in seven years.\n\nBecause of the illegal character of the economic policies of Latin American dictatorships with banks as the International Monetary Fund, a Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt was formed.\n\nThere were also some companies complicit in crimes against humanity. There has been participation of senior executives of Ford, Mercedes Benz, Acindar, Dálmine Siderca, Ingenio Ledesma, and Astarsa\n\nVictoria Basualdo, from Columbia University, investigated the complicity between large companies and armed forces. She found six companies in which dozens of union representatives were kidnapped and tortured, often detained inside the companies and transferred to clandestine detention centers (CDC) in vehicles provided by the companies. In the case of Dálmine Siderca, a CDC had been installed next to the factory, to which it communicated through a door. In the case of Acindar already during the Peronist government of María Estela Martínez de Perón in 1975, a detention center and interrogation by the Federal Police was installed inside the company.\n\nJudge Alicia Vence was in charge of the investigation of acts of State terrorism committed in facilities and with the participation of authorities of the companies Ford and Mercedes Benz, the latter led then by the race driver Juan Manuel Fangio, involved in the acts by the witnesses. In 2015, the investigation was carried out to carry out the oral trial against the accused.\nJosé Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, president of the metallurgical company Acindar, who was Minister of Economy between 1976 and 1980, was criminally prosecuted in the case of the kidnapping of the businessmen Federico and Miguel Gutheim, owners of SADECO cotton company.\n\nThe direct participation of Catholic religious in the commission of crimes against humanity is also proven. Christian Von Wernich is a paradigmatic case. He is a Catholic priest, who served as a chaplain to the Police of the province of Buenos Aires and used to visit clandestine detention centers, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007 for kidnappings, torture, and homicides that were considered crimes against humanity.\n\nDuring a 1981 interview whose contents were revealed by documents declassified by the CIA in 2000, former DINA agent Michael Townley explained that Ignacio Novo Sampol, member of CORU anti-Castro organization, had agreed to commit the Cuban Nationalist Movement in the kidnapping in Buenos Aires of a president of a Dutch bank. The abduction, organized by civilian SIDE agents, the Argentine intelligence agency, was to obtain a ransom. Townley said that Novo Sampol had provided $6,000 from the Cuban Nationalist Movement, forwarded to the civilian SIDE agents to pay for the preparation expenses of the kidnapping. After returning to the United States, Novo Sampol sent Townley a stock of paper, used to print pamphlets in the name of \"Grupo Rojo\" (Red Group), an imaginary Argentine Marxist terrorist organization, which was to claim credit for the abduction of the Dutch banker. Townley declared that the pamphlets were distributed in Mendoza and Córdoba in relation with false flag bombings perpetrated by SIDE agents, which had as aim to accredit the existence of the fake Grupo Rojo. However, the SIDE agents procrastinated too much and the kidnapping finally was not carried out.\n\nThe exact chronology of the repression occurring before the Operation Condor's beginning in March 1976 is still debated, but some sectors claim the long political conflict started in 1969 as individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo and \"Revolución Libertadora\" in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance since 1973 and Isabel Martínez de Perón's \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during \"Operativo Independencia\" (Operation Independence) in 1975 have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nThe target of the Junta was anyone believed to be associated with activist groups, including trade union members, students (including underage students, like in Night of the Pencils, an operation directed by Ramón Camps, General and head of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police from April 1976 to December 1977), people who had uncovered evidence of government corruption and people thought to hold left-wing views (including French nuns Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon, kidnapped by Alfredo Astiz). Ramón Camps told \"Clarín\" in 1984 that he had used torture as a method of interrogation and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances and justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers \"because subversive parents will raise subversive children\". These individuals who suddenly vanished are called \"los desaparecidos\", meaning \"the missing ones\" or \"dissapeared\".\n\nIn December 1976, 22 captured Montoneros responsible for the death of General Cáceres Monié and the attack on the Argentine Army 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment were tortured and executed during the massacre of Margarita Belén in the military Chaco Province, for which Videla would be found guilty of homicide during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas as well as Cristino Nicolaides, junta leader Leopoldo Galtieri and Santa Fe Provincial Police chief Wenceslao Ceniquel. The same year, 50 anonymous persons were illegally executed by a firing-squad in Córdoba. Victims' relatives uncovered evidence that some children taken from their mothers soon after birth were being raised as the adopted children of military men as in the case of Silvia Quintela, a member of the Montoneros guerrillas movement. For three decades, the Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group founded in 1977, has demanded the return of these kidnapped children, estimated to number as many as 500.\n\nIn a declassified memorandum from the U.S. State Department dated May 1978, it is asserted that \"if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture, this is not because torture has been forsworn but 'derives from fewer operations' because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished\" and presents that case that disappearances \"include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people, for example, labor leaders, workers, clergymen, human rights advocates, scientists, doctors, and political party leaders\". The report describes the torture methods used to intimidate and extract information, including electric shocks, prolonged immersion in water, cigarette burns, sexual abuse, rape, the removal of teeth and fingernails, burning with boiling water, oil and acid and castration.\n\nIn late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup. The \"Registro Unificado de Víctimas del Terrorismo de Estado\" (Ruvte) got a record of 662 people listed disappeared under the presidency of Isabel Martinez de Perón and other 6,348 disappeared during the military dictatorship.\n\nIn 1980, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, a Catholic human rights activist who had organized the Servicio de Paz y Justicia (Peace and Justice Service) and suffered torture while held without trial for 14 months in a Buenos Aires concentration camp, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the defense of human rights.\n\nDeclassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the Batallón de Inteligencia 601 of 22,000 killed or \"disappeared\" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, it was later revealed that at least 12,000 \"disappeared\" were detainees held by PEN (\"Poder Ejecutivo Nacional\", anglicized as National Executive Power) and kept in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure. In 2003, the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons recorded the forced disappearance of 8,961 persons from 1976 to 1983, although it noted that the actual number is higher. The members of junta militar currently in prison convicted of crimes against humanity refused to give to the Argentine justice the lists of names and numbers of kidnapped, tortured, murdered or disappeared people, so the exact number of victims remains uncertain.\n\nUnder Carlos Menem government Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims' families. Some 11,000 Argentines as the next of kin have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US$200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship while others as Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo refused to receive any money from a government that they considered to be following the same neoliberal policies dictated by Operation Condor \n\nBy the time of the coup on 24 March 1976, the number of disappeared held under \"Poder Ejecutivo Nacional\" (PEN) stood at least 5,182. Some 18,000 disappeared in the form of PEN detainees were imprisoned in Argentina by the end of 1977 and it is estimated that some 3,000 deaths occurred in the Navy Engineering School (ESMA) alone. These disappeared were held incommunicado and reportedly tortured. Some, like senator Hipolito Solari Yrigoyen and socialist leader professor Alfredo Bravo, were \"detenidos-desaparecidos\".\n\nBy refusing to acknowledge the existence of what was later established to be at least 340 concentration camps throughout the country they also denied the existence of their occupants. The total number of people who were detained for long periods was 8,625. Among them was future President Carlos Menem, who between 1976 and 1981 had been a political prisoner.\n\nSome 8,600 PEN disappeared were eventually released under international pressure. Of these, 4,029 were held in illegal detention centers for less than a year, 2,296 for one to three years, 1,172 for three to five years, 668 for five to seven years and 431 for seven to nine years. Of these, 157 were murdered after being released from detention. In one frank memo, written in 1977, an official at the Foreign Ministry issued the following warning:\nOur situation presents certain aspects which are without doubt difficult to defend if they are analyzed from the point of view of international law. These are: the delays incurred before foreign consuls can visit detainees of foreign nationality, (contravening article 34 of the Convention of Vienna.) the fact that those detained under Executive Power (PEN) are denied the right to legal advice or defense, the complete lack of information of persons detained under PEN, the fact that PEN detainees are not processed for long periods of time, the fact that there are no charges against detainees. The kidnapping and disappearance of people.\n\nAt the time when the CONADEP report was prepared, the \"Asociación Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo\" (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo or \"Abuelas\"), had records of 172 children who disappeared together with their parents or were born at the numerous concentration camps and had not been returned to their families. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo now believe up to 500 grandchildren were stolen and 102 are believed to have been located. On 13 April 2000, the grandmothers received a tip off that the birth certificate of Rosa Roisinblit's infant grandson, born in detention, had been falsified and the child given to an Air Force civil agent and his wife. Following the anonymous phone call, he was located and agreed to a DNA blood test, confirming his true identity. Rodolfo Fernando, grandson of Roisinblit, is the first known newborn of missing children returned to his family through the work of the grandmothers. On 6 October 1978, Roisinblit's daughter, 25-year-old Patricia Julia Roisinblit de Perez, who was active in the Montoneros, was kidnapped along with her husband, 24-year-old José Martínas Pérez Rojo.\n\nThe case of Maria Eugenia Sampallo (born some time in 1978) also received considerable attention as Sampallo sued the couple who adopted her illegally as a baby after her parents disappeared, both Montoneros. Her grandmother spent 24 years looking for her. The case was filed in 2001 after DNA tests indicated that Osvaldo Rivas and Maria Cristina Gomez were not her biological parents. Along with army Captain Enrique Berthier, who furnished the couple with the baby, they were sentenced respectively to 8, 7 and 10 years in prison for kidnapping.\n\nThe Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo is the best-known Argentine human rights organization. For over thirty years, the Mothers have campaigned to find out about the fate of their lost relatives. The Mothers first held their vigil at Plaza de Mayo in 1977, where they continue to gather there every Thursday afternoon. An article of the Madres of the Plaza de Mayo monthly publication caused quite a stir in the mid-1980s, when the Human Rights Group Familiares were quoted as saying: \"Familiares assumes the causes of their children's fight as their own, vindicates all the disappeared as fighters of the people, [...] [and when occurs] the defeat of imperialism and the sovereignty of the people, we will have achieved our objectives\".\n\nIn 1986, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo split into two groups: Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo – Linea Fundadora (Founding Line) remains focused in recovering the remains of the missing and bringing former police and military commanders to justice. On the other hand, the Asociacion de Madres de Plaza de Mayo (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association) is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation. In April 2004, the former head of the Mothers of Plaza Hebe de Bonafini declared her admiration for her missing children Jorge Omar and Raúl Alfredo for taking up arms as left-wing guerrillas.\n\nIn 1980, the Argentine military helped Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, Stefano Delle Chiaie and major drug lords mount the bloody Cocaine Coup of Luis García Meza Tejada in neighboring Bolivia. They hired 70 foreign agents for this task, which was managed in particular by the 601st Intelligence Battalion headed by General Guillermo Suárez Mason. After having been trained by the French military, in the frame of Operation Charly the Argentine Armed Forces would train their counterparts in Nicaragua, but also El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. From 1977 to 1984, after the Falklands War the Argentine Armed Forces exported counter-insurgency tactics, including the systemic use of torture, death squads and disappearances. Special force units, such as \"Batallón de Inteligencia 601\", headed in 1979 by Colonel Jorge Alberto Muzzio, trained the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s, in particular in Lepaterique base.\n\nFollowing the release of classified documents and an interview with Duane Clarridge, former CIA responsible for operations with the Contras, the \"Clarín\" showed that with the election of President Jimmy Carter in 1977 the CIA was blocked from engaging in the special warfare it had previously been engaged in. In conformity with the National Security Doctrine, the Argentine military supported U.S. goals in Latin America while they pressured the United States to be more active in counter-revolutionary activities. In 1981, following the election of Ronald Reagan the CIA took over training of the Contras from Batallón 601. Many Chilean and Uruguayan exiles in Argentina were murdered by Argentine security forces (including high-profile figures such as General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires in 1974, Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz and Zelmar Michelini in Buenos Aires in 1976). Others, such as Wilson Ferreira Aldunate escaped death.\n\nAlthough at least six U.S. citizens had been \"disappeared\" by the Argentine military by 1976, high-ranking state department officials including then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had secretly backed up Argentina's new military rulers. During his years as U.S. Secretary of State, Kissinger had congratulated Argentina's military junta for combating the left, stating that in his opinion \"the government of Argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces\". The importance of his role was not known about until \"The Nation\" published in October 1987 an exposé written by Martin Edwin Andersen, a \"Washington Post\" and \"Newsweek\" special correspondent, Kissinger had secretly given the junta a \"green light\" for their state terrorist policies, being the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA), founded in 1946 assigned the specific goal of teaching \"anti-communist counterinsurgency training\", the place where several Latin American dictators, generations of their military where educated in state terrorism tactics, including the uses of torture in its curriculum. In 2000/2001, the institute was renamed to WHINSEC. According to a \"Command and General Foundation News\" issue, the current curriculum at WHINSEC is compatible with curriculum taught at U.S. military academies. WHINSEC faculty members travel to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas throughout the year in order to remain up to date on curriculum changes. However, the school remains controversial due to its influence over affairs in Latin America and its education of Latin American state actors on crimes against humanity within the military and law enforcement.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, Robert C. Hill, a five-time conservative Republican ambassadorial appointee, worked behind the scenes to keep the Argentina military junta from engaging in massive human rights violations. Upon finding out that Kissinger had given the Argentine generals a \"green light\" for the state terrorism of the junta in June 1976 while at an Organization of American States meeting in Santiago (at the Hotel Carrera, later made famous as the Hotel Cabrera in the film \"Missing\"), Hill quietly scrambled to try to roll back the Kissinger decision. Hill did this although Kissinger aides told him that if he continued, Kissinger would likely have him fired. During that meeting with Argentine foreign minister César Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally.\n\nIn October 1987, \"The Nation\" noted: \"'Hill was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' recalled former \"New York Times\" reporter Juan de Onis. 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt.\" \"It sickened me,\" said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, \"that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death on the basis of a cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal\".\n\nIn 1978, former Secretary Kissinger was feted by the \"dirty war\" generals as a much touted guest of honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to \"The Nation\" editor Victor Navasky, protesting publication of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed: \"At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates\". Ironically, Kissinger's posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false by none other than once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told William E. Knight, an oral historian working for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project:\n\nState Department documents obtained in 2003 during the George W. Bush administration by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act show that in October 1976 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and high-ranking U.S. officials gave their full support to the Argentine military junta and urged them to hurry up and finish their actions before the Congress cut military aid. On 5 October 1976, Kissinger met with Argentina's Foreign Minister and stated:\nThe United States was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the Videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression. In early April 1976, the Congress approved a request by the Ford administration, written and supported by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50,000,000 in security assistance to the junta. At the end of 1976, Congress granted an additional $30,000,000 in military aid and recommendations by the Ford administration to increase military aid to $63,500,000 the following year were also considered by congress. U.S. assistance, training and military sales to the Videla regime continued under the successive Carter administration up until at least 30 September 1978 when military aid was officially called to a stop within section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act.\n\nIn 1977 and 1978, the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in military spare parts to Argentina and in 1977 the Department of Defense was granted $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers. By the time the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program was suspended to Argentina in 1978, total U.S. training costs for Argentine military personnel since 1976 totalled $1,115,000. The Reagan administration, whose first term began in 1981, asserted that the previous Carter administration had weakened U.S. diplomatic relationships with Cold War allies in Argentina and reversed the previous administration's official condemnation of the junta's human rights practices. The re-establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for CIA collaboration with the Argentine intelligence service in training and arming the Nicaraguan Contras against the Sandinista government. The 601 Intelligence Battalion, for example, trained Contras at Lepaterique base in Honduras.\n\nInvestigating French military influence in Argentina, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin found in 2003 the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires initiated a \"permanent French military mission\" in Argentina and reported on it (she found the document in the archives of the \"Quai d'Orsay\", the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The mission was formed of veterans who had fought in the Algerian War and it was assigned to the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Armed Forces. It was continued until 1981, date of the election of socialist François Mitterrand.\n\nAfter release of her documentary film \"Escadrons de la mort, l'école française\" in 2003 which explored the French connection with South American nations, Robin said in an interview with \"L'Humanité\" newspaper: \"French have systematized a military technique in urban environment which would be copied and pasted to Latin American dictatorships\". She noted that the French military had systematized the methods they used to suppress the insurgency during the 1957 Battle of Algiers and exported them to the War School in Buenos Aires. Roger Trinquier's famous book on counter-insurgency had a very strong influence in South America. In addition, Robin said she was shocked to learn that the DST French intelligence agency gave DINA the names of refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno) from France during their counterinsurgency. All of these Chileans have been killed: \"Of course, this puts in cause [\"sic\" – this makes responsible] the French government, and Giscard d'Estaing, then President of the Republic. I was very shocked by the duplicity of the French diplomatic position which, on one hand, received with open arms the political refugees, and, on the other hand, collaborated with the dictatorships\".\n\nOn 10 September 2003, Green members of parliament Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet filed a request to form a Parliamentary Commission to examine the \"role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984\" before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Edouard Balladur (UMP). Apart from \"Le Monde,\" French newspapers did not report this request. UMP deputy Roland Blum, in charge of the Commission, refused to let Marie-Monique Robin testify on this topic. The Commission in December 2003 published a 12-page report claiming that the French had never signed a military agreement with Argentina.\n\nWhen Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin travelled to Chile in February 2003, he claimed that no co-operation between France and the military regimes had occurred. People in Argentina were outraged when they saw the 2003 film, which included three generals defending their actions during the Dirty War. Due to public pressure, President Néstor Kirchner ordered the military to bring charges against the three for justifying the crimes of the dictatorship. They were Albano Hargindeguy, Reynaldo Bignone and Ramón Genaro Díaz Bessone.\n\nThe next year, Robin published her book under the same title \"Escadrons de la mort: l'école française\" (\"Death Squads: The French School\", 2004), revealing more material. She showed how Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's government secretly collaborated with Videla's junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile. Alcides Lopez Aufranc was among the first Argentine officers to go in 1957 to Paris to study for two years at the Ecole de Guerre military school, two years before the Cuban Revolution and when no Argentine guerrillas existed:\nIn practice, declared Robin to \"Página/12\", the arrival of the French in Argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use of torture as the primary weapon of the anti-subversive war in the concept of modern warfare.\n\nThe annihilation decrees signed by Isabel Perón had been inspired by French texts. During the Battle of Algiers, the police forces were put under the authority of the Army. 30,000 persons were \"disappeared\". In Algeria. Reynaldo Bignone, named President of the Argentine junta in July 1982, said in Robin's film: \"The March 1976 order of battle is a copy of the Algerian battle\". The same statements were made by Generals Albano Harguindeguy, Videla's Interior Minister; and Diaz Bessone, former Minister of Planification and ideologue of the junta. The French military would transmit to their Argentine counterparts the notion of an \"internal enemy\" and the use of torture, death squads and \"quadrillages\" (grids).\n\nMarie-Monique Robin also demonstrated that since the 1930s, there had been ties between the French far-right and Argentina, in particular through the Catholic fundamentalist organisation \"Cité catholique\", created by Jean Ousset, a former secretary of Charles Maurras, the founder of the royalist \"Action Française\" movement. \"La Cité\" edited a review, \"Le Verbe\", which influenced militaries during the Algerian War, notably by justifying the use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the \"Cité catholique\" founded groups in Argentina and organised cells in the Army. It greatly expanded during the government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, in particular in 1969. The key figure of the \"Cité catholique\" in Argentina was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla's personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), the pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in Franquist Spain.\n\nRobin believes that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and length of the French-Argentine co-operation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of Society of St. Pius X in 1970, who was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest one in La Reja. A French priest from there said to Marie-Monique Robin: \"To save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him.\" Luis Roldan, former Secretary of Cult under Carlos Menem, President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999, was presented by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, to Robin as \"Mr. Cité catholique in Argentina\". Bruno Genta and Juan Carlos Goyeneche represent this ideology.\n\nAntonio Caggiano, archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, wrote a prologue to Jean Ousset's 1961 Spanish version of \"Le Marxisme-léninisme\". Caggiano said that \"Marxism is the negation of Christ and his Church\" and referred to a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to \"prepare for the decisive battle\". Together with President Arturo Frondizi (Radical Civic Union, UCR), Caggiano inaugurated the first course on counter-revolutionary warfare in the Higher Military College. (Frondizi was eventually overthrown for being \"tolerant of Communism\").\n\nBy 1963, cadets at the Navy Mechanics School started receiving counter-insurgency classes. They were shown the film \"The Battle of Algiers\", which showed the methods used by the French Army in Algeria. Caggiano, the military chaplain at the time, introduced the film and added a religiously oriented commentary to it. On 2 July 1966, four days after President Arturo Umberto Illia was removed from office and replaced by the dictator Juan Carlos Onganía, Caggiano declared: \"We are at a sort of dawn, in which, thanks to God, we all sense that the country is again headed for greatness\".\n\nArgentine Admiral Luis María Mendía, who had started the practice of \"death flights\", testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges, that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of the two French nuns, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domont. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the OAS and having escaped from Algeria after the March 1962 Évian Accords put an end to the Algerian War (1954–1962).\n\nDuring the 2007 hearings, Luis María Mendía referred to material presented in Robin's documentary, titled \"The Death Squads – the French School\" (2003). He asked the Argentine Court to call numerous French officials to testify to their actions: former French President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, former French Premier Pierre Messmer, former French embassador to Buenos Aires Françoise de la Gosse and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983. Besides this \"French connection\", María Mendía also charged former head of state Isabel Perón and former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who had signed the \"anti-subversion decrees\" before Videla's 1976 coup. According to Graciela Dalo, a survivor of the ESMA interrogations, Mendía was trying to establish that these crimes were legitimate, as the 1987 \"Obediencia Debida\" Act claimed them to be and further that the ESMA actions had been committed under Isabel Perón's \"anti-subversion decrees\" (which would give them a formal appearance of legality, although torture is forbidden by the Argentine Constitution). Alfredo Astiz also referred to the \"French connexion\" when testifying in court.\n\nThe junta relinquished power in 1983. After democratic elections, President elect Raúl Alfonsín created the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) in December 1983, led by writer Ernesto Sábato, to collect evidence about the Dirty War crimes. The gruesome details, including documentation of the disappearance of nearly 9,000 people, shocked the world. Jorge Rafael Videla, head of the junta, was among the generals convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances, torture, murders and kidnappings. President Alfonsín ordered that the nine members of the military junta be judicially charged during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas. , most of the military officials are in trial or jail. In 1985, Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment at the military prison of Magdalena. Several senior officers also received jail terms. In the Prologue to the \"Nunca Más\" report (\"Never Again\"), Ernesto Sábato wrote:\nFrom the moment of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of all communication with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected to barbaric tortures, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, and still possessed all the human attributes: they could feel pain, could remember a mother, child or spouse, could feel infinite shame at being raped in public.\n\nReacting to the human rights trials, hardliners in the Argentine army staged a series of uprisings against the Alfonsín government. They barricaded themselves in several military barracks demanding an end of the trials. During Holy Week (\"Semana Santa\") of April 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico (commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment in Misiones province) and several junior army officers, barricaded themselves in the Campo de Mayo army barracks. The military rebels, who were called the carapintadas, called for an end to the trials and the resignation of army chief of staff General Héctor Ríos Ereñú. Rico believed that the Alfonsin government would be unwilling or unable to put down the uprising. He was correct as the Second Army Corps commander's orders to surround the barracks were ignored by his subordinates. Alfonsin called on the people to come to the Plaza de Mayo to defend democracy and hundreds of thousands responded.\n\nAfter a helicopter visit by Alfonsin to Campo de Mayo, the rebels finally surrendered. There were denials of a deal, but several generals were forced into early retirement and General Jose Dante Caridi was soon replaced Erenu as commander of the army. In January 1988, a second military rebellion took place when Rico refused to accept the detention orders issued by a military court for having led the previous uprising. This time he set up base in the 4th Infantry Regiment in Monte Caseros and repudiated Caridi's calls to hand himself in. Rico again demanded an end to the human rights trials saying the promises of Alfonsin to the rebels had not been fulfilled. Caridi ordered several army units to suppress the rebellion. Their advance to the Monte Caseros barracks was slowed down by the rains and the news that rebel soldiers had laid mines that had wounded three loyal officers. Nevertheless, Rico's forces were defeated after a three-hour battle. They surrendered on 17 January 1988 and 300 rebels were arrested, and sentenced to jail.\n\nA third uprising took place in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Alí Seineldín and was supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of the demands of Seineldin and his followers were met. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who had served in the Falklands/Malvinas War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989, as part of a sweeping reform the newly elected President Carlos Menem pardoned those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings. These amnesty laws were long unpopular first with surviving victims of the Dirty War and their families, later on between most of the population.\n\nIn 2005, under Nestor Kirchner presidency, the trials were opened again. Most of the Junta's members are currently in prison by charges of crimes against humanity and genocide.\nForeign governments whose citizens were victims of the Dirty War (which included citizens of Czechoslovakia, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Paraguay, Bolivia, Spain, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and several other nations) are pressing individual cases against the former military regime. France has sought the extradition of Captain Alfredo Astiz for the kidnapping and murder of its nationals, among them nuns Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon.\n\nOn 23 January 1989, an armed group of around 40 guerrillas, a faction of the \"Movimiento Todos por la Patria\" (MTP or All for the Fatherland Movement), attacked the La Tablada army barracks on the outskirts of Buenos Aires to \"prevent\" a military coup. The attack resulted in 28 of the guerrillas killed, five \"disappeared\" and 13 imprisoned. Eleven police and military died, and 53 were wounded in the fighting. The guerrillas claimed to have acted to prevent a military coup. Among the dead at La Tablada was Jorge Baños, a human rights lawyer who had joined the guerrillas. The MTP attack to prevent a military coup has been suspected to be led by infiltrated Intelligence military service.\n\nIn 2002, Máxima, daughter of Jorge Zorreguieta, a civilian cabinet minister of Argentina during the early phase of the Dictatorship, married Willem-Alexander, crown prince of the Netherlands. All of the Netherlands had wrestled in controversy over her suitability, but ultimately the marriage took place without the presence of her parents. Máxima thus became Queen when her husband ascended to the throne in 2013. In August 2016, Argentine President Mauricio Macri was widely condemned by human rights group for calling into question the number of 30,000 disappeared and for referring to the period as a \"Dirty War\".\n\nDuring the Argentine Bicentennial Independence Celebrations (on 9 July 2016), former Colonel Carlos Carrizo Salvadores drew criticism from the left for leading the march of Malvinas War veterans and Veterans of Operation Independence, the counterinsurgency campaign in Northern Argentina. Carrizo Salvadores had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for his part as a paratrooper captain in the so-called Rosario Chapel massacre in Catamarca Province, but was acquitted under the new government of Mauricio Macri.\n\nUnder Néstor Kirchner's term as President in 2003, the Argentine Congress revoked the longstanding amnesty laws, also called the Pardon Laws. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled these laws were unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of war crimes. From then through October 2011, 259 persons were convicted for crimes against humanity and genocide and sentenced in Argentine courts, including Alfredo Astiz, a notorious torturer, that month.\n\nIn 2006, 24 March was designated as a public holiday in Argentina, the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice. That year on the 30th anniversary of the coup, a huge crowd filled the streets to remember what happened during the military government and ensure it did not happen again.\n\nIn 2006, the government began its first trials of military and security officers since the repeal of the \"Pardon Laws\". Miguel Etchecolatz, the police commissioner of the province of Buenos Aires in the 1970s, faced trial on charges of illegal detention, torture and homicide. He was found guilty of six counts of murder, six counts of unlawful imprisonment and seven counts of torture and sentenced in September 2006 to life imprisonment.\n\nIn February 2006, some former Ford Argentine workers sued the U.S.-based company, alleging that local managers worked with the security forces to detain union members on the premises and torture them. The civil suit against Ford Motor Company and Ford Argentina called for four former company executives and a retired military officer to be questioned. According to Pedro Norberto Troiani, one of the plaintiffs, 25 employees were detained in the plant, located from Buenos Aires. Allegations have surfaced since 1998 that Ford officials were involved in state repression, but the company has denied the claims. Army personnel were reported to have arrived at the plant on the day of the military coup on 24 March 1976 and \"disappearances\" immediately started.\n\nIn 2007, President Cristina Kirchner continued prosecution of military and security officers responsible for the \"disappearances\".\n\nOn 14 December 2007, some 200 men who were at military service during the dictatorship demanded an audience with the governor of Tucumán Province, claiming they too were victims of the Junta as they had no choice and suffered hunger, abandonment, physical and psychological injuries, demanding a military pension.\n\nIn February 2010, a German court issued an international arrest warrant for former dictator Jorge Videla in connection with the death of 20-year-old Rolf Stawowiok in Argentina. He was a German citizen born in Argentina while his father was doing development work there. Rolf Stawowiok disappeared on 21 February 1978. In earlier cases, France, Italy and Spain had requested extradition of the Navy captain Alfredo Astiz for war crimes related to his work with ESMA, but were never successful.\nIn 1977, General Albano Harguindeguy, Interior Minister, admitted that 5,618 people disappeared in the form of PEN detenidos-desaparecidos were being held in detention camps throughout Argentina. According to a secret cable from DINA (Chilean secret police) in Buenos Aires, an estimate by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978, which started counting victims in 1975, gave the figure of 22,000 persons – this document was first published by John Dinges in 2004.\n\nOn 15 April 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis), accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two Jesuit priests. So far, no hard evidence has been presented linking the cardinal to this crime. It is known that the cardinal headed the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 and had asked the two priests to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. The cardinal's spokesman flatly denied the allegations.\n\nA priest, Christian von Wernich, was chaplain of the Buenos Aires Province Police while it was under the command of General Ramón Camps during the dictatorship, with the rank of inspector.

Radical priests, including Father Alberto Carbone, who was eventually indicted in the murder of Aramburu, preached Marxism and presented the early Church fathers as model revolutionaries in an attempt to legitimise the violence.

These records could be any type of mainly unstructured text, such as newspaper articles, real estate records or paragraphs in a manual. User queries can range from multi-sentence full descriptions of an information need to a few words.\n\nDocument retrieval is sometimes referred to as, or as a branch of, text retrieval. Text retrieval is a branch of information retrieval where the information is stored primarily in the form of text. Text databases became decentralized thanks to the personal computer and the CD-ROM. Text retrieval is a critical area of study today, since it is the fundamental basis of all internet search engines.\n\nDocument retrieval systems find information to given criteria by matching text records (\"documents\") against user queries, as opposed to expert systems that answer questions by inferring over a logical knowledge database. A document retrieval system consists of a database of documents, a classification algorithm to build a full text index, and a user interface to access the database.\n\nA document retrieval system has two main tasks:\n\nInternet search engines are classical applications of document retrieval. The vast majority of retrieval systems currently in use range from simple Boolean systems through to systems using statistical or natural language processing techniques.\n\nThere are two main classes of indexing schemata for document retrieval systems: \"form based\" (or \"word based\"), and \"content based\" indexing. The document classification scheme (or indexing algorithm) in use determines the nature of the document retrieval system.\n\nForm based document retrieval addresses the exact syntactic properties of a text, comparable to substring matching in string searches. The text is generally unstructured and not necessarily in a natural language, the system could for example be used to process large sets of chemical representations in molecular biology. A suffix tree algorithm is an example for form based indexing.\n\nThe content based approach exploits semantic connections between documents and parts thereof, and semantic connections between queries and documents. Most content based document retrieval systems use an inverted index algorithm.\n\nA \"signature file\" is a technique that creates a \"quick and dirty\" filter, for example a Bloom filter, that will keep all the documents that match to the query and \"hopefully\" a few ones that do not. The way this is done is by creating for each file a signature, typically a hash coded version. One method is superimposed coding. A post-processing step is done to discard the false alarms. Since in most cases this structure is inferior to inverted files in terms of speed, size and functionality, it is not used widely. However, with proper parameters it can beat the inverted files in certain environments.\n\nThe PubMed form interface features the \"related articles\" search which works through a comparison of words from the documents' title, abstract, and MeSH terms using a word-weighted algorithm.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "67516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67516", "title": "Fourth International", "text": "Fourth International\n\nThe Fourth International (FI) is a revolutionary socialist international organisation consisting of followers of Leon Trotsky, or Trotskyists, with the declared goal of helping the working class overthrow capitalism and work toward international communism. The Fourth International was established in France in 1938 as Trotsky and his supporters, having been expelled from the Soviet Union, considered the Third International or Comintern to have become lost to Stalinism and incapable of leading the international working class to political power. Thus, Trotskyists founded their own competing Fourth International.\n\nToday, there is no longer a single cohesive Fourth International. Throughout the better part of its existence, the Fourth International was hounded by agents of the Soviet secret police, repressed by capitalist countries such as France and the United States and rejected by followers of the Soviet Union and later Maoism as illegitimate. It struggled to maintain contact under these conditions of illegality and repression around much of the world during World War II because when workers' uprisings did occur they were often under the influence of Soviet-inspired, anarchist, social democratic, Maoist, or militant nationalist groups, leading to defeats for the FI and its Trotskyists, who seldom gathered similar support. Despite this, many parts of the world, including Latin America, Europe and Asia, continue to have large Trotskyist groupings who are attracted to its anti-Stalinist positions and its defense of workers' internationalism. Quite a few of these groups carry the label Fourth Internationalist either in their organisation's name, major political position documents, or both.\n\nIn line with its Trotskyist underpinnings, the Fourth International tended to view the Comintern as worthy of conditional support even considering its corruption and although it regarded its own ideas as more advanced and thus superior to those of the Third International, it did not actively seek the Comintern's destruction. It does not operate as a cohesive entity in the manner of the prior internationals. The FI suffered a major split in 1940 and an even more significant split in 1953. A partial reunification occurred in 1963, but the international never recovered enough to re-emerge as a single transnational grouping. Trotskyists' response to that situation has been in the form of its many Internationals, with some divided over ideas of which organisation represents the true political continuity of the Fourth International.\n\nTrotskyists regard themselves as working in opposition to both capitalism and Stalinism. Trotsky advocated proletarian revolution as set out in his theory of \"permanent revolution\", and believed that a workers' state would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless socialist revolutions quickly took hold in other countries as well. This theory was advanced in opposition to the view held by the Stalinists that \"socialism in one country\" could be built in the Soviet Union alone. Furthermore, Trotsky and his supporters harshly criticised the increasingly totalitarian nature of Joseph Stalin's rule. They argued that socialism without democracy is impossible. Thus, faced with the increasing lack of democracy in the Soviet Union, they concluded that it was no longer a socialist workers' state, but a degenerated workers' state.\n\nTrotsky and his supporters had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order to replace it with socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.\n\nEventually, Trotsky was sent into internal exile and his supporters were jailed. However, the Left Opposition continued to work in secret within the Soviet Union. Trotsky was eventually exiled to Turkey. He moved from there to France, Norway and finally to Mexico. He was assassinated on Stalin's orders in Mexico by Ramón Mercader, a Spanish-born Soviet agent in August 1940.\n\nA political international is an organisation of political parties or activists with the aim of co-ordinating their activity for a common purpose. There had been a long tradition of socialists organising on an international basis, and Karl Marx had led the International Workingmen's Association, which later became known as the \"first international\".\n\nAfter the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several attempts were made to revive the organisation, culminating in the formation of the Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.\n\nBy declaring themselves the Fourth International, the \"World Party of Socialist Revolution\", the Trotskyists were publicly asserting their continuity with the Comintern, and with its predecessors. Their recognition of the importance of these earlier Internationals was coupled with a belief that they eventually degenerated. Although the Socialist International and Comintern were still in existence, the Trotskyists did not believe those organisations were capable of supporting revolutionary socialism and internationalism.\n\nThe foundation of the Fourth International was therefore spurred in part by a desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the impending World War.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Trotsky and his supporters believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which was intended to be a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters \"within\" the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.\n\nTrotsky claimed that the Third Period policies of the Comintern had contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and that its turn to a popular front policy (aiming to unite all ostensibly anti-fascist forces) sowed illusions in reformism and pacifism and \"clear[ed] the road for a fascist overturn\". By 1935 he claimed that the Comintern had fallen irredeemably into the hands of the Stalinist bureaucracy. He and his supporters, expelled from the Third International, participated in a conference of the London Bureau of socialist parties outside both the Socialist International and the Comintern. Three of those parties joined the Left Opposition in signing a document written by Trotsky calling for a Fourth International, which became known as the \"Declaration of Four\". Of those, two soon distanced themselves from the agreement, but the Dutch Revolutionary Socialist Party worked with the International Left Opposition to declare the International Communist League.\n\nThis position was contested by Andrés Nin and some other members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the International Communist Opposition (ICO), linked to the Right Opposition in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually led to the formation of the International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. Trotsky considered those organisations to be centrist. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.\n\nIn 1935, Trotsky wrote an \"Open Letter for the Fourth International\", reaffirming the \"Declaration of Four\", while documenting the recent course of the Comintern and the Socialist International. In the letter, he called for the urgent formation of a Fourth International. The \"First International Conference for the Fourth International\" was held in Paris in June 1936, reports giving its location as Geneva for security reasons. This meeting dissolved the International Communist League, founding in its place the Movement for the Fourth International on Trotsky's perspectives.\n\nThe foundation of the Fourth International was seen as more than just the simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore to be seen as a counter-revolutionary organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming World War would produce a revolutionary wave of class and national struggles, rather as World War I had done.\n\nStalin reacted to the growing strength of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.\n\nThe International's rationale was to construct new mass revolutionary parties able to lead successful workers' revolutions. It saw these arising from a revolutionary wave which would develop alongside and as a result of the coming World War. Thirty delegates attended a founding conference, held in September 1938, in the home of Alfred Rosmer just outside Paris. Present at the meeting were delegates from all the major countries of Europe, and from North America, although for reasons of cost and distance, few delegates attended from Asia or Latin America. An International Secretariat was established, with many of the day's leading Trotskyists and most countries in which Trotskyists were active represented. Among the resolutions adopted by the conference was the \"Transitional Programme\".\n\nThe \"Transitional Programme\" was the central programmatic statement of the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up as a result of the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members who happened to be in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.\n\nTrotsky opened a public debate with Shachtman and Burnham and developed his positions in a series of polemics written in 1939–1940 and later collected in \"In Defense of Marxism\". Shachtman and Burnham's tendency resigned from the International in early 1940, alongside almost 40% of the SWP's members, many of whom became founder members of the Workers Party.\n\nIn May 1940 an emergency conference of the International met at a secret location \"somewhere in the Western Hemisphere\". It adopted a manifesto drafted by Trotsky shortly before his murder and a range of policies on the work of the International, including one calling for the reunification of the then-divided Fourth Internationalist groups in Britain.\n\nSecretariat members who had supported Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, with the support of Trotsky himself. While leader of the SWP James P. Cannon later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite. A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the Socialist Workers Party.\n\nThe Fourth International was hit hard during World War II. Trotsky was assassinated, many of the FI's European affiliates were destroyed by the Nazis and several of its Asian affiliates were destroyed by the Empire of Japan. The survivors, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, were largely cut off from each other and from the International Secretariat. The new secretary, Jean Van Heijenoort (also known as Gerland), was able to do little more than publish articles in the SWP's theoretical journal \"Fourth International\". Despite this dislocation, the various groups sought to maintain links and some connections were kept up throughout the early part of the war by sailors enlisted in the U.S. Navy who had cause to visit Marseilles. Contact was steady, if irregular, between the SWP and the British Trotskyists, with the result that the Americans exerted what influence they had to encourage the Workers' International League into the International through a fusion with the Revolutionary Socialist League, a union that had been requested by the Emergency Conference.\n\nIn 1942, a debate on the national question in Europe opened up between the majority of the SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, Albert Goldman and Felix Morrow. This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with capitalism rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of Stalinism and social democracy. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions. The SWP's central committee argued that democratic capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution. It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.\n\nThe wartime debate about post-war perspectives was accelerated by the resolution of the February 1944 European Conference of the Fourth International. The conference appointed a new European Secretariat and elected Michel Raptis, a Greek resident in France also known as Michel Pablo, the organisational secretary of its European Bureau. Raptis and other bureau members re-established contact between the Trotskyist parties. The European conference extended the lessons of a revolution then unfolding in Italy, and concluded that a revolutionary wave would cross Europe as the war ended. The SWP had a similar perspective. The British Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) disagreed and held that capitalism was not about to plunge into massive crisis but rather that an upturn in the economy was already underway. A group of leaders of the French Internationalist Communist Party (PCI) around Yvan Craipeau argued a similar position until they were expelled from the PCI in 1948.\n\nIn April 1946 delegates from the principal European sections and a number of others attended a \"Second International Congress\". This set about rebuilding the International Secretariat of the Fourth International with Michel Raptis appointed Secretary and Ernest Mandel, a Belgian, taking a leading role.\n\nPablo and Mandel aimed to counter the opposition of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary Communist Party and French Internationalist Communist Party. Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported Gerry Healy's opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including Pierre Frank and Marcel Bleibtreu, opposed to the new leadership of the PCI albeit for differing reasons.\n\nThe Stalinist occupation of Eastern Europe was the issue of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East European states were still bourgeois entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.\n\nAnother issue that needed to be dealt with was the possibility that the economy would revive. This was initially denied by Mandel (who was quickly forced to revise his opinion, and later devoted his PhD dissertation to late capitalism, analysing the unexpected \"third age\" of capitalist development). Mandel's perspective mirrored uncertainty at that time about the future viability and prospects of capitalism, not just among \"all\" Trotskyist groups, but also among leading economists. Paul Samuelson had envisaged in 1943 the probability of a \"nightmarish combination of the worst features of inflation and deflation\", worrying that \"there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced\". Joseph Schumpeter for his part claimed that \"[t]he general opinion seems to be that capitalist methods will be unequal to the task of reconstruction\". He regarded it as \"not open to doubt that the decay of capitalist society is very far advanced\".\n\nThe Second World Congress in April 1948 was attended by delegates from 22 sections. It debated a range of resolutions on the Jewish Question, Stalinism, the colonial countries and the specific situations facing sections in certain countries. By this point the FI was united around the view that the Eastern European \"buffer states\" were still capitalist countries.\n\nThe Congress was especially notable for bringing the International into much closer contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe. These included such significant groups as the Revolutionary Workers' Party of Bolivia and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in what was then Ceylon, but the previously large Vietnamese Trotskyist groups had mostly been eliminated or absorbed by the supporters of Ho Chi Minh.\n\nAfter the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat attempted to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it differed from the rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.\n\nThe Third World Congress in 1951 resolved that the economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as deformed workers states in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term \"deformed\" was used rather than \"degenerated\", because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.\n\nThe Third World Congress envisaged the real possibility of an \"international civil war\" in the near future. It argued that the mass Communist parties \"may, under certain favourable conditions, go beyond the aims set for them by the Soviet bureaucracy and project a revolutionary orientation\". Given the supposed closeness of war, the FI thought that the Communist Parties and social democratic parties would be the only significant force that could defend the workers of the world against the imperialist camp in those countries where there were mass forces.\n\nIn line with this geopolitical perspective, Pablo argued that the only way the Trotskyists could avoid isolation was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism \"sui generis\", to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.\n\nThis perspective was accepted within the Fourth International, yet sowed the seeds for the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of entryism sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role of the working class parties in the Fourth International. The leaders of the majority of the Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.\n\nIn the wake of the World Congress, the line of the International Leadership was generally accepted by groups around the world, including the U.S. SWP whose leader, James P. Cannon, corresponded with the French majority to support the tactic of entrism \"sui generis\". At the same time, however, Cannon, Healy and Mandel were deeply concerned by Pablo's political evolution. Cannon and Healy were also alarmed by Pablo's intervention into the French section, and by suggestions that Pablo might use the International's authority in this way in other sections of the Fourth International that felt entrism \"sui generis\" was not a suitable tactic in their own countries. In particular, minority tendencies, exemplified in Britain by John Lawrence and in the U.S. by Bert Cochran, to support entrism \"sui generis\" hinted that Pablo's support for their views indicated that the International might also demand Trotskyists in those countries adopt that tactic.\n\nIn 1953, the SWP's national committee issued an \"Open Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World\" and organised the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). This was a public faction which initially included, in addition to the SWP, Gerry Healy's British section The Club, the Internationalist Communist Party in France (then led by Lambert who had expelled Bleibtreu and his grouping), Nahuel Moreno's party in Argentina and the Austrian and Chinese sections of the FI. The sections of the ICFI withdrew from the International Secretariat, which suspended their voting rights. Both sides claimed they constituted a majority of the former International.\n\nSri Lanka's Lanka Sama Samaja Party, then the country's leading workers' party, took a middle position during this dispute. It continued to participate in the ISFI but argued for a joint congress, for reunification with the ICFI.\n\nAn excerpt from the \"Open Letter\" explains the split as follows:\nTo sum up: The lines of cleavage between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are so deep that no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated that it will not permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.\n\nTheir scheme has been to inject their Stalinist conciliationism piecemeal and likewise in piecemeal fashion, get rid of those who come to see what is happening and raise objections.\n\nOver the following decade, the IC referred to the rest of the International as the \"International Secretariat of the Fourth International\", emphasising its view that the Secretariat did not speak for the International as a whole. The Secretariat continued to view itself as the leadership of the International. It held a Fourth World Congress in 1954 to regroup and to recognise reorganised sections in Britain, France and the U.S.\n\nParts of the International Committee were divided over whether the split with \"Pabloism\" was permanent or temporary, and it was perhaps as a result of this that it did not declare itself to be \"the\" Fourth International. Those sections that considered the split permanent embarked on a discussion about the history of the split and its meanings.\n\nThe sections of the International that recognised the leadership of the International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).\n\nThe Secretariat organised a Fifth World Congress in October 1957. Mandel and Pierre Frank appraised the Algerian revolution and surmised that it was essential to reorient in the colonial states and neocolonies towards the emerging guerrilla-led revolutions. According to Robert Alexander, Ernest Mandel has written that an organisation in Indonesia, the Partai Acoma, was affiliate to the FI from 1959 until the 1965 coup in that country.\n\nThe Sixth World Congress in 1961 marked a lessening of the political divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and the leadership of the SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.\n\nIn 1962 the IC and IS formed a Parity Commission to organise a common World Congress. The supporters of Michel Pablo and Juan Posadas opposed the convergence. The supporters of Posadas left the International in 1962. At the 1963 reunification congress, the sections of the IC and IS reunified (with two exceptions: the British and French sections of the IC). This was largely a result of their mutual support for Ernest Mandel and Joseph Hansen's resolution \"Dynamics of World Revolution Today\" and for the Cuban Revolution. This document distinguished between different revolutionary tasks in the imperialist countries, the \"workers' states\", and the colonial and semi-colonial countries. In 1963, the reunified Fourth International elected a United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI), by which name the organisation as a whole is often still referred.\n\nSince the 1963 reunification, a number of approaches have developed within international Trotskyism towards the Fourth International.\n\nIn uniting the large majority of Trotskyists in one organisation, the Fourth International created a tradition which has since been claimed by many Trotskyist organisations.\n\nEchoing Marx's \"Communist Manifesto\", the \"Transitional Programme\" ended with the declaration \"Workers men and women of all countries, place yourselves under the banner of the Fourth International. It is the banner of your approaching victory!\". It declared demands to be placed on capitalists, opposition to the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and support for workers' action against fascism. Most of the demands on capitalists remain unfulfilled. The collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, but through a social revolution leading to the restoration of capitalism, rather than the political revolution proposed by the Trotskyists. Many Trotskyist groups have been active in anti-fascist campaigns, but the Fourth International has never played a major role in the toppling of a regime.\n\nThose groups which follow traditions that left the Fourth International in its early years argue that, despite initially correct positions, it had little impact. Lutte Ouvriere claims that it \"did not survive the Second World War\". Workers Liberty, which follows in the third camp tradition established by the Workers Party, holds that \"Trotsky and everything he represented was defeated and as we have to recognise in retrospect defeated for a whole historical period.\"\n\nOther groups point to a positive impact. The ICFI claim that \"the [early] Fourth International consisted mainly of cadres who remained true to their aims\" and describes much of the Fourth International's early activity as \"correct and principled\". The reunified FI claim that \"the Fourth International refused to compromise with capitalism either in its fascist or democratic variants.\" In its view, \"many of the predictions made by Trotsky when he founded the Fourth International were proved wrong by history. But what was absolutely vindicated were his key political judgements.\"\n\n\nInternationals:\n\n"}

The museum is located in the former Amstelhof, a classical style building from 1681. The dependency displayed small exhibitions in the adjacent Neerlandia Building from 24 February 2004 until the main museum opened on 19 June 2009.\n\nIt is currently the largest satellite of the Hermitage Museum, with a total area of and fits with the museum's plan to make its collections accessible to more people. The exhibition area covers and is contained within two large exhibition halls and smaller exhibition rooms. The remaining space holds lecture halls, offices and staff accommodations and a restaurant.\n\nThe structure opened in 1682 as a retirement home for elderly women under the name Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys () on the east bank of the river Amstel. Beginning in 1817, the facility housed both elderly men and women, and was renamed Diaconie Oude Vrouwen- en Mannenhuis (English: Deanery Home for Old Men and Women). The building was first named Amstelhof () in 1953.\n\nIn the 1990s, operators of the facility determined that it was inadequate to meet the modern needs of its residents and sought to build a new structure elsewhere. They offered the historic structure to the city of Amsterdam, who, in turn, leased it to the museum. The last inhabitants left the Amstelhof in 2007. On 20 June 2009, the museum was opened by Dutch Queen Beatrix and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The museum was open to the public the following day.\n\nDuring the more than 300 years that residents were housed in the Amstelhof, several renovations took place on the building interior and wings were added to provide needed space. Thus, little of the original interior remained when work for the museum began. While some areas were restored to their original appearance, many existing walls were removed and spaces reconfigured to accommodate the museum's needs. The total cost of the renovations was 40 million.\n\nThe temporary museum in the Neerlandia Building on the Nieuwe Keizersgracht closed in 2008 to become the Hermitage for Children. It opened along with the main museum on 20 June 2009.\n\nThe museum houses two permanent presentations, one describes Netherlands–Russia relations and the other details the history of the Amstelhof building. Temporary exhibitions usually are scheduled for six-months.\n\nAlexander the Great (356 BC – 323 BC, king from 336 BC) appeals to the imagination more than any ruler of the ancient age. Beginning in his youth he inspired those around him. During his campaigns in the East, Alexander searched for the origins of Dionysus, whom the ancient Greeks believed came from the exotic East, possibly India. He followed in the footsteps of Dionysus to reach countries such as Bactria, Egypt, India, Mongolia, Persia and Syria. Everywhere he went he established cities, naming many Alexandria, and left behind a legacy of Greek culture in the form of Hellenism.\n\nAlexander's fame lived long after antiquity as an example to many European, Russian and Islamic rulers. His life and history were depicted through paintings, tapestries and decorative art from classical antiquity to the modern age, of Western and non-Western origins.\n\nThe exhibit was the first display in The Netherlands of works from the Hermitage Museum's collections of French paintings of the late 19th and early 20th century. The collection was started by Russian collectors Morozov and Shchukin. The exhibit contained hundreds of masterpieces by artists who pioneered Modernism, including Matisse, Van Dongen, De Vlaminck, Derain and Picasso. It looked at the concept of Modernism from a historical perspective and examined how artists joined the new movement. The guest curator for the exhibit was Henk van Os, Professor at the University of Amsterdam and chairman of the Specialists Council of the Hermitage Amsterdam.\n\nThe museum is planning a sequel exhibition that will examine the origins of this modern art through a display of works by Impressionists from the Hermitage.\n"}

{"id": "97293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97293", "title": "Jah", "text": "Jah\n\nJah or Yah (, \"Yah\") is a short form of Yahweh (in consonantal spelling YHWH , called the Tetragrammaton), the proper name of God in the Hebrew Bible. \nThis short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase \"Hallelujah\", which is actually a two-word phrase, not one word.\n\nIn an English-language context, the name \"Jah\" is now most commonly associated with the Rastafari. It is otherwise mostly limited to the phrase \"Hallelujah\" and theophoric names such as Elijah. \"Jah\" is an abbreviation of \"Jehovah\", the English transliteration of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton יהוה‬, God's name (Exodus 3:13).\nIn the King James Version (1611) there is only a single instance of \"JAH\" (capitalised), in Psalm 68:4. \"An American Translation\" (1939) follows KJV in using \"Yah\" in this verse.\nThe conventional English pronunciation of \"Jah\" is , even though the letter J here transliterates the palatal approximant (Hebrew י Yodh). The spelling \"Yah\" is designed to make the pronunciation explicit in an English-language context (see also romanization of Hebrew).\n\nOn the assumption that \"a\" and \"e\" are the correct vowels, Yahweh is a name of God in the Hebrew language. \"Yahu\" is a well-attested short form of the full or extended name \"Yahweh\". The short form \"Jah/Yah\", which appears in Exodus 15:2 and 17:16, Psalm 89:9, Song of Songs 8:6, is preserved also in theophoric names such as Elijah (\"my god is Jah\"), Malchijah (\"my king is Jah\"), and (Adonijah) \"my lord is Jah\", etc. as well as in the phrase \"Hallelujah\". The name \"Joel\" is derived from combining the word \"Jah\" with the word \"El\".\n\nWhile pronouncing the Tetragrammaton (generally believed to have corresponded to \"Yahweh\") is forbidden for Jews, articulating \"Jah\"/\"Yah\" is allowed, but is usually confined to prayer and study.\n\nRastafari use the terms \"Jah\" or sometimes \"Jah Jah\" as a term for the Lord God of Israel and/or Haile Selassie, who some Rastafarians regard as the incarnation of The God of the Old Testament or as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ who is also known by the title \"Janhoy\".\n\nYah occurs 50 times: 43 times in the Psalms, in Exodus 15:2; 17:16; Isaiah 12:2; 26:4, and twice in Isaiah 38:11.\n\nAt Revelation 19:1-6, \"Jah\"—a contraction of the name Yahweh—is embedded in the phrase \"hallelujah\" (Tiberian \"halləlûyāh\"), a Hebrew expression that literally means \"Praise Jah\". The short form \"IA\" (Yah or Jah (יה)) in the phrase hallelouia (Ἁλληλουιά) is transcribed by the Greek \"Ia\".\n\nIn the King James Version of the Christian Bible, the Hebrew יהּ is transliterated as \"JAH\" (capitalised) in only one instance: \"Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him\". \"An American Translation\" renders the Hebrew word as \"Yah\" in this verse. In the 1885 Revised Version and its annotated study edition, The Modern Reader's Bible, which uses the Revised Version as its base text, also transliterates \"JAH\" in Psalms 89:8 which reads,\"O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O JAH? and thy faithfulness is round about thee\".\n\nWith the rise of the Reformation, reconstructions of the Tetragrammaton became popular. The Tyndale Bible was the first English translation to use the anglicized reconstruction. The modern letter \"J\" settled on its current English pronunciation only around 500 years ago; in Ancient Hebrew, the first consonant of the Tetragrammaton always represents a \"Y\" sound.\n\nRotherham's \"Emphasised Bible\" includes 49 uses of \"Jah\". In the \"Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition\" Bible, the Jerusalem Bible, and the New Jerusalem Bible (prior to 1998) the name \"YHWH\" and its abbreviated form \"Yah\" is found. The \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\", used primarily by Jehovah's Witnesses, employs \"Jah\" in the Hebrew Scriptures, and translates \"Hallelujah\" as \"Praise Jah\" in the Greek Scriptures. The Divine Name King James Bible employs \"JAH\" in 50 instances within the Old Testament according to the Divine Name Concordance of the Divine Name King James Bible, Second Edition.\n\nThe Spanish language Reina Valera Bible employs \"JAH\" in 21 instances within the Old Testament according to the \"Nueva Concordancia Strong Exhaustiva\". The Darby Bible, Young's Literal Translation, The Jubilee Bible 2000, Lexham English Bible, The Complete Jewish Bible, Names of God Bible, The Recovery Version, Green's Literal Translation, the New Jewish Publication Society or NJPS Tanakh and World English Bible includes \"Jah\" (Yah in the Lexham English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible, the NJPS Tanakh and the World English Bible) numerous times within the Old Testament (as well as in the New Testament or New Covenant as is the case in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles) as \"Hallelujah!\" or \"Alleluia!\" (Praise Jah or Yah in either instance) which is also employed throughout the Old Testament of these Bible versions.\n\n\"Hallelujah!\" or \"Alleluia!\" is also used in other Bible versions such as the Divine Name King James Bible, American Standard Version, the Recovery Version, The Tree of Life Version, Amplified Bible, God's Word Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, International Standard Version, The Message, New American Bible Revised Edition, The Jerusalem Bible, The New Jerusalem Bible, NJPS Tanakh, The first JPS translation, The Living Bible, The Bible in Living English, Young's Literal Translation, King James Version, The Spanish language Reina Valera and even in Bible versions that otherwise do not generally use the Divine Name such as the New King James Version, English Standard Version, J.B. Phillips New Testament, New International Version, Douay-Rheims Version, God's Word Translation, Revised Standard Version, New Revised Standard Version, The Jubilee Bible 2000, New American Standard Bible, New Century Version, New International Reader's Version and several other versions, translations and/or editions in English and other languages varying from once to numerous times depending on the Bible version especially and most notably in Revelation Chapter 19 in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles.\n\nJah is referenced in many reggae songs. The popularity of this music form associated with the Rastafari has spread the name \"Jah\" (derived from the KJV Psalms 68:4) beyond the West Indies.\n\nFor example, it is referenced in Bob Marley's \"Is This Love\", in the line: \"We'll share the same room, for Jah provide the bread\". It appears in the title of Third World's hit song \"Try Jah Love\". The Mighty Diamonds song \"Pass the Koutchie\" has the following lyric: \"Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on\". Similarly, Mystic Roots \"Pass the Marijuana\" contains the words \"Pass the marijuana, give Jah thanks and praise today\". Also Stevie Wonder's ode to Marley, \"Master Blaster (Jammin')\", contains the following verse lyric: \"We've agreed to get together, joined as children in Jah\". P.O.D.'s song \"Strength of My Life\" contains the words \"If Jah is for me, tell me whom I gon' fear? (no I won't fear), and Jah of Jacob, deserving of my love\". Also, Jah is referenced many times in Damian Marley's song \"Road to Zion\" and in the songs of Costa Rican singer Noah, such as \"If you don't believe in Jah, we can not be together\". Additionally, Jah has been linked to acid-reggae music. For example, the name can be heard in Thievery Corporation's song \"The Outernationalist\". Hardcore punk/reggae band Bad Brains' first album contains the songs \"Jah Calling\" and \"I Luv I Jah\". The use of Jah in music is also evident in the reggae band Soldiers of Jah Army, also known as SOJA. Jah also appears in The Lonely Island's \"Ras Trent\" as well as being the subject of \"Mount Zion\" by the MC Young Zeus. Jah also appears in Massive Attack's song \"A Prayer for England\": \"Jah forgive us for forgetting, Oh Jah help us to be forgiving\". Jah is also mentioned in the lyrics in \"Prayer in C\". Also of note is the 1991 release by American ska-punk band Sublime, titled \"Jah Won't Pay the Bills\". Another song in which \"Jah\" appears in is a song written by the Israeli band Hatikva 6 called \"If I'll Meet God\", the first line of the chorus states \"Eem be'yom min ha'yamim, Efgosh et Elohim, Et Allah, Jah Jah, God, Dieu, Melech hamlachim\" which roughly translates to \"If one day I'll meet god, Allah, Jah Jah, God, Dieu, King of Kings\" which are all names of god.\n\n\"Jah\" sometimes appears in other Christian music genres as well. P.O.D. recorded the song \"Without Jah, Nothing,\" and the first line of Camper Van Beethoven's song \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\" is \"Every day, I get up and pray to Jah\". Major Lazer released a song in 2012 called \"Jah No Partial\".\n"}

In terms of its influence on the mainstream book market, it shares a similar popularity in France as publishers like Penguin and Signet do in English-speaking territories.\n\nAdmittedly, books of a similar format, fitting in a pocket, already existed. Since 1905, Editions Jules Tallandier marketed themselves under the name \"Livre de poche\", popular novels at low cost. But the successful reception of \"Le Livre de Poche\" was due to the combination of the new idea of \"consumerism\" with the era and the popular demand for a cheap book, presented in covers recalling cinema posters, but containing quality writing.\n\nHenri Filipacchi supposedly had the idea after seeing an American soldier tearing up a book in order to fit it into the pockets of his uniform. Filipacchi succeeded in convincing his editor friends Albin Michel, Calmann-Lévy, Grasset and Gallimard to join his project and become the \"founding fathers\" of Le Livre de Poche.\n\nThus \"Kœnigsmark\", by Pierre Benoit, was the first title released, in 1953. Every fortnight a new title is released. It soon became a \"fait de société\". From 8 million copies in 1957-1958, sales climbed to 28 million in 1969. This success inspired competitors: J'ai lu created by Flammarion in 1958, Presses Pocket created by the Presses de la Cité and Folio created by Gallimard in 1972 after its withdrawal from the Librairie Générale Française. But, with nearly a billion volumes distributed since its creation and more than 18 million copies sold in 2002, it remains the premier widely distributed French paperback collection.\n\nThe capital of La Librairie générale française, a limited company, is owned 80% by Hachette-Livre and, up to 20%, by les Éditions Albin Michel.\n\n"}

The contents describe how the Ascalon elders pooled money to pay the initial ransom for pockets of Jews and holy relics being held captive in Jerusalem by the Crusaders, the fate of some of these refugees after their release (including their transport to Alexandria, contraction of the plague, or death at sea), and the need for additional funds for the rescuing of further captives.

Monosyllabism is the name for the property of single-syllable word form. Monosyllabism is connected to ideographic writing systems, because of the one-glyph for one word (idea) principle, and Chinese and other languages of Southeast Asia are sometimes referred to as monosyllabic languages. The natural complement of monosyllabism is polysyllabism.\n\nThe languages of the Asian region tend to be highly isolating and can be phonetically complex (the phonetic rules of Thai language permits 23 638 possible syllables, compared to, for example, Hawaiian language's 162). The difficulty of defining the term \"word\", such as the difficulty of telling apart collocations, set phrases and compound words in languages such as Chinese or English (is \"dog house/doghouse\" a single word or a two-word phrase?), the subjective question of what constitutes \"most\" words to make a language monosyllabic (there are no living languages that are strictly monosyllabic) and other such considerations render the topic non-scientific and unencyclopedic.\n\nA monosyllable may be complex and include seven or more consonants and a vowel (CCCCVCCC or CCCVCCCC as in English \"strengths\") or be as simple as a single vowel or a syllabic consonant.\n\nFew known recorded languages preserve simple CV forms which apparently are fully functional roots conveying meaning, \"i.e.\" are words—but are \"not\" the reductions from earlier complex forms that we find in Mandarin Chinese CV forms, almost always derived with tonal and phonological modifications from Sino-Tibetan *(C)CV(C)(C)/(V) forms.\n\nExamples of monosyllabic languages include Vietnamese and Old Chinese. However, all known varieties of modern Chinese are not monosyllabic; see Chinese morphology and Vietnamese morphology for discussion.\n\nSyllables are units of speech. The text below attempts to introduce the concept into a discussion about the writing systems.\n\nOne such language that does record simple C(V) forms as words is hieroglyphic Egyptian where signs for single consonants (with implied vowel) denoting words are marked as words with a short horizontal line: \"e.g.\" 3 ₵, which means 'vulture (or perhaps 'the bird')'; and ' ₳, which means 'arm'. Another early language that allows us to see simple CV forms as words is cuneiform (and earlier pictographic) Sumerian, in which, with some reservations based on the multiple readings of most signs, we can specify the final V: \"e.g.\" da, 'side'; and sa, 'sinew'. Some scientists, however, believe that Sumerian may have been a tonal language, which seems plausible given the number of homonyms in the language.\n"}

In 2010, the International Press Institute named him a World Press Freedom Hero for his work.\n\nOn 16 December 1991, Pap Saine co-founded \"The Point\" along with Deyda Hydara and Babucarr Gaye; Hydara and Saine had been friends since childhood. Gaye resigned four months later, and Hydara and Saine ran the paper together for the next decade. Saine also worked as a Reuters correspondent for West Africa.\n\nOn 14 December 2004, the Gambia passed two new media laws. One, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004, allowed prison terms for defamation and sedition; the other, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004, required newspaper owners to purchase expensive operating licenses, registering their homes as security. Hydara announced his intent to challenge these laws, but on 16 December, was assassinated by an unknown gunman while driving home from work in Banjul. Hydara's murder was never solved. The following year, he was posthumously awarded the PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award.\n\nFollowing Hydara's death, Saine continued to edit \"The Point\", making it a daily in 2006. \"The Point\" soon became the only independent newspaper in the Gambia.\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Saine and \"Point\" reporter Modou Sanyang were arrested by Gambian police for suspicion of \"publishing and spreading false information\". Sanyang was released with a warning, but Saine was formally charged. According to the Media Foundation of West Africa, the arrests had been prompted by a \"Point\" story titled \"Arrested Gambian Diplomat Sent to Mile 2\", in which the paper reported that Lamini Sabi Sanyang, an arrested official from Gambia's US Embassy, had been transferred to Mile 2 Prison; Saine had been detained for refusing to reveal his source. One week later, following another report on Gambia's US Embassy, Saine was arrested again, interrogated at length, and given a second charge of \"publishing and spreading false information\".\n\nOn 24 February, authorities also accused Saine of being Senegalese and having obtained a Gambian birth certificate through \"false statements\". He faced separate trials for each set of charges, both on 12 March in Banjul. Reporters Without Borders described the investigation of Saine as \"hounding\" and called on Kamalesh Sharma, the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, to intervene.\n\nOn 9 April, the charges of \"publishing and spreading false information\" were formally dropped.\n\nIn November 2008, the International Press Institute began a \"Justice Denied\" campaign pressing for investigations into violence against journalists in the Gambia, particularly the still-unsolved murder of Deyda Haydara. At a June 2009 press conference, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh disparaged questions about the Hydara investigation, saying \"And up to now one of these stupid Web sites carries 'Who Killed Deyda Hydara'? Let them go and ask Deyda Hydara who killed him.\" The Gambia Press Union then published a statement criticizing the lack of press freedom in Gambia, the stalled progress of the investigation, and the president's remarks, which the union called \"inappropriate\". The statement ran in \"The Point\" and a weekly newspaper, \"Foroyaa\", on 11 June.\n\nThe Gambian government responded by arresting six journalists: Pap Saine, News Editor Ebrima Sawaneh, and reporters Sarata Jabbi-Dibba and Pa Modou Faal of \"The Point\"; and editor Sam Saar and reporters Emil Touray of \"Foroyaa\". The six were charged with sedition and criminal defamation of the president. Jabbi-Dibba (the only woman) was held in Mile 2 prison, while Saine, Sawaneh, Faal, Saar, and Touray were held in Old Jeshwang prison. On 8 August, Jabbi-Dibba's seven-month-old baby was taken away.\n\nNumerous human rights NGOs protested the arrests and called the charges against the journalists to be dropped. Amnesty International designated the six as prisoners of conscience and demanded their immediate release. The Committee to Protect Journalists also campaigned for Saine's release, as did the World Organization Against Torture, the International Federation for Human Rights, International PEN, the PEN American Center, and Front Line Defenders. Jammeh continued to denounce the journalists, however, making a state television appearance to say \"So they think they can hide behind so-called press freedom and violate the law and get away with it? They got it wrong this time ... We are going to prosecute them to the letter.\"\n\nOn 7 August 2009, the six were convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Mile 2 Prison, as well as a fine of 250,000 dalasi (£5,780) apiece. However, Jammeh pardoned them in September, following a campaign of \"domestic and international pressure\". The pardons were issued to coincide with Ramadan.\n\nSaine was awarded the Johann Philipp Palm Award in 2006. The award is named for a bookseller executed by Napoleon, and recognizes individuals who are \"of outstanding prominence in the promotion of freedom of opinion and the press\".\n\nIn 2010, Saine was named a World Press Freedom Hero by the International Press Institute. He is the third West African to have won the title, following Kenneth Best (Liberia) and Freedom Neruda (Côte d'Ivoire). Saine described the award as a morale-booster and \"an inspiration for journalists who are fighting for freedom of the press and the interests of justice, democracy and human rights not only in the Gambia but in all of Africa\".\n"}

W. Chapman, was a British scholar, book collector and editor of the works of Samuel Johnson and Jane Austen.\n\nChapman was the youngest of six children born to an Anglican clergyman, who died when he was three years old. He was educated at the High School of Dundee, St Andrews University and Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated with a First in classics and humanities. He worked as assistant to the secretary of the Clarendon Press. In 1913 he married Katherine Marion Metcalfe, an English tutor at Somerville College.\nChapman did military service in Salonika during World War I, managing to study the works of Johnson there and continue to write for the \"Times Literary Supplement\".\n\nAfter the war Chapman would remain in Oxford until his death. In 1920 he succeeded Charles Cannan as secretary of the Clarendon Press. He played a part in producing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", combining editorial and administrative responsibilities at the press.\n\nAlthough Chapman is generally credited as the scholar who established Austen’s canonical status in the twentieth century, his wife played a key role in igniting his interest in book collecting as well as Jane Austen’s works. He himself cited her antiquarian interests as the inspiration of his book collecting career, and her editions of Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey both preceded Chapman’s own. Her contribution to his work is self-evident in her ubiquitous handwriting in the Chapman archives. However, Chapman’s own negligence in acknowledging his wife’s contribution to his Jane Austen edition caused her work to go uncredited until later scholars such as David Gilson and Kathryn Sutherland proved otherwise.\n\nIn 1923 Chapman produced an edition of five novels of Jane Austen; further Austen miscellania were published separately in the 1920s and 1930s before being collected together as a sixth volume, \"Minor Works\", of \"The Novels of Jane Austen\". He also edited (1932) Austen's correspondence, though this involved him in some controversy with Austen's critics.\n\nAfter retirement from the Clarendon Press in 1943, Chapman worked on \"what many consider his greatest accomplishment\": a three-volume edition (1952) of Samuel Johnson's letters.\n\nIn 1948, Chapman rejected the authenticity of the Rice portrait of Jane Austen based on costume evidence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2013380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013380", "title": "SPECint", "text": "SPECint\n\nSPECint is a computer benchmark specification for CPU integer processing power. It is maintained by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). SPECint is the integer performance testing component of the SPEC test suite. The first SPEC test suite, CPU92, was announced in 1992. It was followed by CPU95, CPU2000, and CPU2006. The latest standard of SPECint is CINT2006 (aka SPECint2006).\n\nCPU2006 is a set of benchmarks designed to test the CPU performance of a modern server computer system. It is split into two components, the first being CINT2006, the other being CFP2006 (SPECfp), for floating point testing.\n\nSPEC defines a base runtime for each of the 12 benchmark programs. For SPECint2006, that number ranges from 1000 to 3000 seconds. The timed test is run on the system, and the time of the test system is compared to the reference time, and a ratio is computed. That ratio becomes the SPECint score for that test. (This differs from the rating in SPECINT2000, which multiplies the ratio by 100.)\n\nAs an example for SPECint2006, consider a processor which can run 400.perlbench in 2000 seconds. The time it takes the reference machine to run the benchmark is 9770 seconds. Thus the ratio is 4.885. Each ratio is computed, and then the geometric mean of those ratios is computed to produce an overall value.\n\nFor a fee, SPEC distributes source code files to users wanting to test their systems. These files are written in a standard programming language, which is then compiled for each particular CPU architecture and operating system. Thus, the performance measured is that of the CPU, RAM, and compiler, and does not test I/O, networking, or graphics.\n\nTwo metrics are reported for a particular benchmark, \"base\" and \"peak\". Compiler options account for the difference between the two numbers. As the SPEC benchmarks are distributed as source code, it is up to the party performing the test to compile this code. There is agreement that the benchmarks should be compiled in the same way as a user would compile a program, but there is no consistent method for user compilation, it varies system by system. SPEC, in this case, defines two reference points, \"base\" and \"peak\". Base has a more strict set of compilation rules than peak. Less optimization can be done, the compiler flags must be the same for each benchmark, in the same order, and there must be a limited number of flags. Base, then, is closest to how a user would compile a program with standard flags. The 'peak' metric can be performed with maximum compiler optimization, even to the extent of different optimizations for each benchmark. This number represents maximum system performance, achieved by full compiler optimization.\n\nSPECint tests are carried out on a wide range of hardware, with results typically published for the full range of system-level implementations employing the latest CPUs. For SPECint2006, the CPUs include Intel and AMD x86 & x86-64 processors, Sun SPARC CPUs, IBM POWER CPUs, and IA-64 CPUs. This range of capabilities, specifically in this case the number of CPUs, means that the SPECint benchmark is usually run on only a single CPU, even if the system has many CPUs. If a single CPU has multiple cores, only a single core is used; hyper-threading is also typically disabled,\n\nA more complete system-level benchmark that allows all CPUs to be used is known as SPECint_rate2006, also called \"CINT2006 Rate\".\n\nThe SPECint2006 test suite consists of 12 benchmark programs, designed to test exclusively the integer performance of the system.\n\nThe benchmarks are:\nIn the SpecInt2006 benchmarks, the 462.libquantum benchmark is highly vectorizable. The baseline computer for all benchmarks is a 1997 Sun Ultrasparc server computer. Whereas most of the spec sub-benchmarks turn in a performance improvement of about 5x to 80x times faster than the Ultrasparc, the particular 462.libquantum sub-benchmark turns in a result that is up to 4082 times faster than the Sun Ultrasparc. This suggests that for this sub-benchmark, most of the improvements over the Ultrasparc are due to vectorizing compiler improvements, NOT due to CPU hardware improvements, since 1997.\n\n\n"}

It was completed in 1943 and was the last engine built by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, which was affectionately known as the \"Cotton Belt Route\". It was also the last locomotive built in Arkansas. It is located at the Arkansas Railroad Museum.\n\nThe Cotton Belt initially purchased ten Northern 4-8-4 engines (#800–809) from Baldwin Locomotive Works located at Eddystone, Pennsylvania in 1930. Seven years later, Cotton Belt built five more Northern engines (#810–814) from their own shops in Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 1937. These Northern locomotives were Class L1 on the Cotton Belt. \nIn 1942, Cotton Belt officials petitioned the War Production Board for authorization to buy five new EMD FT diesel locomotives for their growing freight business. Instead, they were granted approval to produce five more 4-8-4 type locomotives (#815–819). Although similar to the previous set of five steam engines, these new locomotives had many modern improvements. \nSince 819 was built during World War II, some materials were in short supply. The Cotton Belt emblems, which would have normally been made of brass, were made of steel to save brass for the war effort. Decorative emblems, numbers, etc., were also made of steel and chromium plating was entirely eliminated. Work on the new L1 Northerns began on Tuesday June 2, 1942. But delivery of the boilers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works lagged. The five new boilers were shipped by Baldwin to Pine Bluff between November 5 and December 12, 1942. The rail journey from Philadelphia to Pine Bluff took about five days for each boiler. Work by the Cotton Belt shop forces took an additional five or six weeks to complete each new locomotive. \nOn Monday February 8, 1943, the last of these five steam locomotives, Engine 819, was placed in active service. It was the final locomotive constructed by the Cotton Belt's own staff of mechanical engineers, mechanical officers, foremen and workers in the company shops at Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The cost to build was $143,607.00 and it was to be the last locomotive produced in Arkansas.\nEngine 819 traveled more than 804,000 miles during its 10½ years of service, before being forced aside by the more modern diesel locomotives. On July 19, 1955 Cotton Belt's President H. J. McKenzie presented retired Engine 819 to the City of Pine Bluff to show the Cotton Belt's gratitude for the part the city had played in their steam locomotive operations. McKenzie commented that this model engine is generally conceded to be one of the best designed and most attractive of its type ever built. He recalled how the engine had been built by local craftsmen, who were very proud of them and he hoped that the people of Pine Bluff would be equally proud to display it in their public park.\n\nIn order to raise money for the cost of moving and constructing a permanent display structure for the engine, the City of Pine Bluff sold \"shares\" in the locomotive to the school children in Jefferson County. Children were requested to \"buy\" Engine 819 by contributing one penny per pound (the engine & tender weigh 541,300 pounds) and were presented with cards signed by the mayor indicating the number of \"shares\" purchased. It had been estimated they needed to raise $4,000.00 for the concrete based, metal roofed, pipe framed shed surrounded by a concrete walkway and fence. The problem of getting the locomotive moved to the display was solved when Cotton Belt agreed to lend materials for a temporary spur to the park. Cotton Belt and Missouri Pacific employees contributed the labor in building the spur and moving the historic locomotive and tender.\nHowever, just four years later, the \"Pine Bluff Commercial\" ran this note in the October 6, 1959 edition:\nIt took most of a year to get 819's situation improved. It was decided to move the engine to a new location approximately 150 yards west of its old spot, near the front of the Reserve building. The Pine Bluff Jaycees spearheaded the drive to build a green and white steel shed at the new location, while the move and reconditioning was being coordinated by members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Cotton Belt employees. Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed. That was when BRT stepped in and offered to assist with the engine.\n\n\"Before we're through,\" one of the men said \"that old engine will look just like it did the day it rolled out of the shop she was built in. We hope to have her fixed where she'll be better taken care of, too.\"\nDuring the move to her new location between Townsend and Oakland Parks, Engine 819 \"broke loose\" and coasted down an incline on her temporary track. The locomotive, after starting to coast, rammed the park's lake embankment and finally stopped against a large black oak tree. The workmen labored the next day to get the engine back on her rails and into place. Crews stated they expected to have the locomotive in her new quarters in about two more weeks.\n\nAlthough the engine and tender were successfully relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with International Paper, designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand & Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction of the shed was completed in September 1965 when a chain-link fence was installed and the landscaping was finished.\n\nUpon completion of Engine 819's new home in 1965, Mayor Austin Franks shared one of the two keys to the gate with long-time railfan James Norris. Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always remembered his late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while he was there to let kids climb on the locomotive, ring the bell and answer their many questions.\n\n\"Every time I come out here I can see my daddy standing right on that step.\" Norris said \"It kinda gets down in your heart.\"\n\nIt is uncertain when Mr. Norris' health got so bad that he could no longer continue his weekly maintenance visits to the 819, but he admitted in 1965 that his doctor had told him to stay away from the locomotive. Records indicate that Mr. Norris died in 1970 and by 1983 the \"Arkansas Democrat\" described the locomotive as \"covered in graffiti and vandals have removed, or tried to take, whatever wasn't too heavy to carry off.\" Miss Arkansas of 1958, Sally Miller Perdue, from Pine Bluff complained \"It had been abandoned and stripped of all its dignity. It has become the iron-horse that was put out to pasture, neglected and abused.\"\n\nMs. Perdue, whose family had a long history with the railroad, agreed to chair a sub-committee of the Chamber of Commerce's Publicity & Tourism to get the 819 rejuvenated and relocated. With a slogan of \"Let's Put the Steam Back in Pine Bluff\", she felt that a lot of volunteers, mainly retired Cotton Belt craftsmen and engineers, would be interested in working to restore the 819. Superintendent R. R. McClanahan of the Cotton Belt Pine Bluff Division worked hard to get the locomotive and tender transported from the park back to the shops to make those repairs.\n\nOn December 1, 1983, a force of between 50–100 Cotton Belt employees, most of them volunteers, assisted railfans and rail historical groups, placed Engine 819 back on Cotton Belt rails for the first time in nearly three decades and transported the engine from the park back to the site of its manufacturing 40 years earlier. Members of the newly formed Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society moved the locomotive back to the Cotton Belt shops, where it was to be restored in a bold project to show Arkansans what past gigantic locomotives looked like.\n\nAlthough the ownership of the locomotive was retained by the city, the restoration of the 819 was the responsibility of \"Project 819\", an all-volunteer effort by two rail historical preservation groups: the Arkansas Railroad Club and the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society. The project leased space needed at the Cotton Belt shops in Pine Bluff to complete the restoration, which was projected to take 18–24 months.\n\nWhile the engine languished in the park, various parts disappeared including its bell, whistle, Cotton Belt emblems and many of the gauges. Jake Commer, President of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society at the time, offered a \"no questions asked\" policy for the return of these items and received many of the parts back, including the whistle and one of the emblems. The original bell was never located however and the one currently on the engine is from another 800 class locomotive. That bell was used for many years by the Wesley United Methodist Church in Pine Bluff before being donated to Project 819.\n\nLed by Bill B. Bailey, the Restoration Director for \"Project 819\", seven separate volunteer groups worked six days a week on various sections of the locomotive and tender in hopes of getting the engine totally restored and federally certified as worthy to run on the rails again. Mr. Bailey estimated that about 20% of the volunteers had actually worked on the locomotive or went through an apprenticeship in the early 1940s when the 819 or other 800-class steam locomotives were built in the Cotton Belt Shops at Pine Bluff.\n\nEngine 819 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.\n\nOn April 6, 1986, Engine 819 moved out of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd gathered at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, \"They helped us so much I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it.\"\n\nTwenty days later, on April 26, 1986, Engine 819 pulled into Fordyce on her first full-fledged trip out of Pine Bluff in 31 years. School children from Pine Bluff, Rison, Kingsland and Fordyce waved and shouted their delight at the engine. Cars of railfans followed the train's path, taking pictures.\n\nOn June 13, 1986, Engine 819 participated in the Arkansas State Sesquicentennial with a trip to Little Rock and was perhaps Pine Bluff's most visible contribution to the weekend events marking the state's 150th birthday. In addition to Pine Bluff's Mayor Robinson, Louis Ramsay - Chairman of the state's Sesquicentennial Commission, and Judge Earl Chadick, Sr. of Jefferson County, Hillary Clinton also rode up from Pine Bluff in the opulent VIP car named \"The Houston\" on loan from the Cotton Belt. Governor Bill Clinton joined his wife and the other riders on board when the train slowed to a crawl behind Barton Coliseum, just minutes from Little Rock's Union Station. Engine 819 spent the weekend on display at Union Station, just a few blocks north of the state capitol, as part of Arkansas' Sesquicentennial celebration, before returning to Pine Bluff.\n\nDuring the summer of 1986, film crews came to Pine Bluff for the production of the movie \"End of the Line\". Engine 819 played a major role along with 35 Pine Bluff residents turned-actors, many of them members of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society who had helped restore the steam engine. Arkansas-born actress Mary Steenburgen was the film's executive producer, who worked hard to be able to use the newly restored locomotive for the movie. On August 27, Pine Bluff residents were treated to a special premiere showing of the Orion Pictures film at the Pine Mall Cinema. Proceeds from the $5.00 tickets were given to the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society.\n\nFor the next seven years, the locomotive traveled on numerous excursions, including a trip to the 1990 NRHS convention in St. Louis, where she stood at Union Station with Union Pacific Railroad's No. 844, Frisco No. 1522 and Norfolk & Western No. 1218. The last 819 excursion was to Tyler, Texas in October 1993.\n\nToday, the engine is partially disassembled for its mandated 15-year Federal Railroad Administration inspection. The boiler has been “ultra-sounded” and documented, with only a small area of the firebox remaining to be checked. The flue tubes were removed with plans made for their replacement. A sudden increase in material costs and various emergency repairs needed at the museum over the years have exhausted funds that were hoped to be used to complete the project. The locomotive has sat idle inside the museum, awaiting its return to steam and possible future travels.\n\n"}
{"id": "2413446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2413446", "title": "Standard (warez)", "text": "Standard (warez)\n\nStandards in the warez scene are defined by groups of people who have been involved in its activities for several years and have established connections to large groups. These people form a committee, which creates drafts for approval of the large groups. Outside the warez scene, often referred to as p2p, there are no global rules similar to the scene, although some groups and individuals could have their own internal guidelines they follow.\n\nIn warez distribution, all releases must follow these predefined standards to become accepted material.\nThe standards committee usually cycles several drafts and finally decides which is best suited for the purpose, and then releases the draft for approval.\nOnce the draft has been e-signed by several bigger groups, it becomes ratified and accepted as the current standard.\nThere are separate standards for each category of releases. \nAll groups are expected to know and follow the standards.\n\nThere are rules of naming and organizing files, rules that dictate how a file must be packaged and an nfo file, that contains required information, must be added with the content.\n\nThe first part of a standards document usually defines the format properties for the material, like codec, bitrate, resolution, file type and file size. Creators of the standard usually do comprehensive testing to find optimal codecs and settings for sound and video to maximize image quality in the selected file size.\n\nWhen choosing file size, the limiting factor is the size of the media to be used (such as 700MB for CD-R). The standards are designed such that a certain amount of content will fit on each piece of media, with the best possible quality in terms of size. If more discs are required for sufficient quality, the standard will define the circumstances where it is acceptable to expand to a second or third disc. Newer video standards moved away from the size constraints and replaced them with a quality based alternative such as the use of CRF.\n\nNew codecs are usually tested annually to check if any offer any conclusive enhancement in quality or compression time. In general, quality is not sacrificed for speed, and the standards will usually opt for the highest quality possible, even if this takes much longer. For example, releases using the Xvid encoder must use the two-pass encoding method, which takes twice as long as a single pass, but achieves much higher quality; similarly, DVD-R releases that must be re-encoded often use 6 or 8 passes to get the best quality.\n\nWhen choosing the file format, platform compatibility is important. Formats are chosen such that they can be used on any major platform with little hassle. Some formats such as CloneCD can only be used on Windows computers, and these formats are generally not chosen for use in the standards.\n\nNext, the standard usually talks about how to package the material. Allowed package formats today are limited to RAR and ZIP, of which the latter is used only in 0-day releases.\n\nThe sizes of the archives within the distributed file vary from the traditional 3½\" floppy disk (1.44 MB) or extra-high density disk (2.88 MB) to 5 MB, 15 MB (typical for CD images) or 20MB (typical for CD images of console releases), 50 MB files (typical for DVD images), and 100MB (for dual-layer DVD images). These measurements are not equivalent to traditional measurement of file size (which is 1024 KB to a MB, 1024 MB to a GB); in a typical DVD release, each RAR file is exactly 50,000,000 bytes, not 52,428,800 bytes (50 megabytes in binary prefix).\n\nFormerly, the size of volumes were limited by the RAR file naming scheme, which produced extensions .rar, .r00 and so on through .r99. This allowed for 101 volumes in a single release before the naming switched to s00, s01 and so on. For example, a DVD-R image (4.37 GiB), split into 101 pieces, produces volumes smaller than 50 MB. The new RAR naming format, name.part001.rar, removes the limit, although the individual split archives continue to be 50 MB for historical reasons and because the old RAR naming format is still being widely used.\n\nDifferent compression levels are used for each type of material being distributed. The reason for this is that some material compresses much better than others. Movies and MP3 files are already compressed with near maximum capacity. Repacking them would just create larger files and increase decompression time. Ripped movies are still packaged due to the large file size, but compression is disallowed and the RAR format is used only as a container. Because of this, modern playback software can easily play a release directly from the packaged files, and even stream it as the release is downloaded (if the network is fast enough).\n\nMP3 and music video releases are an exception in that they are not packaged into a single archive like almost all other sections. These releases have content that is not further compressible without loss of quality, but also have small enough files that they can be transferred reliably without breaking them up. Since these releases rarely have large numbers of files, leaving them unpackaged is more convenient and allows for easier scripting. For example, scripts can read ID3 information from MP3s and sort releases based on those contents.\n\nRules for naming files and folders are an important part of the standards. Correctly named folders make it easier to maintain clean archives and unique filenames allow dupecheck to work properly. There's a defined character set which can be used in naming of the folders. The selected character set is chosen to minimize problems due to the many platforms a release may encounter during its distribution. Since FTP servers, operating systems or file systems may not allow special characters in file or directory names, only a small set of characters is allowed. Substitutions are made where special characters would normally be used (e.g. \"ç\" replaced by \"c\") or these characters are omitted, such as an apostrophe. This can happen automatically by site scripts. As a note, spaces are explicitly disallowed in current standards and are substituted with underscores or full stops.\n\nThe ubiquitous character set includes the upper- and lower-case English alphabet, numerals, and several basic punctuation marks. It is outlined below:\n\nA typical example of the folder name of a movie release would be:\nThe Xvid scene does not allow the use of parentheses and \nthe BDR scene also doesn't allow the use of an underscore, \nwhile those are common with music releases. \nDots aren't used in the required naming scheme for music videos. \nSquare brackets aren't defined in any ruleset, however they are used by p2p groups that do not follow these rules. The best known example is aXXo.\n\nStandards documents have often a date defined when the rules take effect. The warez scene typically follows the UTC time standard. \nThere is no formal record documenting correct times for all releases. Depending on geographical location and the timing of releases, release sites receive software releases at slightly different times. Release times in any single source may vary by as much as two weeks.\n\nIf a group violates a standard, the release will be nuked. Another group will often \"proper\" the release. \nThis proper usually requires a sample or a detailed explanation to prove the flaw in the material, unless the flaw was clear enough for the release to be nuked at releasing time. Flaws that aren't immediately visible can be found during testing of the material, such as a broken crack or a bad serial. These sanctions are social in nature and can be initiated by anyone within the community.\n\nThere are several standards to release movies, TV show episodes and other video material to the scene. VCD releases use the less efficient MPEG-1 format, are low quality, but can be played back on most standalone DVD players. SVCD releases use MPEG-2 encoding, have half the video resolution of DVDs and can also be played back on most DVD players. DVD-R releases use the same format as retail DVD-Videos, and are therefore larger in size. Finally DivX, Xvid, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and recently HEVC releases use the much more efficient MPEG standards. Generally, only middle to top-end DVD players can play back DivX or Xvid files, while Blu-ray players are required to handle H.264 files.\n\nThere are many different formats because the whole thing was always a function of players, codec development and the pursuit of the best possible quality in terms of size. This results in a series of evolutionary stages and improvements that have been introduced gradually. The only film format that hasn't changed since the early days is the DVDR. The Scene still holds on to this format but it's becoming less important due to Blu-rays being the main source for retail releases.\n\nScene rules require the releasing group to spread theatrical VCDs in .bin/.cue files that can be burned on a CD. Although often the CD size is dictated by the length of the movie or video. One movie typically uses two CDs, although length may force the release to be a 3 or 4 CD release. The source of these theatrical releases is typically analog, such as CAM, telecine or telesync releases (movies recorded by a camera in theatres, often with external audio sources). VCDs from other sources such as DVD, VHS, TV, Pay-Per-View specials, Porn or Anime may also be released in the .mpg or .asf format. DVD and VHS rips are only allowed if there was no screener released before. The scene VCDs popped up in 1998, but digital unlicensed versions of films already appeared in early 1997 on private FTP networks. Eviliso, VCD-Europe, FTF and Immortal VCD are groups that have released VCD movies. In 1999 there were 15 to 20 groups.\n\nBecause of its low quality, VCD releases declined in favor of SVCD and XviD. VCDs are often larger than these higher quality files, making VCDs even less attractive. VCDs once used for music videos got their own set of standards on October 1, 2002.\n\nScene rules require the releasing group to spread SVCDs in .bin/.cue files, that fit on 700 MiB CDs. One movie typically uses two CDs, although length may force the release to be a 3 or 4 CD release. Content source is sometimes analog, such as Cam, Telecine or telesync releases. Also R5, DVDSCR or retail DVD is used as SVCD source. The advantage of SVCD is that it can be played on any standalone DVD player, but when DivX-capable players are taking over the market and more bandwidth becomes available to download DVDRs, SVCD became obsolete. Around 2007, the stream of SVCD releases from the scene died out.\n\nStandard definition rips have a resolution that is lower than high-definition video.\n\nMPEG-4 release standards are set in the so-called TDX rules. The DivX codec originally gained popularity because it provided a good compromise between film quality and file size. Approximately 25% of the space occupied by DVD is enough for a DivX encode to have DVD quality output. The first standards were created by meetings and debates of Team DivX (TDX) in 2000. This group consisted of the leaders of the top 5 DivX releasing groups, topsite operators along with rippers and encoders. It was formed because they thought \"the new Div/X scene was a bit unmoderated, sloppy and pretty much a free-for-all.\" iSONEWS published the first standards on April 26. Earlier, on March 16, the database started to carry a DivX section on their website. A week later Betanews noticed the popularity of the then recently released DivX codec throughout IRC channels and asked whether this was a new threat to DVD after the DeCSS utility. The 2001 revision of the standards were organized by different people from iSONEWS. It consisted of 15 groups and signed by 18. This was the last one of the listed rulesets covering pornography.\n\nThe once generally accepted TDX2002 ruleset requires movie releases to contain a DivX 3.11 or Xvid encoded video stream with an MP3 or AC3 encoded audio stream in an AVI container file. Movies are released in one, two or more 700 MiB files, so that they can be easily stored on CD-R. Two or four TV show episodes usually share one CD, hence 175 or 350 MiB releases are common. 233 MiB (three episodes per CD) are more rare but not forbidden, and are often used for full 30-minute programs with no adverts. 233 MiB is more used on whole season rips from retail sources or on single episodes that have a longer runtime. In July 2002, around the release of the new TDX2K2 ruleset, Xvid releases started to pop up. DivX with SBC was retired. VCDVaULT was the pioneer in promoting Xvid to the scene.\n\nThe TDX2002 ruleset was followed by TXD2005. Because all DivX codecs are banned in this new ruleset, TDX became TXD: The \"XviD\" Releasing Standards. There is a rebuttal against this revision, proving it to be flawed in several aspects. Higher resolutions are not allowed. More efficient formats such as AVC and AAC have not been adopted yet, but are still being pushed by some release groups. There are also considerations to replace the old proprietary AVI file format with a modern container such as MP4 or MKV that can include multiple audio streams, subtitles and DVD-like menus. However, few standalone DVD players support these formats yet, and cross-platform playback is an important consideration. Nonetheless the introduction of MPEG-4 playback capabilities in standalone DVD players was a result of the huge amount of TDX-compliant movie material available on the internet.\n\nThe latest TXD revision is TXD2009. As with each revision, there are some major changes. Multiple CD releases aren't necessary anymore, but most release groups keep following the tradition. The maximum width of a rip is lowered back to 640px for WS releases, the movie length versus file size rules and many other sections of the ruleset are redefined or extended. 91 releasegroups have signed the rules. as with the 2005 standards, there is a rebuttal that aims to allow \"SOME of the fuckups and insanity in the 2009 ruleset\". While the 2005 rebuttal made some valid points, this one is regarded as being pointless by other sceners. The reason for lowering the resolution is that some cheap Xvid players don't fully support resolutions above 640px. The pixel aspect ratio goes bad and makes the movie unwatchable. Other points made in the rebuttal are too hard to enforce, while still being backed by the releasing groups, or that the TXD is mainly meant for retail sources. Not all rules can be enforced on non-retail sources.\nXviD used for standard definition English television releases has been a \"ruleless world\". However, in 2002 a ruleset for VCD, SVCD and DivX/Xvid \"tries to cover up the mess a little\". SDTV, PDTV, HDTV and their dupe rules were being defined. Nuking had always been an issue in the TV scene. In 2007, a document was released that \"intended to bring a level playing field to the TV-XviD scene and attempt to put down some rules to end some of the controversy that has plagued us in recent years.\", but it was only a draft. On January 1, 2011, a rule set written specifically for UK TV was released, taking into consideration various factors which differ from other regions.\n\nThe introduction of HDTV and the availability of high-definition source material has resulted in the release of video files that exceed the maximum allowed resolution by the TDX rules, which anticipated DVD-Video rips as the ultimate source. Due to a missing standard these releases follow different rules. They are usually tagged as HR HDTV and use half the resolution of 1080i (960 × 540 px, vertically cropped to 528 or 544 px). Some releases also use a resolution of 1024 × 576 px to provide a proper aspect ratio of 16:9. Occasionally, shows (usually animated shows) aired in Standard Definition (PDTV) are often uploaded as HR (high resolution) PDTV using the H264 codec which offers much better compression than XviD, allowing a higher resolution in a file the same size as an XviD encoded video using a Standard Definition source.\n\nOn October 17, 2013, the first standard definition ruleset for retail sources was released. A day later there was a revision that fixed some examples. The MKV container must be used. It is mandatory to support file streaming and playing from RARs. CRF must be used. A photograph as proof must be included. 81 groups signed the document.\n\nOn February 20, 2012, more than a year after the appearance of the first draft, the SD x264 TV Release Standards document was released with the goal \"to bring quality control back to the SD releases\". According to the document x264 has become the most advanced H264 video encoder and compared to XviD it is able to provide higher quality and compression at greater SD resolutions. It also allows better control and transparency over encoding settings. With CRF (constant rate factor) in the mix it can be ensured that a diverse array of material will get the most appropriate bitrate and not arbitrary fixed file sizes. The video container must be MP4 and AAC is used for the audio. Thirteen groups, ASAP, BAJSKORV, C4TV, D2V, DiVERGE, FTP, KYR, LMAO, LOL, MOMENTUM, SYS, TLA and YesTV signed the document and began releasing TV shows in the new format.\n\nFQM and 2HD indicated they will keep releasing XviD. FQM said it's pointless losing a lot of standalone compatibility for slightly higher quality when there's already even better quality available. 2HD agrees and a vocal minority of the torrent community is quite upset because the MP4 container isn't compatible with many DVD players and other devices, but most scene groups don't really care about BitTorrent. \nSoftpedia writer Lucian Parfeni called this interesting phenomenon the \"angry pirate\" and wrote that a lot of BitTorrent users are very disappointed about the move, though quite a few have no idea why it happened. \nA second reason FQM provided was that partial files can't be played back but LOL wrote the next day that the streaming issues were solved. On March 29, an updated version of the rules were released. This time 22 groups supported the document. MP4Box became the recommended muxer because it has support for file streaming and playing from RARs. For encoding audio, FFmpeg and FAAC encoders are banned. 2HD announced on April 15, 2012 that they would be abandoning XviD as show seasons end, but later this changed to only the seasons of the bigger shows. A month after 2HD's first announcement FQM released their first x264 rip.\n\nOn April 3, 2016, the SD x264 TV Release Standard was updated with a new revision that \"aims to update the standards from 2012 to standards suitable for 2016 and the future. Adding clarity and patching loopholes to once again allow for consistent and quality releases, which was the aim of this standard back in 2012.\" The video container in this revision was changed from mp4 to mkv which frustrated many users.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, five groups released the first rule set specifically designed for x264 sport releases: TXSRS2K9. The idea was that the x264 encoder would be more suitable than Xvid. \nSome days after preing the rule set, a rebuttal was released with concerns about the decisions made and them being in conflict with the high definition TV-X264 rule set. \naAF called the rules unofficial nonsense and said that respected groups would not be following them. \nOnly NOsegmenT and KICKOFF have released standard definition x264 sport rips under these rules.\n\nThe following year, a rule set for Xvid sports releases appeared: TXSRS10. Its aim is to improve the overall quality of sports releases while retaining the compatibility that Xvid provides. It should bring standardization and get rid of restrictions applicable to the \"ruleless world of TV-XVID\". Twelve groups signed the standards, including two of the original five of the x264 rule set.\n\nThe SD x264 TV Releasing Standards 2012 also cover sport releases, making the previous standards obsolete.\n\nThe latest High Definition x264 Standard is Revision 4.0 from 2011. This ruleset targets HD DVD and Blu-ray sourced 720p and 1080p movie and TV-show rips. The releases are made available in a Matroska .mkv container, using the x264 encoder. The file size must be a multiple of 1120 MiB. \nIt has become quite normal that non-English spoken movies are tagged with their language tag, even when they contain English subtitles. This is different for Xvid releases. This practice has been accepted by all nukenets, but it was never written down in an addendum to the ruleset. Also the usage of both Dutch and Flemish audio tracks in one release has become a practice.\n\nThere is a second ruleset from 2008 for x264 releases that has many similarities to the previous one, but it concentrates on BD5 and BD9 releases. \nThe purpose of these releases is that the initial mkv file can be burned as a Blu-ray image to a single or double-layer DVD-R. The mkv file accompanying this kind of release is 200-300MB smaller than a similar release following the other ruleset due to the overhead of the Blu-ray image that will be created. \nAround May 2012, the stream of BD9 releases came to a halt. 2011 only had around thirty BD5 releases.\n\nOn August 13, 2009, the first version of the standard was released. This standard is only a recommendation for anime from Blu-ray and its purpose is to improve quality over the then current HDX standard. The document reads that anime was always something special for the video codec experts at Doom9. Without anime there wouldn't be any VirtualDub or many other video related things at all. This is why they decided to put out new standard to enjoy almost lossless anime quality.\nThe French scene had rules for anime releases years earlier. The latest French ruleset for anime is from 2011.\n\nBecause of the x264 scene, many people think WMV-HD is redundant. The authors of the first document think this is not true because of the compatibility WMV-HD provides. They write that the only reason many people are against WMV-HD, is because WMV is from Microsoft. In 2007 they wrote that it can be played on the Xbox 360 and HTPC's while x264 is restricted to HTPC's. They point out that many movie studios utilize the VC-1 codec for their retail BD-ROMs.\n\nThe changes in the 2008 ruleset were made because 1080p was getting more and more popular and the authors felt it was necessary to lower the 720p bitrate minimum as well to show x264 lovers WMV is equal quality. The video size wasn't determined by the length of the movie anymore, but by the minimum bitrate.\n\nIn the 2009 standards, a nuke section was added to govern the WMV-HD section. All nukes based on any other rules are unacceptable. Because all the groups releasing WMV-HD have agreed to and signed this rule set, they are the only ones who will develop, implement, and mandate the rules governing the WMV-HD section. The groups are IGUANA, NOVO, BamHD and INSECTS. SMeG was added too in later versions.\n\nA special section for animated/anime titles was added in version 3.5 of the rule set.\nVersion 4.0 of the rule set had a large ascii art added and was the first to have no minimum or maximum file size requirement for the final WMV file. WMV-HD was from then on purely quality driven by minimum bitrate.\nIn version 4.1 the rule set was added that the group who releases an episode of a show first has exclusive rights to do the entire season of that show for a period of thirty days. This means that during those 30 days no other group can release an episode of the same show and season without being nuked.\n\nThe source for a WMV release must be HD DVD or Blu-ray. The audio has to be encoded to WMA 10 Pro and the video codec must be Windows Media 9 Advanced Profile (VC-1). A 720p resolution dupes 1080p but 1080p does not dupe 720p. The WMV file must be in stored in RAR with a recovery record. Compression is not allowed.\n\nIn 2013, at least ten new movie releases were seen, all released by the group INSECTS. This category died out in favor of x264 MKV releases, a format that is ubiquitous for non pornographic ripped video in 2016.\n\nThe first ever scene TV-x264 release, \"The.Unit.S01E04.HD720p.x264-MiRAGETV\", was made by Spatula in early 2006. In May 2007, more than a year later, the first ruleset appeared. SAiNTS refused to sign this ruleset because it did not ban segmenting. According to them, this was the main reason for the \"crap\" releases in the HDTV scene. This first ruleset defined Matroska as the video container. A fixed file size for the resulting .mkv was used based on the shows length.\n\nThe 2011 standards first introduced CRF, instead of 2-pass based encoding. In April 2016, a total rewrite of the ruleset was released, addressing all known issues and patching loopholes.\nIn April 2012, QCF released the first 1080p x264 television ruleset shortly after one of their releases got nuked. \nThe ruleset was nuked afterwards by LocalNet for \"one.group.does.not.make.a.ruleset.make_try.inviting.some.others.to.contribute\". In December 2012, SYS agreed: \"One group doesn't decide.\"\nIn September 2013, DEADPOOL had the following to say about the rules:\nIn April 2014, BATV announced they are dropping the INTERNAL tag: \"one group doesn't get to decide how we all release 1080p TV.\" A day later, BATV released the first 1080p HDTV x265 encode using that same episode for comparison. BATV thinks that 1080p is completely and utterly pointless unless done by a decent group. DIMENSION indicated they won't be using certain channels for 1080p captures due to insufficient quality.\n\nIn 2016, a new standard was introduced for web-sourced files, covering standard and high definition video. Web based streaming and video on-demand services have increased in popularity. They were initially used for missed broadcasts, but it evolved into a legitimate logo-free exclusive source for original content.\n\nThe scene requires DVD-Video releases to fit on a 4.7 GB DVD-R. Hence many released movies are not 1:1 copies of the retail DVDs. The latest standards revision is TDRS2K10. This ruleset appeared only two months after the 2009 ruleset, which has an addendum released to clarify a rule because of some confusion. The 2010 ruleset seems to have more similarities with TDRS2K5 than with the previous TDRS2K9 ruleset. According to the first nuke, the signing groups are crap. This resulted in a nukewar. Few days later, an addendum was released.\nAccording to XeoN-VorTeX on October 31, 2002, a milestone in DVDR ripping was reached with the COMPLETE release of The Matrix. The DVD was generally regarded as the most complex DVD on the market. Only a movie only rip was available. The new rip included things such as the white rabbit.\n\nNowadays releases are in DVD5 or DVD9 size, have a menu available and are encoded with CCE.\n\nThe scene requires BD-R releases to fit on a 25 GB single-layer Blu-ray Disc. Hence not all released movies are 1:1 copies of the retail Blu-rays, although those releases exist and are tagged COMPLETE.BLURAY. \nThe current Music video Council standard is version 6.0. X264 must be used in an mkv container in combination with an MP2, MP3, AC3, or DTS audio track.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, the first XXX x264 SD standards were released. The movie file must not be split and an MP4 container must be used. The audio format is AAC. Xvid was used for standard definition rips the years before, just like DivX and SVCD, but did not have a ruleset. The groups Mirage and SMuT had their own list of rules they endorsed visible in their nfos. SMuT wrote: \"We endorse the following XXX rules and encourage other groups/sites/scene members to insist they are followed also.\"\n\nStandards for DVDR, paysite videos and imagesets have been released before.\n\nBoth MP3 and FLAC releases can optionally include M3U playlist files.\n\nAt the start of the MP3 scene in 1995, there was little organization or standardization. Between 1999-2004, the pre-dominantly used MP3 encoding quality was 192 kbit/s at 44.1 kHz, which was nominal for the hardware and software encoding available at the time. This improved as computers got faster and the LAME MP3 encoder developed into its later versions.\nDue to broad support in hardware devices, unauthorized audio material is usually released in MP3 files at VBR quality. In 2007, new rules put forth that it is recommended to encode all files with Lame 3.97, using the \"-V2 --vbr-new\" switch. Other formats such as AAC or Vorbis are currently not allowed.\n\nIn 2009, new rules were introduced. Homemade releases are forbidden. Every release needs an ID3 v1.1 AND ID3 v2 tag. Extra material that is available on the source material is allowed to be released. Flash storage mediums are allowed as sources to accommodate some retail releases made exclusively in those formats.\n\nThe early MP3 release groups, 1996-1997, were considered \"lamers\", bottom feeders. In 2000, the former leader of Rabid Neurosis, Al Capone, posted a letter to the scene on the RNS website, complaining how the mp3 scene became more like the warez scene during its first 4 years.\n\nOn October 2, 2011 the scene introduced a FLAC category by releasing a first ruleset. Eight days later an updated revision was released. According to the documents, the ruleset was created to satisfy the long lasting audiophile's demand for a music scene of higher quality than LAME mpeg compression encoding and because space and bandwidth were able to accommodate more. To avoid previously made mistakes in the music scene, a group of elder sceners gathered to decide upon the rules. A common understanding amongst all was that material from non-physical media can easily be of doubtful origin of source and hence of questionable quality. The rules consider only physical media as a valid source and they must be followed very strictly. A lot of releases are being nuked for various cosmetic flaws.\n\nEarly 2016, anonymous sceners voiced a concern that nukers lack technical understanding to nuke improperly ripped vinyl sources and showed examples of how the ruleset gets twisted or misinterpreted for minor issues. The release got nuked within the hour after pre by ZoNeNET with just \"invalid.proper\" as reason. In June later that year, 4 years after version 2.0, a new ruleset was made to address misinterpretations in the wording and to update some rules.\n\nIn response to version 3 of the rules, a scene notice called the rules invalid because it was not created by leading groups in the section or a council. It also pointed out that its block on WEB and PROMO releases causes a void due to the digital only distribution of many originals . The group CUSTODES mentioned in their farewell message that the FLAC ruleset isn't professional enough to archive music in the best quality possible.\n\nApplication releases are usually split in two different categories, 0-day and ISO apps. Categories originating from or still being put into 0-day are for example PDA, EBOOK or XXX-IMAGESET. 0-day (pronounced as zero day) refers to any copyrighted work that has been released the same day as the original product, or sometimes even before. \nIt is considered a mark of skill among warez distro groups to crack and distribute a program on the same day of its commercial release.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the scene for game releases that are changed to minimize the size of the distributed files. A first ten point document was made by \"The Faction\" in 1998. The grouping that created the rules that should be adhered to, and the rules themselves, were disbanded the following year. The NSA rules, or \"the new rules\", outlines the codes of conduct regarding game ripping. Releasing can be done in two fields: games and applications. It can also be done in two ways: it is possible to release disc images or groups can 'rip'. In the process of ripping, groups remove things such as introductory movies, multiple texture modes, big sound files and the like.\n\nThe game must fit on CDs or DVDs, and the format should be either BIN/CUE, or ISO, respectively. Some sites allow CCD images too, as defined in the site's rules. Media descriptor files (MDF/MDS) seem to be permitted now as well. A draft version of Standard ISO Rules (S.I.R.) 2010 was included in TGSC #43.\n\nDOX is an abbreviation of \"documents\" or \"documentation\" (manuals). This category includes video game add-ons such as No-CDs, cracked updates, keygens, covers, trainers or cheat codes. DOX releases are amongst the rarest releases in the scene. This is due to their small size. In October 2007, TNT (The Nova Team) noted in the nfo of their 750th release that only the groups DEViANCE and FAiRLiGHT managed to reach the same amount of DOX releases.\nThe console scene survived decades without rules. In 2009, a first set of rules for the PS2, Xbox 360 and the Wii was released. It's remarkable that a release must be pred no later than 30 days after retail date. Besides the 0-day standards, most other rulesets nowadays don't have such limitations. An example of a ruleset that did have such a limitation would be the deprecated TDX 2000 ruleset, but in the subsequent ruleset (TDX2k1) this limitation was removed. There are no written standards for the other console scenes. The first games released on a certain platform are often not playable because the console isn't cracked at the time.\n\nOn January 25, 1997, the first game released for the N64 was Super Mario 64 by the group \"Anthrox\" and the console division of \"Swat\". The games are released as one zipfile following the old traditional 8.3 naming convention. No folders were used. The ROM extensions \".v64\" and \".z64\" were used as naming conventions. Shortly before the closure of 64dd.net in January 2015, there were 883 releases numbered on the site. The last releases listed were done by the group Carrot in 2012.\n\nOn June 23, 2000, the first ripped Dreamcast game, Dead or Alive 2, was released by Utopia., this was a CDRWIN ISO image (bin/cue) like in the PC game ISO scene. The day before, Utopia released a Dreamcast BootCD that was capable of booting copies and imports on a non-chipped standard consumer model. Less than two months later, when Kalisto released the first self bootable game, Dynamite Cop, the game was a Padus DiscJuggler (CDI) image. Later that month, the first copy protected game, Ultimate Fighting Championship, was released by Kalisto. Almost all releases that followed were released as a CDI image and thus became the de facto standard. When Kalisto announced their retirement in the DC scene, they had released more than 66% of all Dreamcast releases. Two days later, a new group called Echelon picked up where Kalisto left off. This group released their 188th and last Dreamcast game release on April 30, 2002. On October 12, 2000, PARADOX, another big and respected scene group, released the first trainer for the Dreamcast. Two weeks after that, they released their first game, Shadowman, for the Dreamcast console with an intro \"just to prove that we can do neat DC releases as well\". Besides games and dox, also emulators and Linux distros were released in the DC scene.\n\nXbox releases are by convention in the XISO format, a slight modification of the DVD ISO format. DVDRips of Xbox games were released so they could fit on a single CD. A lot of the first Xbox games were released by the group ProjectX on May 3, 2002. These first releases worked on a developer Xbox, but if it would be playable on retail versions was unknown at the time because no modchips existed yet.\nThere are more than 4400 Xbox releases released in the scene.\n\nPlayStation 2 releases must be in standard DVD ISO format. PARADOX was the first group to do PS2 and PS2 DVD rips, but later on they were the ones motivating the scene to release full DVD ISOs.\n\nOn June 12, 2003, the first game for the Nintendo GameCube, , was released by \"STARCUBE\".\nAs of May 2016, there are more than 3100 NGC releases released in the scene.\n\nOn December 8, 2005, the first full game for the Xbox 360 was released in the scene by the warez group PI. was the first of a batch of three games released that day by PI. A couple of minutes before that, they released an open source tool to extract Xbox 360 dumps.\nAs of January 2017, there are more than 6700 Xbox 360 releases released in the scene.\n\nThe image of the Xbox 360 game is a .iso with a .dvd file. The rars are split to volumes of 50 MB for DVD5 disks or 100 MB for DVD9 disks and must use compression.\n\nOn November 25, 2006, PARADOX released the first PS3 ISO. The PS3 ISOs are now fully playable on a jailbroken PS3. As of January 2017, there were more than 4,800 PS3 releases in the scene.\n\nA first ruleset for the PlayStation 3 section was released on June 10, 2011.\nShortly afterwards it was voided in classic scene style: \"These rules dont mean shit you asshats.\" \nand the original rules were nuked for \"inadequate.and.unnecessary.ruleset_not.signed.by.all.listed.groups_see.Response.to.The.Official.PlayStation3.Ruleset.2011.PS3\". A new \"VOID\" ruleset was released the day after and was nuked for \"no.valid.rebuttal.given_not.all.grps.need.to.sign_follow.the.new.ruleset\". \nThe better response followed a couple of days later.\nWii releases must be in standard DVD ISO format. The rar archives must use compression. PARADOX released the first Wii image on December 12, 2006. The game was Red Steel.\n\nOn April 14, 2008, \"BlaZe\" was the first group to release a Virtual Console title. This emulated SNES finally had a proper dump after its fourth release more than a year later. These DLC releases are tagged \"VC\" or \"WiiWare\" and exist of a packed WAD file. A large amount of these first releases were nuked. The main nuke reason was \"modified.ticket.info\". Example:. \"Dupe\" or \"bad dump\" are other common reasons to receive a nuke. Another reason would be \"not trucha signed\" resulting not to be able to install.\n\nIn January 2017, more than 7800 releases for the Wii were released in the scene.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, the group VENOM released the first game for the Wii U: . The disk image is a .iso file in Wii U Optical Disc format (WUOD), Nintendo's proprietary disc format for the Wii U. Like other console scene firsts, the game isn't playable on the console yet. This first scene release was a few days after the Wii U was announced to be allegedly hacked by the mod chip developer WiiKey. Based on the file date of the RAR archives, VENOM had already created the ISO file more than a month before pre. This is the point in time when they first made the files available within the scene through their affiliated sites.\nLater, Venom's Release was found to be a bad dump, so the real first Wii U game dumped was by PoWeRUp, which has been confirmed as PROPER.\n\nOn November 19, 2013, a couple of days before the official console launch date, the group COMPLEX released the first game for the Xbox One: \"\". The release contained a 42GB .iso file without the security sectors. The file system format of the disk is XGD4 (Xbox Game Data 4).\n\nOn May 31, 2014, the group WaYsTeD brought the first PlayStation 4 game to the scene: \"Watch Dogs\". Just like with other console firsts, the 25GB .iso file isn't playable yet, hoping it will be hacked one day. It has the same file structure as the PlayStation 3 games. Within two months, some other groups started doing raw image dumps too. More than 3 years later on September 27, 2017, the group KOTF (Knights of the Fallen) released Grand Theft Auto V as the first playable decrypted game dump. Among the first releases were games such as Assassins Creed IV and Far Cry 4 with RAR volumes of 250MB and even 500MB sized parts. The extremely old firmware that was required to play these games was a major drawback.\n\nA handheld game console is a lightweight, portable electronic device with a built-in screen, game controls, speakers and replaceable and or rechargeable batteries or battery pack. Handheld game consoles are run on machines of small size allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place. Unlike video game consoles, the controls, screen and speakers are all part of a single unit.\n\nGame Boy Advance releases are in their native ROM format (.gba). However, like the 0day releases, due to their small size, these are often compressed into RAR files and then compressed into ZIP format; otherwise, they are simply compressed into ZIP format. See also GBA Scene and GBA Piracy on pocketheaven.com for more background and history.\n\nThe Nintendo DS scene started out as an extension of the Game Boy Advance scene, and carried forward with mostly the same set of rules. On May 31, 2010 a first ruleset was released with the goal of establishing a clear and concise listing of what should be expected of a valid Nintendo DS release. \"Having an official list to reference should prevent needless nuking, and clean up what is at present a cluttered and confused scene.\" 7 groups signed the rules. The day after, a second \"official\" ruleset was released but was nuked later on, although it is deemed to be the most relevant according to scenerules.irc.gs. Multiple of the 18 groups listed did not agree to sign the rules. A scene notice has been released by \"Concerned Retired NDS/GBA Scene Founding Members\" concerning the issue of the two rulesets.\n\nNintendo DS releases are in their native ROM format (.neo or .nds). The Scene has been doing .zip from the GBA days, but now the releases need to be compressed into 5 MB split RAR volumes and contain a Nintendo DS title or a patch for a Nintendo DS title. Also an NFO file is a must. A patch is some modification or tool like a trainer, crack, language selector or save fix. The most common formats are .BDF and .IPS. The directory name must include the text \"NDS\" and the group name. DSi related releases are regarded as NDS releases and must have the tag DSi.\n\nSee also DS Scene and DS Piracy on pocketheaven.com for more background and history.\n\nNintendo 3DS releases use the .3ds file format or the .cia file format. The group LEGACY (LGC) released the first three games on June 5, 2011. They included a picture of the dumper they used. The packaging is done with compressed RAR files and an SFV for verification. As of October 2017, there are more than 2400 3DS releases.\n\nSony PSP releases are by convention specified as FULL UMD or UMD RIP, meaning some parts were removed either out of non-necessity, or to fit it to a certain-sized memory stick. You can play an ISO with custom firmware or an emulator such as devhook. PARADOX released the first retail PSP game on May 4, 2005. In December 2006, the scene started releasing old PSX games that can be played with the official emulator on the PSP. These games are bought from the PlayStation Store with a PS3. Depending on the releasegroup, they are tagged \"PSXPSP\", \"PSX_PSP\", \"PSX.To.PSP\", \"PSX.FOR.PSP\" or \"PS1_For_PSP\". On May 19, 2006, PARADOX returned to the PSP scene to release a +9 trainer just to prove that trainers for Sony's handheld are possible. Since then, no other group or person has publicly released any trainers. See also PSP Scene and PSP Piracy on pocketheaven.com for more background and history.\nUnlike the games, there are standards for how to release movies for the PSP. All the releases must be in the MP4/THM format. Retail movies released for the PSP are tagged \"UMDMovie\". When the first UMDMovie was released in September 2005, there wasn't a way to play it yet. Because Sony killed the format, the UMDMovie releases came to a halt in May 2007. 3 years later the group ABSTRAKT released some more UMD Movies.\n\nThe first game release for the PlayStation Vita in the scene, \"\", was done by the group PSiCO on February 8, 2016. This was almost 4 years after the introduction of the PS Vita in Europe and North America. It was dumped from a PS Vita NVG game cartridge and the PFS encryption layer was removed since this data is not needed to become playable in the future. Releases are tagged with \"PSV\" in the directory name. There were already a handful of other PSV tagged releases before, but these contained covers.\n\nThe first releases were made to be used with the Cobra BlackFin dongle for the PlayStation Vita handheld, using the \".psv\" (BlackFin) format for its data dump. After the release of the Vitamin dumper in August 2016 following the HENkaku homebrew enabler, there weren't many new releases immediately after because of issues with this new tool. A couple of weeks later the first ruleset was signed by 4 groups. The best tool to make a copy of the game cartridge data at that moment was MaiDumpTool in combination with Vitamin 2.0 when needed. The file format used for these newer dumps is \".vpk\": a ZIP containing the decrypted files of the game folder.\n\nOther handheld platforms that had games released by the Scene include Neo Geo Pocket, Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, WonderSwan Color, Tapwave Zodiac, Gizmondo, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and N-Gage.\n\nThe first traceable scene release of an e-book can be dated back to around the year 2000. In 2008, sUppLeX wrote in one of their NFOs that \"ebooks do not really belong to 0day anymore, so we definitely need rules for that. Most countries got their own rules for the local ebook section in their country, but there's nothing similar for the whole world.\" sUppLeX were releasing their ebooks in RAR/SFV format at that time, but reverted two years later.\nStandards existed for the German and Polish ebook scenes. \nIn 2009, a new ruleset for German e-books was created, which closely matches general rules for English releases and which since has been adopted in most e-book releases. There was the option to choose between ZIP/DIZ or RAR/SFV to package a release.\n\nIn 2012, international ebook rules were created. It was a \"unified agreement\" applicable to all groups \"to ensure high quality ebook releases\". DRM-protection has to be removed prior to release and only the 0day ZIP/DIZ packaging can be used. Some examples showing naming conventions:\n\n\nAllowed file formats are PDF, EPUB, Kindle (.azw, .kf8) and Mobipocket (.prc, .mobi).\n\n"}

Though it covered a wide range of genre and subject matter, \"Wimmen's Comix\" focused more than other anthologies of the time on feminist concerns, homosexuality, sex and politics in general, and autobiographical comics. \"Wimmen's Comix\" #1 featured the first-ever comic strip featuring an \"out\" lesbian, Trina Robbins' \"Sandy Comes Out.\" \"Wimmen's Comix\" was a launching pad for many cartoonists' careers, and it inspired other small-press and self-published titles like \"Dyke Shorts\" and \"Dynamite Damsels\".\n\n\"Wimmen's Comix\" debuted a few years after the publication of the 1970 one-shot (also published by Last Gasp) \"It Ain't Me, Babe\", the first American comic book entirely produced by women, which was put together by Trina Robbins, the most prolific and influential of the women cartoonists in the underground scene. (\"It Ain't Me Babe\" was a feminist newspaper in Berkeley, California.) Many of the creators from the \"It Ain't Me Babe\" comic went on to contribute to \"Wimmen's Comix\".\n\nOriginally, the group behind \"Wimmen's Comix\" was not an official collective, but rather a few women artists who came together with a common interest to create at least one comic that women could get paid to be in, in a male-dominated comix culture. The first issue was edited by musician and artist Patricia Moodian. Later issues (17 total in 20 years) were edited by a different editor, or different editors who shared the job.\n\n\"Wimmen's Comix\" #1 featured Trina Robbins' \"Sandy Comes Out\", the first-ever comic strip featuring an \"out\" lesbian.\n\nIn 1975, regular contributors Aline Kominsky-Crumb and Diane Noomin left to start their own title, \"Twisted Sisters\". (Kominsky-Crumb has later claimed that a large part of her break with the \"Wimmen's Comix\" group was over feminist issues.) Many \"Wimmen's Comix\"' contributors, including Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Penny Van Horn, Carol Tyler, M.K. Brown, Diane Noomin, Phoebe Gloeckner, Carol Lay, Caryn Leschen, Leslie Sternbergh, Dori Seda, Mary Fleener, and Krystine Kryttre, subsequently appeared in \"Twisted Sisters: A Collection of Bad Girl Art\" (Viking Penguin) and \"Twisted Sisters: Drawing the Line\" (Kitchen Sink Press), both edited by Noomin.\n\nLast Gasp published issues #1-10, when the title moved to Renegade Press for issues #11–13. Rip Off Press published the final three issues, #14–16.\n\nIn 1992, for issue #17, the title of the comic was changed to \"Wimmin's Comix\" following a discussion over the gender politics of words containing \"man\" or \"men\" (see womyn). This, and other political conflicts, along with financial difficulties and the increasing availability of other venues for independent female cartoonists, led to the end of the series after that issue.\n\nEvery issue of \"Wimmen's Comix\" is reprinted in \"The Complete Wimmen's Comix\", a two-volume collection released in February 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4179702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4179702", "title": "Yelp", "text": "Yelp\n\nYelp is a local-search service powered by crowd-sourced review forum run by an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores. \n\nYelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Yelp has 77 million unique visitors via desktop computer and 64 million unique visitors via mobile website on a monthly average basis. By the end of 2017, Yelp has 148 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses' advertising.\n\nTwo former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004. Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor. The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding. MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name \"Yelp\". In an interview published in February 2013, Stoppelman explained why they decided on \"Yelp\" for the company's name, stating that \"it was short, memorable, easy to spell, and was familiar with 'the help' and 'yellow pages'\".\n\nAccording to \"Fortune Magazine\", Yelp's initial email-based system was \"convoluted\". The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family. Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the \"Real Reviews\" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited. According to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"the site's popularity soared\" after it was re-designed in late 2005. Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital. The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006. By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors. It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008. In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion. Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews. By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.\n\nYelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009 and one for Canada that August. The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English. From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period. An Australian website went live in November 2011. It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings, and was initially glitchy. Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey and Denmark. Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore, which was followed by Japan in 2014.\n\nIn December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company, but the two parties failed to reach an agreement. According to \"The New York Times\", Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion. Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers. In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.\n\nYelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011, but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation. That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp. In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.\n\nHaving filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011, Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million. In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million. The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1. Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013. Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million \"exceeded expectations\", but the company was not yet profitable.\n\nIn 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.\n\nThe company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm. It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility. Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina. Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.\n\nIn early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million. Then in August 2017, Yelp sold Eat24 to Grubhub for $287.5 million. The acquisition resulted in a partnership to integrate Grubhub delivery into the Yelp profiles of restaurants.\n\nIn late 2015, a \"Public Services & Government\" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages. For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages. Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections. Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.\n\nOn November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.\n\nIn April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million. In May, 2017 Yelp's stocks dropped by 30% following disappointing sales.\n\nYelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site. Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas. The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services using a one to five star rating system. Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals. In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives. According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is \"one of the most important sites on the Internet.\" As of Q4 2017 it has 141 million monthly unique visitors and 148 million reviews.\n\n78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better, but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Users can give a review a \"thumbs-up\" if it is \"useful, funny or cool.\" Each day a \"Review of the Day\" is determined based on a vote by users.\n\nAs of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device. The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008. In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera. Check-in features were added in 2010.\n\nYelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010. Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable, but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015. SeatMe was reworked into the current \"Yelp Reservations\" feature. In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores and make appointments at spas. Yelp's content was integrated into Siri and the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6. Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.\n\nIn March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp. In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.\n\nYelp started a 7-10% cash back program at some US restaurants in 2016 through partnership with Empyr.\n\nOn February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses. It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.\n\nYelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008. Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations. The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs. A business owner can \"claim\" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports. Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the \"check in\" feature. In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device. Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.\n\nYelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses. Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors. As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year. Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising. Originally a sponsored \"favorite review\" could place a positive review above negative ones, but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.\n\nA Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each \"star\" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent. A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours. A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.\n\nAccording to \"BusinessWeek\", Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses. Criticism of Yelp continues to focus on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.\n\nAs Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent. A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014. Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.\n\nYelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use. The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their \"first obviously fake reviews.\" Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating. The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has \"the most aggressive\" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into. Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works, which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.\n\nYelp also conducts \"sting operations\" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews. In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day \"consumer alert\" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read \"We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business\". In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay. In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp. An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014. In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations. In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.\n\nAccording to \"BusinessWeek\", Yelp has \"always had a complicated relationship with small businesses.\" Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs. Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising. Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising. Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.\n\nIn August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.\n\nJournalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.\n\nIn 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled \"Billion Dollar Bully\" about Yelp's alleged business practices.\n\nIn 2018, in the case \"Hassell v. Bird\", the California Supreme Court held by a narrow 4-3 margin that a business cannot force Yelp to remove a review, even if the review is defamatory of the business.\n\nAccording to \"Inc. Magazine\" most reviewers (sometimes called \"Yelpers\") are \"well-intentioned\" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or to be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike. Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location, or by praise and attention from other users. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these. Users can give a review a \"thumbs-up\" if it is \"useful, funny or cool.\" Each day a \"Review of the Day\" is determined based on a vote by users. According to \"The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews\" many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or \"suburban baby boomers\".\n\nReviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos. Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the \"Yelp Elite Squad\" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of the quality and frequency of their reviews. Members may nominate other reviewers for elite status. Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad. To accept a nomination, members must not own a business. Yelpers are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected. Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member. The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005, and in 2006 it was formally codified; the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the \"Yelp Elite Squad.\" Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks. As of 2017, there are over 80 local Elite Squads in North America.\n\nYelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews. In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws. In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using \"disparagement clauses\" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.\n\nAs of 2017, Yelp employed a staff of over 80 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners. Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.\n\n\n"}
