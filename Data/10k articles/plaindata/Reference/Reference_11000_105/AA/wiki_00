McCaffery wrote that he saw his list \"as a means of sharing with readers my own views about what books are going to be read 100 or 1000 years from now\". The list includes many books not included in the Modern Library list, including five of his top ten, Thomas Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\", Robert Coover's \"The Public Burning\", Samuel Beckett’s \"Trilogy\" (\"Molloy\", \"Malone Dies\" and \"The Unnamable\"), Gertrude Stein’s \"The Making of Americans\", and William S. Burrough's \"The Nova Trilogy\". \n\nTopping the list is Vladimir Nabokov's 1962 novel \"Pale Fire\", which McCaffery called the \"most audaciously conceived novel of the century.\" Not counting the tetralogies of Rikki Ducornet (#35) and Gene Wolfe (#78), the most cited author is James Joyce, whose four works, \"Ulysses\" (#2), \"Finnegans Wake\" (#10), \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (#21), and \"Dubliners\" (#63), all made the list. Robert Coover and William H. Gass each have three works on the list, while Samuel Delany, Don DeLillo, William Faulkner, Raymond Federman, William Gaddis, Vladimir Nabokov, and William Vollmann have two apiece.\n\nAltogether, there are 34 titles in common between the Modern Library list and the Greatest Hits list:\n\nIronweed was included in a single entry with its predecessors in the Albany Trilogy, rather than as a solo work as it was on the Modern Library list.\n\n\n"}

It requires writing the names of the Seven Sleepers onto seven wafers, then singing an alliterative verse three times. The verse is written in half lines and was used for its assumed curative properties, although what the charm is supposed to be curing is still a matter of debate.\n\nSome scholars believe that the charm was supposed to help victims sleep more easily if they were suffering from a disease that caused convulsions. \n\nAnother theory is that the dwarf, a being from Anglo-Saxon mythology, might originally have been a night demon of some kind. The night demon, according to this theory, could possibly have been the personification of the illness.\n\nMost theories that speculate that the dwarf represents some kind of disease usually think that the disease is related to sleeping because of the inclusion of the Seven Sleepers in the charm. According to one source, \"The names of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus occur in various charms of the Middle Ages. They are usually, to secure sleep, but in some cases are to be employed against fever\".\n\nMatthew Lewis also believes that the charm is related to helping someone who is having trouble sleeping, and he believes that knowing the origin of the word nightmare is key to understanding the charm. Although the etymology of nightmare is somewhat disputed, the word can possibly be translated as meaning \"night monster.\" According to Lewis, the dwarf in this charm is a manifestation of a night monster, as dwarfs were linked to the idea of evil spirits and thought to be capable of causing physical harm.\n\n"}

The mosque is rectangular in shape, and its minaret rises .\n\nAccording to Muslim tradition, the mosque is situated upon the site where Jacob wept after being shown Joseph's blood-soaked tunic which suggested that he had been mauled and killed; on the right of the courtyard is a small room said to be the place where Jacob sat down and wept. Hence the mosque's alternative name \"Sadness of our Lord Jacob\". According to Samaritan tradition, al-Khadra Mosque had been a synagogue destroyed by the Crusaders. They claim that its Arabic name \"al-Khadra\" (\"the Green\") derived from the Samaritan \"Mahallat Khadra\" (\"the place of the Green\"). Archaeologist Michael Avi-Yonah identified the Khadra Mosque with the synagogue built by the Samaritan high priest Akbon in 362 CE.\n\nThe synagogue was rebuilt in 1137 by Ab Giluga, a Samaritan from Acre. Several Western scholars, however, believe, because of examples of Gothic architecture in portions of the present-day mosque, that in the 1170s, there stood a Crusader church and bell tower. Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi records in 1225, while Nablus was under Ayyubid rule, the buildings was restored to become a Samaritan synagogue, which he referred to as \"a large mosque\" which the Samaritans venerated. It is probably from this era that the Samaritan inscriptions on a minaret wall were made.\n\nIn 1242, however, the Knights Templars damaged the building, which was later destroyed in 1260 by the Mongols. It was transformed as a mosque in 1290 by the Mamluks during the reign of Sultan Qalawun as attested to by a foundation inscription. Most of the structure resembles Mamluk architecture and a \"mihrab\" was added to the mosque.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian government and Gush Shalom, during the Second Intifada in the Battle of Nablus in 2002, Israeli bulldozers destroyed 85% of the mosque, including the Mamluk-era \"mihrab\". The current imam of al-Khadra Mosque, Maher Kharaz (the 'White Lion'), was removed from his position in a Palestinian Authority 'crack down' on militant imams in 1996, but was reinstated in 2006. Kharaz, a Hamas member and opponent of Fatah, regularly defied the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority during his weekly Friday sermons. Kharaz was arrested on September 23, 2007 in another Fatah-led 'crack down' on Hamas.\n\n"}

In 1966 the Albanian Communist Party issued a decree aimed to wipe out \"traces of the non-Albanian population\" in places where significant Slavic minorities still lived. In 1968 one of the demands of Albanian nationalistic demonstration on Kosovo was to remove Serbian Orthodox name Metohija from the name of the province. In 1975 the Albanian Communist Party issued a decree on the Albanization of all place-names and personal names which ordered citizens to give \"modern revolutionary (Illyrian) names\" to their children, while non-Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations all over the country were Albanized to better suit the \"state ideology\".\n\nAfter the Kosovo War and the entrance of the NATO forces to Kosovo in June 1999 a sweeping Albanization of place-names, organizations, street-names and business took place. In 2005 a special envoy of UN Secretary-General, issued a report submitted to the UN Security Council inviting the Kosovo Albanian leaders to react and bring a halt to the attempts to rewrite the history through \"albanization\". The politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms.\n\nWhen the region of Malësi e Madhe became territory of newly established Albania after the Balkan Wars, most of Serbian language toponyms were Albanized. Nevetheless, in 1924 Edit Durham reported that Serbian toponyms still existed scattered across Malësi e Madhe.\n\nSoon after the Second World War substantial Greek population in the southern Albania and other people of non-Albanian ethnicity were required to Albanize their names. The Central Committee of the Albanian Communist Party issued two decrees which Albanized place-names and personal names. The first decree was issued in 1966 aimed to wipe out \"traces of the non-Albanian population\" in places where significant Slavic minorities still lived. The 1966 Albanisation of names included personal names of ethnic Macedonians and names of the villages where they lived in compact communities. A Decree on the Albanization of all place-names and personal names was also issued at 7th congress of the Communist Party held in period 26—29 May 1975. The decree referred to all names which are not aligned with ideological and political guideline of the Communist Party. This decree ordered citizens to give \"modern revolutionary (Illyrian) names\" to their children. \n\nTzachristos argues that Christian names were overwhelmingly affected while on the other hand, the use of several Muslim names was allowed in spite their religious connotations. However, French anthropologist Gilles de Rapper states that according to some observations the religious names survived better among Christians than among Muslims. Under the same decree geographical name changes occurred all over the country in cases of non-Albanian toponyms or ones that had religious connotations. As a result, names of 13 settlements in Korçë and 6 in Sarandë regions were changed in order to be in agreement with the \"state ideology\". Moreover, the names of Greek and Roman archaeological sites were changed to \"Illyrian\".\n\nA ban of religious names had deleterious consequences on people of Greek ethnicity who traditionally give religious names to their children. \n\nIn case of substantial Serb community in northern Albania (Skadar), their family names had been Albanized during dictatorship of Enver Hoxha.\n\nThe desire of the Greek minority's representatives to be able to use bilingual signposts and signs within municipalities is based on their need for recognition of Greek culture and, more importantly, a fear of its erosion. The December 2007 lawsuit against Omonoia President Vasil Bolano for replacing signs in Albanian with signs in Greek illustrates the issues surrounding toponymy and its symbolic meaning. The situation was the exact counterpoint to the measures of Albanisation of toponyms operated by the communist regime.\n\nThe politicians in contemporary Albania continued to support the politics of Albanization, particularly Albanization of Slavic toponyms. In 2009 Albanian president Bamir Topi and Prime Minister Sali Berisha proposed establishment of the commission for Albanization of Slavic toponomy. Berisha actually supports Albanization of not only Slavic toponyms but all placenames in Albania. In spite of his proposal, there are no similarly strong attempts to Albanize Latin, Turkish or Greek place names for the time being.\n\nDuring the widespread demonstrations in Priština and several other towns on Kosovo in 1968, the Albanian nationalists demanded a change of name of the Serbia's province \"Kosovo and Metohija\" to \"Kosovo\". They considered an Orthodox name of Metohija as provocative. Their demands were met and less than a month after demonstrations Yugoslav Federal Parliament removed Serbian name Metohija from the official name of the province.\n\nAfter the Kosovo War and entrance of the NATO forces to Kosovo in June 1999 a sweeping Albanization of place-names, organizations, street-names and business took place. In some cases newly forged placenames (i.e. Burim, Besiana or Theranda) are not accepted instead of traditional names.\n\nIn 2003 UN Secretary-General reported that names of many non-Albanians were \"Albanized\" in official documents which include their identity cards. In the same report it is indicated that after becoming award of this activities in some cases UNMIK reissued documents with correct spelling of the name. The Minister for Kosovo in the Government of Serbia informed EULEX that the practice of Albanization of names of Serbs is unacceptable. \n\nIn 2005 Kai Eide, a special envoy of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, issued a report which was later submitted to the UN Security Council. In this report the Kosovo Albanian leaders are invited to react and bring a halt to the attempts to rewrite the history through \"albanization\". \n\nAssembly of Kosovo adopted a Law on the Use of Languages which stipulated that non-Albanians have the right to receive all information, documents and other services in any of the Kosovo’s official languages. It was reported by UNHCR that Kosovo’s public companies do not respect this law when it comes to their non-Albanian customers, particularly Serbs, whose names are changed to Albanized versions with \"ç\". There is a common practice reported by Ombusdperson institution in 2008 which has serious long-term consequences when municipalities don't respect names in the Serbian, Bosniak and Turkish languages of newborn babies when they are recorded in the registry books.\n\nDuring Second World War western part of Macedonia was annexed into fascist Albania. All Macedonian schools were replaced with Albanian while names and surnames of non-Albanian people had to take an Albanian form.\n\nThere are attempts to restore traditional names in south-east Albania. In April 2013 Albanian parliament decided to reverse an order from 1973 by which toponyms in several municipalities near Macedonian border were Albanized. Local authorities in Pustec voted to restore pre-1973 Slavic toponyms.\n\n"}

{"id": "16759434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16759434", "title": "Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions", "text": "Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions\n\nBetween December 1911 and January 1912, both Roald Amundsen (leading his South Pole expedition) and Robert Falcon Scott (leading the Terra Nova Expedition) reached the South Pole within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the geographic south pole first and subsequently return to their base camp at Framheim without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.\n\nThe outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.\n\nHistorically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed, including:\n\nSullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive. he states \"Man is a poor beast of burden, as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.\"\n\nScott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective (\"The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition\" – Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole (\"The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object\" – Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, Henry Robertson Bowers, and Edward Adrian Wilson in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to Cherry-Garrard.\n\nAmundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909. Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under Kristian Prestrud who conducted an expedition to King Edward VII Land while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.\n\nAmundsen camped on the Ross Ice Shelf at the Bay of Whales which is 60 miles (96 km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350 miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.\nScott's base was at Cape Evans on Ross Island, with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.\nConsequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.\n\nThe major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport —dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three \"motor sledges\". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander Reginald William Skelton who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant E.R.G.R. \"Teddy\" Evans as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition. Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost. One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.\n\nScott had used dogs on his first (Discovery) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.\n\nScott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his Nimrod expedition that got to within of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the Beardmore Glacier (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, Lawrence Oates, whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.\n\nThere was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of William Speirs Bruce in his Arctic, Antarctic, and Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, Amundsen in the \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition, Fridtjof Nansen's crossing of Greenland, Robert Peary's three attempts at the North Pole, Eivind Astrup's work supporting Peary, Frederick Cook's discredited North Pole expedition, and Otto Sverdrup's explorations of Ellesmere Island. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take \"dogs, dogs and more dogs\".\n\nAt the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport. Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives. He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.' On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'. But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed \"reluctance\" to use dogs in this way: \"One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions.\"\n\nAmundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach. Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves. He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse. Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they \"also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal\". The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.\n\nAmundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the Inuit while on his \"Gjøa\" North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.\n\nWhat Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food. Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle. The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility. Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.\n\nScott took the Norwegian pilot and skier Tryggve Gran to the Antarctic on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18 km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.\n\nScott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that \"Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event\".\n\nAmundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, Olav Bjaaland, as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the South Pole.\n\nScott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. Simpson, Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records. The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were short of One-Ton Depot, which was from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team. Scott also blamed \"a prolonged blizzard\". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a \"normal\" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.\n\nDuring depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn. In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.\n\nScott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.)\n\nApsley Cherry-Garrard in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.\n\nScott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., Wilson's trip with Cherry-Garrard and Bowers to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.\n\nSince the rations contained no B and C vitamins, the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs. This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of scurvy.\n\nScott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.\n\nDehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.\n\nIt has been said (by the present-day explorer Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.\n\nAmundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.\n\nScott's team suffered regularly from snow blindness and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time. By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the \"day\" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the \"night\" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.\n\nIn 1921, 'Teddy' Evans wrote in his book \"South with Scott\" that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.\n\nHe did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.\n\nHe continued his instructions in the next paragraph \"You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised.\" with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.\n\nExpedition member Apsley Cherry-Garrard did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book \"The Worst Journey in the World\". However, in the 1948 preface to his book, he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and Edward Atkinson reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January. Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler Cecil Meares had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote \"In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February\".\n\nOn 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at Hut Point when, on 19 February, Tom Crean arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt Edward Evans was lying seriously ill in a tent some to the south, and in urgent need of rescue. Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.\n\nAtkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected Apsley Cherry-Garrard. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to \"use his judgement\" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.\n\nOn the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes \"We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.\" By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: \"The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble.\"\n\nAround 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing \"We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.\" (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.)\n\n"}
{"id": "2842614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2842614", "title": "Direct–inverse language", "text": "Direct–inverse language\n\nThe definition of a direct–inverse language is a matter under research, but it is widely understood to involve different grammar for transitive predications according to the relative positions of their \"subject\" and their \"object\" on a \"person hierarchy\", which, in turn, is some combination of saliency and animacy specific to a given language. The direct construction is the unmarked one. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in the person hierarchy, and the inverse is used when the object outranks the subject. The existence of direct–inverse morphosyntax is usually accompanied by proximate–obviative morphosyntax. The direct–inverse dimension subsumes the proximate–obviative dimension. Across languages, obviation almost always involves the third person (although second-person obviation is reported for some Nilo-Saharan languages), and the direct–inverse alternation is usually presented as being a way of marking the proximate–obviative distinction between two (or more) third person arguments of a sentence. However, there are at least two languages with inverse systems, the Mesoamerican languages Zoque and Huastec, in which inverse morphosyntax is never used when both subject and object are third person, but only when one of these arguments is third person and the other is a speech act participant (SAP), the first or second person .\n\nNeither a morphological feature nor a syntactic feature is common to all inverse systems.\n\nDirect-inverse systems on verbs coexist with the various morphosyntactic alignments in nouns. In some inverse languages, including all Mesoamerican inverse languages, the direct-inverse alternation changes the morphosyntactic alignment, and the language is said to have \"hierarchical alignment\".\n\nKlaiman has suggested four common properties of inverse languages:\n\nSome languages that comply with Klaiman's definition of an inverse language are Maasai, Carib, Wastek, Chukchee, the Algonquian languages and some Athapaskan languages like Koyukon and Navajo, Mapudungun and Movima (language isolates), rGyalrong (Sino-Tibetan) and some Mixe–Zoquean languages. On the other hand, the Mixean language Oluteco has been reported to have an inverse system which does not conform to the second rule, as certain intransitive verbs and passives of ditransitives also can take inverse morphology.\n\nIn Ojibwe, an Algonquian language of North America, the person hierarchy is second person > first person > third person proximate > third person obviative. Since the morphology of Ojibwe has no case distinctions (an Ojibwe nominal phrase does not change when its relations to the other sentence constituents change), the only way to distinguish subject from object in a transitive verb with two participants is through direct–inverse suffixes. A direct suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone higher on the person hierarchy on someone lower on the person hierarchy:\n\nAn inverse suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone lower on the person hierarchy on someone higher on the person hierarchy (such as by the speaker on the addressee or an obviative third person on a proximate):\n\nAs can be seen, the only difference between these two verbs is the direct–inverse opposition, rather than case markers (or word order, when distinct nominals are used). An inverse verb is not equivalent to a passive verb. There is a separate passivity marker, denoted in literature as \"indefinite person (X)\", ranked in topicality hierarchy below first and second persons, but higher than animate and inanimate third persons:\n\nSahaptin, an Amerindian language of the northwestern United States, has an inverse marked by the verbal prefix \"pá\"-. It indicates transitive action from the second to the third person when both arguments are SAPs. That can be called the semantic inverse.\n\nSahaptin \"pá\"- does not occur with transitive action between SAPs and the third person, but it does occur between third-person participants. The contrast can be elicited with multiple clause examples such as given below. In the inverse the semantic patient is coreferential with the subject in the preceding clause. That can be called a pragmatic inverse.\n\nThe pragmatic inverse topicalizes the patient, but its nominal, if present, retains its accusative case-marking.\n\n\n\n"}

Sutherland Black, is a critical encyclopedia of the Bible. In theology and biblical studies, it is often referenced as \"Enc. Bib.\", or as \"Cheyne and Black\".\n\nIt has an article for every single name and place both in the Bible and in its traditional Apocrypha, as well as for each of the books of these, together with many improper nouns appearing in these (such as \"nebi'im\", 'mole', 'owl') and other more general subjects (such as 'music', 'tents', etc.). Many of these articles are given in great detail, and usually include mention of the various spellings for each word as used by the Masoretic Text, Septuagint (differentiating between each of the most important ancient manuscripts), and by other ancient versions; the largest article is that on the Gospels, which is over 5 MB in size, despite being almost completely plain text (and therefore over half a million words long). It is thus an extremely large work – in PDF form it constitutes a total of about 190 MB of mostly plain text (this would equate to nearly 20 million words, even at 10 characters per word).\n\nIt is frequently referenced by other respected Bible-related encyclopedias of the period, such as the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", and 11th Edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" for example. The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" has some articles ('marriage' for example) which quote large sections from it nearly verbatim. It is also referenced by works such as the \"International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\". It is hence, indirectly, also a source for some articles of the English Wikipedia, mainly related to the Judaeo-Christian religion.\n\nA measure of its importance of some of the contributors is gained from the fact that the Jewish Encyclopedia dedicates the majority of the article 'Jerahmeel' to discussing Cheyne's theory of the Jerahmeelites, despite regarding it as arbitrary.\n\nThe articles are still of value and interest to modern scholars, Islamic writers, as well as to religio-political commentators such as Jihad Watch; however, modern archaeological research and discoveries have made portions of it obsolete, and modern interpretations are of even older material is likely to be very different. For example, the Jerahmeelite/Arabian theory (see below) has long been ignored. It is no longer restricted by copyright and has become available online (, for example).\n\nThe authors of the articles include many of the most respected biblical scholars at the time it was written. Several held senior professorships at important universities and many held the highest academic qualification – the Doctor of Divinity. The contributors were:\n\nProfessor Cheyne put forth a surprising theory concerning the Jerahmeelites. In his view they were a powerful north-Arabian tribe, with which the Hebrews came into conflict on their first approach to the land. A part of the Jerahmeelites was absorbed by the Hebrews, but there were many contests between the Israelites and the main body of the Jerahmeelites all through the period of the Kings. Even among the post-exilic opponents of Nehemiah, the Jerahmeelites appear again. Cheyne believes that echoes of these conflicts once reverberated throughout the Old Testament, but that, owing to the corruption of the Masoretic Text, they must now be reawakened by conjectural emendation of the text.\n\nCarrying out this idea, Cheyne finds the chief elements of Israel's origin, religion, and history in Jerahmeel. Babylonia and Assyria sink into insignificance beside Jerahmeel in so far as influence on the Old Testament is concerned. \"Amalekites\" is a corruption of \"Jerahmeelites\"; \"Beer-lahai-roi\" (Gen. xvi. 14) is a corruption of \"Well of Jerahmeel\"; \"Ephraim\" is often a corruption of \"Jerahmeel.\" The epithet of Jericho, \"city of palm-trees,\" is a corruption of \"city of Jerahmeel\"; the names of Saul, of Kish, his father, and of most of the sons of Saul are held to be corruptions of \"Jerahmeel\"; and Isaiah's \"Maher-shalal-hash-baz\" is held to be a corruption of \"Jerahmeel will be deserted.\" \"Jerahmeel\" has been displaced by \"Babylon\" in Isa. xiii. and xiv.; and Ezekiel's three wise men were \"Enoch, Jerahmeel, and Arab.\" This list might be continued indefinitely.\n\nBy the same principle, he derives other names from \"Rehoboth\", \"Zarephath\", \"Mizraim\", and \"Arab\"; he does not equate \"Mizraim\" with Egypt (the usual interpretation). The vast majority of names of places and people in the bible are connected by Cheyne to Jerahmeel, or one of these.\n\nThe ingenuity of Cheyne's method may be admitted; but the thesis must be rejected as altogether arbitrary. That it has received serious attention is owing solely to the great service rendered by its sponsor in other departments of Old Testament research.\n\nCheyne frequently mentions this theory in his Encyclopaedia articles, often appending his view to articles written by people with more mainstream interpretations. He does, however, detail the alternative (and therefore mainstream) views, while doing so. Hence the articles are respected, as long as Cheyne's theory about these names is ignored.\n\n\n"}

The first letter to the Thessalonians was likely the first of Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52.\n\nMost New Testament scholars believe Paul the Apostle wrote this letter from Corinth, although information appended to this work in many early manuscripts (e.g., Codices Alexandrinus, Mosquensis, and Angelicus) state that Paul wrote it in Athens after Timothy had returned from Macedonia with news of the state of the church in Thessalonica (; ). For the most part, the letter is personal in nature, with only the final two chapters spent addressing issues of doctrine, almost as an aside. Paul's main purpose in writing is to encourage and reassure the Christians there. Paul urges them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the return of Christ.\n\nUnlike all subsequent Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on justification by faith or questions of Jewish–Gentile relations, themes that are covered in all other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul's positions on these matters were formed and elucidated.\n\nThe majority of New Testament scholars hold 1 Thessalonians to be authentic, although a number of scholars in the mid-19th century contested its authenticity, most notably Clement Schrader and F.C. Baur. 1 Thessalonians matches other accepted Pauline letters, both in style and in content, and its authorship is also affirmed by 2 Thessalonians.\n\n\nIt is also sometimes suggested that 1 Thes. 5:1–11 is a post-Pauline insertion that has many features of Lukan language and theology that serves as an apologetic correction to Paul's imminent expectation of the Second Coming in 1 Thes. 4:13–18.\n\nOther scholars, such as Schmithals, Eckhart, Demke and Munro, have developed complicated theories involving redaction and interpolation in 1 and 2 Thessalonians.\n\nPaul claimed the title of the \"Apostle to the Gentiles\", and established gentile churches in several important cities in the Roman Empire.\n\nAccording to Bart D. Ehrman, the Acts of the Apostles tells a different story of Paul's career, but in this case it reports that, while there were \"some\" Jews converted during Paul's initial preaching in Thessalonica, the gentiles who were converted were \"a large number\" and the Jews as a body fiercely opposed Paul's work there.\n\n\nPaul, speaking for himself, Silas, and Timothy, gives thanks for the news about their faith and love; he reminds them of the kind of life he had lived while he was with them. Paul stresses how honorably he conducted himself, reminding them that he had worked to earn his keep, taking great pains not to burden anyone. He did this, he says, even though he could have used his status as an apostle to impose upon them.\n\nPaul goes on to explain that the dead will be resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord in the air.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1365508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1365508", "title": "Gesta Stephani", "text": "Gesta Stephani\n\nDeeds of King Stephen or Acts of Stephen or Gesta Regis Stephani is a mid-12th-century English history by an anonymous author about King Stephen of England and his struggles with his cousin, Empress Matilda, also known as the \"Empress Maud\". It is one of the main sources for this period in the history of England.\n\nSome historians think the author may have been Robert of Bath (also known as Robert of Lewes), Bishop of Bath from 1136 to 1166.\n\nThe \"Gesta Stephani\" was first published in Paris in 1619, from a manuscript in the episcopal library at Laon which was subsequently lost. A fuller manuscript has recently been found, and since published, in the Municipal Library at Valenciennes, having been transferred from the nearby abbey of Vicoigne. The Latin text tells in 120 chapters of the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign, and ends with the accession of King Henry II.\n\nThe \"Gesta Stephani\" was written in two books and historian R.H.C. Davis believes that the first twelve years of Stephen's reign—which comprise book I—were written in about 1148, while the subsequent account, taken up to the accession of Henry II, was written after 1153. Davis examined the places named in the texts and found that most of them were in the South-West of England; unusually detailed descriptions of Bristol and Bath, as well as scornful comments about the former, suggest that the author may have been writing in or near Bath. This contrasts with an earlier statement by K.R. Potter that there is \"no clear indication of any local attachment\". However, Davis points out that comparisons with the chronicles of other writers based elsewhere in the country reveal considerable south-west bias in the \"Gesta\", which had been overlooked by historians who compared it only with the account of William of Malmesbury, who was also writing in the south-west.\n\nThe authorship of the \"Gesta \"is not known. According to Richard Howlett, writing in 1886, the author was not from a monastery, and Davis agreed with this in his analysis of the author, because, while he does show a local bias, his knowledge of Exeter, London, Pevensey and Bedford all show that he was a man who travelled. Nonetheless, he was not an itinerant, and his writing reveals little knowledge of the north or East of England or the leading baronial families in those parts of the kingdom, while he placed too much emphasis on the exploits of relatively minor barons associated with the south west, including the de Tracy family. The writer appears to have been a scholar, and his work omits dates and extraneous detail for the sake of literary effect, while employing classical terms to offices and positions rather than their Mediaeval Latin equivalents. Scholars agree that he was a supporter of Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester. However, historians differ over their exact relationship: Howlett suggested the author was Henry's chaplain, but Davis believes that the criticism he gave to Henry in the \"Gesta\" makes this unlikely. Davis instead suggests that he was a bishop, based on his style of writing, his perspectives on the events he writes about and the places he visited; he goes further to speculate that it may have been Robert of Lewes, Bishop of Bath, who was the author. Robert Bartlett states that he was \"perhaps\" the author and Hushcroft writes that it was written either by him \"or someone close to him\".\n\nTwo manuscripts of the \"Gesta Stephani\" have been known to scholars, but one is now lost. The first, housed in the episcopal library at Laon, was printed in the seventeenth century, but subsequently disappeared. It stopped at 1147, was damaged, with some pages illegible, and included gaps in the text. The second manuscript was discovered in the Municipal Library at Valenciennes and was originally from the Abbey of Vicoigne; it includes all of the original manuscript's content, but carries on the work until the end of Stephen's reign and is legible where the original one was damaged. It contains the same four gaps as the first but, where pages appear to be missing in the first, the second manuscript includes gaps in the text, which leads R.A.B. Mynors to suggest that second was copied from the first.\n\nA manuscript of the \"Gesta Stephani\" was discovered in the libraries of the bishop of Laon in the early seventeenth century, and was first printed in 1619 at Paris by the French historian André Duchesne (1584–1640) in \"Historia Normannorum Scriptores Antiqui\". It was incomplete at that time, and was lost after Duchesne's death. This text was reprinted in England by R.C. Sewell (1803–1864) in 1846 and by Richard Howlett (1841–1917) in 1886; the latter has been praised for its improvements to Duchesne's version and its useful preface. There have been two translations of the work into English, the first being by Thomas Forester in \"Henry of Huntingdon\" in 1853 and then second by Joseph Stevenson (1806–1895) in \"The Church Historians of England\" in 1858.\n\nAnother manuscript was discovered in the Municipal Library, Valenciennes, by Professor R.A.B. Mynors (1903–1989), who found it included with a version of the \"Gesta Regum\" by William of Malmesbury, catalogued in the library as MS 792. This new text continued the history of Stephen's reign up to 1154 and filled in the damaged passages which Duchesne was unable to transcribe. In 1955, this version was translated by K.R. Potter and published by Nelson's Mediaeval Texts, with an essay assessing it written by Dr A.L. Poole (1889–1963). It was reprinted in 1976 by Oxford University Press and included a new introduction by R.H.C. Davis (1918–1991), with contributions by Mynors.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Harrison into the conditions of the displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe.\n\nHarrison's report was part of the impetus for the creation of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry regarding Mandatory Palestine, then under a British mandate, which was formed to recommend policies for dealing with both Jewish war refugees and the problems of Palestine.\n\nFollowing the completion of the report, Truman sent a copy to British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, with respect to Britain’s responsibility for Palestine. Truman wrote \"On the basis of this and other information which has come to me I concur in the belief that no other single matter is so important for those who have known the horrors of concentration camps for over a decade as is the future of immigration possibilities into Palestine.\" \n\nThe British responded negatively to the report; they blamed Zionist pressure for the report's conclusion regarding Palestine, and suggested that the United States should also take a share of the refugees. Attlee wanted the report kept confidential, but his request was ignored.\n\nPresident Roosevelt appointed Harrison as the U.S. representative on the Intergovernmental Commission on Refugees on March 15, 1945.\n\nOn June 18, the Jewish Agency in Mandatory Palestine sent a detailed and strongly worded memo to the British authorities requesting 100,000 immigration permits for Jewish displaced persons (DPs) in Europe.\n\nOn June 22, two months after Roosevelt’s death, President Truman asked Harrison to conduct an inspection tour of camps holding displaced persons (DPs) in Europe, on the urging of outgoing Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. Harrison was asked to inquire into the conditions and needs of those among the displaced persons in the liberated countries of Western Europe and in Allied-occupied Germany and Allied-occupied Austria with particular reference to the Jewish refugees who may possibly be stateless or non-repatriable:\n\n(1) the conditions under which displaced persons and particularly those who may be stateless or non-repatriable are at present living, especially in Germany and Austria,<br>\n(2) the needs of such persons,<br>\n(3) how those needs are being met at present by the military authorities, the governments of residence and international and private relief bodies, and <br>\n(4) the views of the possibly non-repatriable persons as to their future destinations.<br>\nHarrison left in early July as the head of a small delegation, including two representatives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Joseph J. Schwartz and Herbert Katzki, the latter also of the War Refugee Board, and Patrick Murphy Malin of the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees. The group split up to visit approximately thirty DP camps; Schwartz went to the camps in Northern Germany whilst Harrison visited the US camps in Austria and Bavaria.\n\nThe report was dated August 24. It blamed U.S. military authorities for the horrible conditions it described:\n\nHarrison contrasted these conditions with the relative normal life led by the nearby German populations and wondered at the contrast:\n\nHe wrote that to date U.S. authorities were handing DPs in traditional ways as national groups, but that conditions and the history of Nazi anti-Semitism required recognition of the distinct identity of these DPs:\n\nHe recommended to the President that 100,000 DPs in those camps be permitted to resettle in Palestine. Truman forwarded the report to General Eisenhower, Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe. Eisenhower responded promptly with a series of measures that segregated Jewish DPs, found housing even if it meant displacing German locals, increased rations, and preference in employment, perhaps aided by information about the Report's contents before it reached Truman. Another immediate result of Harrison's recommendations was the appointment of an adviser on Jewish affairs to the U.S. Army with the rank of major-general, based on the recommendation of several Jewish organizations to the secretary of war. Rabbi Judah P. Nadich was the first, followed in October 1945 by Simon H. Rifkind, a New York City judge and municipal official. Finally, the \"Report\" focused the attention of the Truman and the U.S. military on the Jewish DPs. Truman wrote to Eisenhower on August 31:\n\nIt also highlighted Palestine as the solution and British control of immigration there as a crucial barrier.\n\nEisenhower replied to the Harrison Report with a lengthy update to Truman in mid-October, explaining changes in conditions and contesting Harrison's assertion, in Eisenhower's words, that \"our military guards are now substituting for SS troops\". He wrote that:\n\nHarrison responded in a radio address the next day that what Eisenhower viewed as improvements fell far short of what was required: \"The point is that they shouldn't be in any camps at all, but in houses. Shifting them from one camp to another can hardly be said to be liberation.\"\n\nHarrison's report was part of the impetus for the creation of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine, which was formed to recommend policies for dealing with both Jewish war refugees and the problems of Palestine. Harrison campaigned on behalf of his proposal in the months that followed, testifying in January 1946 before the Anglo-American Committee. In 1946, the \"New York Times\" called Harrison's work \"the first official proposal for the immediate settlement of 100,000 Jews in Palestine\". Harrison's report has been credited by some historians as a crucial step in the development of United States support for the State of Israel. In June he called for the United Nations to create an agency to address the problems of those uprooted by war, many now stateless, and he thought Latin America might welcome many of them.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin referred to the report in a speech to the House of Commons, a week after the London Conference of 1946–47 – Britain's last attempt to negotiate peace in Palestine – failed. In the speech, he blamed the Harrison Report for the ill feeling which ensued:\n\n"}

It has been owned by three British prime ministers, and some of its 18th-century interiors, among the best in London, were removed and re-installed elsewhere. The surviving part of the house was granted Grade II* Listed Building status in 1970.\n\nThe surviving part of the historic house is now the home of the Lansdowne Club.\n\nIt was designed by Robert Adam as a private house for John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute but in 1763 he sold it unfinished to William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (both men became Prime Minister). Shelburne retained Adam until 1771, when his wife died, with parts of the decoration still incomplete. George Dance the Younger and Robert Smirke later worked on the house.\n\nFrom 1763 to 1929 it belonged to the Petty-FitzMaurice family, Marquesses of Lansdowne. In 1931 part of the original house was demolished to allow a new road to be built. Since 1935, part of it has been the home of the Lansdowne Club. The positioning of the property was rather unusual. It had a large front garden occupying the whole of the southern side of the square, which it faced side on. This arrangement gave Devonshire House on Piccadilly an open aspect behind as far as the square.\n\nFamous former owners or residents of Lansdowne House include:\n\n\nIn the 1930s, the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster Council decided to construct a road link from Berkeley Square to Curzon Street, which required the demolition of all the front rooms of Lansdowne House. One of Adam's three drawing rooms was removed and installed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while the Dining Room went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The facade was rebuilt in a modified form at the front of the reduced house.\n\nMuch of the house's collections, such as the Lansdowne Amazon and the Lansdowne Hercules, were also bought by American and British museums. Other objects were transferred to Bowood House, the Lansdowne country house, where Adam also worked. This remains in the family, though large parts of it were also demolished, in 1956.\n\nA large office block was built on the front garden on the southern edge of the square at what is now Nos. 55–59 Berkeley Square. This new building inherited the name of the old house, while the address No. 9 Fitzmaurice Place still points to the original location, where the Lansdowne Club is now undergoing extensive renovations begun in 2000. On 1 May 1935, the Lansdowne Club opened as a 'social, residential and athletic Club for members of social standing…'. This includes some of the 18th-century rooms, with others added in the 1930s in Art Deco style.\n\n"}
{"id": "18089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18089", "title": "Lettre de cachet", "text": "Lettre de cachet\n\nLettres de cachet (, lit. \"letters of the sign/signet\") were letters signed by the king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed with the royal seal, or \"cachet\". They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be appealed.\n\nIn the case of organized bodies, 'lettres de cachet’ were issued for the purpose of preventing assembly or accomplishing some other definite act. The provincial estates were convoked (called to assembly) in this manner, and it was by a \"lettre de cachet\" (in this case, a \"lettre de jussipri\"), or by showing in person in a \"lit de justice\", that the king ordered a \"parlement\" to register a law despite that parlement's refusal to pass it.\n\nThe best-known \"lettres de cachet\", however, were penal, by which a subject was imprisoned without trial and without an opportunity of defense (after inquiry and due diligence by the Lieutenant De Police) in a state prison or an ordinary jail, confinement in a convent or the General Hospital of Paris, transportation to the colonies, or expulsion to another part of the realm, or from the realm altogether. The Lettres were mainly used against drunkards, troublemakers, prostitutes, squanderers of family fortune, or insane persons. The wealthy sometimes petitioned such \"lettres\" to dispose of inconvenient individuals, especially to prevent unequal marriages (nobles with commoners), or to prevent a scandal (the Lettre could prevent court cases that might otherwise dishonour a family).\n\nIn this respect, the \"lettres de cachet\" were a prominent symbol of the abuses of the \"ancien régime\" monarchy, and as such were suppressed during the French Revolution. In 1789 and 1790, all cases were revised by a commission which confirmed most of the sentences. Historian Claude Quétel has interpreted these confirmations as indicating that the Lettres were not as arbitrary and unjust as they have been represented after the Revolution, and he hence speaks of a \"Légende noire\".\n\nThe power to issue \"lettres de cachet\" was a royal privilege recognized by the French monarchic civil law that developed during the 13th century, as the Capetian monarchy overcame its initial distrust of Roman law. The principle can be traced to a maxim which furnished a text of the \"Pandects\" of Justinian: in their Latin version, \"Rex solutus est a legibus\", or \"The king is released from the laws.\" \"The French legal scholars interpreted the imperial office of the Justinian code in a generic way and arrived at the conclusion that every 'king is an emperor in his own kingdom,' that is, he possesses the prerogatives of legal absolutism that the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" attributes to the Roman emperor.\"\n\nThis meant that when the king intervened directly, he could decide without heeding the laws, and even contrary to the laws. This was an early conception, and in early times the order in question was simply verbal; some letters patent of Henry III of France in 1576 state that François de Montmorency was \"prisoner in our castle of the Bastille in Paris by verbal command\" of the late king Charles IX.\n\nIn the 14th century the principle was introduced that the order should be written, and hence arose the \"lettre de cachet\". The \"lettre de cachet\" belonged to the class of \"lettres closes\", as opposed to \"lettres patentes\", which contained the expression of the legal and permanent will of the king, and had to be furnished with the seal of state affixed by the chancellor.\n\nThe \"lettres de cachet\", on the contrary, were signed simply by a secretary of state for the king; they bore merely the imprint of the king's privy seal, from which circumstance they were often called, in the 14th and 15th centuries, \"lettres de petit signet\" or \"lettres de petit cachet\", and were entirely exempt from the control of the chancellor.\n\nWhile serving the government as a silent weapon against political adversaries or controversial writers and as a means of punishing culprits of high birth without the scandal of a lawsuit, the \"lettres de cachet\" had many other uses. They were employed by the police in dealing with prostitutes, and on their authority lunatics were shut up in hospitals and sometimes in prisons.\n\nThey were also often used by heads of families as a means of correction, for example, for protecting the family honour from the disorderly or criminal conduct of sons. The case of the Marquis de Sade (imprisoned 1777–1790 under a \"lettre de cachet\" obtained by his wealthy and influential mother-in-law) is a prominent example. Wives, too, took advantage of them to curb the profligacy of husbands and vice versa.\n\nIn reality, the secretary of state had a delegation, and could issue them at his own discretion, and in most cases the king was unaware of their issue. In the 18th century it is certain that the letters were often issued blank, i.e. without containing the name of the person against whom they were directed; the recipient, or mandatary, filled in the name in order to make the letter effective.\n\nProtests against the \"lettres de cachet\" were made continually by the \"parlement\" of Paris and by the provincial \"parlements\", and also by the Estates-General. In 1648, during the Fronde, the sovereign courts of Paris, by their \"Arrêt d'Union\", procured their momentary suppression in a kind of charter of liberties which they imposed upon the crown, but which was short-lived.\n\nIt was not until the reign of Louis XVI that a reaction against the abuse became clearly perceptible. At the beginning of that reign Malesherbes during his short ministry endeavoured to infuse some measure of justice into the system, and in March 1784 the baron de Breteuil, a minister of the king's household, addressed a circular to the intendants and the lieutenant of police with a view to preventing the most serious abuses connected with the issue of \"lettres de cachet\".\n\nThe Comte de Mirabeau wrote a scathing indictment of \"lettres de cachet\" while imprisoned in the dungeon of Vincennes (by \"lettre de cachet\" obtained by his father). The treatise was published after his liberation in 1782 under the title \"Les Lettres de cachet et des prisons d'etat\" and was widely read throughout Europe.\n\nIn Paris, in 1779, the Cour des Aides demanded their suppression, and in March 1788 the parlement of Paris made some exceedingly energetic remonstrances, which are important for the light they throw upon old French public law. The crown, however, did not decide to lay aside this weapon, and in a declaration to the States-General in the royal session of June 23, 1789 (art. 15) it did not renounce it absolutely.\n\n\"Lettres de cachet\" were abolished after the French Revolution by the Constituent Assembly, but Napoleon reestablished their penal equivalent by a political measure in the decree of 8 March 1801 on the state prisons. This is all the more striking, given that Napoleon had pushed for measures ensuring the rule of law in the codes of laws adopted under his rule. This action was one of the acts brought up against him by the senatus-consulte of 3 April 1814, which pronounced his fall \"considering that he has violated the constitutional laws by the decrees on the state prisons.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Today the oinochoe is kept in Martin von Wagner Museum in Würzburg, where it has the inventory number \"H 5724\".\n\nNot including the handle, it has a height of 20.5 centimetres and a maximum diameter of 11.6 centimetres. The spout of the vessel widens slightly from the concave neck. Features such as its trefoil mouth, truncated column neck, pear-shaped body, low disk-shaped foot and strap handle indicate a fairly advanced stage of development, on which account it should be dated to the second or third quarter of the seventh century, probably between 640 and 620.\n\nIn many respects, the Oinochoe of the Mamarce potter combines several cultural traditions together. Firstly, the vessel is a work in the impasto style which was typical of the Villanova culture. As was the norm, very fine-grained clay was used and it was turned on a potter's wheel, not just moulded by hand. The surface was polished in the manner of prehistoric art. The shape is known among scholars as bucchero impasto and prefigures later Bucchero pottery. Thus, the oinochoe stands in the transition between the Villanova culture and that of the Etruscans.\n\nImages were incised on the oinochoe and red filling was pressed into the incisions, some traces of which still remain. This incised decoration suggests the oinochoe comes from the Falisci or Falerii area, but it might also come from the neighbouring settlement of Veii. The incisions depict a warrior who is flanked by a horse on the right and by a goat suckling its kid on the left (both goats missing their fourth leg). Above the goats there were two waterfowl. The engraver equipped the bearded warrior with helmet, greaves and belt and depicted him with his legs spread as if he were dancing.\n\nThe depiction of a human figure flanked by animals has a parallel in the common eastern motif of the master of animals. While the master of animals motif originates in the east, it is common in Greece; a form with horses is native to Corinth and goats might indicate Euboean influence. If the image derives from the master of animals motif, then the depiction of a suckling goat is most unusual - we would expect two horses. Even more unusual is the fact that the goat is looking away from the warrior. The waterfowl would have to be explained as Villanovan influence.\n\nOn the right side, stretching over the horse to the warrior is an incised inscription in Etruscan which reads from right to left, saying \"mi mamarce zinace\". \"Mi\" is the first person singular nominative pronoun, \"mamarce\" is a male name in the nominative-accusative or locative case and \"zinace\" is a past active verb meaning \"made\". Because Mamarce only states his first name, it is assumed that he belonged to a lower social class. The name Mamerce is Italic, appearing in Latin as Mamercus and connected with \"Mamers\", the Oscan name of the god Mars. That the potter who bore this name was himself ethnically Italiote need not follow.\n\n"}

{"id": "2587548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2587548", "title": "Martin Burns", "text": "Martin Burns\n\nMartin Burns (February 15, 1861 – January 8, 1937) was an American world wrestling champion \"catch-as-catch-can\" wrestler as well as wrestling coach and teacher. Born in Cedar County, Iowa he started wrestling as a teenager and made money traveling around the Midwest wrestling in carnivals and fairs. As a professional he claimed the American Heavyweight Championship by defeating Evan \"Strangler\" Lewis in 1895 and held the title for two years. Martin Burns himself claimed to have wrestled in more than 6,000 matches and is said to have lost only seven. After the end of his active wrestling career he started a successful wrestling school in Omaha and later coached Cedar Rapids' Washington high school to the very first Iowa high school state wrestling tournament title. He died in Council Bluffs in 1937. In 2001 Martin \"Farmer\" Burns was inducted into the International Wrestling Institute and Museum Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2002. The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted Martin Burns in 2003.\n\nMartin Burns was born on February 15, 1861, in a log cabin on a farm in Cedar County, Iowa. Growing up amidst the Civil War, Burns was exposed at an early age to the sport of wrestling, which was a preferred activity among the soldiers while stationed in camp. Consequently, the sport’s popularity further increased during the 1860s, and many historians also speculate that the added interest may be due to the fact that President Abraham Lincoln had himself been a champion wrestler in his younger years (it is documented that Lincoln once beat the Louisiana State Champion in New Salem, LA in 1831).\n\nBurns wrestled impromptu matches as a child; and at age 8, he tossed an older rival to claim a fifteen cent prize. His father died when he was 11, leaving him to support his mother, brother, and five sisters. To earn money, Burns worked at a nearby farm for $12 per month; and while he received little schooling, it was this physical labor that enabled Burns to develop his tremendous physical strength. He also spent time working in grading camps, where he competed in regular competitions against rugged strongmen. However, while these men focused on brute strength, Burns spent much time meticulously perfecting the strategies and techniques of catch wrestling, which is a grappling style where various holds and tactics are used with the intent to either submit or pin both opponent’s shoulders to the ground at once. Therefore, the combination of Burns’ superior conditioning, intellect, and advanced skill made him a nearly unbeatable wrestling opponent.\n\nBy 1880, Martin Burns had developed a formidable reputation; and at 19, he wrestled his first match against a professional grappler when he battled David Grafft to a 2-hour and 19 minute draw. He then honed his skills against the top pro wrestlers of the day, losing decisions to Henry Clayton and Tom Connors in 1886 and 1887 respectively. The defeat to Clayton particularly irked Burns, as he was unable to offset the feared stranglehold that subsequently earned Clayton the moniker Evan “Strangler” Lewis (long before the more famous Ed “Strangler” Lewis was ever born). Consequently, Burns launched into a rigorous program of neck development; and soon built an immense 20” neck that possessed such strength that he could be dropped six feet on a hangman’s noose to no effect (a stunt that Burns would often perform at carnivals and fairs).\n\nWhile on a trip to Chicago in the spring of 1889, Burns saw a sign offering $25 to anyone who could last fifteen minutes against top grapplers Jack Carleek and Evan Lewis. Burns accepted the challenge and showed up at the Olympic Theater dressed in his regular farmer’s overalls. Consequently, the event’s announcer introduced Martin to the crowd as “Farmer” Burns; and the “Farmer” promptly made a monkey out of Carleek, throwing him across the stage before being declared the winner after fifteen minutes. The next challenge was Burns’ much-awaited rematch against Evan “Strangler” Lewis, who was now the reigning Catch-as-Catch-Can Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Joe Acton on March 14, 1887. However, fifteen minutes proved not enough time for Lewis to throw Burns; and again, the unknown “Farmer” was declared the winner and was subsequently lauded as a wrestling hero the next day in Chicago newspapers.\n\nFollowing Farmer Burns’ emergence as a premier grappler, he traveled the country, taking on the greatest wrestlers of the day, while also beating all comers at carnivals. Though he weighed just 165 pounds, he regularly defeated men who outweighed him by as much as 50-100 pounds. At the time, professional catch-as-catch-can (freestyle) wrestling often used no time limit, and a match was usually decided when a wrestler “threw” his opponent to the ground. However, Burns became known as the master of the pinfall, as he perfected the art of trapping his opponents’ shoulders to the mat while contriving such dangerous maneuvers as the full and half-nelson, hammerlock, double-wrist lock, chicken wing, and a variety of submission toe holds.\n\nFarmer Burns soon encountered the renowned Sorakichi Matsuda, who is regarded as Japan’s first-ever pro wrestler, and who had been a top challenger to World Wrestling Champions William Muldoon and Ernest Roeber during the previous decade. The two faced off in Troy, NY on May 13, 1891, and Burns scored his biggest win yet when he pinned Matsuda in just four minutes. As a result, Farmer Burns soon became known as the world’s premier all-around grappler; and between 1890–93, he never lost a single fall. Then, on March 2, 1893, Evan Lewis was recognized as wrestling’s American Heavyweight Champion when he beat Ernest Roeber to unify the American Greco-Roman Title with the Catch-As-Catch-Can Championship. This set up yet another rematch between Farmer Burns and Strangler Lewis; and on April 20, 1895, Burns pinned Lewis to capture the title. Burns would go on to reign as wrestling’s American Champion for two years until he was finally beaten by Dan McLeod and Tom Jenkins in 1897.\n\nNevertheless, Farmer Burns’ greatest contribution to wrestling’s evolution may be as a trainer. He opened a gymnasium in Rock Island, Illinois in 1893, and helped to establish schools that enlightened young grapplers to the world of catch wrestling. In 1899, Burns defeated a 21-year-old Iowan named Frank Gotch, but he recognized his raw talent and recruited him as his prized student. Burns would then mold Gotch into perhaps the greatest wrestling champion of all-time, as he defeated George Hackenschmidt in 1908 to claim the undisputed World Heavyweight Title. In addition, Farmer Burns also served as a teacher to a myriad of grapplers who would transform the sport in the early 1900s, including future World Champion Earl Caddock, future Middleweight World Champion and Champion Wrestler of the A.E.F. Ralph Parcaut, as well as creative pioneer Joseph “Toots” Mondt. Other big names he personally trained included Rudy Dusek, Joe Malcewicz, Emil Klank, Jess Westergaard, Fred Beell and Jack Sherry. It is said he trained more than 1,600 wrestlers in all. Burns was so respected as a trainer that he was even recruited to serve as the conditioning coach for boxer Jim Jeffries’ 1910 title bout against Jack Johnson.\n\nIn 1914, Burns published a 96-page mail-order course entitled \"The Lessons in Wrestling and Physical Culture\", which incorporated breathing techniques, calisthenics, stamina exercises, and Eastern martial arts principles, thus becoming the bible for all aspiring wrestlers during the early 1900s. Moreover, it is said that Ed “Strangler” Lewis, the great wrestling champion of the 1920s and 30s (and the eventual teacher of Lou Thesz) got his start in wrestling by following Burns’ training methods. Consequently, it is because of Burns’ many efforts that his native state of Iowa has subsequently become the nation’s amateur wrestling capital, with the University of Iowa consistently serving as an NCAA powerhouse, and with the International Wrestling Institute and Museum also based in Newton.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Burns was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Legacy wing.\n\nBurns had two sons, Raymond and Charlie, who became musicians in Chicago, and a daughter, Celia Burns Beem. He suffered the loss of his wife Amelia in 1930, which led to the deterioration of his own condition. At this point he went to live with his daughter who died in 1951.\n\nBurns died on January 8, 1937, in Council Bluffs, Iowa at the age of 75, and was buried at the St. James Cemetery in Toronto, Iowa.\n\nThe \"Farmer\" Burns workout is a custom workout routine developed by Martin Burns for himself and his students. It is based only on resistance provided by one's own body, a pair of dumbbell weights, and supplemental aerobic exercise, such as running. The workout consists of three phases of exercises organized into sets and repetitions. The first phase is a combination of warm-ups and stretches, using only one's own body for resistance. The second phase uses a pair of dumbbells for resistance, otherwise resembling aerobics in appearance. The third phase of exercises are partner exercises, again only relying on the two persons' bodies for resistance. Martin Burns' career success is often accredited greatly in part to this intense workout routine.\n\nBurns was well known in the early twentieth century for his neck. He managed to have a twenty-inch neck. With this neck, according to an article in WWE Magazine, he gained fame by being put into a noose, getting hanged, and living, while whistling \"Yankee Doodle\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1107036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1107036", "title": "Medical record", "text": "Medical record\n\nThe terms medical record, health record, and medical chart are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the systematic documentation of a single patient's medical history and care across time within one particular health care provider's jurisdiction. The medical record includes a variety of types of \"notes\" entered over time by health care professionals, recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies, orders for the administration of drugs and therapies, test results, x-rays, reports, etc. The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite.\n\nThe terms are used for both the physical and metal folder that exists for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein.\n\nMedical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers, but advances in online data storage have led to the development of personal health records (PHR) that are maintained by patients themselves, often on third-party websites. This concept is supported by US national health administration entities and by AHIMA, the American Health Information Management Association.\n\nBecause many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive private information covered by expectations of privacy, many ethical and legal issues are implicated in their maintenance, such as third-party access and appropriate storage and disposal. Although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider, the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient, who may obtain copies upon request.\n\nThe information contained in the medical record allows health care providers to determine the patient's medical history and provide informed care. The medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication among patient and health care provider and professionals contributing to the patient's care. An increasing purpose of the medical record is to ensure documentation of compliance with institutional, professional or governmental regulation.\n\nThe traditional medical record for inpatient care can include admission notes, on-service notes, progress notes (SOAP notes), preoperative notes, operative notes, postoperative notes, procedure notes, delivery notes, postpartum notes, and discharge notes.\n\nPersonal health records combine many of the above features with portability, thus allowing a patient to share medical records across providers and health care systems.\n\nA patient's individual medical record identifies the patient and contains information regarding the patient's case history at a particular provider. The health record as well as any electronically stored variant of the traditional paper files contain proper identification of the patient. Further information varies with the individual medical history of the patient.\n\nTraditionally, medical records were written on paper and maintained in folders often divided into sections for each type of note (progress note, order, test results), with new information added to each section chronologically. Active records are usually housed at the clinical site, but older records are often archived offsite.\n\nThe advent of electronic medical records has not only changed the format of medical records but has increased accessibility of files. The use of an individual dossier style medical record, where records are kept on each patient by name and illness type originated at the Mayo Clinic out of a desire to simplify patient tracking and to allow for medical research.\n\nMaintenance of medical records requires security measures to prevent from unauthorized access or tampering with the records.\n\nThe medical history is a longitudinal record of what has happened to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.\n\n\nWithin the medical record, individual medical encounters are marked by discrete summations of a patient's medical history by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant and can take several forms. Hospital admission documentation (i.e., when a patient requires hospitalization) or consultation by a specialist often take an exhaustive form, detailing the entirety of prior health and health care. Routine visits by a provider familiar to the patient, however, may take a shorter form such as the \"problem-oriented medical record\" (POMR), which includes a problem list of diagnoses or a \"SOAP\" method of documentation for each visit. Each encounter will generally contain the aspects below:\n\n\nWritten orders by medical providers are included in the medical record. These detail the instructions given to other members of the health care team by the primary providers.\n\nWhen a patient is hospitalized, daily updates are entered into the medical record documenting clinical changes, new information, etc. These often take the form of a SOAP note and are entered by all members of the health-care team (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapists, etc.). They are kept in chronological order and document the sequence of events leading to the current state of health.\n\nThe results of testing, such as blood tests (e.g., complete blood count) radiology examinations (e.g., X-rays), pathology (e.g., biopsy results), or specialized testing (e.g., pulmonary function testing) are included. Often, as in the case of X-rays, a written report of the findings is included in lieu of the actual film.\n\nMany other items are variably kept within the medical record. Digital images of the patient, flowsheets from operations/intensive care units, informed consent forms, EKG tracings, outputs from medical devices (such as pacemakers), chemotherapy protocols, and numerous other important pieces of information form part of the record depending on the patient and his or her set of illnesses/treatments.\n\nMedical records are legal documents that can be used as evidence via a subpoena duces tecum, and are thus subject to the laws of the country/state in which they are produced. As such, there is great variability in rules governing production, ownership, accessibility, and destruction. There is some controversy regarding proof verifying the facts, or absence of facts in the record, apart from the medical record itself.\n\nDemographics include patient information that is not medical in nature. It is often information to locate the patient, including identifying numbers, addresses, and contact numbers. It may contain information about race and religion as well as workplace and type of occupation. It also contains information regarding the patient's health insurance. It is common to also find emergency contact information located in this section of the medical chart.\n\nIn the United States, written records must be marked with the date and time and scribed with indelible pens without use of corrective paper. Errors in the record should be struck out with a single line (so that the initial entry remains legible) and initialed by the author.\nOrders and notes must be signed by the author. Electronic versions require an electronic signature.\n\nOwnership and keeping of patient's records varies from country to country.\n\nIn the United States, the data contained within the medical record belongs to the patient, whereas the physical form the data takes belongs to the entity responsible for maintaining the record per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Patients have the right to ensure that the information contained in their record is accurate, and can petition their health care provider to amend factually incorrect information in their records.\n\nThere is no consensus regarding medical record ownership in the United States. Factors complicating questions of ownership include the form and source of the information, custody of the information, contract rights, and variation in state law. There is no federal law regarding ownership of medical records. HIPAA gives patients the right to access and amend their own records, but it has no language regarding ownership of the records. Twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C. have no laws that define ownership of medical records. Twenty-one states have laws stating that the providers are the owners of the records. Only one state, New Hampshire, has a law ascribing ownership of medical records to the patient.\n\nUnder Canadian federal law, the patient owns the information contained in a medical record, but the healthcare provider owns the records themselves. The same is true for both nursing home and dental records. In cases where the provider is an employee of a clinic or hospital, it is the employer that has ownership of the records. By law, all providers must keep medical records for a period of 15 years beyond the last entry.\n\nThe precedent for the law is the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v MacDonald. In that ruling, an appeal by a physician, Dr. Elizabeth McInerney, challenging a patient's access to their own medical record was denied. The patient, Margaret MacDonald, won a court order granting her full access to her own medical record. The case was complicated by the fact that the records were in electronic form and contained information supplied by other providers. McInerney maintained that she didn't have the right to release records she herself did not author. The courts ruled otherwise. Legislation followed, codifying into law the principles of the ruling. It is that legislation which deems providers the owner of medical records, but requires that access to the records be granted to the patient themselves.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ownership of the NHS's medical records has in the past generally been described as belonging to the Secretary of State for Health and this is taken by some to mean copyright also belongs to the authorities.\n\nIn Germany, a relatively new law, which has been established in 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.\n\nIn addition, an electronic health insurance card was issued in January 2014 which is applicable in Germany ( or eGK), but also in the other member states of the European Union (European Health Insurance Card). It contains data such as: the name of the health insurance company, the validity period of the card, and personal information about the patient (name, date of birth, sex, address, health insurance number) as well information about the patient’s insurance status and additional charges. Furthermore, it can contain medical data if agreed to by the patient. This data can include information concerning emergency care, prescriptions, an electronic medical record, and electronic physician’s letters. However, due to the limited storage space (32kB), some information is deposited on servers.\n\nIn the United States, the most basic rules governing access to a medical record dictate that only the patient and the health-care providers directly involved in delivering care have the right to view the record. The patient, however, may grant consent for any person or entity to evaluate the record. The full rules regarding access and security for medical records are set forth under the guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nThe rules become more complicated in special situations. A 2018 study found discrepancies in how major hospitals handle record requests, with forms displaying limited information relative to phone conversations.\n\n\nIn the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v. MacDonald gave patients the right to copy and examine all information in their medical records, while the records themselves remained the property of the healthcare provider. The 2004 Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) contains regulatory guidelines to protect the confidentiality of patient information for healthcare organizations acting as stewards of their medical records. Despite legal precedent for access nationwide, there is still some variance in laws depending on the province. There is also some confusion among providers as to the scope of the patient information they have to give access to, but the language in the supreme court ruling gives patient access rights to their entire record.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Acts and later the Freedom of Information Act 2000 gave patients or their representatives the right to a copy of their record, except where information breaches confidentiality (e.g., information from another family member or where a patient has asked for information not to be disclosed to third parties) or would be harmful to the patient's wellbeing (e.g., some psychiatric assessments). Also, the legislation gives patients the right to check for any errors in their record and insist that amendments be made if required.\n\nIn general, entities in possession of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally for as long as that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded information should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient’s death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case).\n\nThe outsourcing of medical record transcription and storage has the potential to violate patient-physician confidentiality by possibly allowing unaccountable persons access to patient data.\nFalsification of a medical record by a medical professional is a felony in most United States jurisdictions.\nGovernments have often refused to disclose medical records of military personnel who have been used as experimental subjects.\n\nGiven the series of medical data breaches and the lack of public trust, some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.\n\nPatients' medical information can be shared by a number of people both within the health care industry and beyond. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law pertaining to medical privacy that went into effect in 2003. This law established standards for patient privacy in all 50 states, including the right of patients to access to their own records. HIPAA provides some protection, but does not resolve the issues involving medical records privacy.\n\nMedical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.\n\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) addresses the issue of privacy by providing medical information handling guidelines. Not only is it bound by the Code of Ethics of its profession (in the case of doctors and nurses), but also by the legislation on data protection and criminal law. Professional secrecy applies to practitioners, psychologists, nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing assistants, chiropodists, and administrative personnel, as well as auxiliary hospital staff. The maintenance of the confidentiality and privacy of patients implies first of all in the medical history, which must be adequately guarded, remaining accessible only to the authorized personnel. However, the precepts of privacy must be observed in all fields of hospital life: privacy at the time of the conduct of the anamnesis and physical exploration, the privacy at the time of the information to the relatives, the conversations between healthcare providers in the corridors, maintenance of adequate patient data collection in hospital nursing controls (planks, slates), telephone conversations, open intercoms ...\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the other gates of the Forbidden City, the Meridian Gate has two protruding arms on either side, derived from ancient que towers traditionally used to decorate the main entrances of palaces, temples and tombs. The gate has five arches. The three central arches are close together in the main, central section; the two flanking arches are farther apart from the three central arches, and are located between the central section and the protruding arms. The centre arch was formerly reserved for the Emperor alone; the exceptions were the Empress, who could enter it once on the day of her wedding, and the top three scholars of the triennial civil service examinations, who left the exams through the central arch. All other officials and servants had to use the four side arches.\n\nA series of buildings form the superstructure of the gate. The central one is a pavilion of nine bays wide, with double eaves. On each of the protruding side, a 13 bays-long building with a single eave, connects the two pyramidal-roofed pavilions that represented the que towers. \n\nIts superstructure is also called the \"Five Phoenix Turrets\" because it is composed of five buildings. Imperial proclamations and almanacs were issued from the gate house. After successful campaigns, the Emperor received prisoners of war here, sometimes followed by mass decapitations.\n\nAlthough urban myth has it that senior officers were executed here in Imperial China; in reality only corporal punishment was actually carried out.\n\nBehind the viewer is Upright Gate, the principal entrance to the imperial palace grounds.\n\nWhen proceeding northward through the palace grounds, the next major gate encountered is the Gate of Supreme Harmony.\n\n"}
{"id": "44219945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44219945", "title": "Microfadeometry", "text": "Microfadeometry\n\nMicrofadeometry is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.\nThis process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra.\n\nLight-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early art conservation studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials. Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.\n\nBefore the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.\nBenchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.\n\nUsing a powerful xenon arc lamp, 1 lumen of light is focused through an optical fiber onto a 300–400 μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic. The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5–12 years of display at normal museum light levels. The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400–710 nm using a water filter. The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.\nCalibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the Blue Wool Scale.\n\nConcerns associated with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards, variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.\n\nCultural institutions that house their own instruments for microfadeometry are: Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, the Library of Congress and the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Conservation Department at Buffalo State College in New York, and The National Archives (United Kingdom).\n\n"}

The film stars Ben Stiller, Amy Adams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Hank Azaria, Bill Hader, Christopher Guest, Alain Chabat, Jon Bernthal, and Robin Williams. It is the second installment in the \"Night at the Museum\" trilogy, and a sequel to the 2006 film \"Night at the Museum\". It is also the last \"Night at the Museum\" film to feature Jake Cherry as Nick Daley, as Cherry aged out of the role. The film was released theatrically on May 22, 2009 by 20th Century Fox, being the only film in the trilogy not to be released theatrically in December. Like its predecessor, it received mixed critical reception and a box office success by grossing over $413 million on a $150 million budget.\n\nTwo years after the events of the first film, Larry Daley, former night guard at the American Museum of Natural History, now runs his own direct response television company that sells inventions based on his experiences. He travels to the museum, discovering most of the exhibits will be moved to the Federal Archives at the Smithsonian Institution and replaced with holographic information providers. The Tablet of Ahkmenrah is to remain in the museum, leaving most of the exhibits without the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved, Larry receives a phone call from Jedediah, who informs him that Dexter the monkey stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing every exhibit in it to life. Larry travels to Washington, DC, navigating his way to the archives with help from his son Nick while posing as a night guard.\n\nLarry finds his friends trapped in their shipping container under attack from Ahkmenrah’s evil older brother Kahmunrah, accidentally activating the tablet and bringing the exhibits in the Smithsonian to life again. Kahmunrah reveals his plans to use the tablet’s powers to conquer the world. Larry escapes, aided by a gigantic octopus and General George A. Custer, who is captured, and then the adventurous Amelia Earhart, who becomes his travelling companion around the museum. The two evade Kahmunrah’s army, trapping them in the portrait of V-J Day in Times Square. Kahmunrah enlists fellow evil historical leaders, Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Al Capone to help capture Larry and retrieve the tablet. Jedediah tries to help but is placed in an hourglass. Kahmunrah is unable to open the Gate of the Underworld with the tablet, and gives Larry and Amelia an hour to translate it, or Kahmunrah will kill Larry and his friends.\n\nWhile searching for someone in the museum who can help, Larry and Amelia end up falling in love. They travel to the National Air and Space Museum, briefly encountering the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial. Inside the museum, Larry grounds all of the aircraft and rockets from taking off, before a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads inform him that the combination is the value of pi. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone’s troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape using the Wright Flyer. They crash the plane into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the acquired combination to summon an army of bird-headed warriors. Lincoln crashes in through the window, frightening the warriors back into the Underworld.\n\nAmelia gathers an army of allies including Larry’s friends and Custer, leading to a climactic battle. But Custer is afraid to fight after remembering Little Big Horn. Larry persuades him to forget the past and fight on. Meanwhile, Octavius rescues Jedediah, who together, turn the tide of the Battle. Larry obtains the tablet, and devises a plan to stop Kahmunrah. Inspired by an idea given to him by Lincoln, Larry sparks a disagreement between Capone, Bonaparte and Ivan, causing them to brawl amongst themselves. Larry attempts to escape, only to be cut off by an angry Kahmunrah, brandishing a Khopesh. After a brief scuffle between Larry, armed with his flashlight, and Kahmunrah, Amelia eventually manages to use the tablet to open the gate, and Larry finally defeats Kahmunrah, banishing him to the Underworld. \n\nAmelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home, giving Larry a final kiss before taking off in her plane, knowing she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian. \nTwo months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it, and the exhibits remain, capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being animatronics. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museum's new extension of visiting hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriters Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon confirmed to Dark Horizons that they were writing a sequel to \"Night at the Museum,\" originally with the tentative title \"Another Night at the Museum\". The writers said that \"there'll be existing characters and plenty of new ones.\"\n\n20th Century Fox announced that the sequel, \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\", would be released during Memorial Day weekend in 2009. Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan, Ricky Gervais, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Cherry, Rami Malek, Mizuo Peck, Brad Garrett and Robin Williams would return for the sequel, with Shawn Levy returning as director.\n\nThe film was mostly filmed in Vancouver and Montreal with some scenes filmed in the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.. A scene was shot at the Lincoln Memorial on the night of May 21, 2008. Scenes were also shot at the American Museum of Natural History in New York on August 18 and 20, 2008.\n\nThe trailer was released with \"Bedtime Stories\", \"Yes Man\" and \"Marley & Me\" in December 2008. The trailer accompanied the film \"Bride Wars\" in January, \"The Pink Panther 2\" in February, and \"Dragonball Evolution\" in April 2009. The film was also promoted as an opening skit on \"American Idol,\" where a replica of the \"Idol\" judge seats are being held at the real Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAn alternate ending included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases featured the return of Dick Van Dyke as Cecil Fredericks, Bill Cobbs as Reginald, and Mickey Rooney as Gus.\n\nAs of 2009, numerous artifacts which inspired the movie were on display at Smithsonian Museums along the National Mall. Many of the artifacts are labeled with \"Night at the Museum\" logos.\n\nGift shops at the Smithsonian also sell a replica of the Einstein Bobble-head, created specifically as a tie-in to the movie.\n\nAlan Silvestri returned to score the sequel. \nVarèse Sarabande issued the score on May 19, 2009.\n\nA trailer of \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\" was released on December 19, 2008. The film premiered on May 14, 2009 in Washington, D.C.. The film released in UK on May 20, 2009, on May 22, 2009 in United States, and in Japan on August 12, 2009.\n\nAt the end of its box office run, \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\" earned a gross of $177 million in North America and $236 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $413 million against a budget of $150 million.\n\nOn Friday, May 22, 2009, its opening day, the film's estimated gross was $16 million, for second day the film grossed $20 million and for third day the gross was $19 million, coming in ahead of \"Terminator Salvation\" (which released on Thursday) in 4,096 theaters at No. 1, reaching up to $54.1 million, with a $13,226 per-theater average over the Memorial Day weekend. By comparison, \"Night at the Museum\" reached up to $30 million on its opening weekend in December 2006. For its second weekend, the film grossed $24.35 million, for third weekend $14.6 million.\n\nFor the opening weekend of May 22, 2009 the film grossed $49 million while playing in theaters of 56 territories; the film debuted in UK ($6.6 million), Russia ($5.23 million) and France ($5.05 million). The largest market in other territories being UK, Japan, Germany, Australia and France where the film grossed $32.8 million, $21.49 million, $18.78 million, $14.03 million and $13.3 million.\n\nLike its predecessor, the sequel has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 44% \"rotten\" approval rating, based on 163 reviews, with an average score of 5.1/10, making it just barely the highest reviewed film of the series. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian\" is busy enough to keep the kids interested but the slapstick goes overboard and the special effects (however well executed) throw the production into mania\". Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 42 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nDespite mixed reviews from critics, most critics praised Amy Adams' and Hank Azaria's performances. Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" awarded the film 3 stars stating that \"[Adams]'s terrific -- a sparkling screen presence.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B+ stating \"\"Battle of the Smithsonian\" has plenty of life. But it's Adams who gives it zing.\" Also, many reviews noted the costume worn by Amy Adams during the movie. Perry Seibert of \"TV Guide\" gave the film 2 stars despite honoring that \"thanks to Azaria, a master of comic timing. His grandiose, yet slightly fey bad guy is equally funny when he's chewing out minions as he is when deliberating if Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader are evil enough to join his team. Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" enjoyed both performances.\n\nOne critic panned the movie on its excessive use of special effects as noted by Scott Tobias of \"The A.V. Club\" when he described the film as \"a baffling master plot and a crowded pileup of special effects in search of something to do.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun Times\" awarded the film 1½ stars out of 4 claiming \"its premise is lame, its plot relentlessly predictable, its characters with personalities that would distinguish picture books.\"\n\nIn CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\" an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\" was made available December 1, 2009 on DVD and Blu-ray as a two-disc Special Edition and a three-disc Digital Copy Edition.\n\n, the film has sold 4,083,829 DVDs and 585,023 Blu-ray discs grossing $51,481,903 and $11,674,546 totalling $63,156,449 in North America.\n\nThe video game based on the film was released on May 5, 2009. It was fairly well received in comparison to the majority of film-based video-games, netting a 7.5 out of 10 from IGN.com.\n\nBen Stiller admitted that a sequel was \"a possibility\" and on January 22, 2010, co-writer Thomas Lennon said to \"Access Hollywood\", \"That after the success of two \"Night at the Museum\" films, it's no surprise that 20th Century Fox is looking to develop a third and that those suspicions are indeed true and how could you not? I think it's a really outstanding idea to do \"Night at the Museum 3\", in fact,\" he said. \"I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that,\" he added with a raised eyebrow. \"I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It might be in the works.\" In an interview, Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that it was only in the \"ideas stage\".\n\nIt was announced in February 2013 that the film, directed by Shawn Levy, would be released on December 25, 2014. On September 10, 2013, it was announced that shooting would start in February 2014. On November 8, 2013, English actor Dan Stevens was cast as Sir Lancelot. On November 15, 2013, it was announced Skyler Gisondo would be replacing Jake Cherry for the role of Nicky Daley. On December 18, 2013 it was announced that Robin Williams, Stiller, and Ricky Gervais would be returning for the sequel. On January 9, 2014, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would play a security guard in the British Museum. On January 14, 2014, the film's release date was moved up from December 25, 2014, to December 19, 2014. On January 23, 2014, it was announced Ben Kingsley would play an Egyptian Pharaoh at the British Museum. Principal photography and production began on January 27, 2014.

Founded on 8 July 1968, by noted documentary filmmaker Gerald Thompson, the independent film company broke new ground in the world of documentaries, using new filming techniques and capturing footage of never before filmed activities of its various subjects. In 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was sold to Circle Communications, where it retained its own identity as a division within the company. The following year, Circle Communications was taken over by Southern Star Entertainment UK. Under the new ownership, Oxford Scientific Films continued to enhance its reputation for innovative film-making, producing multiple award-winning series and films, including the highly acclaimed Animal Planet series, \"Meerkat Manor\".\n\nIn March 2008, Southern Star merged its Sydney-based factual business division into the Oxford Scientific Films division, retaining the brand name for specialist documentaries, while using \"Southern Star Factual\" as the brand name for its features and entertainment style documentaries. When Southern Star was sold to Endemol, Oxford Scientific Films was retained by parent company Fairfax Media. In 2011 Oxford Scientific Films was acquired by Boom Pictures Productions, who own a 70% share of the company.\n\nIn 1967, cinemicrophotography pioneer, professional film maker, and Oxford University lecturer Gerald Thompson, was approached by the Ealing Corporation of Harvard about expanding its catalogue of short educational films. Universal Education and Visual Arts, a New York City, company also was interested in talking with Thompson about the works he'd produced. Thompson and five of his associates and former students: Peter Parks, who worked with plankton; John Paling, a fish specialist who worked with Parks; recent Oxford graduate Sean Morris; zoologist John Cooke; and Eric Skinner, who assisted Thompson with his films, wanted to form an independent film company. Thompson and Parks travelled to America to meet with the two companies to show their work. At the end of the meeting, they told the head of the company about their desire to open their own company and, impressed with the films he'd seen, he offered to finance them for the first three years and give them the funds to build a place to work.\n\nWhen they returned to the United Kingdom, Thompson sold them a quarter acre of his garden, at a steeply discounted price, to be the home for the new building. They formed Oxford Scientific Films, taking part of the name from Parks' existing company Oxford Biological Films. Thompson, Parks, Morris, Paling, and Thompson's son David, headed the new company, which began operating on 8 July 1968. Thompson remained at his position at Oxford University while the company building was being completed, while the other four travelled to America to make the film loops for Ealing. Thompson resigned from the university on 2 September 1969, taking on the work at Oxford Scientific Films full-time.\n\nThe company focused initially on filming nature at a microscopic level, including insect and aquatic wildlife. Using specialised equipment and camera techniques the developed themselves, the company gained fame for its ability to record never before seen footage of the natural world. Its cinematographers became experts in micro, macro, snorkel, slow-motion and time-lapse photography. As the company grew, it expanded into other innovating filming and post-production techniques, and moved from creating short loops to creating television programmes and series, commercials, and feature films.\n\nIn September 1996, Oxford Scientific Films was purchased by film and television rights company Circle Communications for £3.9 million. £3.85 million of the purchase price was paid in cash, with the rest paid through a stock exchange. Less than a year later, in May 1997, Australia-based Southern Star Entertainment made a £8.3 million take over bid for Circle Communications, due to its distribution business, strong catalogue, and the company's drama and factual production business. Oxford Scientific Films, which had retained its own identity under Circle Communications, became a core division of Southern Star Entertainment.\n\nOn 4 December 2003, Oxford Scientific's extensive libraries of over 350,000 still images and over 2,000 of film footage libraries were acquired by Photolibrary. The acquisition was done as a share exchange,with Photolibrary acquiring shares in Oxford Scientific Films Limited, and Southern Star paying A$1 million to purchase a 46.46% equity in Photolibrary. Photolibrary retained existing employees of the library divisions, and continues using the names \"Oxford Scientific\" and \"OSF\" in promoting the libraries. Southern Star retained full control of Oxford Scientific Films production unit, and through that unit, continues supplying images and footage to the Photolibrary.\n\nIn March 2008, parent company Southern Star Group merged its Sydney-based \"factual business unit\" into the Oxford Scientific Films division. The merged company now uses two brands, with the existing Oxford Scientific Films name being used for its \"specialist factual programmes\", while the Southern Star Factual brand will be used for \"features and factual entertainment shows.\"\n\nOxford Scientific Films has produced numerous award-winning programmes and films. In 1998, its film \"The Forbidden Fruit\" produced for the BBC's long-running series \"The Natural World\" and WNET Nature, won seven industry awards. \"Heroes of the High Frontier\", produced as a National Geographic Special, won four awards and was a finalist for the Best of the Show Grand Award Trophy at the New York Festivals.\n\nIn 2005, the company launched \"Meerkat Manor\", a docu-drama commissioned for Animal Planet. The series has since become Animal Planet's highest rated series, and has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival Awards and was a finalist at the 2006 Wildscreen Festival It won multiple awards at the 2006 Omni Awards and 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Gala. The series is also noted for capturing never before seen aspects of the lives of meerkats, being the first to capture meerkat infanticide on film, and for expanding the boundaries of the documentary genre.\n\n"}

{"id": "36922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36922", "title": "Quran", "text": "Quran\n\nThe Quran ( ; , literally meaning \"the recitation\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran) is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\"Allah\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (Arabic: سورة‎ \"sūrah\", plural سور \"suwar\"), which are subdivided into verses (Arabic: آية‎ \"āyāh\", plural آيات \"āyāt\").\n\nMuslims believe that the Quran was orally revealed by God to the final Prophet, Muhammad, through the archangel Gabriel (\"Jibril\"), incrementally over a period of some 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as Muhammad's most important miracle, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages starting with those revealed to Adam and ending with Muhammad. The word \"Quran\" occurs some 70 times in the Quran's text, and other names and words are also said to refer to the Quran.\n\nAccording to tradition, several of Muhammad's companions served as scribes and recorded the revelations. Shortly after his death, the Quran was compiled by the companions, who had written down or memorized parts of it. The codices showed differences that motivated Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version, now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.\n\nThe Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind . It sometimes offers detailed accounts of specific historical events, and it often emphasizes the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence. \"Hadith\" are additional oral and written traditions supplementing the Quran; from careful authentication they are believed to describe words and actions of Muhammad, and in some traditions also those closest to him. In most denominations of Islam, the Quran is used together with \"hadith\" to interpret \"sharia\" (Islamic) law; in a small number of denominations, only the Quran is used as a source. During prayers, the Quran is recited only in Arabic.\n\nSomeone who has memorized the entire Quran is called a \"hafiz\". Quranic verse (\"ayah\") is sometimes recited with a special kind of elocution reserved for this purpose, called \"tajwid\". During the month of Ramadan, Muslims typically complete the recitation of the whole Quran during \"tarawih\" prayers. In order to extrapolate the meaning of a particular Quranic verse, most Muslims rely on exegesis, or \"tafsir\".\n\nThe word appears about 70 times in the Quran itself, assuming various meanings. It is a verbal noun () of the Arabic verb (), meaning \"he read\" or \"he recited\". The Syriac equivalent is () , which refers to \"scripture reading\" or \"lesson\". While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the origin of the word is itself. Regardless, it had become an Arabic term by Muhammad's lifetime. An important meaning of the word is the \"act of reciting\", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: \"It is for Us to collect it and to recite it ().\"\n\nIn other verses, the word refers to \"an individual passage recited [by Muhammad]\". Its liturgical context is seen in a number of passages, for example: \"So when is recited, listen to it and keep silent.\" The word may also assume the meaning of a codified scripture when mentioned with other scriptures such as the Torah and Gospel.\n\nThe term also has closely related synonyms that are employed throughout the Quran. Each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning, but its use may converge with that of in certain contexts. Such terms include (book); (sign); and (scripture). The latter two terms also denote units of revelation. In the large majority of contexts, usually with a definite article (\"al-\"), the word is referred to as the \"revelation\" (\"waḥy\"), that which has been \"sent down\" (\"tanzīl\") at intervals. Other related words are: (remembrance), used to refer to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and (wisdom), sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it.\n\nThe Quran describes itself as \"the discernment\" (\"al-furqān\"), \"the mother book\" (\"umm al-kitāb\"), \"the guide\" (\"huda\"), \"the wisdom\" (\"hikmah\"), \"the remembrance\" (\"dhikr\") and \"the revelation\" (\"tanzīl\"; something sent down, signifying the descent of an object from a higher place to lower place). Another term is (The Book), though it is also used in the Arabic language for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Gospels. The term \"mus'haf\" ('written work') is often used to refer to particular Quranic manuscripts but is also used in the Quran to identify earlier revealed books.\n\nIslamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira during one of his isolated retreats to the mountains. Thereafter, he received revelations over a period of 23 years. According to \"hadith\" and Muslim history, after Muhammad immigrated to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to recite the Quran and to learn and teach the laws, which were revealed daily. It is related that some of the Quraysh who were taken prisoners at the Battle of Badr regained their freedom after they had taught some of the Muslims the simple writing of the time. Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate. As it was initially spoken, the Quran was recorded on tablets, bones, and the wide, flat ends of date palm fronds. Most suras were in use amongst early Muslims since they are mentioned in numerous sayings by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, the making of prayer and the manner of recitation. However, the Quran did not exist in book form at the time of Muhammad's death in 632. There is agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write down the revelation.\n\"Sahih al-Bukhari\" narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, \"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell\" and Aisha reported, \"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\" Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \"one mighty in power\", the one who \"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.\nThe Quran describes Muhammad as \"ummi\", which is traditionally interpreted as \"illiterate,\" but the meaning is rather more complex. Medieval commentators such as Al-Tabari maintained that the term induced two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; second, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures (but they gave priority to the first meaning). Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood. For example, according to Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading he possibly would have been suspected of having studied the books of the ancestors. Some scholars such as Watt prefer the second meaning of \"ummi\" – they take it to indicate unfamiliarity with earlier sacred texts.\n\nThe final verse of the Quran was revealed on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah in the year 10 A.H., a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632. The verse was revealed after the Prophet finished delivering his sermon at Ghadir Khumm.\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in the Battle of Yamama by Musaylimah. The first caliph, Abu Bakr (d. 634), subsequently decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.\nAccording to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib (d. 661) compiled a complete version of the Quran shortly after Muhammad's death. The order of this text differed from that gathered later during Uthman's era in that this version had been collected in chronological order. Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran in circulation. Other personal copies of the Quran might have existed including Ibn Mas'ud's and Ubay ibn Ka'b's codex, none of which exist today.\n\nThe Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance. University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.\n\nIn 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that were later proved to be the most ancient Quranic text known to exist at the time. The Sana'a manuscripts contain palimpsests, a manuscript page from which the text has been washed off to make the parchment reusable again—a practice which was common in ancient times due to scarcity of writing material. However, the faint washed-off underlying text (\"scriptio inferior\") is still barely visible and believed to be \"pre-Uthmanic\" Quranic content, while the text written on top (\"scriptio superior\") is believed to belong to Uthmanic time. Studies using radiocarbon dating indicate that the parchments are dated to the period before 671 CE with a 99 percent probability.\nIn 2015, fragments of a very early Quran, dating back to 1370 years ago, were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England. According to the tests carried out by Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, \"with a probability of more than 95%, the parchment was from between 568 and 645\". The manuscript is written in Hijazi script, an early form of written Arabic. This is possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran, but as the tests allow a range of possible dates, it cannot be said with certainty which of the existing versions is the oldest. Saudi scholar Saud al-Sarhan has expressed doubt over the age of the fragments as they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later.\n\nMuslims believe the Quran to be the book of divine guidance revealed from God to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years and view the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity.\n\nRevelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing an individual, conveying a message for a greater number of recipients. The process by which the divine message comes to the heart of a messenger of God is \"tanzil\" (to send down) or \"nuzūl\" (to come down). As the Quran says, \"With the truth we (God) have sent it down and with the truth it has come down.\"\n\nThe Quran frequently asserts in its text that it is divinely ordained. Some verses in the Quran seem to imply that even those who do not speak Arabic would understand the Quran if it were recited to them. The Quran refers to a written pre-text, \"the preserved tablet\", that records God's speech even before it was sent down.\n\nThe issue of whether the Quran is eternal or created became a theological debate (Quran's createdness) in the ninth century. Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on reason and rational thought, held that the Quran was created while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore uncreated. Sufi philosophers view the question as artificial or wrongly framed.\n\nMuslims believe that the present wording of the Quran corresponds to that revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran , it is protected from corruption (\"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian.\"). Muslims consider the Quran to be a guide, a sign of the prophethood of Muhammad and the truth of the religion.\n\nInimitability of the Quran (or \"I'jaz\") is the belief that no human speech can match the Quran in its content and form. The Quran is considered an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: \"If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another.\" So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations at the individual level and in history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.\n\nThe first sura of the Quran is repeated in daily prayers and in other occasions. This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most often recited sura of the Quran:\n\nPraised be God, Lord of the Universe, the Beneficent, the Merciful and Master of the Day of Judgment, You alone We do worship and from You alone we do seek assistance, guide us to the right path, the path of those to whom You have granted blessings, those who are neither subject to Your anger nor have gone astray.\"\n\nOther sections of the Quran of choice are also read in daily prayers.\n\nRespect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with reverence. Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of Quran (\"none shall touch but those who are clean\"), some Muslims believe that they must perform a ritual cleansing with water before touching a copy of the Quran, although this view is not universal. Worn-out copies of the Quran are wrapped in a cloth and stored indefinitely in a safe place, buried in a mosque or a Muslim cemetery, or burned and the ashes buried or scattered over water.\n\nIn Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism and jurisprudence, have been concerned with the Quran or have their foundation in its teachings. Muslims believe that the preaching or reading of the Quran is rewarded with divine rewards variously called \"ajr\", \"thawab\" or \"hasanat\".\n\nThe Quran also inspired Islamic arts and specifically the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination. The Quran is never decorated with figurative images, but many Qurans have been highly decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page, or between the lines or at the start of suras. Islamic verses appear in many other media, on buildings and on objects of all sizes, such as mosque lamps, metal work, pottery and single pages of calligraphy for muraqqas or albums.\n\nThe Quran consists of 114 chapters of varying lengths, each known as a \"sura\". Suras are classified as Meccan or Medinan, depending on whether the verses were revealed before or after the migration of Muhammad to the city of Medina. However, a sura classified as Medinan may contain Meccan verses in it and vice versa. Sura titles are derived from a name or quality discussed in the text, or from the first letters or words of the sura. Suras are arranged roughly in order of decreasing size. The sura arrangement is thus not connected to the sequence of revelation. Each sura except the ninth starts with the \"Bismillah\" (), an Arabic phrase meaning \"In the name of God\". There are, however, still 114 occurrences of the \"Bismillah\" in the Quran, due to its presence in Quran as the opening of Solomon's letter to the Queen of Sheba.\n\nEach sura consists of several verses, known as \"ayat\", which originally means a \"sign\" or \"evidence\" sent by God. The number of verses differs from sura to sura. An individual verse may be just a few letters or several lines. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6,236; however, the number varies if the \"bismillahs\" are counted separately.\n\nIn addition to and independent of the division into suras, there are various ways of dividing the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading. The 30 \"juz'\" (plural \"ajzāʼ\") can be used to read through the entire Quran in a month. Some of these parts are known by names—which are the first few words by which the \"juzʼ\" starts. A \"juz\"' is sometimes further divided into two \"ḥizb\" (plural \"aḥzāb\"), and each \"hizb\" subdivided into four \"rubʻ al-ahzab\". The Quran is also divided into seven approximately equal parts, \"manzil\" (plural \"manāzil\"), for it to be recited in a week.\n\nA different structure is provided by semantical units resembling paragraphs and comprising roughly ten \"ayat\" each. Such a section is called a rukū`.\n\nThe \"Muqattaʿat\" ( \"ḥurūf muqaṭṭaʿāt\" \"disjoined letters\" or \"disconnected letters\"; also \"mysterious letters\") are combinations of between one and five Arabic letters figuring at the beginning of 29 out of the 114 surahs (chapters) of the [Quran just after the basmala. The letters are also known as \"fawātih\" () or \"openers\" as they form the opening verse of their respective suras . Four surahs are named for their \"muqatta'at\", \"Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ\", \"Yāʾ-Sīn\", \"Ṣād\" and \" Qāf\". The original significance of the letters is unknown. Tafsir (exegesis) has interpreted them as abbreviations for either names or qualities of God or for the names or content of the respective surahs.\n\nAccording to one estimate the Quran consists of 77,430 words, 18,994 unique words, 12,183 stems, 3,382 lemmas and 1,685 roots.\n\nThe Quranic content is concerned with basic Islamic beliefs including the existence of God and the resurrection. Narratives of the early prophets, ethical and legal subjects, historical events of Muhammad's time, charity and prayer also appear in the Quran. The Quranic verses contain general exhortations regarding right and wrong and historical events are related to outline general moral lessons. Verses pertaining to natural phenomena have been interpreted by Muslims as an indication of the authenticity of the Quranic message.\n\nThe central theme of the Quran is monotheism. God is depicted as living, eternal, omniscient and omnipotent (see, e.g., Quran , , ). God's omnipotence appears above all in his power to create. He is the creator of everything, of the heavens and the earth and what is between them (see, e.g., Quran , , etc.). All human beings are equal in their utter dependence upon God, and their well-being depends upon their acknowledging that fact and living accordingly.\nThe Quran uses cosmological and contingency arguments in various verses without referring to the terms to prove the existence of God. Therefore, the universe is originated and needs an originator, and whatever exists must have a sufficient cause for its existence. Besides, the design of the universe is frequently referred to as a point of contemplation: \"It is He who has created seven heavens in harmony. You cannot see any fault in God's creation; then look again: Can you see any flaw?\"\n\nThe doctrine of the last day and eschatology (the final fate of the universe) may be reckoned as the second great doctrine of the Quran. It is estimated that approximately one-third of the Quran is eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with the day of judgment at the end of time. There is a reference to the afterlife on most pages of the Quran and belief in the afterlife is often referred to in conjunction with belief in God as in the common expression: \"Believe in God and the last day\". A number of suras such as 44, 56, 75, 78, 81 and 101 are directly related to the afterlife and its preparations. Some suras indicate the closeness of the event and warn people to be prepared for the imminent day. For instance, the first verses of Sura 22, which deal with the mighty earthquake and the situations of people on that day, represent this style of divine address: \"O People! Be respectful to your Lord. The earthquake of the Hour is a mighty thing.\"\n\nThe Quran is often vivid in its depiction of what will happen at the end time. Watt describes the Quranic view of End Time:\n\nThe Quran does not assert a natural immortality of the human soul, since man's existence is dependent on the will of God: when he wills, he causes man to die; and when he wills, he raises him to life again in a bodily resurrection.\n\nAccording to the Quran, God communicated with man and made his will known through signs and revelations. Prophets, or 'Messengers of God', received revelations and delivered them to humanity. The message has been identical and for all humankind. \"Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you, that your lord has at his Command forgiveness as well as a most Grievous Penalty.\" The revelation does not come directly from God to the prophets. Angels acting as God's messengers deliver the divine revelation to them. This comes out in Quran , in which it is stated: \"It is not for any mortal that God should speak to them, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal by his permission whatsoever He will.\"\n\nBelief is a fundamental aspect of morality in the Quran, and scholars have tried to determine the semantic contents of \"belief\" and \"believer\" in the Quran. The ethico-legal concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct are linked to a profound awareness of God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith, accountability, and the belief in each human's ultimate encounter with God. People are invited to perform acts of charity, especially for the needy. Believers who \"spend of their wealth by night and by day, in secret and in public\" are promised that they \"shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\". It also affirms family life by legislating on matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of practices, such as usury and gambling, are prohibited. The Quran is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic law (\"sharia\"). Some formal religious practices receive significant attention in the Quran including the formal prayers (\"salat\") and fasting in the month of Ramadan. As for the manner in which the prayer is to be conducted, the Quran refers to prostration. The term for charity, \"zakat\", literally means purification. Charity, according to the Quran, is a means of self-purification.\n\nThe astrophysicist Nidhal Guessoum while being highly critical of pseudo-scientific claims made about the Quran, has highlighted the encouragement for sciences that the Quran provides by developing \"the concept of knowledge.\" He writes: \"The Qur'an draws attention to the danger of conjecturing without evidence (\"And follow not that of which you have not the (certain) knowledge of...\" 17:36) and in several different verses asks Muslims to require proofs (\"Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful\" 2:111), both in matters of theological belief and in natural science.\" Guessoum cites Ghaleb Hasan on the definition of \"proof\" according the Quran being \"clear and strong... convincing evidence or argument.\" Also, such a proof cannot rely on an argument from authority, citing verse 5:104. Lastly, both assertions and rejections require a proof, according to verse 4:174. Ismail al-Faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any reawakening of the Muslim civilization must start with the Quran; however, the biggest obstacle on this route is the \"centuries old heritage of tafseer (exegesis) and other classical disciplines\" which inhibit a \"universal, epidemiological and systematic conception\" of the Quran's message. The philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, considered the Quran's methodology and epistemology to be empirical and rational.\n\nIt's generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the Quran dealing with natural phenomena. In many of these verses the study of nature is \"encouraged and highly recommended,\" and historical Islamic scientists like Al-Biruni and Al-Battani derived their inspiration from verses of the Quran. Mohammad Hashim Kamali has stated that \"scientific observation, experimental knowledge and rationality\" are the primary tools with which humanity can achieve the goals laid out for it in the Quran. Ziauddin Sardar built a case for Muslims having developed the foundations of modern science, by highlighting the repeated calls of the Quran to observe and reflect upon natural phenomenon.\n\nThe physicist Abdus Salam, in his Nobel Prize banquet address, quoted a well known verse from the Quran (67:3–4) and then stated: \"This in effect is the faith of all physicists: the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement of our gaze\". One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and the discoveries that science allows humanity to make about nature and the universe. Salam also held the opinion that the Quran and the Islamic spirit of study and rational reflection was the source of extraordinary civilizational development. Salam highlights, in particular, the work of Ibn al-Haytham and Al-Biruni as the pioneers of empiricism who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving birth to modern science. Salam was also careful to differentiate between metaphysics and physics, and advised against empirically probing certain matters on which \"physics is silent and will remain so,\" such as the doctrine of \"creation from nothing\" which in Salam's view is outside the limits of science and thus \"gives way\" to religious considerations.\n\nThe Quran's message is conveyed with various literary structures and devices. In the original Arabic, the suras and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that assist the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text. Muslims assert (according to the Quran itself) that the Quranic content and style is inimitable.\n\nThe language of the Quran has been described as \"rhymed prose\" as it partakes of both poetry and prose; however, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others. Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.\n\nThe Quranic text seems to have no beginning, middle, or end, its nonlinear structure being akin to a web or net. The textual arrangement is sometimes considered to exhibit lack of continuity, absence of any chronological or thematic order and repetitiousness. Michael Sells, citing the work of the critic Norman O. Brown, acknowledges Brown's observation that the seeming disorganization of Quranic literary expression – its scattered or fragmented mode of composition in Sells's phrase – is in fact a literary device capable of delivering profound effects as if the intensity of the prophetic message were shattering the vehicle of human language in which it was being communicated. Sells also addresses the much-discussed repetitiveness of the Quran, seeing this, too, as a literary device.\n\nA text is self-referential when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself. According to Stefan Wild, the Quran demonstrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted. Self-referentiality is evident in those passages where the Quran refers to itself as revelation (\"tanzil\"), remembrance (\"dhikr\"), news (\"naba\"'), criterion (\"furqan\") in a self-designating manner (explicitly asserting its Divinity, \"And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down; so are you now denying it?\"), or in the frequent appearance of the \"Say\" tags, when Muhammad is commanded to speak (e.g., \"Say: 'God's guidance is the true guidance'\", \"Say: 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God?'\"). According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential. The feature is more evident in early Meccan suras.\n\nThe Quran has sparked a huge body of commentary and explication (\"tafsir\"), aimed at explaining the \"meanings of the Quranic verses, clarifying their import and finding out their significance\".\n\nTafsir is one of the earliest academic activities of Muslims. According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person who described the meanings of verses for early Muslims. Other early exegetes included a few Companions of Muhammad, like ʻAli ibn Abi Talib, ʻAbdullah ibn Abbas, ʻAbdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kaʻb. Exegesis in those days was confined to the explanation of literary aspects of the verse, the background of its revelation and, occasionally, interpretation of one verse with the help of the other. If the verse was about a historical event, then sometimes a few traditions (\"hadith\") of Muhammad were narrated to make its meaning clear.\n\nBecause the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the later converts to Islam (mostly non-Arabs) did not always understand the Quranic Arabic, they did not catch allusions that were clear to early Muslims fluent in Arabic and they were concerned with reconciling apparent conflict of themes in the Quran. Commentators erudite in Arabic explained the allusions, and perhaps most importantly, explained which Quranic verses had been revealed early in Muhammad's prophetic career, as being appropriate to the very earliest Muslim community, and which had been revealed later, canceling out or \"abrogating\" (\"nāsikh\") the earlier text (\"mansūkh\"). Other scholars, however, maintain that no abrogation has taken place in the Quran. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, with the name \"Tafseer e Kabir\".. Following this commentary, a five volume English commentary was also published as The English Commentary of the Holy Quran.\n\nEsoteric or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meanings of the Quran. Sufism moves beyond the apparent (\"zahir\") point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric (\"batin\") and metaphysical dimensions of consciousness and existence. According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are allusions (\"isharat\") rather than explanations (\"tafsir\"). They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each writer.\n\nSufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keeler, also exemplifies the use of the theme of love, as for instance can be seen in Qushayri's interpretation of the Quran. Quran says:\n\nMoses, in 7:143, comes the way of those who are in love, he asks for a vision but his desire is denied, he is made to suffer by being commanded to look at other than the Beloved while the mountain is able to see God. The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\n\nMuhammad Husayn Tabatabaei says that according to the popular explanation among the later exegetes, \"ta'wil\" indicates the particular meaning a verse is directed towards. The meaning of revelation (\"tanzil\"), as opposed to \"ta'wil\", is clear in its accordance to the obvious meaning of the words as they were revealed. But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of \"ta'wil\", which originally meant \"to return\" or \"the returning place\". In Tabatabaei's view, what has been rightly called \"ta'wil\", or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran, is not concerned simply with the denotation of words. Rather, it is concerned with certain truths and realities that transcend the comprehension of the common run of men; yet it is from these truths and realities that the principles of doctrine and the practical injunctions of the Quran issue forth. Interpretation is not the meaning of the verse—rather it transpires through that meaning, in a special sort of transpiration. There is a spiritual reality—which is the main objective of ordaining a law, or the basic aim in describing a divine attribute—and then there is an actual significance that a Quranic story refers to.\n\nAccording to Shia beliefs, those who are firmly rooted in knowledge like Muhammad and the imams know the secrets of the Quran. According to Tabatabaei, the statement \"none knows its interpretation except God\" remains valid, without any opposing or qualifying clause. Therefore, so far as this verse is concerned, the knowledge of the Quran's interpretation is reserved for God. But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know the interpretation of the Quran to a certain extent.\n\nAccording to Tabatabaei, there are acceptable and unacceptable esoteric interpretations. Acceptable \"ta'wil\" refers to the meaning of a verse beyond its literal meaning; rather the implicit meaning, which ultimately is known only to God and can't be comprehended directly through human thought alone. The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, satisfaction, anger and sorrow, which are apparently attributed to God. Unacceptable \"ta'wil\" is where one \"transfers\" the apparent meaning of a verse to a different meaning by means of a proof; this method is not without obvious inconsistencies. Although this unacceptable \"ta'wil\" has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to the Quranic verses. The correct interpretation is that reality a verse refers to. It is found in all verses, the decisive and the ambiguous alike; it is not a sort of a meaning of the word; it is a fact that is too sublime for words. God has dressed them with words to bring them a bit nearer to our minds; in this respect they are like proverbs that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the hearer to clearly grasp the intended idea.\n\nOne of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is Sulami (d. 1021) without whose work the majority of very early Sufi commentaries would not have been preserved. Sulami's major commentary is a book named \"haqaiq al-tafsir\" (\"Truths of Exegesis\") which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Daylami (d. 1193), Shirazi (d. 1209) and Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) \"kashf al-asrar\" (\"the unveiling of the secrets\"). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book \"Mathnawi\". Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in \"Mathnawi\", which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work \"ruh al-Bayan\" (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis. Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali).\n\nUnlike the Salafis and Zahiri, Shias and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe the meaning of the Quran is not restricted to the literal aspect. For them, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has inward aspects. Henry Corbin narrates a \"hadith\" that goes back to Muhammad:\n\nThe Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning (this depth possesses a depth, after the image of the celestial Spheres, which are enclosed within each other). So it goes on for seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth).\n\nAccording to this view, it has also become evident that the inner meaning of the Quran does not eradicate or invalidate its outward meaning. Rather, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body. Corbin considers the Quran to play a part in Islamic philosophy, because gnosiology itself goes hand in hand with prophetology.\n\nCommentaries dealing with the \"zahir\" (outward aspects) of the text are called \"tafsir\", and hermeneutic and esoteric commentaries dealing with the \"batin\" are called \"ta'wil\" (\"interpretation\" or \"explanation\"), which involves taking the text back to its beginning. Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God. In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahiris, is the belief that the Quran should only be taken at its apparent meaning.\n\nReappropriation is the name of the hermeneutical style of some ex-Muslims who have converted to Christianity. Their style or reinterpretation is ad hoc and unsystematized and geared towards apologetics. This tradition of interpretation draws on the following practices: grammatical renegotiation, renegotiation of textual preference, retrieval, and concession.\n\nTranslating the Quran has always been problematic and difficult. Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in another language or form. Furthermore, an Arabic word may have a range of meanings depending on the context, making an accurate translation even more difficult.\n\nNevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian, and European languages. The first translator of the Quran was Salman the Persian, who translated surat \"al-Fatiha\" into Persian during the seventh century. Another translation of the Quran was completed in 884 in Alwar (Sindh, India, now Pakistan) by the orders of Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz on the request of the Hindu Raja Mehruk.\n\nThe first fully attested complete translations of the Quran were done between the 10th and 12th centuries in Persian. The Samanid king, Mansur I (961–976), ordered a group of scholars from Khorasan to translate the Tafsir al-Tabari, originally in Arabic, into Persian. Later in the 11th century, one of the students of Abu Mansur Abdullah al-Ansari wrote a complete \"tafsir\" of the Quran in Persian. In the 12th century, Najm al-Din Abu Hafs al-Nasafi translated the Quran into Persian. The manuscripts of all three books have survived and have been published several times.\n\nIslamic tradition also holds that translations were made for Emperor Negus of Abyssinia and Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, as both received letters by Muhammad containing verses from the Quran. In early centuries, the permissibility of translations was not an issue, but whether one could use translations in prayer.\n\nIn 1936, translations in 102 languages were known. In 2010, the \"Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review\" reported that the Quran was presented in 112 languages at the 18th International Quran Exhibition in Tehran.\n\nRobert of Ketton's 1143 translation of the Quran for Peter the Venerable, \"Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete\", was the first into a Western language (Latin).\nAlexander Ross offered the first English version in 1649, from the French translation of \"L'Alcoran de Mahomet\" (1647) by Andre du Ryer. In 1734, George Sale produced the first scholarly translation of the Quran into English; another was produced by Richard Bell in 1937, and yet another by Arthur John Arberry in 1955. All these translators were non-Muslims. There have been numerous translations by Muslims. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has published translations of the Quran in 50 different languages besides a five-volume English commentary and an English translation of the Quran.\n\nAs with translations of the Bible, the English translators have sometimes favored archaic English words and constructions over their more modern or conventional equivalents; for example, two widely read translators, A. Yusuf Ali and M. Marmaduke Pickthall, use the plural and singular \"ye\" and \"thou\" instead of the more common \"you\".\n\nThe oldest Gurumukhi translation of the Quran Sharif in Gurmukhi has been found in village Lande of Moga district of Punjab which was printed in 1911.\n\nThe proper recitation of the Quran is the subject of a separate discipline named \"tajwid\" which determines in detail how the Quran should be recited, how each individual syllable is to be pronounced, the need to pay attention to the places where there should be a pause, to elisions, where the pronunciation should be long or short, where letters should be sounded together and where they should be kept separate, etc. It may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the Quran and covers three main areas: the proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels (the articulation of the Quranic phonemes), the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation, and the musical and melodious features of recitation.\n\nIn order to avoid incorrect pronunciation, reciters who are not native speakers of Arabic language follow a program of training in countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia. The recitations of a few Egyptian reciters were highly influential in the development of the art of recitation. Southeast Asia is well known for world-class recitation, evidenced in the popularity of the woman reciters such as Maria Ulfah of Jakarta.\n\nThere are two types of recitation: \"murattal\" is at a slower pace, used for study and practice. \"Mujawwad\" refers to a slow recitation that deploys heightened technical artistry and melodic modulation, as in public performances by trained experts. It is directed to and dependent upon an audience for the \"mujawwad\" reciter seeks to involve the listeners.\n\nVocalization markers indicating specific vowel sounds were introduced into the Arabic language by the end of the 9th century. The first Quranic manuscripts lacked these marks, therefore several recitations remain acceptable. The variation in readings of the text permitted by the nature of the defective vocalization led to an increase in the number of readings during the 10th century. The 10th-century Muslim scholar from Baghdad, Ibn Mujāhid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable textual readings of the Quran. He studied various readings and their trustworthiness and chose seven 8th-century readers from the cities of Mecca, Medina, Kufa, Basra and Damascus. Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers, rather than six or ten, but this may be related to a prophetic tradition (Muhammad's saying) reporting that the Quran had been revealed in seven \"ahruf\" (meaning seven letters or modes). Today, the most popular readings are those transmitted by Ḥafṣ (d. 796) and Warsh (d. 812) which are according to two of Ibn Mujahid's reciters, Aasim ibn Abi al-Najud (Kufa, d. 745) and Nafi‘ al-Madani (Medina, d. 785), respectively. The influential standard Quran of Cairo (1924) uses an elaborate system of modified vowel-signs and a set of additional symbols for minute details and is based on ʻAsim's recitation, the 8th-century recitation of Kufa. This edition has become the standard for modern printings of the Quran.\n\nThe variant readings of the Quran are one type of textual variant. According to Melchert, the majority of disagreements have to do with vowels to supply, most of them in turn not conceivably reflecting dialectal differences and about one in eight disagreements has to do with whether to place dots above or below the line.\n\nNasser categorizes variant readings into various subtypes, including internal vowels, long vowels, gemination (shaddah), assimilation and alternation.\n\nOccasionally, an early Quran shows compatibility with a particular reading. A Syrian manuscript from the 8th century is shown to have been written according to the reading of Ibn Amir ad-Dimashqi. Another study suggests that this manuscript bears the vocalization of himsi region.\n\nBefore printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was transmitted in manuscripts made by calligraphers and copyists. The earliest manuscripts were written in \"Ḥijāzī\"-type script. The \"Hijazi\" style manuscripts nevertheless confirm that transmission of the Quran in writing began at an early stage. Probably in the ninth century, scripts began to feature thicker strokes, which are traditionally known as \"Kufic\" scripts. Toward the end of the ninth century, new scripts began to appear in copies of the Quran and replace earlier scripts. The reason for discontinuation in the use of the earlier style was that it took too long to produce and the demand for copies was increasing. Copyists would therefore choose simpler writing styles. Beginning in the 11th century, the styles of writing employed were primarily the \"naskh\", \"muhaqqaq\", \"rayḥānī\" and, on rarer occasions, the \"thuluth\" script. \"Naskh\" was in very widespread use. In North Africa and Spain, the \"Maghribī\" style was popular. More distinct is the \"Bihari\" script which was used solely in the north of India. \"Nastaʻlīq\" style was also rarely used in Persian world.\n\nIn the beginning, the Quran did not have vocalization markings. The system of vocalization, as we know it today, seems to have been introduced towards the end of the ninth century. Since it would have been too costly for most Muslims to purchase a manuscript, copies of the Quran were held in mosques in order to make them accessible to people. These copies frequently took the form of a series of 30 parts or \"juzʼ\". In terms of productivity, the Ottoman copyists provide the best example. This was in response to widespread demand, unpopularity of printing methods and for aesthetic reasons.\n\nWood-block printing of extracts from the Quran is on record as early as the 10th century.\n\nArabic movable type printing was ordered by Pope Julius II (r. 1503–1512) for distribution among Middle Eastern Christians. The first complete Quran printed with movable type was produced in Venice in 1537/1538 for the Ottoman market by Paganino Paganini and Alessandro Paganini. Two more editions include those published by the pastor Abraham Hinckelmann in Hamburg in 1694, and by Italian priest Ludovico Maracci in Padua in 1698 with Latin translation and commentary.\n\nPrinted copies of the Quran during this period met with strong opposition from Muslim legal scholars: printing anything in Arabic was prohibited in the Ottoman empire between 1483 and 1726—initially, even on penalty of death. The Ottoman ban on printing in Arabic script was lifted in 1726 for non-religious texts only upon the request of Ibrahim Muteferrika, who printed his first book in 1729. Very few books, and no religious texts, were printed in the Ottoman Empire for another century.\n\nIn 1786, Catherine the Great of Russia, sponsored a printing press for \"Tatar and Turkish orthography\" in Saint Petersburg, with one Mullah Osman Ismail responsible for producing the Arabic types. A Quran was printed with this press in 1787, reprinted in 1790 and 1793 in Saint Petersburg, and in 1803 in Kazan. The first edition printed in Iran appeared in Tehran (1828), a translation in Turkish was printed in Cairo in 1842, and the first officially sanctioned Ottoman edition was finally printed in Constantinople between 1875 and 1877 as a two-volume set, during the First Constitutional Era.\n\nGustav Flügel published an edition of the Quran in 1834 in Leipzig, which remained authoritative for close to a century, until Cairo's Al-Azhar University published an edition of the Quran in 1924. This edition was the result of a long preparation as it standardized Quranic orthography and remains the basis of later editions.\n\nThe Quran's statements on the creation of the universe and earth, the origins of human life, biology, earth sciences and so on have been criticized by scientists as containing fallacies, being unscientific, and likely to be contradicted by evolving scientific theories. Several scholars have said that it lacks clarity despite calling itself a clear book.\n\nThe Quran speaks well of the relationship it has with former books (the Torah and the Gospels) and attributes their similarities to their unique origin and saying all of them have been revealed by the one God.\n\nThe Quran's language was similar to the Syriac language according to The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran. The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament.\n\nSome non-Muslim groups such as Baha'is and Druze view the Quran as holy. Unitarian Universalists may also seek inspiration from the Quran. The Quran has been noted to have certain narratives similarities to the Diatessaron, Protoevangelium of James, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and the Arabic Infancy Gospel. One scholar has suggested that the Diatessaron, as a gospel harmony, may have led to the conception that the Christian Gospel is one text.\n\nAfter the Quran, and the general rise of Islam, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly into an art form.\n\nWadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at University of Chicago, and Mustansir Mir, Professor of Islamic studies at Youngstown State University, state:\n\n\nIntroductory texts:\n\nTraditional Quranic commentaries (tafsir):\n\n\nTopical studies:\n\nLiterary criticism:\n\nEncyclopedias:\n\nAcademic journals:\nQuran browsers and translations:\n\nWord-for-word analysis:\n\nManuscripts:\n\nOther resources:\n"}

The plaintiff reduced the damages sought to less than $75,000 and petitioned for remand to state court because the amount in controversy requirement was no longer met. The 6th Circuit upheld a denial of the petition for remand, holding that the amount in controversy at the time of removal was what mattered.\n"}

{"id": "69211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69211", "title": "Song of Ascents", "text": "Song of Ascents\n\nSong of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134 (119–133 in the Septuagint and the Vulgate), each starting with the superscription Shir Hama'aloth (, meaning \"Song of the Ascents\"). They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs.\n\nFour of them (Psalms 122, 124, 131, and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Three of them (Psalms 131, 133, and 134) have only three verses. The longest is psalm 132 (18 verses).\n\nMany scholars believe the title indicates that these psalms were sung by worshippers as they ascended the road to Jerusalem to attend the three pilgrim festivals (). Others think they were sung by the Levite singers as they ascended the fifteen steps to minister at the Temple in Jerusalem. One view says the Levites first sang the Songs at the dedication of Solomon's temple during the night of the fifteenth of Tishri 959 BC. Another study suggests that they were composed for a celebration after Nehemiah's rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls in 445 BC. Others consider that they may originally have been individual poems which were later collected together and given the title linking them to pilgrimage after the Babylonian captivity.\n\nThey were well suited for being sung by their poetic form and the sentiments they express. \"They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [\"i.e.\", repetition], and by their epigrammatic style... More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful.\" As a collection, they contain a number of repeated formulaic phrases, as well as an emphasis on Zion.\n\nThere are two references to the Songs of Ascents in the Mishnah, noting the correspondence between the fifteen songs and the temple's fifteen steps between the Israelite's court and the women's court. Rashi refers to a Talmudic legend that King David composed or sang the fifteen songs to calm rising waters at the foundation of the temple.\n\nPsalm 126, eponymously called \"Shir Hamaalot\" due to its common use, is traditionally recited before the Grace After Meals on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, and other festive occasions in keeping with its themes of joy and redemption. The psalm is sung to a wide variety of tunes both liturgical and secular. The most well-known melody in the Ashkenazi Jewish world is that by Cantor Pinchas Minkowsky which was recorded by Cantor Yossle Rosenblatt.\n\nIt is traditional for some Jews to place a copy of Psalm 121 in the labor and delivery room to promote an easy labor by asking God for mercy. As well, it is placed on the baby's carriage and in the baby's room to protect the child and surround them in learning and with holy objects.\n\nThe liturgical use of these psalms came into Christianity through its Jewish roots. The form of the Scriptures used in the Early Church, at least so far as the Hebrew Bible was concerned, was primarily the Septuagint. In the Septuagint, these psalms are numbered 119–133.\n\nMany early hermits observed the practice of reciting the entire Psalter daily, coenobitic communities would chant the entire Psalter through in a week, so these psalms would be said on a regular basis, during the course of the Canonical hours.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the Songs of Degrees (Greek: \"anabathmoi\") make up the Eighteenth Kathisma (division of the Psalter), and are read on Friday evenings at Vespers throughout the liturgical year. The Kathisma is divided into three sections (called \"stases\") of five psalms each.\n\nDuring Great Lent the Eighteenth Kathisma is read every weekday (Monday through Friday evening) at Vespers, and on Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week. In the Slavic usage this Kathisma is also read from the apodosis of the Exaltation of the Cross up to the forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, and from the apodosis of Theophany up to the Sunday of the Prodigal Son. The reason for this is that the nights are longer in winter, especially in the northern latitudes, so during this season three Kathismata will be chanted at Matins instead of two, so in order to still have a reading from the Psalter at Vespers, the Eighteenth Kathisma is repeated.\n\nAt Matins on Sundays and feast days throughout the year, special hymns called \"anabathmoi\" (, from βαθμός, 'step'; Slavonic: \"stepénnyi\") are chanted immediately before the prokeimenon and Matins Gospel. These anabathmoi are compositions based upon the Songs of Ascents, and are written in the eight tones of Byzantine chant. The Anabathmoi for each tone consists of three \"stases\" or sets of verses (sometimes called antiphons), except for Tone 8 which has four stases. On Sundays, the anabathmoi are chanted according to the tone of the week; on feast days which do not fall on Sunday, the Anabathmoi almost always consist of the first stasis in Tone 4 (based on Psalm 128).\n\nSymbolically, the anabathmoi are chanted as a reminder that Christians are ascending to the Heavenly Jerusalem, and that the spiritual intensity of the service is rising as they approach the reading of the Gospel.\n\nThe Western Daily Office was strongly influenced by the Rule of St. Benedict, where these psalms are assigned to Terce, Sext and None on weekdays. Over the centuries, however, various schedules have been used for reciting the psalms. In the modern Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church, the Gradual Psalms are used in several ways:\n\n"}

The definitive book on the subject (Cowie 2009) includes chapters on (among others) dictionaries of:\n\n\nDictionaries of idioms and slang are common in most cultures. Examples include (of French) the \"Dictionnaire des expressions et locutions\", edited by Alain Rey (Paris: Le Robert 2006), and (of English) Eric Partridge's \"Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English\" (8th edition, London: Routledge 2002). In the area of language learning, there are specialized dictionaries for aspects of language which tend to be unproblematic for mother-tongue speakers but may cause difficulty for learners. These include dictionaries of phrasal verbs, such as the \"Oxford Phrasal Verbs Dictionary\" (2nd edition, Oxford University Press: 2006), and dictionaries of collocation, such as \"Macmillan Collocations Dictionary\" (Oxford: Macmillan 2010).\n\nOne of the most common types of specialized dictionary is what is often referred to in English as a technical dictionary and in German as a Fachwörterbuch. These dictionaries cover the terminology of a particular subject field or discipline. As described in Nielsen (1994), dictionaries of this type can be classified in various ways. A dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a multi-field dictionary; one that covers one subject field is called a single-field dictionary; and one that covers a limited part of a subject field is called a sub-field dictionary. A technical dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the relevant terminology as possible is called a maximizing dictionary, whereas one that attempts to cover only a limited part of the relevant terminology is called a minimizing dictionary.\n\nSpecialized dictionaries can have various functions, i.e. they can help users in different types of situation. Monolingual dictionaries can help users understand and produce texts, whereas bilingual dictionaries can help users understand texts, translate texts and produce texts, as described in e.g. Nielsen (1994) and Nielsen (2010).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49242742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49242742", "title": "Yunhai jingyuan", "text": "Yunhai jingyuan\n\nThe (c. 780) Yunhai jingyuan 韻海鏡源 Ocean of Rhymes, Mirror of Sources Chinese dictionary, which was compiled by the Tang dynasty official and calligrapher Yan Zhengqing (709–785), was the first phonologically-arranged rime dictionary of words rather than characters. Although the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" is a lost work, several later dictionaries, such as the (1711) \"Peiwen Yunfu\", followed its system of collating entries by the tone and rime of the last character in a term.\n\nThe title \"Yunhai jingyuan\" compounds four words (translation equivalents from Wenlin 2015):\n\nEnglish translations include:\n\nThe \"Yunhai jingyuan\" included 26,911 character head entries and comprised 360 volumes (\"juǎn\" 卷 \"roll; volume\"; Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72). By any standards, it was a very large dictionary, and \"by the standards of the time it must have been simply gigantic\" (Needham and Harbsmeier 1998: 78). For more than two centuries, the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" remained the most inclusive Chinese dictionary, until the (1039) \"Jiyun\" with 53,525 character entries.\n\nCompared with two contemporary 100-volume dictionaries, the \"Guiyuan zhucong\" 桂苑珠叢 by Zhuge Ying 諸葛潁 (539-615) and the 100-volume \"Zihai\" 字海 compiled under the direction of Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690-705), the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" was an \"even more miraculous lexicographical work\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 178).\n\nChinese dictionaries are traditionally dichotomized between \"zìdiǎn\" 字典 \"character dictionaries\" and \"cídiǎn\" 辭典 \"word dictionaries\". In the history of Chinese lexicography, the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" was the earliest hybrid of a word dictionary and a rime dictionary (Yong and Peng 2008: 226). Earlier rime dictionaries that only included characters include (c. 230) \"Shenglei\" and the (601) \"Qieyun\", which was revised as the (720) \"Tangyun\" 唐韻.\n\nIn 773, during the reign of Emperor Daizong of Tang (r. 762-779). Yan Zhengqing assembled a group of over 50 scholars with diverse backgrounds to compile the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" at his residence in Huzhou. They included several of his literary friends, the Daoist poet Zhang Zhihe, the Chan Buddhist monk Jiaoran 皎然, and Lu Yu, author of \"The Classic of Tea\" (Benn 2015: 108). In the same year, the \"Yunhailou\" 韻海樓 \"Ocean of Rhymes Building\" was constructed as the depository for its namesake \"Yunhai jingyuan\". The building was restored in 1666, and is presently a municipal library and cultural center in Huzhou, Zhejiang prefecture.\n\nYan Zhengqing's reference work included not only single-syllable words but also multi-character compounds, and even some \"chengyu\" \"set phrases\". This type of specialized dictionary was intended for the composition of poems, retrieving literary quotations, and finding appropriate words for antithetical couplets (Yong and Peng 2008: 330).\n\nThe word or phrase entries in the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" were phonologically arranged by the 106 rime groups of the \"Píngshuǐ\" (lit. 平水 \"level water\") system, which is based on the traditional four tones: \"ping\" \"level\", \"shang\" \"rising\", \"qu\" \"departing\", and \"ru\" \"entering\". Note that the term \"rime\" is used, as opposed to common rhyme, in the linguistic sense of syllable rime or Chinese rime table. A dictionary user looks up a word by the tone and rime of the final character, which presumes that the user already knows, or can guess, how to pronounce the character. For speakers of alphabetic languages who are familiar with easy dictionary lookup, using a Chinese dictionary based on the \"Yunhai jingyuan\" system is very user-unfriendly.\n\nThree later dictionaries of literary allusions followed the 106-rime arrangement of the \"Yunhai jingyuan\". First were the Yuan dynasty (c. 1280) \"Yunfu qunyu\" 韻府群玉 \"Assembly of Jade Tablets, a Word-Store arranged by Rhymes\" compiled by Yin Shifu 陰時夫 and the Ming dynasty (1592) \"Wuche yunrui\" 五車韻瑞 \"Five Cartloads of Rhyme-inscribed Jade Tablets\" by Ling Zhilong 淩稚隆. Ultimately the Qing dynasty (1711) \"Peiwen yunfu\" \"Word-store arranged by Rhymes, from the Hall of the Admiration of Literature\" expanded entries and corrected errors in previous rime dictionaries, resulting in 212 volumes with 10,257 head entries arranged by the 106 \"Pingshui\" rime categories (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 219; Yong and Peng 2008: 330).\n\nThe (1728) Pianzi leipian 駢字類編 \"Classified Collection of Phrases and Literary Allusions\" dictionary was the first dictionary to abandon the traditional \"Yunhai jingyuan\" system of indexing words by their last character's rime and tone, and it indexed words by their first character (Needham et al. 1986: 219). Most subsequent Chinese word dictionaries were internally arranged by the graphic radical of the first character in a word.\n\n\n\n"}
