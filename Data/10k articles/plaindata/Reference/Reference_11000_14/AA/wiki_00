The museum specialises in the material history of China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia, from which the diverse ethnic groups of Singapore trace their ancestry.\n\nThe museum first opened at the Old Tao Nan School building on 22 April 1997 at Armenian Street, with exhibits largely centred on Chinese civilisation. With the restoration of the Empress Place Building, the museum established its new flagship museum there on 2 March 2003, rapidly expanding the collection to other areas of Asia. The Armenian Street branch closed for renovations on 1 January 2006 and reopened on 25 April 2008 as the Peranakan Museum, specialising in Peranakan culture. \nOn 16 September 2006, the Museum officially launched its new logo with a new slogan \"The Asian Civilisations Museum – Where Asian Cultures Come Alive!\". This new logo reflects the museum's unique location by the historic Singapore River, the source and origin of Singapore multicultural society, which the ACM presents in its collection. The brown reflected image also alludes to the museum as a place for reflection, while the vibrant orange is an invigorating colour which represents activity and energy.\n\nIn late 2013, after undergoing a rebranding exercise, the Museum launched its new logo with a new slogan \"Singapore's Museum of Asia\".\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the Museum was named the top museum in Singapore and ranked ninth in Asia by TripAdvisor’s Travellers’ Choice awards. The Museum was the only Singapore museum ranked among Asia's top 10 museums.\n\nOn 15 November 2015, the Museum unveiled its new spaces after it started its revamp in 2014. The revamp is carried out in phases: Phase 1 was unveiled on 14 November 2015. Phase 2 was completed in April 2016, with further enhancements to follow.\n\nThe Chinese collection is represented by fine Dehua porcelain figures, Taoist and Buddhistic statuary, export porcelain, calligraphy and other examples of decorative art.\n\nThe South Asian Galleries feature statuary from a broad spectrum of periods including some fine Chola bronzes. Of particularly note is the Chola bronze sculpture of Uma, the consort of Shiva and that of Somaskanda. The early Buddhist art of India is also represented by works hailing from the Mathura and Gandhara schools, including a rare sandstone Mathura Buddha dating to the Kanishka era, and the head of a Gandharan Bodhisattva. Other areas of note include South Indian woodwork, Nepali-Tibetan bronzes, textiles, late medieval miniatures and colonial prints.\n\nThe Southeast Asian collections are broad in scope and are rich in ethnological material. Representing the aristocratic art of ancient Southeast Asia are Khmer sculptures, Javanese temple sculpture (some on loan from Leiden), later Buddhist art from Burma/Thailand and the Sinicised temple art of Vietnam. Peranakan gold, textiles, tribal ornament and theatrical masks are other strengths of the collection.\n\nThe Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is the permanent home for the cargo recovered from the Tang Shipwreck, a sunken 9th century trading ship bound for Iran and Iraq, discovered in 1998 off Belitung Island in the Java Sea. The recovered cargo comprises more than 60,000 well-preserved ceramics produced in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907), as well as objects of gold and silver. \n\nCertain gallery rooms are also used for temporary exhibitions. A recent exhibition included the display of the spectacular Bronze Age masks from Sanxingdui, Sichuan Province, China.\n\nThe museum has a restaurant, Empress, featuring traditional Chinese dishes in a contemporary setting, and a café, Privé ACM, offering all day dining. There are ballrooms and halls available for functions. The museum shop has souvenirs and a wide range of books on Asian art.\n\nPeranakan Museum\n"}

Established in 1966, members include record collectors, discographers, and audio engineers, together with librarians, curators, archivists, and researchers.\n\nARSC was founded in 1966 by a group of academics, primarily music librarians, who felt that contemporary professional associations such as the Music Library Association (MLA) were not paying enough attention to the special needs of recorded sound archives, and that scholars were giving too little attention to historical recorded sound as opposed to printed sources. In contrast to professional organizations such as the MLA and the American Library Association, ARSC by design also welcomed private record collectors, since they held (and needed to preserve) many important recordings that were not present in institutional collections. Furthermore, ARSC was intended to bring together collectors from all genres, classical, jazz, popular, etc., as well as those concerned with spoken word recordings.\n\nAfter three organizational meetings in 1965 and 1966, and the election of its first president, Philip L. Miller, Chief of the Music Division, New York Public Library, ARSC's first annual conference was held at Indiana University in March 1967. Its first publication was the \"Preliminary Directory of Sound Recording Collections in the United States and Canada\" (1967), listing 1,500 public and private collections. This was followed by the launch of the \"ARSC Journal\" (1968), the \"ARSC Newsletter\" (1977), and other publications. Other important projects have included The Rigler-Deutsch Index, a union catalog of the 615,000 78 rpm holdings of five major public archives. Data from this massive project is now part of the WorldCat online library catalog.\n\nARSC is governed by an eight-person board of directors, seven of whom are elected biennially by the membership. The eighth, the executive director, is appointed by the president with the approval of the board, is non-voting, and handles day-to-day operations. In the early years ARSC's leadership consisted primarily of professional archivists, but in later years it broadened to include scholars and private collectors, several of whom have served as president. A historical listing of officers and committee chairs can be found on the association's website.\n\nAlthough ARSC is based in the U.S., about ten percent of its membership is located in other countries. The association maintains close relations with the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) and is a member of the Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations (CCAAA), an international umbrella group concerned with audiovisual preservation matters worldwide.\n\n\nARSC has held an annual conference each year since 1967. It generally takes place over three days between April and June in a city in the United States, though two conferences have taken place in Canada and one in London. Several conferences have been held jointly with the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives. Typically, there are two session tracks, one focusing on artists and repertoire, musical genres, collecting, and discographies, the other on technical issues of audio preservation and restoration, library cataloging issues, the history of recorded sound, etc. Cumulatively, approximately 1,200 papers and panels have been presented through 2015, and nearly all have been professionally audio (and sometimes video) recorded and made available to members. A project is currently underway to digitize and post them online. In addition, since 2012 workshops conducted in conjunction with the conference have been streamed live.\n\nThe \"ARSC Journal\" is a peer-reviewed journal that has been in existence since 1968. Currently published semi-annually, it “serves to document the history of sound recording and includes original articles on many aspects of research and preservation: biography; cataloging; copyright law; current research; discography; technical aspects of sound restoration, etc., etc.” It also includes reviews of books and sound recordings, as well as an ongoing bibliography of articles of interest that have appeared in other journals. In all, more than 2,200 articles and reviews have been published through 2015, all of which are now available online. The \"ARSC Newsletter\", containing association news, is published three times a year, and a \"Membership Directory\" is published electronically each year. Other publications include the \"ARSC Guide to Audio Preservation\" (2015), a guide for smaller public and private collections.\n\nBeginning in 1991 ARSC has presented a number of Awards for Excellence “to authors and publishers of books, articles, or recording liner notes, to recognize outstanding published research in the field of recorded sound.” Each year, a Lifetime Achievement Award is presented for recorded sound research and publication, and an Award for Distinguished Service to Historical Recordings is presented for other contributions to the field.\n\nThe Research Grants Program supports the research involving audio preservation and sound recordings, including discographies and historical studies of the sound recording industry. The Preservation of Classical Music Historical Recordings Grants Program supports “the preservation of historically significant sound recordings of Western Art Music.” ARSC also provides a modest number of Travel Grants for first-time attendees at the annual conference.\n\nARSClist is an unmoderated email discussion list sponsored by ARSC. Subscription is open to members and to the archival community at large. ARSC also has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, among other places.\n\nSince 2005, the Copyright and Fair Use Committee has led the organization in advocating for changes in U.S. copyright laws to ensure the preservation of and public access to historical sound recordings. This has included testimony at U.S. Copyright Office hearings and a number of studies and position papers. Currently, there are no sound recordings in the public domain. Recordings made after 1972 are covered by Federal copyright laws; pre-1972 recordings remain under state laws until 2067 (assuming that copyright term will not be extended again). Making copies of recordings is a violation of copyright law; therefore, libraries and archives may not legally be able to perform necessary preservation work. Public access is limited by rights holders who will neither release historical material nor allow others to do so. In 2009 ARSC was instrumental in securing legislation directing the Copyright Office to study the status of pre-1972 recordings, which resulted in a Copyright Office recommendation that Congress address this problem. ARSC also favors changes in copyright law related to orphan works.\n\nIn 2008 ARSC co-founded with other organizations the Historical Recording Coalition for Access and Preservation to pursue these issues, and the Copyright and Fair Use Committee keeps members informed of news related to sound recording copyright and fair use issues.\n\nThe Technical Committee focuses on audio technology, providing guidance to institutions and audio professionals in preserving and maintaining access to sound recordings.\n\nThe Education and Training Committee provides publications and online resources, and conducts a workshop at the annual conference covering topics that have included copyright, grant applications, disaster recovery, and the preservation and handling of digital resources.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6398064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6398064", "title": "Comparison of American football and rugby league", "text": "Comparison of American football and rugby league\n\nA comparison between American football and rugby league is possible because of their shared origins and similar game concepts. Along with Canadian football, rugby league is the most similar sport to American football. Both sports involve the concept of a limited number of downs/tackles and scoring touchdowns/tries takes clear precedence over goal-kicking.\n\nGenerally, American football games last much longer than 80-minute rugby league matches. Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, it is much slower-paced than the more hectic rugby league, in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play. Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league; defending players interfering with any other attacking player (and vice versa) will incur a penalty. Passing in the two sports also differs: while backward passing is common to both sports, in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal. Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line. American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves and padding around the body, whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league, usually amounting to light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets being illegal). \nThe rugby pitch and American football field are both similar in size with a pitch being 100 meters while a football field is 100 yards.\n\nBoth sports descend from the older game of rugby football in the 19th Century when its two offshoots developed. British colonists and the British military in Canada brought football to North America. It became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At the time, association football and rugby football were not as differentiated as they are now and teams would negotiate the rules before playing each game. The sports of American football and Canadian football evolved from these intercollegiate games.\n\nMeanwhile, in England a schism developed in rugby football between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away sport, rugby league, which permitted player payments. At first, the two rugby codes differed only in how they were administered; over time, their playing rules diverged to the point that they are now distinctly different forms of football.\n\nAmerican football is played on a rectangular field long by 53 1⁄3 yards (48.8 m) wide. Near each end of the field is a \"goal line\", which are apart. A scoring area called an end zone extends beyond each goal line. Yard lines cross the field every , two rows of hash marks run parallel to the side lines near the middle of the field. At the back of each of the end zones, there are a set of goalposts. American football goalposts were formerly H-shaped and were located on the goal line, but; in 1967, the NFL adopted the current modern offset-fork design, made from extruded steel pipes. The goalposts currently consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet (5.6 m) apart (24 feet (7.3 m) in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar, which is mounted on a single central support post that raises the crossbar to a height of 10 feet (3.0 m), resulting in a two-tined fork shape. The central vertical post is offset from the crossbar toward the rear, placing it as far as possible from the field of play; it is also usually padded to minimize collision-related injuries. In 1974, in the effort to create a safer, unimpeded field of play in the end zone, calculated to produce more passing touchdowns, the NFL relocated the goalposts from the goal line to the end line. \n\nA rugby league field has very similar dimensions, being up to long and wide. Lines cross the field marking every . The goal posts are separated by exactly and the area beyond each goal post, known as the \"in-goal area\", extends for another . In rugby league, goal posts are usually H-shaped, each post being high and apart, with the cross bar being high. American football \"tuning fork\" goal posts are allowed in rugby league, provided the posts and cross bar are at the required dimensions. The goal posts are used for other forms of point scoring in rugby league: drop goals or field goals, penalty goals and conversions.\n\nAs four replacements in a rugby league team, with only twelve interchanges of players allowed to be made throughout the game (ten in the Australian NRL). If the interchanges are used up and a player becomes injured and cannot continue, the team simply has to play short handed. All players must attack and defend and there is no equivalent of special teams.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, and in arena football (an indoor variant of the American game) from 1988 to 2007, American football did use a one-platoon system in which most players were required to play all facets of the game, severely limiting substitution, much as rugby league (and most other sports) continue to do. Most levels of American football abolished the one-platoon system in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although college football re-implemented it for a short time in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBroadly speaking, offensive and defensive linemen in American football correspond to forwards in rugby league and other players are somewhat similar to backs. Basically the job of the forwards in rugby league is to get the ball over the advantage line and give the backs space and a chance to be creative and move the ball around, which will hopefully result in points. However, rugby league players are far less specialised than American football players.\n\nMany of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. A fullback in American football is very different from a fullback in rugby league. However, some of the positions are fairly similar: for instance, the stand-off/five-eighth and halfback carry out a similar role to a quarterback in American football.\n\nIn American football, the team that's in possession of the ball (the offense) has four \"downs\", to advance the ball 10 yards towards the end zone. When the offense gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four downs. If the offense fails to gain 10 yards after 4 downs, it loses possession of the ball.\n\nA down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:\n\nThis closely resembles the six-tackle rule in rugby league. The team in possession has a \"set of six\" tackles before having to hand over possession. A key difference is that there is no automatic way of earning a new set of tackles in rugby league. Each set is effectively a chance to score, with failure to do so resulting in relinquishing possession. Another major difference is that play stops briefly when the player in possession of the ball is tackled and resumes once he gets to his feet and returns the ball to play.\n\nPlayers can advance the ball in two ways in American football:\n\nIn rugby league the ball cannot be passed forward, so players can advance the ball by either running with it, or kicking it ahead and chasing it. This concept is preserved in American football; any player may pass the ball backwards, regardless of player position and location of the field. In addition, a ball passed backwards remains live, even if not caught, so long as it remains in play, similar to rugby league.\n\nFollowing a down, the ball is returned to play within a restricted time limit by a \"snap\" in American Football. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the center, then passes (or \"snaps\") the ball back between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback and play commences.\n\nIn rugby league the ball is returned to play following a tackle via the \"play the ball\", in which the tackled player gets back to his feet and rolls the ball back to a teammate, usually the hooker. The tackled player will usually try to return to the ball to play as quickly as possible before the defensive line can re-form.\n\nPossession may change in different ways in both games:-\n\n\nIn both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. However, kicking in general play is more common in rugby league. Kicking is far more heavily restricted in American football; the rules currently prohibit a player from kicking the ball after he has crossed the line of scrimmage, whereas a rugby league player can kick the ball at any time, from any point on the field. In rugby league, a player can receive a kick (and still maintain possession) if he is behind the kicker at the time of the kick; that feature is not allowed in the American game, except in the onside kick scenario described above.\n\nIn American football, the offense can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of American and Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby league.\n\nThe ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In American football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby league. The lateral is most commonly seen on plays at the very end of the game when a team needing a touchdown with only time on the clock for one more play attempts to avoid being tackled by passing to any teammate behind him that may advance the ball. A common trick play called the hook and ladder combines the two - a short forward pass is thrown, with the player catching the pass immediately throwing a lateral to a trailing teammate who is hopefully unnoticed by defensive players. Laterals are also seen in \"pitch\" or \"pitchout\" plays, where the quarterback tosses the ball to a back behind him, rather than handing it off.\n\nThere is also a minor distinction in what constitutes a forward or backward pass in the two sports. In rugby league (as in rugby union), a pass is considered forward (and thus illegal) if the person catching the ball is ahead of the player throwing it. In American football, a pass is considered forward only if the path of the ball itself has a forward component to it. For instance, the Music City Miracle (a play in which the receiving end of a lateral pass was ahead of the person throwing it, but the path was not forward) was a legal lateral in American football but would have been an illegal forward pass had it been attempted in rugby.\n\nIn both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands.\n\nIn both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. Play then restarts from the next down or tackle. In rugby league, it is common for the player in possession to 'off-load' the ball, passing out of the tackle (before forward progress is halted) in order not to use up a tackle and to keep the play alive. This is much less common in American football, where the lateral pass is most commonly used as a desperation strategy when trailing near the end of a game.\n\nIn American football, players are allowed to 'block' players without the ball, within certain restrictions. This is not permitted in rugby league and would be considered 'obstruction'. Players not in possession of the ball may not interfere with each other.\n\nA touchdown is the American football equivalent of rugby league's try. Despite the names, a try requires the ball to be 'touched down' to the ground, whereas a touchdown doesn't. In American football it is sufficient for the player carrying the ball to cause the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) while still in bounds, by carrying it in or holding the ball in or through the imaginary plane of the goal line. In rugby league the ball must be pressed to the ground in the in-goal area. An American football touchdown scores 6 points and a rugby league try is worth 4 points.\n\nIn both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In American football this is called an extra point or a \"point after touchdown\" (PAT) in the NFL (worth 1 point), in rugby league it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). There are two key differences between an extra point and a conversion, conversions cannot be charged down like an extra point attempt but they must be taken from the same position as the try was scored. Hence it is important to score under the posts rather than in the corner, which makes for a difficult kick. Rugby league has no equivalent to American football's two-point conversion, in which the scoring team chooses not to kick at goal, but attempt a second touchdown from short range.\n\nIn American football teams often opt to go for a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby league equivalent, also called a field goal, is worth only one point and is much less common. The key difference between a field goal in the two sports is that an American football field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby league the field goal is attempted using a drop-kick.\n\nA similar concept in rugby league is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 2 points in league. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in American football in that the ball is kicked from the ground and may be held by a teammate (although almost never is), but it cannot be charged down. The nearest equivalent in American football is the rarely used fair catch kick.\n\nAmerican football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby league. If a ball carrier is tackled in their own endzone (in-goal area) with the ball or steps out the back of the end zone with the ball, this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the opposing team. In rugby league this does not result in any points but causes the team in possession to kick the ball back to the opposition from under the posts.\n\nAt least one cross-code match between American football and rugby league has been played. On August 1, 2009 the Jacksonville Axemen of the AMNRL played the Jacksonville Knights of the Florida Football Alliance. The first half was played under American football rules, the second half was played under rugby league rules. The score at half-time was Jacksonville Axemen 6 - Jacksonville Knights 27. The final score was Jacksonville Axemen 38 - Jacksonville Knights 27.\n\n\n"}

Classical music and spoken word recordings can extend to over 30 minutes on a side. If a side exceeds the average time, the maximum groove amplitude is reduced to make room for the additional program material. This can cause hiss in the sound from lower quality amplifiers when the volume is turned up to compensate for the lower recorded level. An extreme example, Todd Rundgren's \"Initiation\" LP, with 36 minutes of music on one side, has a \"technical note\" at the bottom of the inner sleeve: \"if the sound does not seem loud enough on your system, try re-recording the music onto tape.\" The total of around 40–45 minutes often influences the arrangement of tracks, with the preferred positions being the opening and closing tracks of each side.\n\nAlthough the term EP is commonly used to describe a 7\" single with more than two tracks, technically they are not different from a normal 7\" single. The EP uses reduced dynamic range and a smaller run-off groove area to extend the playing time. However, there are examples of singles, such as The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" or Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which are six minutes long or more. (in 1989, RCA released 'Dreamtime' by the band Love and Rockets, which clocks at 8:40). These longer recordings would require the same technical approach as an EP. The term EP has also been used for 10\" 45 rpm records, typically containing a reduced number of tracks.\n\nVinyl albums have a large 12\" (30 cm) album cover, which also allows cover designers scope for imaginative designs, often including fold-outs and leaflets.\n\n\n\n"}

He co-founded Creative Playthings in 1945 with his wife Theresa, and worked with artists, architects, and designers, such as Isamu Noguchi, Louis Kahn, Henry Moore, Robert Winston, and the Swiss toymaker, Antonio Vitali, to create innovative educational play objects and playground designs for children. By the 1950s, Creative Playthings had gained international recognition and expanded to become one of the most important manufacturers and suppliers of materials for early childhood education. In 1975, Frank Caplan founded The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood. He researched and co-authored a national bestselling series on early childhood development with Theresa Caplan, which included, \"The First Twelve Months of Life\" (1977), \"The Second Twelve Months of Life\" (1978), and \"The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old\" (1983). Together they also co-authored \"The Power of Play\" (1973). He was one of the first male nursery school teachers in the U.S. and together with Theresa Caplan collected over 50,000 American and international folk toys, folk art, and contemporary playthings, which in 1984 the couple donated to The Children's Museum of Indianapolis for a permanent gallery on folk, fantasy, and play.\n\nFrank Caplan was born in Kingston upon Hull, England, on June 10, 1911, to Russian Jewish parents. In 1914, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Harlem, New York. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1927 and began attending City College of New York at night. After graduating in 1931 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and history, he took a job as the director of the Block Recreation Project, working with street gangs to create club centers for leadership training. His interest in toys began when working as one of the first male nursery school teachers in the U.S. under Caroline Pratt, founder and director of City and Country School in Greenwich Village, New York City. Later, he worked at the Jewish Center in Far Rockaway, Long Island (along with his future wife, Theresa Caplan, and artist, Mark Rothko), where he made puppets and simple playthings for children. In 1934, he set up a cooperative farm-camp for city children.\n\nOn May 30, 1934, Frank Caplan married Theresa Caplan (b. Kupferberg, June 6, 1913 – April 13, 2010). In 1936, he received his master's degree in the Philosophy of Education from Teachers College, Columbia University and began work as Senior Project Supervisor of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Youth Service Division of the New York City Board of Education, a novel experiment to develop education programs for 16- to 25-year-olds living in economically distressed areas of New York City.\n\nIn 1975, Frank and Theresa Caplan co-founded The Princeton Center for Infancy and Early Childhood, a pioneering organization that researched and prepared books and pamphlets for parents and professionals. The center authored \"The Parenting Advisor\" (1977), \"Parents’ Yellow Pages\" (1978), and \"Growing Up Years: Your Child’s Record Keeping Book\" (1978). Frank and Theresa co-authored \"The Power of Play\" (1973), \"The First Twelve Months of Life\" (1977), \"The Second Twelve Months of Life\" (1978), and \"The Early Childhood Years: The 2 to 6 Year Old\" (1983), which covered the mental, physical, language and social development of early childhood with advice for parents and answers to common concerns. The series was praised for embracing both mothers and fathers as well as supporting diverse family types.\n\nIn the 1950s, Frank and Theresa Caplan began collecting folk toys on their numerous international travels. Their casual collecting grew into more formal collecting of folk toys from around the world in the hopes of establishing a Museum of Fantasy and Play. In 1984 they donated their collection of over 50,000 folk toys, folk art, and contemporary playthings to The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. The collection, now known as the Caplan Collection, was first used in the exhibit \"Passport to the World.\"\n\nFrank Caplan died on September 28, 1988.

{"id": "12200470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12200470", "title": "Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology", "text": "Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology\n\nThe Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology (in French, \"galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie\") is a part of the French National Museum of Natural History (\"Muséum national d'histoire naturelle\", MNHN). It is situated in the \"Jardin des plantes\" ('Garden of the Plants') in Paris near the \"gare d'Austerlitz\" train station. The gallery displays a collection of crystals, gemstones and minerals \"parmi les plus anciennes et les plus prestigieuses du monde\" ('among the oldest and the most prestigious in the world').\n\nThe collection is older than the building. It began in 1625, when minerals with medicinal properties were deposited in \"le droguier du roi\" ('the royal drug cabinet'). Thereafter, the \"droguier\" and its minerals were moved to the \"Jardin royal des plantes médicinales\" ('Royal Garden of the Medicinal Plants'), founded in 1635 under the rule of Louis XIII. The \"Jardin royal des plantes médicinales\", as a location, corresponds in the present day to the still existing \"Jardin des plantes\", but as an institution it nowadays corresponds to the French National Museum of Natural History. In 1635, when the Royal Garden was being founded, the mineral collections and the royal drug cabinet were transported to a \"château\" situated in the same property as the garden itself. In the same year, the so-mentioned château was also destined to receive the \"cabinet du roi\" (the 'Royal Cabinet of Curiosities'). Later, during the reign of Louis XIV, the mineralogical collection of the \"cabinet du roi\" was enriched on the orders of the king and put on public display as of 1745.\n\nYears later the French Revolution broke out, spanning from 1789 to 1799. During the period, on June 1793, the revolutionaries who were ruling France transformed the \"Jardin royal des plantes médicinales\" into the still existing \"Muséum national d'histoire naturelle\", but at this point in time the mineralogical and geological samples remained in the old \"cabinet du roi\". After the French Revolution and after the reign of Napoleon, monarchy in France was back and ruled the country again. It was not until the reign of Louis Philippe I that a new building was planned in order to receive the mineralogy collections. Construction works started in 1833 and the new building was inaugurated in 1837 in the presence of the king. This building, designed by architect Charles Rohault de Fleury and still currently in use to show to the public the mineralogical collections, was the first in France to be designed as a museum. The building is partitioned, contiguously, into three different parts: a central nave originally destined to receive the mineralogy and geology collections, and two wings, one on the right-hand side of the central nave, the other on the left-hand side. The right-hand wing was originally intended to receive the \"Muséum\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s main library, as still stated in the right-side pediment of the building, where the word \"Bibliothèque\" ('Libray') still can be read. The left-side wing of the building was originally destined to receive the \"Muséum\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s herbarium, but a new nearby building, the \"galerie de Botanique\" ('Gallery of Botany'), was inaugurated in 1935 with the purpose of preservation of all \"Muséum\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s vegetal samples, so the herbarium left its old allocated location and was sent to the new one, where it is still preserved.\n\nIn the late months of 1959, the old \"cabinet du roi\" was demolished in order to build on its footprint the current central library of the \"Muséum\". As a consequence, during the 1960s, the rooms in the former library, situated in the Gallery's right wing, were destined to receive a chosen set of mineral samples. This area in the building, the former library, is still nowadays the current main exhibition space in the \"galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie\".\n\nIn 1972, as per the \"Muséum\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s herbarium had left the Gallery's left-wing since 1935, French paleontologist Jean-Pierre Lehman opened a \"galerie de Paléobotanique\" ('Gallery of Paleobotany') in this area of the building. The \"Muséum\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s paleobotanical collections were on exhibit at this new paleobotanical gallery until 1998, when it was definitely closed to the public. The Gallery of Paleobotany was permanently dismantled in 2005, although a few of its fossil plants are currently on exhibition at the galerie de Paléontologie et d'Anatomie comparée and at one of the greenhouses of the \"Muséum\".\n\nIn 1982 the \"Muséum\" bought a collection of Brazilian giant crystals known as the Ilia Deleff collection. Born in 1921, Ilia Deleff, who had sold the collection to the French \"Muséum\", is a Bulgarian physician and geologist who started collecting these unique giant crystals in the late 1950s. The Ilia Deleff collection of giant crystals is on exhibit at the \"galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie\" since 1983.\n\nClosed in 2004 for renovation, the \"galerie de Minéralogie et de Géologie\" reopened ten years later, in 2014, showing a completely new kind of path tour for its new permanent exhibition called \"Les Trésors de la Terre\" ('Treasures of the Earth'). It is much more pedagogical, focusing on crystallography and the classification of minerals. This permanent exhibition currently shows approximately 600 mineralogical specimens,\n\n"}
{"id": "12741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12741", "title": "Gesta Danorum", "text": "Gesta Danorum\n\nGesta Danorum (\"Deeds of the Danes\") is a patriotic work of Danish history, by the 13th century author Saxo Grammaticus (\"Saxo the Literate\", literally \"the Grammarian\"). It is the most ambitious literary undertaking of medieval Denmark and is an essential source for the nation's early history. It is also one of the oldest known written documents about the history of Estonia and Latvia.\n\nConsisting of sixteen books written in Latin on the invitation of Archbishop Absalon, \"Gesta Danorum\" describes Danish history and to some degree Scandinavian history in general, from prehistory to the late 12th century. In addition, \"Gesta Danorum\" offers singular reflections on European affairs in the High Middle Ages from a unique Scandinavian perspective, supplementing what has been handed down by historians from Western and Southern Europe.\n\nThe sixteen books, in prose with an occasional excursion into poetry, can be categorized into two parts: Books 1-9, which deal with Norse mythology, and Books 10-16, which deal with medieval history. Book 9 ends with Gorm the Old, the first factual documented King of Denmark. The last three books (14-16), which describe Danish conquests on the south shore of the Baltic Sea and wars against Slavic peoples (the Northern Crusades), are very valuable for the history of West Slavic tribes (Polabian Slavs, Pomeranians) and Slavic paganism. Book 14 contains a unique description of the temple on the island of Rügen.\n\nWhen exactly \"Gesta Danorum\" was written is the subject of numerous works; however, it is generally agreed that \"Gesta Danorum\" was not finished before 1208. The last event described in the last book (Book 16) is King Canute VI of Denmark subduing Pomerania under Duke Bogislaw I, in 1186. However the preface of the work, dictated to Archbishop Anders Sunesen, mentions the Danish conquest of the areas north of the Elbe in 1208.\n\nBook 14, comprising nearly one-quarter of the text of the entire work, ends with Absalon's appointment to archbishop in 1178. Since this book is so large and \"Absalon\" has greater importance than King Valdemar I, this book may have been written first and comprised a work on its own. It is possible that Saxo then enlarged it with Books 15 and 16, telling the story of King Valdemar I's last years and King Canute VI's first years.\n\nIt is believed that Saxo then wrote Books 11, 12, and 13. Svend Aagesen's history of Denmark, \"Brevis Historia Regum Dacie\" (circa 1186), states that Saxo had decided to write about \"The king-father and his sons,\" which would be King Sweyn Estridson, in Books 11, 12, and 13. He would later add the first ten books. This would also explain the 22 years between the last event described in the last book (Book 16) and the 1208 event described in the preface.\n\nThe original manuscripts of the work are lost, except for four fragments: the Angers Fragment, Lassen Fragment, Kall-Rasmussen Fragment and Plesner Fragment. The Angers Fragment is the biggest fragment, and the only one attested to be in Saxo’s own handwriting. The other ones are copies from ca. 1275. All four fragments are in the collection of the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nThe text has, however, survived. In 1510–1512, Christiern Pedersen, a Danish translator working in Paris, searched Denmark high and low for an existing copy of Saxo’s works, which by that time was nearly all but lost. By that time most knowledge of Saxo’s work came from a summary located in \"Chronica Jutensis\", from around 1342, called \"Compendium Saxonis\". It is also in this summary that the name \"Gesta Danorum\" is found. The title Saxo himself used for his work is unknown.\n\nChristiern Pedersen finally found a copy in the collection of Archbishop Birger Gunnersen of Lund, Skåne (Skåne is now part of Sweden, but at the time was still part of Denmark), which he gladly lent him. With the help of printer Jodocus Badius, \"Gesta Danorum\" was refined and printed.\n\nThe first printed press publication and the oldest known complete text of Saxo’s works is Christiern Pedersen's Latin edition, printed and published by Jodocus Badius in Paris, France on 15 March 1514 under the title of \"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae\" (\"History of the Kings and heroes of the Danes\"). The edition features the following colophon: ...\"impressit in inclyta Parrhisorum academia Iodocus Badius Ascensius Idibus Martiis. MDXIIII. Supputatione Romana.\" (the Ides of March, 1514).\n\nThe full front page reads (with abbreviations expanded) in Latin:\n\"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae stilo eleganti a Saxone Grammatico natione Zialandico necnon Roskildensis ecclesiae praeposito, abhinc supra trecentos annos conscriptae et nunc primum literaria serie illustratae tersissimeque impressae.\"\n\nDanish language:\n\"De danske Kongers og Heltes Historie, skrevet i pyntelig Stil for over 300 Aar siden af Saxo Grammaticus, en Sjællandsfar og Provst ved Kirken i Roskilde, og nu for første Gang oplyst ved et Register og omhyggeligt trykt\".\n\nEnglish language:\n\"Histories of the Kings and heroes of the Danes, composed in elegant style by Saxo Grammaticus, a Zealander and also provost of the church of Roskilde, over three hundred years ago, and now for the first time illustrated and printed correctly in a learned compilation.\"\nThe source of all existing translations and new editions is Christiern Pedersen's Latin \"Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae\". There exist a number different translations today, some complete, some partial:\n\n\n\n\n\"Gesta Danorum\" is also translated partially in other English, French and German releases.\n\nCertain aspects of \"Gesta Danorum\" formed the basis for William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\". It is thought that Shakespeare never read \"Gesta Danorum\", and instead had access to an auxiliary version of the tale describing the downfall of the Prince of Denmark, whose real name, Amleth, was used in anagram by Shakespeare for Hamlet.\n\nSaxo’s version, told of in Books 3 and 4, is very similar to that of Shakespeare’s \"Hamlet\". In Saxo's version, two brothers, Orvendil and Fengi are given the rule over Jutland by King Rørik Slyngebond of the Danes. Soon after, Orvendil marries King Rørik’s daughter, Geruth (Gertrude in \"Hamlet\"). Amleth is their first and only child.\n\nFengi becomes resentful of his brother’s marriage, and also wants sole leadership of Jutland, so therefore murders Orvendil. After a very brief period of mourning, Fengi marries Geruth, and declares himself sole leader of Jutland. Eventually, Amleth avenges his father’s murder and plans the murder of his uncle, making him the new and rightful King of Jutland. However, while Hamlet dies in Shakespeare's version just after his uncle's death, in Saxo's version Amleth survives and begins ruling his kingdom, going on to other adventures.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After feeling a little better, he visits the Louvre. When he feels dizzy, he is transported to what is described as the \"space-time of [his] reveries\" by a guardian of the Louvre. The guardians are the souls of each piece of art, with the guardian he meets being of the \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\". On his second day at the Louvre, he looks at the paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. While looking at \"Recollection of Mortefontaine\", he meets Asai Chū, who had worked on introducing Western-style art to Japan. He is then transported to an art gallery in Ueno which is exhibiting Chū's works posthumously and hears the writer Natsume Sōseki speaking of Chū's work. Transported into another Corot drawing, he meets Chū again and they glance upon Corot working on that drawing. On Sunday, the man travels to Auvers-sur-Oise, the final resting place of Vincent van Gogh. Going behind the church of Auvers, he meets van Gogh, who lets him visit his apartment and see his paintings. Back in the present, he visits Charles-François Daubigny's house and finally, van Gogh's grave. A few days later, on a Tuesday when the Louvre is closed, he is transported to Paris in 1939 during the evacuation of the museum at the start of World War II. The man learns about the difficult process, which was led by Jacques Jaujard, including the transport of the \"Mona Lisa\", \"The Raft of the Medusa\", and the \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\". On his final day in Paris, the man visits the tomb of Philippe Pot, and reunites with his own dead wife Keiko.\n\nThe Louvre commissioned Taniguchi to create the manga as part of The Louvre Collection, which features various comics artists' works on the museum, and he spent a month at the museum in May 2013. The manga was serialized in Shogakukan's manga magazine starting with the 19th issue, and the collected tankōbon was published on February 20, 2015, with a luxury edition in full color. The manga was published in France by the Louvre in collaboration with Futuropolis on November 21, 2014. The manga was translated into English by NBM Publishing, which listed it in October 2015, and published the manga on May 13, 2016. The manga is also licensed in Germany by Carlsen, in Italy by Rizzoli Lizard, and in Spain by Ponent Mon.\n\nResponse to the manga has been mixed, with praise going towards its art and mood, but the plot being criticized. Hans Rollman of \"PopMatters\" said that \"Guardians of the Louvre\" \"demonstrates that contemporary manga artists can hold their own against the greatest in the pantheon of western art\", commending its artwork and atmosphere, while describing the plot as minimal. \"Publishers Weekly\" called the manga \"coolly and resplendently drawn, if rather indifferently written\". Katherine Dacey of MangaBlog was critical of the manga's \"middlebrow sensibility\" and attempt to dictate how art should be appreciated, but commended its sensual imagery. Summer Hayes of \"Booklist\" liked the use of color in the manga to \"heighten emotion, create distance, and echo artistic styles\", concluding that while the story has seams, the manga is a \"voyeuristic trip\" showing the relationship between art and life.\n\n\"Guardians of the Louvre\" was part of the selection for the (2015 Fnac Comics Prize). At \"The Best and Worst Manga of 2016\" panel of Comic-Con International, the manga was part of the list of \"Worst Manga for Anyone, Any Age\".\n"}

{"id": "102326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102326", "title": "Hansard", "text": "Hansard\n\nHansard is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after Thomas Curson Hansard (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster.\n\nThough the history of the \"Hansard\" began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.\n\nThe many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of \"the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers\".\n\nSeveral editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include \"Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society\" and \"Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia\". The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in Edward Cave's \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully \"filleted\"; for example, Sir Robert Walpole was thinly disguised as \"Sr. R―t W―le\".\n\nIn 1771 Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the \"Parliamentary Register\" published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813.\n\nWilliam Cobbett (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing \"Parliamentary Debates\" as a supplement to his \"Political Register\" in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the \"Parliamentary History\". Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On June 5, 1810 William Cobbett stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by Thomas Curson Hansard. Cobbett was found \"guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence\". The court sentence read: \"The court do adjudge that you, William Cobbett pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid\". The sentence was described by J. C. Trewin as \"vindictive\". The Court argued that Thomas Curson Hansard, who had \"seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all\" and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King's Bench Prison.\n\nCobbett's reports were printed by Thomas Curson Hansard from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the \"Parliamentary Debates\" and \"Parliamentary History\", which then \"passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812\". \"Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates\" became \"Hansard Parliamentary Debates\", \"abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard\". From 1829 the name \"Hansard\" appeared on the title page of each issue. Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of \"Hansard\" are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.\n\nHansard outlasted competitors including Almon and Debrett, and the later \"Mirror of Parliament\" published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to \"correct\" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was \"The Times\" which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed. Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debate reports. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.\n\nThe \"Hansard\" of today, a comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when Parliament took over the publication and established its own staff of official \"Hansard\" reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.\n\n\"Hansard\" is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons Select Committee in 1893, as being a report\n\nOne instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of members in the House of Commons. In that House, the Speaker must call on a member by name before that member may speak, but \"Hansard\" makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, \"Hansard\" sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as \"the hon. Member for \"Constituency Name\" rather than by name, \"Hansard\" adds, in parentheses, the name of the member being referred to, the first time that Member is referred to in a speech or debate. When a Member simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, \"Hansard\" identifies him or her.\n\nAny interruption to debate will be marked with the word \"(Interruption)\". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during Prime Minister's Questions, are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.\n\n\"Hansard\" also publishes written answers – known as written ministerial statements – made by Government ministers in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the House of Commons, printed and published a report stating that an indecent book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in Newgate Prison. Stockdale sued for defamation but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by parliamentary privilege. In the resulting case of \"Stockdale v Hansard\", the court found that the House held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 to establish privilege for publications under the House's authority.\n\nSince 1909—and for important votes before then—\"Hansard\" has listed how members have voted in divisions. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons \"Hansard\" did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with Members' references to other Members of the same party as \"hon. Friends\", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The \"Hansard\" of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords Chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary Written Answers and Statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that \"Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining\". The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK \"Hansard\" more accessible. The UK \"Hansard\" is currently being digitised to a high-level format for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK \"Hansard\" from 1803, with the exception of Standing Committees.\n\nBecause \"Hansard\" is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of parliament makes an inaccurate statement in parliament, he/she must write a correction in the copy of \"Hansard\" kept in the House of Commons library.\n\nAs with the Westminster \"Hansard\", the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding \"repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors\". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent (\"The member for Halifax West\", etc.) or by their cabinet post. \"Hansard\" supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—\"Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)\" or \"Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)\"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.\n\nIf interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as \"Some hon. members: Oh, oh!\" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:\n\nGiven the bilingual nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian \"Hansard\"s are maintained, one in French and one in English. This makes it a natural parallel text, and it is often used to train French–English machine translation programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the \"Hansard\"s and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive corpus. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.\n\nThe Canadian \"Hansard\" records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English \"Hansard\" records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French \"Hansard\" record.\n\nIn one instance, during a Liberal filibuster in the Senate of Canada, Senator Philippe Gigantès was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the \"Hansard\".\n\nIn Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of \"Saint John's Ledger\", \"had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark\". The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. \nThe Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the \"Ledger\", made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits. In another case, a \"Gentleman by the name Parsons\", of the \"Newfoundland Patriot\", \"was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident\".\n\nAs was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, the \"Halifax Gazette\", was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the \"Acadian Recorder\", founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the \"Free Press\", established in 1816 by Edward Ward. Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.\n\nThe Family Compact of Nova Scotia, nicknamed \"the little compact\", \"viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with disdain\" and \"were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront\". There are many cases which exemplify the \"struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes\" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.\n\n\"The Novascotian\" newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by George Young who was instrumental in its establishment. George Young sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.\n\nIn 1827 Joseph Howe bought the \"Novascotian\" from Young. \"There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe\". In 1835 Joseph Howe was \"prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the \"Novascotian\"\". He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a \"cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada\". Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.\n\nNo official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953. The provincial website now posts \"Hansard\" online, with records from March 29, 1977 to current.\n\nAlberta adopted a \"Hansard\" in 1972. From 1905 to 1971, local newspapers reported on legislative proceedings, and from these articles the Legislature Library has compiled a Scrapbook \"Hansard\", which is available online. News reporters were allowed to take handwritten notes in the Chamber, but they could not to make sound recordings, and members of the public were not allowed to take notes.\n\nIn 1965 a recording system was installed in the Chamber. Initially the Clerk’s office provided transcription only for special events, such as throne speeches, but requests from MLAs for transcripts increased, and by 1971 all House proceedings were being recorded. On March 8, 1972, the government introduced a motion to create \"Alberta Hansard\", and the following day they brought forward a motion allowing audio and video recording in the Chamber and also permitting visitors to the galleries to take notes. Assembly standing orders 115 and 116 set out the rules for broadcast media in the Chamber and at committee meetings, respectively.\n\n\"Hansard\" staff verifies the names of individuals and entities mentioned in the House. Like other \"Hansard\"s, \"Alberta Hansard\" follows editorial guidelines established in the 19th century, and transcripts are substantially verbatim. Revisions are limited to “the correction of grammar, spelling and punctuation, ensuring that the correct parliamentary forms are observed, and minimizing superfluous repetition and redundancies, but no material alterations shall be made, nor any amendments that would in any way tend to change the sense of what has been spoken.”\n\nTranscripts for Legislative Assembly of Alberta proceedings from 1972 onward are available online, and current issues are usually posted within 12 hours of the day’s sitting. A transcript for a regular afternoon Assembly sitting of 4.5 hours contains more than 30,000 words. Also available online are transcripts for meetings of committees of the Legislative Assembly from the 1990s onward, earlier for some committees.\n\nNo complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa \"Hansard\", opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: \"J. Horgan\". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with \"Honourable\": \"Hon. S. Hagen\". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as \"Interjection\". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line (\"Motion approved\" or \"Motion negatived\").\n\nThe Parliament of Australia also keeps record of debates, using the term \"Hansard\". The records are published by the State Law Publisher. The Parliament of South Australia was the first convict free state colony to use \"Hansard\"; where it became a convention from 1857. The Parliament of Victoria followed the lead of South Australia by introducing the use of \"Hansard\" in 1866 The Parliament of New South Wales commenced its \"Hansard\" system on 28 October 1879 with the reporting of the Legislative Council at the opening of the Third Session of the Ninth Parliament.\n\nOn 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters, led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the Parliament of New Zealand. Ever since that day official transcripts of MPs speeches in the House have been continuously published.\n\nToday \"Hansard\" is produced by a team of 17 FTE Hansard Editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. \"Hansard\" is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.\n\nSpeeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words MPs use in the debating chamber. \"Hansard\" is as close to verbatim as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. MPs are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. MPs can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the House.\n\nThe European Parliament has its verbatim report of proceedings of the plenary sessions, often referred to by its name in French (CRE). It is eventually available in nearly all of the Union's languages.\n\n\n\n"}

The Reserve Bank of India describes the Hundi as \"an unconditional order in writing made by a person directing another to pay a certain sum of money to a person named in the order.\"\n\nHundis have a very long history in India. Written records show their use at least as far back as the sixteenth century. The merchant Banarasi Das, born 1586, received a hundi for 200 rupees from his father to enable him to borrow money to start trading.\n\nDuring the colonial era, the British government regarded the hundi system as indigenous or traditional, but not informal. They were reluctant to interfere with it as it formed such an important part of the Indian economy and they also wished to tax the transactions taking place within the system. Official hundi forms were produced incorporating revenue stamps bearing the image of British monarchs, including Queen Victoria, and disputes between merchants often entered the court system, so in no way was the system an underground one even though it did not take place through normal banking channels.\n\n\nThere are few other varieties; the Nam-jog hundi, Dhani-jog hundi, Jawabee hundi, Jokhami hundi, Firman-jog hundi, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Shortly after Lemuel Ray's father Henry B. Ray died in 1851, two years later 26-year-old Elisha Ray, Lemuel's brother died in 1853, only one year after that in 1854 Henry Ray; Henry B. Ray's eldest son and Lemuel and Elisha's brother died from the disease. The body with the \"skull and crossbones\", found in a coffin with the markings JB-55, had characteristics consistent with a death from tuberculosis, as well as two surrounding bodies, all presumably buried in the 1790s. \"JB-55\" is the only visually confirmable practice of the bone disruption that the Ray family was supposed to have used to keep dead family members \"dead.\" Another common method to ensure that dead family members remained that way was to cut out the heart of the deceased member and burn it to cure the rest of the family and put the spirit to rest\n\nThe Ray family died from the deadly and highly contagious disease of tuberculosis, then known as consumption over a period of nine years.\n\nIn the early 1990s a few children were playing near a hillside gravel mine in Jewett City, Connecticut, there they discovered the unmarked Walton Family graveyard. 29 graves were uncovered collectively belonging to both the Walton family and the Ray Family. One such grave had a body which was buried, exhumed, then reburied with its skull dislocated from its spine placed face down with its femers placed in an \"X\" below the skull.\n\n"}
{"id": "3180643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3180643", "title": "Jikji", "text": "Jikji\n\nJikji () is the abbreviated title of a Korean Buddhist document, whose title can be translated \"Anthology of Great Buddhist Priests' Zen Teachings\". Printed during the Goryeo Dynasty in 1377, it is the world's oldest extant book printed with movable metal type. UNESCO confirmed \"Jikji\" as the world's oldest metalloid type in September 2001 and includes it in the Memory of the World Programme.\n\n\"Jikji\" was published in Heungdeok Temple in 1377, 78 years prior to Johannes Gutenberg's acclaimed \"42-Line Bible\" printed during the years 1452–1455. The greater part of the \"Jikji\" is now lost, and today only the last volume survives, and is kept at the Manuscrits Orientaux division of the National Library of France.\n\nThe \"Jikji\" was written by the Buddhist monk Baegun (1298–1374, Buddhist name Gyeonghan), who served as the chief priest of Anguk and Shingwang temples in Haeju, and was published in two volumes in Seongbulsan in 1372. Baegun died in Chwiam Temple in Yeoju in 1374.\n\nThe \"Jikji\" comprises a collection of excerpts from the of the most revered Buddhist monks throughout successive generations. Gyeonghan compiled it as a guide for students of Buddhism, then Korea's national religion under the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392).\n\nThe text propounds on the essentials of Seon, the predecessor to Japan's Zen Buddhism.\n\nThe \"Jikji\" consists of two volumes. The metal-print \"Jikji\" that was published in Heungdeok Temple is kept in the \"Manuscrits Orientaux\" division of the National Library of France, with the first page of the last volume (Book 1 in Chapter 38) torn off. A wood-carving print of \"Jikji\" published in Chwiamsa Temple contains the complete two volumes. This is kept in the National Library of Korea and Jangsagak and Bulgap temples as well as in the Academy of Korean Studies.\n\nOn the last page of \"Jikji\" is recorded details of its publication, indicating that it was published in the 3rd Year of King U (July 1377) by metal type at Heungdeok temple in Cheongju. The \"Jikji\" originally consisted of two volumes totaling 307 chapters, but the first volume of the metal printed version is no longer extant.\n\nThere is a record indicating that in 1377 Baegun's students, priests Seoksan and Daldam, helped in the publication of \"Jikji\" by using moveable metal type and the priestess Myodeok contributed her efforts as well.\n\nThe surviving metal type's dimensions are 24.6 x 17.0 cm. Its paper is very slight and white. The whole text is doubly folded very slightly. The cover looks re-made. The title of \"Jikji\" also seems to be written with an Indian ink after the original. The cover on the surviving volume of the metal type edition records in French \"The oldest known Korean book printed with molded type, with 1377 as date\", written by Maurice Courant.\n\nThe lines are not straight, but askew. The difference of the thickness of ink color shown on drawn letter paper is large, and spots often occur. Even some characters, such as 'day' (日) or 'one' (一), are written reversely, while other letters are not printed out completely. The same typed letters are not shown on the same paper, but the same typed letters appear on other leaves. There are also blurs and spots around the characters.\n\nTowards the end of the Joseon Dynasty, a French diplomat bought the second volume of the \"Jikji\" in Seoul and took it off to France, where it is now kept at the National Library of France in Paris.\n\nAccording to UNESCO records, the \"Jikji\" “had been in the collection of Victor Emile Marie Joseph Collin de Plancy, a chargé d'affaires with the French Embassy in Seoul in 1887 during the reign of King Gojong. The book then passed into the hands of Henri Véver, a collector of classics, in an auction at Hotel Drouot in 1911, and when he died in 1950, it was donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, where it has been ever since.” Today only 38 sheets of the second volume of the metal print edition are extant.\n\nIn May 1886, Korea and France concluded a treaty of defense and commerce, and as a result in 1887 official diplomatic relations were entered into by the treaty's official ratification by Kim Yunsik (1835–1922) and Victor Emile Marie Joseph Collin de Plancy (1853–1924). Plancy, who had majored in law in France and went on to study Chinese, had served for six years as translator at the French Legation in China, between 1877 and 1883. In 1888 he went to Seoul as the first French consul to Korea, staying until 1891. During his extended residence in Korea, first as consul and then again as full diplomatic minister from 1896–1906, Victor Collin de Plancy collected Korean ceramics and old books. He let Kulang, who had moved to Seoul as his official secretary, classify them.\n\nAlthough the channels through which Plancy collected his works are not clearly known, he seems to have collected them primarily from the early 1900s. Most of the old books Plancy collected in Korea went to the National Library of France at an auction in 1911, while the metal-printed \"Jikji\" was purchased in that same year for 180 francs by Henri Véver (1854–1943), a well-known jewel merchant and old book collector, who in turn donated it to the French National Library in his will.\n\nThe metal-printed \"Jikji\" became known to the world in 1901 through its inclusion in the appendix of the \"Hanguk Seoji\", compiled by the French Sinologist and scholar of Korea, Maurice Courant (1865–1935). In 1972 the \"Jikji\" was displayed in Paris during the \"International Book Year\" hosted by the National Library of France, gaining it worldwide attention for the first time. The book was \"rediscovered\" by Dr. Park Byung Sun who was working as a librarian in the National Library of France. Dr. Park died in 2011.\n\nThe \"Jikji\" was printed using metal print in Heungdeok Temple outside Cheongjumok in July 1377, a fact recorded in its postscript. The fact that it was printed in Heungdeok Temple in Uncheondong, Cheongju, was confirmed when Cheongju University excavated the Heungdeok Temple site in 1985.\n\nHeungdeok Temple was rebuilt in March 1992. In 1992, the Early Printing Museum of Cheongju was opened, and it took the \"Jikji\" as its central theme from 2000.\n\nOnly the final volume of the \"Jikji\" is preserved by the Manuscrits Orientaux department of the National Library of France.\n\nOn September 4, 2001, the \"Jikji\" was formally added to UNESCO's Memory of the World. The Jikji Memory of the World Prize was created in 2004 to commemorate the creation of the \"Jikji\".\n\nThe right of ownership remains disputed, with the French National Library maintaining that the \"Jikji\" should remain in France, while Korean activists argue it should belong to Korea. The National Library of France says that as an important historical artifact of all mankind, the \"Jikji\" should remain in France as it represents a common, worldwide heritage, and does not belong to any one country. In addition, they claim the \"Jikji\" would be better preserved and displayed in France because of the prestige and resources the Library possesses. On the other hand, Korean organizations claim that it should belong to its country of origin and that it carries historical significance for the Korean people.\nThe Committee to Bring Jikji Back to Korea led by the American Richard Pennington is one such organization in Seoul, Korea that is working to repatriate the Jikji back to Korea from France.\nThe French President François Mitterrand promised to investigate ways to return various Korean books including the \"Jikji\", should the French high-speed rail technology be exported to Korea. From April to June 2011, 297 volumes with 191 different Uigwes of the Kyujanggak (Oegyujanggak), were shipped back in four separate installments and subsequently kept at the National Museum of Korea. However \"Jikji\" was not included, following opposition in France, including a protest lodged by the librarians of the National Library.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6756239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6756239", "title": "Landolt–Börnstein", "text": "Landolt–Börnstein\n\nLandolt–Börnstein is the largest collection of critically evaluated property data in materials science and the closely related fields of chemistry, physics and engineering published by Springer Nature.\nOn July 28, 1882, Dr. Hans Heinrich Landolt and Dr. Richard Börnstein, both professors at the \"Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule\" (Agricultural College) at Berlin, signed a contract with the publisher Ferdinand Springer on the publication of a collection of tables with physical-chemical data. The title of this book \"Physikalisch-chemische Tabellen\" (Physical-Chemical Tables) published in 1883 was soon forgotten. Owing to its success the data collection has been known for more than a hundred years by each scientist only as \"The Landolt-Börnstein\".\n\n1250 copies of the 1st Edition were printed and sold. In 1894, the 2nd Edition was published, in 1905 the 3rd Edition, in 1912 the 4th Edition, and finally in 1923 the 5th Edition. Supplementary volumes of the latter were printed until as late as 1936. New Editions saw changes in large expansion of volumes, number of authors, updated structure, additional tables and coverage of new areas of physics and chemistry.\n\nThe 5th Edition was eventually published in 1923, consisting of two volumes and comprising a total of 1,695 pages. Sixty three authors had contributed to it. The growth that had already been noticed in previous editions, continued. It was clear, that \"another edition in approximately 10 years\" was no solution. A complete conceptual change of the Landolt-Börnstein had thus become necessary. For the meantime supplementary volumes in two-year intervals should be provided to fill in the blanks and add the latest data. The first supplementary volume of the 5th Edition was published in 1927, the second in 1931 and the third in 1935/36. The latter consisted of three sub-volumes with a total of 3,039 pages and contributions from 82 authors.\n\nThe 6th Edition (1950) was published in line with the revised general frame. The basic idea was to have four volumes instead of one, each of which was to cover different fields of the Landolt-Börnstein under different editors. Each volume was given a detailed table of contents. Two major restrictions were also imposed. The author of a contribution was asked to choose a \"Bestwert\" (optimum value) from the mass of statements of an experimental value in the publications of different authors, or derive a \"wahrscheinlichster Wert” (most possible value). The other change of importance was that not only diagrams became as important as tables, but that text also became necessary to explain the presented data.\n\nThe new concept of the 6th Edition – splitting of the edition in four volumes with a yet unknown number of sub-volumes – was a slight progress, but eventually, it has not proven to be of much use. Instead of publishing new editions of the data collection one after the other, the \"New Series\" concept was intended to publish independent volumes that were each to cover a certain closed theme. It was flexible enough to follow the changes in the scientific interest and abandon the previous structuring of physics and chemistry in favor of new themes. Thus, new subjects such as solid-state physics could easily be comprised in groups of volumes. This concept has been adhered to up to now.\n\nThe New Series represents over 520 books published between 1961 and 2018 and includes more than 220,000 pages covering mechanical, optical, acoustical, thermal, spectroscopic, electrical and magnetic properties among others. The New Series offers critically evaluated data by over 1,000 expert authors and editors in materials science. \n\nLandolt–Börnstein books have gone through various digitization initiatives, from CD-ROM to FTP and PDF formats. Landolt–Börnstein books content is now available on SpringerMaterials, a comprehensive database for identifying material properties which covers data from materials science, physics, physical and inorganic chemistry, engineering and other related fields. SpringerMaterials offers advanced materials science-specific search functionality that allows easy retrieval of accurate results. Recently introduced SpringerMaterials Interactive is a set of advanced functionalities for visualizing and analyzing materials property data. Examples of these functionalities include interactive graphs, dynamic data tables, and side-by- side comparisons of materials/properties.\n\n\n"}

According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).\n\nRalph Merrifield, the British archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a material approach to magic, defined the differences between religion and magic: \n\"'Religion' is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; 'magic', the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; 'ritual', prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse\".\n\nIn 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention - magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, “instrumental coercive manipulation”, opposed to the religious attitude of “personal and supplicative negotiation”; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.\n\nThis separation of the terms 'religion' and 'magic' in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing \"belief in spiritual beings\" will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices. However using the word 'magic' alongside 'religion' is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.\n\nBoth magic and religion contain rituals. \nMost cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a shamanistic interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion.\n\nThere is a long-standing belief in the power of true names, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being's true name grants power over it.\n\nIf names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all. This belief is reflected in traditional Wicca, where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God - the two supreme deities in Wicca - are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the Tetragrammaton (YHWH, usually translated as \"Lord\" in small caps) to refer to God in the Tanakh. The same belief is seen in Hinduism, but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a \"good\" thing. Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being Krishna.\n\nMagic and Abrahamic religions have had a somewhat checkered past. The King James Version of the Bible included the famous translation \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" (Exodus 22:18), and Saul is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh's sorcerers as well as the staff of Moses and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh's magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh's magicians, they employed \"their secret arts\" whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.\n\nThe words 'witch' and 'witchcraft' appear in some English versions of the Bible. One verse that is probably responsible for more deaths of suspected witches than any other passage from the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) is Exodus 22:18. In the King James Version, this reads: \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" The precise meaning of the Hebrew word \"kashaph\", here translated as 'witch' and in some other modern versions, 'sorceress', is uncertain. In the Septuagint it was translated as \"pharmakeia\", meaning 'pharmacy', and on this basis, Reginald Scot claimed in the 16th century that 'witch' was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.\n"}

In humans, a relatively small number of genes are thought to be responsible for human skin color. Different alleles or gene variants code for differences in the melanin found within the skin. Within some groups are high frequencies of dark skin alleles, while others have high frequencies of light skin alleles, for example. The parents of such twins, who are typically both of mixed race, have a combination of alleles for light and dark skin in their genome. \n\nEach sperm or egg cell possesses a random selection of genes from its mother or father. While not the most probable event, a sperm or egg may randomly acquire, for example, mostly alleles that confer light skin coloration or mostly alleles that confer dark skin coloration. In such cases, fraternal twins can differ from each other quite dramatically in terms of skin color or other physical characteristics.\n\nNumerous sets of mixed twins have been born.\n\nMuch more rarely, mixed twins can arise as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.\n"}

{"id": "2608713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2608713", "title": "Skuld (princess)", "text": "Skuld (princess)\n\nSkuld was a princess of Scandinavian legend who married Heoroweard and encouraged him to kill Hroðulf (Hrólfr Kraki). The accounts of her vary greatly from source to source. \"Skuld\" is derived from the Old Norse verb \"skulla\", \"need/ought to be/shall be\"; its meaning is \"that which should become, or that needs to occur\".\n\n\"Hrólfr Kraki's saga\" tells that one Yule, Helgi (appears as Halga in \"Beowulf\") was visited by an ugly being while he was in his hunting house. No person in the entire kingdom allowed the being to enter the house, except Helgi. Later, the thing asked to sleep in his bed. Unwillingly he agreed, and as the thing got into the bed, it turned into an elvish woman, who was clad in silk and who was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He raped her, and made her pregnant. Helgi forgot the woman and a couple of days after the date had passed, he was visited by the woman, who had Skuld on her arms. The daughter would marry Hjörvarđr (Heoroweard).\n\nMuch later, when her half-brother Hrólfr Kraki was King of the Danes, Skuld began to turn her husband against Hrólfr. Under the pretext that they would wait three years before paying the accumulated tribute at one time, Skuld assembled a large army which included strong warriors, criminals, elves and norns. She was a great sorceress and used seiðr (witchcraft) to hide the great muster from Hrólfr and his champions. They then arrived at Lejre one Yule for the midwinter blóts, with all the weapons hidden in wagons to ambush the king at night. A battle ensued and, in the account found in \"Gesta Danorum\", Bödvar Bjarki fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by Hjalti. To overcome him, Skuld cast the most powerful spell to resuscitate her fallen warriors and after a long fight Hrólfr and all his eleven champions fell, with the sole exception of Vöggr who promises to avenge the king.\n\nAs Hjörvarđr was also killed in the battle, Skuld became the Queen of Denmark but did not rule well and only for a short time. Bödvar Bjarki's brothers Elk-Froði and Thorir (Þorir) Houndsfoot went to Denmark to avenge their brother. The Swedish queen Yrsa gave them a large Swedish army headed by Vöggr. They seized the wicked elf queen by surprise, just as she had suddenly attacked the king, tying her arms so she could not use her magic arts. With no spells to prevent it, they then slew all of her supernatural rabble. After this, a cruel vengeance was exacted on the captured Skuld in retribution for her treachery and fratricide and she was tortured to death through a variety of the most dreadful ways. The rule over the kingdom was then restored to King Hrólfr's daughters. When all this was accomplished, everyone went home.\n\nThe \"Skjöldunga saga\" relates that Helgo (Halga) was the King of Denmark together with his brother Roas (Hroðgar). Helgo raped Olava, the Queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married King Adillus (Eadgils), the King of Sweden. Yrsa and Adillus had a daughter, Scullda.\n\nYrsa and Adillus married their Scullda to Hiørvardus, the King of Öland (also called \"Hiorvardus\" and \"Hevardus\", and who corresponds to Heoroweard in \"Beowulf\"). As her half-brother Rolfo (Hrólfr Kraki, Hroðulf) was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark.\n\nHiørvardus and Queen Skullda rebelled against Rolfo and killed him. However, Hiørvardus did not live long after this and was himself killed.\n\nThe \"Gesta Danorum\" (book 2), by Saxo Grammaticus, tells that Roluo (Hrólfr Kraki) defeated Athislus (Eadgils) and gave Sweden to young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who was seized by passion to Roluo's beautiful but heartless sister Skulde and married her.\n\nThe ambitious Skulde, however, did not like the fact that her husband had to pay taxes to Roluo and so incited Hiartuar to rebel against him. They so went to Lejre (a town which Roluo had built) with arms hidden in the ships, under the pretense that they wanted to pay tribute. They were well-received, but after the banquet, when most people were drunk asleep, the Swedes and the Goths (i.e. the Geats) proceeded to kill everyone at Roluo's residence. After a long battle, involving Roluo's champion Bjarki, who fought in the shape of a spirit bear until he was awakened by his comrade Hjalti the Geats won and Roluo was killed.\n\nHiartuar asked Wigg (Vöggr) if he wanted to fight for him, and Wigg said yes. Hiartuar wanted to give Wigg a sword, but he insisted on receiving it by taking the hilt. Having the hilt in his hand, Wigg pierced Hiartuar with the sword and so avenged Roluo. Swedes and Geats then rushed forward and killed Wigg. The Swedish king Høtherus (based on the god Höðr), the brother of Athislus, succeeded Roluo and became the king of a combined Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThe \"Chronicon Lethrense\" (and the included \"Annales Lundenses\") tell that Rolf Krage's sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar/Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skåne, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden.\n\nHjartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed the sleeping Rolf together with all his berserkers after these intoxicated themselves at a banquet Rolf had given in honor of his sister's arrival. Only one survived, Wigge (Vöggr), who played along until he was to do homage to Hjartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hjartwar was only king one morning. However, according to a reputation, it was instead an Åke who killed Hjartwar with seven dagger-stabs and so became king.\n\n\n"}

A messiah claimant, he was the founder of the Unification movement (members of which considered him and his wife Hak Ja Han to be their \"True Parents\"), and of its widely noted \"Blessing\" or mass wedding ceremony, and the author of its unique theology the \"Divine Principle\". He was an opponent of communism and an advocate for Korean reunification, for which he was recognized by the governments of both North and South Korea. Businesses he promoted included News World Communications, an international news media corporation known for its American subsidiary \"The Washington Times\", and Tongil Group, a South Korean business group (chaebol), as well as various related organizations.\n\nMoon was born in what is now North Korea. When he was a child, his family converted to Christianity. In 1947 he was convicted by the North Korean government of spying for South Korea and given a five-year sentence to the Hŭngnam labor camp. In 1954, he founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Seoul, South Korea based on conservative, family-oriented teachings from new interpretations of the Bible. In 1971, he moved to the United States and became well known after giving a series of public speeches on his beliefs. In the 1982 case \"United States v. Sun Myung Moon\" he was found guilty of willfully filing false federal income tax returns and sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. His case generated protests from clergy and civil libertarians, who said that the trial was biased against him.\n\nMoon was criticized for making high demands of his followers. His wedding ceremonies also drew criticism, especially after they involved members of other churches, including Roman Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo. He was also criticized for his relationships with political and religious figures, including U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, North Korean President Kim Il Sung, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\n\nSun Myung Moon was born Moon Yong Myeong on 25 February 1920, in modern-day North P'yŏng'an Province, North Korea, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule. He was the younger of two sons in a farming family of eight children. Moon's family followed Confucianist beliefs until he was around 10 years old, when they converted to Christianity and joined the Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn 1941, Moon began studying electrical engineering at Waseda University in Japan. During this time he cooperated with Communist Party members in the Korean independence movement against Imperial Japan. In 1943, he returned to Seoul and married Sun Kil Choi on 28 April 1945. On 2 April 1946 their son, Sung Jin Moon was born. In the 1940s, Moon attended a church in Sangdo dong that was led by the messianic minister Baek Moon Kim, who claimed that he had been given by Jesus the mission to spread the message of a \"new Israel\" throughout the world. Around this time Moon changed his given name to Sun Myung.\n\nFollowing World War II, Korea was divided along the 38th parallel into two trusteeships: the United States and the Soviet Union. Pyongyang was the center of Christian activity in Korea until 1945. From the late forties 166 priests and other religious figures were killed or disappeared in concentration camps, including Francis Hong Yong-ho, bishop of Pyongyang and all monks of Tokwon abbey. In 1947 Moon was convicted by the North Korean government of spying for South Korea and given a five-year sentence to the Hŭngnam labor camp. In 1950, during the Korean War United Nations troops had raided Hŭngnam and the guards fled. Moon escaped and traveled to Busan, South Korea.\n\nMoon emerged from his years in the labor camp as a staunch anti-communist. His teachings viewed the Cold War between democracy and communism as the final conflict between God and Satan, with divided Korea as its primary front line. In 1954, Moon formally founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Seoul. He quickly drew young acolytes who helped to build the foundations of church affiliated business and cultural organizations. At his new church, he preached a conservative, family-oriented value system and his interpretation of the Bible. On 8 January 1957, Moon and Choi divorced.\n\nMoon has said that when he was fifteen years old Jesus anointed him to carry out his unfinished work by becoming parent to all of humanity. The \"Divine Principle\" or \"Exposition of the Divine Principle\" (Korean 원리강론/原理講論, translit. \"wonli ganglon\") is the main theological textbook of the Unification movement. It was co-written by Moon and early disciple Hyo Won Eu and first published in 1966. A translation entitled \"Divine Principle\" was published in English in 1973. The book lays out the core of Unification theology, and is held to have the status of scripture by believers. Following the format of systematic theology, it includes (1) God's purpose in creating human beings, (2) the fall of man, and (3) restoration – the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended.\n\nGod is viewed as the creator, whose nature combines both masculinity and femininity, and is the source of all truth, beauty, and goodness. Human beings and the universe reflect God's personality, nature, and purpose. \"Give-and-take action\" (reciprocal interaction) and \"subject and object position\" (initiator and responder) are \"key interpretive concepts\", and the self is designed to be God's object. The purpose of human existence is to return joy to God. The \"four-position foundation\" (Origin, Subject, Object and Union) is \"another important and interpretive concept\", and explains in part the emphasis on the family.\n\nMoon married his second wife, Hak Ja Han, on 11 April 1960, soon after he turned 40 years old, in a ceremony called the Holy Marriage. Han is called \"Mother\" or \"True Mother\". She and Moon together are referred to as the \"True Parents\" by members of the Unification Church and their family as the \"True Family\". Jesus was divine but not God; he was supposed to be the second Adam who would create a perfect family by joining with the ideal wife and creating a pure family that would have begun humanity's liberation from its sinful condition. When Jesus was crucified before marrying, he redeemed mankind spiritually but not physically. That task was left to the \"True Parents\" – Moon and Han – who would link married couples and their families to God.\n\nBlessing ceremonies have attracted a lot of attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled \"mass weddings\". Some couples are already married and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries. Meant to highlight the church's emphasis on traditional morality, they brought Moon both fame and notoriety.\n\n36 couples participated in the first ceremony in 1961 for members of the early church in Seoul, South Korea. The ceremonies continued to grow in scale; over 2,000 couples participated in the 1982 one at New York's Madison Square Garden, the first outside South Korea. In 1997, about 30,000 couples took part in a ceremony in Washington, DC.\n\nMoon said that he matched couples from differing races and nationalities because of his belief that all of humanity should be united: \"International and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an ideal world of peace. People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the world of peace can come that much more quickly.\"\n\nIn 1971, Moon moved to the United States, which he had first visited in 1965. He remained a citizen of the Republic of Korea and maintained a residence in South Korea. In 1972, Moon founded the International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences, a series of scientific conferences. The first conference had 20 participants, while the largest conference in Seoul in 1982, had 808 participants from over 100 countries. Participants included Nobel laureates John Eccles (Physiology or Medicine 1963, who chaired the 1976 conference)\nand Eugene Wigner (Physics 1963).\n\nIn 1974, Moon asked church members in the United States to support President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office. Church members prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the United States Capitol, under the motto: \"Forgive, Love and Unite.\" On 1 February 1974 Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the church into widespread public and media attention.\n\nIn the 1970s, Moon, who had seldom before spoken to the general public, gave a series of public speeches to audiences in the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The largest were a rally in 1975 against North Korean aggression in Seoul and a speech at an event organized by the Unification Church in Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1982, Moon was convicted in the United States of filing false federal income tax returns and conspiracy. His conviction was upheld on appeal in a split decision. Moon was given an 18-month sentence and a $15,000 fine. He served 13 months of the sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury before being released on good behavior to a halfway house.\n\nThe case was the center of national freedom of religion and free speech debates. Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of the Harvard University Law School argued that the trial by jury had \"doomed (Moon) to conviction based on religious prejudice.\" The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A, the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon. Many notable clergy, including Jerry Falwell and Joseph Lowery, signed petitions protesting the government's case and spoke out in defense of Moon.\n\nIn 1982 \"The Washington Times\" was founded by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate associated with Moon which also owned newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America, as well as the news agency United Press International. The political views of \"The Washington Times\" have often been described as conservative. The \"Times\" was read by many Washington DC insiders, including Ronald Reagan. By 2002 Moon had invested roughly $1.7 billion to support the \"Times\", which he called \"the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world\".\n\nIn 2000, Moon sponsored a United Nations conference which proposed the formation of \"a religious assembly, or council of religious representatives, within the structure of the United Nations.\"\n\nIn 2003, Moon sponsored the first Peace Cup international club football tournament. The Los Angeles Galaxy, which competes in Major League Soccer, played in South Korea in the Peace Cup. During the event Pelé, widely regarded as the best soccer player of all time and former Brazilian Sports Minister, met with Moon.\n\nIn 2009, Moon's autobiography, \"As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen\" (), was published by Gimm-Young Publishers in South Korea. The book became a best-seller in Korea and Japan. Said to be the inspiration of Gimm-Young CEO Eun Ju Park, a devout Buddhist, the book focused more on Moon's role as a Korean patriot and an international peace advocate than as a religious figure.\n\nBy 2010, Moon had given much of the responsibility for Family Federation for World Peace and Unification religious and business activities to his children, who were then in their 30s and 40s. In 2012, the South Korean press reported that Moon traveled worldwide in his private jet which cost $50 million.\n\nOn 14 August 2012, after suffering from pneumonia earlier in the month, Moon was admitted to Saint Mary's Hospital at The Catholic University of Korea in Seoul. On 15 August 2012, he was reported to be gravely ill and was put on a respirator at the intensive care unit of St. Mary’s Hospital. On 31 August 2012, Moon was transferred to a church-owned hospital near his home in Gapyeong, northeast of Seoul, after suffering multiple organ failure. Moon died on the morning of 3 September 2012 (1:54 am KST) at the age of 92.\n\nIn 1964 Moon founded the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, which promoted the interests of South Korea and sponsored Radio Free Asia. Former U.S. Presidents Harry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon were honorary presidents or directors at various times.\n\nIn 1972 Moon predicted the decline of communism, based on the teachings of the \"Divine Principle\": \"After 7,000 biblical years — 6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion — communism will fall in its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the border line and afterward communism will decline; in the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it.\"\n\nIn 1980, Moon asked church members to found CAUSA International as an anti-communist educational organization, based in New York. In the 1980s, it was active in 21 countries. In the United States it sponsored educational conferences for Christian leaders as well as seminars and conferences for Senate staffers and other activists. In 1986, it produced the anti-communist documentary film \"Nicaragua Was Our Home\". CAUSA supported the Nicaraguan Contras and also reportedly helped finance a Bolivian military coup with connections to cocaine cartels which successfully overthrew a democratically elected government.\nIn August 1985, seven years before the fall of Soviet Union, the Professors World Peace Academy, an organization founded by Moon, sponsored a conference in Geneva to debate the theme \"The situation in the world after the fall of the communist empire.\" In April 1990, Moon visited the Soviet Union and met with President Mikhail Gorbachev. Moon expressed support for the political and economic transformations under way in the Soviet Union. At the same time the Unification Church was expanding into formerly communist nations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some American conservatives criticized Moon for his softening of his previous anti-communist stance.\n\nIn 1991, Moon met with Kim Il Sung, the North Korean President, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula, as well as on international relations, tourism, etc. In 1994, Moon was officially invited to the funeral of Kim Il Sung, in spite of the absence of diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea. Moon and his church are known for their efforts to promote Korean unification.\n\nIn 2003, Korean Unification Church members started a political party in South Korea. It was named \"The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home.\" In its inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for Korean reunification by educating the public about God and peace. Moon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea. In 2012 Moon was posthumously awarded North Korea's National Reunification Prize.\n\nIn 2005, Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Dr. Hak Ja Han Moon, founded the Universal Peace Federation (UPF), an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). \"We support and promote the work of the United Nations and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\" \n\nMoon's projects have been lobbied in the National Congress of Brazil by Brazilian MPs. Moon has held dialogues between members of the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Parliament as part of his Middle East Peace Initiatives.\n\nTongil Group is a South Korean business group (chaebol \"Tongil\" is Korean for \"unification,\" the name of the Unification Church in Korean is \"Tongilgyo.\"), founded in 1963 by Moon as a nonprofit organization to provide revenue for the church. Its core focus was manufacturing but in the 1970s and 1980s it expanded by founding or acquiring businesses in pharmaceuticals, tourism, and publishing. Among Tongil Group’s chief holdings are: The Ilwha Company, which produces ginseng and related products; Ilshin Stone, building materials; and Tongil Heavy Industries, machine parts including hardware for the South Korean military.\n\nNews World Communications is an international news media corporation founded by Moon in 1976. It owns United Press International, \"The World and I\", \"Tiempos del Mundo\" (Latin America), \"The Segye Ilbo\" (South Korea), \"The Sekai Nippo\" (Japan), the \"Zambezi Times\" (South Africa), and \"The Middle East Times\" (Egypt). Until 2008 it published the Washington D.C.-based newsmagazine \"Insight on the News\". Until 2010, it owned the \"Washington Times\". On 2 November 2010, Sun Myung Moon and a group of former \"Times\" editors purchased the \"Times\" from News World.\n\nIn 1982, Moon sponsored the film \"Inchon\", an historical drama about the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. It was not successful critically or financially, and was criticized for its unfair treatment of the North Korean government.\n\nIn 1989, Moon founded Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma, the most successful soccer club in Korean football, having won a record 7 league titles, 2 FA Cups, 3 League Cups, and 2 AFC Champions League titles.\nThe church is the largest owner of U.S. sushi restaurants and in the Kodiak region of Alaska, is the area's largest employer. The church owns the only automobile manufacturing plant in North Korea, Pyeonghwa Motors, and is the second largest exporter of Korean goods.\n\nIn 2011, construction of $18 million Yeosu Expo Hotel was completed; the hotel located at Moon-owned The Ocean Resort in Yeosu, the venue of the Expo 2012. The opening ceremony was attended by the governor of the province. Another one, The Ocean Hotel, was completed in February 2012. Moon-owned Yeongpyeong Resort, The Ocean Resort and Pineridge Resort are scheduled to host the Expo 2012, 2018 Winter Olympics and Formula 1. Moon also managed the FIFA-accredited Peace Cup. The FIFA itself has funded more than $2m for the Peace Cup since 2003.\n\nMoon took a strong stance against racism and racial discrimination. In 1974 he urged Unification Church members to support an African American president of the United States: \"We have had enough of white presidents. So, let's this time elect a president from the Negro race. What will you do if I say so? There's no question there. We must never forget that we are brothers and sisters in a huge human family. In any level of community, we must become like a family.\"\n\nIn 1981 he said that he himself was a victim of racial prejudice in the United States (concerning his prosecution on tax charges in United States v. Sun Myung Moon), saying: \"I would not be standing here today if my skin were white or my religion were Presbyterian. I am here today only because my skin is yellow and my religion is Unification Church. The ugliest things in this beautiful country of America are religious bigotry and racism.\"\n\nSeveral African American organizations and individuals spoke out in defense of Moon at this time including the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Conference of Black Mayors, and Joseph Lowery who was then the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\nIn a later controversy over the use of the word \"Moonie\" by the American news media, which was said to be offensive, Moon's position was supported by civil rights activists Ralph Abernathy and James Bevel.\n\nIn 2000 Moon and The Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan got together to sponsor the Million Family March, a rally in Washington D.C. to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony; as well as to address other issues, including abortion, capital punishment, health care, education, welfare and Social Security reform, substance abuse prevention, and overhaul of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. In his keynote speech Farrakhan called for racial harmony.\n\nIn 1962, Moon and other church members founded the Little Angels Children’s Folk Ballet of Korea, a children's dance troop which presents traditional Korean folk dances. He said that this was to project a positive image of South Korea to the world. In 1984, Moon founded the $8-million Universal Ballet project, with Soviet-born Oleg Vinogradov as its art director and Moon's daughter-in-law Julia as its prima ballerina. It was described by \"The New York Times\" as the top ballet company in Asia. In 1989, Moon founded Universal Ballet Academy which changed its name later to Kirov Academy of Ballet in Washington, D.C.\n\nMoon held honorary degrees from more than ten universities and colleges worldwide; at least one of which, the University of Bridgeport, received significant funding from his organizations. He was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea. In 1985, he and his wife received Doctor of Divinity degrees from Shaw University.\n\nIn 2004, at event in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C., Moon was honored as the Messiah. This attracted much public attention and was criticized by \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" as a possible violation of the principle of separation of church and state in the United States. Some of the political figures who had attended the event later told reporters that they had been misled as to its nature.\n\nSeveral months after his death, an award named after him and his wife (Sunhak Peace Prize) was proposed, inheriting his will to \"recognize and empower innovations in human development, conflict resolution and ecological conservation.\" Its laureates receive a certificate, a medal, and US $1 million.\nMoon was posthumously awarded North Korea's National Reunification Prize in 2012 and a meritorious award by K-League. On the first anniversary of Moon's death, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed condolences to Han and the family saying: \"Kim Jong-un prayed for the repose of Moon, who worked hard for national concord, prosperity and reunification and world peace.\"\n\nIn 2013, Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai stated: \"I remain greatly inspired by people like Reverend Dr. Sun Myung Moon, whose work and life across continents continue to impact positively on the lives of millions of others in the world.\"\n\nMoon's claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been disputed by both Christian and Jewish scholars. The \"Divine Principle\" was labeled as heretical by Protestant churches in South Korea, including Moon’s own Presbyterian Church. In the United States it was rejected by ecumenical organizations as being non-Christian. Protestant commentators have also criticized Unification Church teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. In their influential book \"The Kingdom of the Cults\" (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the \"Divine Principle\" on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus. Commentators have criticized the \"Divine Principle\" for saying that the First World War, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Cold War served as indemnity conditions to prepare the world for the establishment of the Kingdom of God. In 2003, George D. Chryssides of the University of Wolverhampton criticized Moon for introducing doctrines which tended to divide the Christian church rather than uniting it, which was his stated purpose in founding the Unification Church (originally named the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity). In his 2009 autobiography Moon himself wrote that he did not originally intend on founding a separate denomination at all.\n\nMoon has been criticized for basing some of his theology on that of his former pastor Baek Moon Kim. Kim wrote down his theology in a book, titled \"The Fundamental Christian Principles\". It was around this same time that Moon began to claim that Jesus had appeared to him years earlier and had given him a similar mission. Moon eventually helped to develop his own book, titled \"The Original Text of the Divine Principle\" (later changed to the \"Exposition of the Divine Principle\", and later changed again to the \"Divine Principle\"). There are similarities in both men's work related to the Principles of Creation, the Fall, and Restoration. Moon himself stated that Kim was a \"John the Baptist figure\".\n\nDuring the Cold War Moon was criticized by both the mainstream media and the alternative press for his anti-communist activism, which many said could lead to World War Three and a nuclear holocaust. Moon’s anti-communist activities received financial support from controversial Japanese millionaire and activist Ryōichi Sasakawa. In 1977 the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, of the United States House of Representatives, while investigating the Koreagate scandal found that the South Korean National Intelligence Service (KCIA) had worked with the Unification Church to gain political influence within the United States, with some members working as volunteers in Congressional offices. Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization which undertook public diplomacy for the Republic of Korea. The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Moon's campaign in support of Richard Nixon. In 1980, Moon founded the international anti-communist organization CAUSA International which supported the Nicaraguan Contras and also reportedly helped finance a Bolivian military coup which successfully overthrew a democratically elected government. Moon's newspaper, \"The Washington Times\" is said to have played a major role in introducing right wing propaganda into the United States news media, with links to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some American conservatives criticized Moon for his softening of his previous anti-communist stance.\n\nIn the 1990s when Moon began to offer the Unification Church marriage blessing ceremony to members of other churches and religions he was criticized for creating possible confusion. In 1998, journalist Peter Maass reported that some Unification Church members were dismayed and grumbled when Moon extended the Blessing to non-members because they had not gone through the same course that members had. In 2001, the Unification Church came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church when Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist, married in a Unification Church Blessing ceremony, presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon. Following his marriage the Archbishop was called to the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, where he was asked not to see his wife anymore, and to move to a Capuchin monastery. Sung went on a hunger strike to protest their separation. This attracted much media attention. Milingo is now an advocate of the removal of the requirement for celibacy by priests in the Catholic Church. He is the founder of Married Priests Now!.\n\nMoon opposed homosexuality and compared gay people to \"dirty dung-eating dogs\". He prophesied that \"gays will be eliminated\" in a \"purge on God's orders\". In 2000 Moon was criticized, including by some members of his church, for his support of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan's Million Family March. Moon was also criticized for his relationship with controversial Jewish scholar Richard L. Rubenstein, an advocate of the \"Death of God theology\" of the 1960s. Rubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council, as well as on the board of directors of the church-owned \"Washington Times\" newspaper. In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport which was then affiliated with the church. In 1998 the Egyptian newspaper \"Al-Ahram\" criticized Moon's possible relationship with Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu and wrote that the \"Washington Times\" editorial policy was \"rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.\"\n\nIn 2007 Moon's American news magazine \"Insight on the News\" reported that someone on the campaign staff of American presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton had leaked a report to one of \"Insight's\" reporters which said, according to \"The Washington Post\", that Senator Barack Obama had \"spent at least four years in a so-called madrassa, or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia\".\nAccording to the \"International Herald Tribune\", the report said that the Clinton campaign was \"preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack Obama had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was 6.\" Senator Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by \"The New York Times\", \"Insight's\" editor did not name the person said to be the reporter's source. Soon after \"Insight's\" story, CNN reporter John Vause visited State Elementary School Menteng 01, a secular public school which Obama had attended for one year after attending a Roman Catholic school for three, and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in his or her own faith. He was told by Hardi Priyono, deputy headmaster of the school, \"This is a public school. We don't focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment.\" Students at Besuki wore Western clothing, and the \"Chicago Tribune\" described the school as \"so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas\". Interviews by Nedra Pickler of the Associated Press found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama's attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice principal of the school, told Pickler: \"The allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone's welcome here ... it's a public school.\"\n\nIn 2009 Moon's support for the Japan–Korea Undersea Tunnel was criticized in Japan and South Korea as a possible threat to both nations' interests and national identities. In 2012 \"The New Republic\" criticized Moon on a number of points: His neglect of his wife, Hak Ja Han, and his appointments of their children and their spouses to leadership positions in the church and related businesses, including their daughter In Jin Moon to the presidency of the Unification Church of the United States against the wishes of many church members; his support of right-wing elements within the government of South Korea, and using church members and resources for business projects and political activism, including \"The Washington Times\". \"The New Republic\" also criticized the relationship between the Unification Church and Islam, especially following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City; as well as the relationship between Moon and his family and the family of then United States Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe \"Divine Principle\" itself says about Moon: \"With the fullness of time, God has sent one person to this earth to resolve the fundamental problems of human life and the universe. His name is Sun Myung Moon. For several decades he wandered through the spirit world so vast as to be beyond imagining. He trod a bloody path of suffering in search of the truth, passing through tribulations that God alone remembers. Since he understood that no one can find the ultimate truth to save humanity without first passing through the bitterest of trials, he fought alone against millions of devils, both in the spiritual and physical worlds, and triumphed over them all. Through intimate spiritual communion with God and by meeting with Jesus and many saints in Paradise, he brought to light all the secrets of Heaven.\"\n\nIn 1978 Rodney Sawatsky wrote in an article in \"Theology Today\": \"Why trust Rev. Moon's dreams and visions of the new age and his role in it, we ask? Most converts actually have had minimal contact with him. Frederick Sontag (Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church, Abingdon, 1977) in his interviews with Moon appears to have found a pleasant but not an overwhelming personality. Charisma, as traditionally understood, seems hardly applicable here. Rather, Moon provides a model. He suffered valiantly, he knows confidently, he prays assuredly, he lives lovingly, say his followers. The Divine Principle is not an unrealizable ideal; it is incarnate in a man, it lives, it is imitable. His truth is experienced to be their truth. His explanation of the universe becomes their understanding of themselves and the world in which they live.\"\n\nIn 1980 sociologist Irving Louis Horowitz commented: \"The Reverend Moon is a fundamentalist with a vengeance. He has a belief system that admits of no boundaries or limits, an all-embracing truth. His writings exhibit a holistic concern for the person, society, nature, and all things embraced by the human vision. In this sense the concept underwriting the Unification church is apt, for its primary drive and appeal is unity, urging a paradigm of essence in an overly complicated world of existence. It is a ready-made doctrine for impatient young people and all those for whom the pursuit of the complex has become a tiresome and fruitless venture.\"\n\nIn 1998 investigative journalist Peter Maass wrote in an article in \"The New Yorker\": \"There are, certainly, differing degrees of devotion among Moon's followers; the fact that they bow at the right moment or shout \"Mansei!\" in unison doesn't mean they believe everything Moon says, or do precisely what he commands. Even on important issues, like Moon's claiming to be the messiah, there are church members whom I met, including a close aide to Moon, who demur. A religious leader whom they respect and whose theology they believe, yes; the messiah, perhaps not.\"\n\nIn his 2004 book \"The New Religious Movement Experience in America\" Eugene V. Gallagher wrote: \"The \"Divine Principle's\" analysis of the Fall sets the stage for the mission of Rev. Moon, who in the last days brings a revelation that offers humankind the chance to return to an Edenic state. The account in the \"Divine Principle\" offers Unificationists a comprehensive context for understanding human suffering.\"\n\n\n"}

It was originally released as Nose to Tail Eating: A Kind of British Cooking in England in 1999, but was updated and revamped to be more comprehensive for the American edition, which was also re-released in the UK. The updated release featured a foreword written by Anthony Bourdain, author of \"\". \"The New Yorker\" has described the book as the \"'Ulysses' of the whole Slow Food movement\" because of its international readership and the \"New York Magazine\" considered it to be a \"cult cookbook\".\n\nIn 2000, \"The Whole Beast\" was given the André Simon Award for gastronomic literature.\n\nThe book features a number of recipes that, in total, utilize every part of the pig. In addition, it features a number of \"techniques for brining, salting, pickling and preserving in fat\", including explanations on how to \"clear stock with egg whites and shells, how to bone out a trotter and how to bake bread using a tiny quantity of yeast for tastier results.\" It also includes descriptions on methods of \"making stocks and the old-fashioned skill of rendering\". The book also includes a few black and white photos that serve as decoration and example for the dishes and pieces of meat involved and discussed.\n\nA famous quote from the book, and personal slogan of Henderson that is often cited by newspapers and used by master chefs reads, \"If you're going to kill the animal it seems only polite to use the whole thing.\"\n\nAmanda Hesser of the \"New York Times\" said that Henderson has \"a lovely writing voice, as well, so the text, largely recipes, has a rare lyrical charm. An ingredient might be 'a large knob of butter' or 'a good supply of toast.'\" Kurt Timmermeister, author of \"Growing a Farmer: How I Learned to Live Off the Land\", stated that the book \"has a style...that I love: clean, crisp and confident with a touch of humor.\" Fay Maschler of the \"London Evening Standard\" explained that \"Fergus the man comes across in the writing. You can almost see and hear his curvaceous smile, joyful semaphore and barks of 'Ah ha!'.\"\n\nJonathan Reynolds of the \"New York Times\" praised Henderson's use of various, generally undesirable parts of the pig and pointed out that the book was \"filled with sly observations and unpredictable advice about ingredients other than offal\" as well. Also for the \"New York Times\", Dwight Garner called the book a \"terrifically dour, Edward Gorey-ish guide to cooking with offal: everything from pig's trotters and lamb's kidneys to brains, tripe, spleen, heart and tongue.\" Elizabeth Johnson of \"The Journal News\" considered first editions of the book to be \"collector's items\" because of its popularity. Lucy Waverman of \"The Globe and Mail\" said that its \"dry humour and vivid imagery is a refreshing change from traditional recipe writing\". Aileen Reid of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called it a \"surprisingly refined book\" that is \"beautifully and elegantly written\". Stephanie Alexander of \"The Age\" considered it to be an \"absolute gem\" and a \"triumph of book design.\" Two years later for \"The Age\", Necia Wilden wrote that the book was \"a sleeper that went from underground classic to foodies' must-have\".\n\n\n\n"}

The books are based on H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nIn a departure from many Cthulhu Mythos stories, Lumley's characters are not helpless victims of unimaginable forces which can drive humans mad by merely manifesting themselves. Instead, Titus Crow, his friend Henri-Laurent de Marigny, and other Lumley characters confront Cthulhu's minions in a series of increasingly large-scale encounters, in which humans, although outmatched, try to fight back. In a letter to the journal \"Crypt of Cthulhu\", Lumley wrote:\n\nCrow has been known to survive any number of encounters with monsters, although he may not always be able to defeat the creatures. For instance, he may fall unconscious upon running into a monster that kills anything that moves.\n\nIn The Transition of Titus Crow Crow, fleeing from the Hounds of Tindalos, is almost totally destroyed when the Clock crashes. (Pt.4 -Fragments). He is slowly recreated from surviving cells & his memories stored in the Clock, as a cyborg over many decades, by a robot who theorized that robots were originally created by organic beings. As a cyborg he now has powers that can better deal with the monsters of the mythos.\n\nHe is described as a man who spends most of his money on commodities and keeps the rest of it in the bank. Crow owns several Cthulhu Mythos objects, including the Clock of Dreams. The Clock is a time-space machine in the form of a coffin-shaped clock. It was previously owned by Randolph Carter and by de Marigny's father, and is referred to as \"de Marigny's clock\" in many of the early short stories.\n\nIn an interview with Lumley, Robert M. Price suggests various possible models for Crow, including Miro Hetzel, Jack Vance's futuristic detective, Doctor Who, Mervyn Peake's Titus Groan, August Derleth's Dr. Laban Shrewsbury, William Hope Hodgson's Carnacki and Seabury Quinn's Jules de Grandin. Lumley doesn't acknowledge any of these as conscious inspirations, saying that Crow's time-clock (which derives from Lovecraft's \"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\") long predates Who; that he's never read Peake's \"Gormenghast\" and that the similarity of names is coincidental; and that he \"was never too keen on\" Derleth's Shrewsbury. He does admit, however, to having \"always had a soft spot\" for Bram Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing.\n\n\nCollected in \"The Compleat Crow\" (1987 Hodder and Stoughton). ()\n\n"}

The UDRP currently applies to all generic top level domains (.com, .net, .org, etc...), some country code top-level domains, and some older top level domains in specific circumstances.\n\nWhen ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was \"The Trademark Dilemma\", the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner's consent. By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled. In the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal described such domain names as \"an instrument of fraud\".\n\nOne of ICANN's first steps was to commission the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to produce a report on the conflict between trademarks and domain names. Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report recommended the establishment of a \"mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations\", which would allow for a \"neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature.\" The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that \"each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party\n\nThe WIPO Report sets out the now familiar three stage test of the UDRP.\n\nFollowing adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was \"World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman\", involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.com\n\nProviders of the UDRP are:\n\n\nWhen a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must \"represent and warrant\", among other things, that registering the name \"will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party\", and agree to participate in an arbitration-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim.\n\nA complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed:\n\n\nIn a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as:\n\n\nThe goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge. The costs to hire a UDRP provider to handle a complaint often start around US$1,000 to $2,000.\n\nIf a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law. For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name.\n\nThe UDRP process has already been used in a number of well-known cases, such as \"Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and \"Madonna.com\"\". In this case, the arbitration panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna.\n\nOften there is contention over similar but not identical domain names, in which the offended party files a court action claiming trademark or copyright infringement. For example, actor Robert De Niro has claimed ownership of all domain names incorporating the text \"Tribeca\" for domain names with any content related to film festivals. In particular, he has a dispute with the owner of the website http://tribeca.net.\n\nIn 2012, ICANN launched a process to create new generic top-level domains. Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms. Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective. Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a \"substantial increase in cybersquatting\". Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Miquel Hudin in 2007 with Èlia Varela i Serra as editor and the guides are designed to allow those interested in enotourism to visit \"Big Wines from Small Regions\" as they focus exclusively on the wines as well as the gastronomy and local culture of small regions throughout the world.\n\nThe first Vinologue Guide was for Dalmatia in Croatia and was released in 2008.\n\nAfter several trips throughout Europe in the early 2000s the founders discovered that traditional travel guidebooks made little to no mention of the wines or the culture and gastronomy that surrounds it. In 2007 they started researching a guide for the coastal Dalmatia region in Croatia. While researching the guide, they found the wines of neighboring Herzegovina to be of high quality as well and decided to release two guides instead of the original one.\n\nAll of the guides were initially released in the digital EPUB format. They slowly added other titles such as Stellenbosch in South Africa. It was in 2012 that they released their first official print guide (alongside the digital version) for the Empordà region of Catalonia due to demand from the winemakers. It was the first English language enotourism guide of its kind in all of Spain. This was followed by a guide in print and digital for DOQ Priorat that was released simultaneously in separate English and Catalan editions. It was the first enotourism guide and first complete guide to the internationally renowned wines of the region.\n\nAfter the first edition of the Priorat book unexpectedly sold out in 2014, they released a fully revised and much larger second edition in mid-2015.\n\nThe guides are different from other travel guidebooks in that in addition to providing travel information, history, and basic language information, they also provide reviews of the wines produced by each winery covered creating a hybrid book that is part travel guide and part wine guide, thus the name, 'vinologue' which is a portmanteau of 'vino' and 'travelogue'. The guides work to make wine both approachable and affordable for any audience and they purposefully don't award numeric scores to wines given that beyond tasting notes, they believe scores to be highly subjective and personal.\n\nBoth the print and digital editions of the guides are focused on being \"21st century books\" with GPS coordinates from wineries, QR Codes, and other digital media integration.\n\nEach guide requires a great deal of work by the authors involved as they live in the region for several months while working on the research in order to achieve a full first person point of view. The guides are written fully independently with the wineries and other businesses mentioned not paying for inclusion and the local governmental bodies not funding publication.\n\nThe comprehensive tasting notes for the wines of the regions and accompanying scores are derived from a panel of professional sommeliers who perform all the tastings fully blind.\n\n\nVinologue Empordà received the Gourmand Award of \"Best Enotourism Book\" from a United States publisher in 2012.\n\nVinologue Priorat 1st Edition was a finalist for \"Best Wine Book in the World\" from the Gourmand Award.\n\nVinologue Priorat 2nd Edition was praised highly in the annual wine book reviews on the website of Jancis Robinson stating, \"Quite simply, every wine region deserves an enotourism guide of this calibre, and every wine traveller wants a wine guide this good.\" \n\nGeorgia: A guide to the cradle of wine was named, \"the definitive guide to this unique country's wines\" in The Guardian. \n\nThey were the first to coin the term, flying wine to describe wines that were made in rented facilities that they winemaker didn't own. These differ from négociants in that the wines are usually side projects of a winemaker at the winery made in their spare time primarily for experimentation as opposed to the négociant which primarily for commercial purposes. Flying wines are often encountered in Priorat, neighboring DO Montsant, and other regions where winemaking is the dominant aspect of day-to-day life.\n\n"}

Substantial numbers of manuscripts circulated during the later medieval period containing reports of pleas heard before the Common Bench. In the sixteenth century versions of this material appeared in print form. These publications constituted the earliest legal precedents of the common law. They are extant in a continuous series from 1268 to 1535, covering the reigns of King Edward I to Henry VIII. The language of the original manuscripts and editions was either Latin or Law French.\nMaitland and others have considered that the medieval manuscripts were compiled by law students, rather than being officially sanctioned accounts of court proceedings.\n\nThe best-known printed version is the so-called \"Vulgate\" edition, which appeared in a series of volumes between 1678 and 1680, and which became the standard edition consulted by practising lawyers. More recent editions for the use of lawyers and historians have been made by the Selden Society. Traditionally, they have been divided into eleven separate series:\n\n\nA number of abridgements of the Year Books were compiled and circulated by various editors, who sought to excerpt leading cases and categorise them by subject. The first abridgment was made by Nicholas Statham, Baron of the Exchequer under Edward IV, in around 1470.\n\nThe last year for which a yearbook was printed was 1535. Thereafter printed law reports became more various. The earliest such reports are called the nominate reports; their original publications were named after the court reporter who compiled and edited them. Sir Edward Coke was one important early jurist who published a series of court reports during his tenure as chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas.\n\n\n"}
