The minimum age is frequently set at 55 years old, but it can vary.\n\nThese communities are set up to accommodate older individuals who would like to live in an area without the perceived problems of having children around. In most cases a younger spouse or significant other is permitted to live in the community as long as one member meets the minimum age requirement.\n\nAge-qualified communities, also known as 55+ communities, active adult communities, lifestyle communities, or retirement communities, are often planned communities that offer homes and community features that are attractive to 55+ adults. These might include a clubhouse or lifestyle center with a good many activities, sometimes with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, exercise facilities, craft rooms, demonstration kitchens, and decks and patios for gathering.\n\nA noteworthy Canadian example, Arbutus Ridge Seaside Community for Active Adults in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island, was the first comprehensive retirement community built in Canada. It is a private community that subsequently became the template and proving ground for what has become accepted and commonplace. In 2015, that template was expanded in line with the growing desire for spiritually focused retirement living as Global Kingdom Ministries unveiled Trinity Ravine Towers in Toronto, one of the country's first Christian community living condominium complexes.\n\nAccording to 55places.com, Florida has the most age-restricted communities with more than 300 communities, with New Jersey coming in second with more than 230 age-restricted communities. Other popular states for age-restricted communities include Oregon, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Utah.\n\nWhile in the United States discrimination in housing is generally prohibited, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 (109 STAT. 787) allow communities to restrict residency to older individuals. Individuals may buy into these properties regardless of age; however, the owner may be prohibited from occupying the property according to the association declarations and bylaws.\n\nAccording to research compiled by TRI Pointe Homes, there are 75 million people who comprise the boomer generation and over 32 million of these who are over the age of 55 would consider living in an age-restricted community.\n\nWith most age restricted communities, there are homeowner association (HOA) fees that cover services and amenities to resident such as golf courses, game nights, clubhouses, pools, and landscaping. In the United States, these fees can range from $100 — $500 a month.\n\nA common problem occurs when the homeowner dies; if the surviving resident does not meet the requirements for ownership, then he or she is forced to sell the home. This can happen even if the survivor is the \"spouse\" of the deceased. However, many age-restricted communities have circumvented this issue by allowing the survivor to maintain residency as noted in the deed restrictions.\n\nAnother common problem arises when a change in the family situation renders a grandparent responsible for a grandchild. Often grandchildren are prohibited from living more than a short time (often 90 days) in a community.\n"}

He was one of the most successful preachers of Jamaican Revivalism.\n\nAfter spending time in Panama, he returned to Jamaica and was baptized by a local Baptist preacher. He became not merely leader of a Revival branch but of a new movement,the Bedwardites . In the 1880 he started to gather large groups of followers by conducting mass healings services. He identified himself with Paul Bogle, the Baptist leader of the Morant Bay rebellion. In this connection he stressed for changes and developments in the race relations in Jamaican society. He supposedly said: “Brethren! Hell will be your position if you do not rise up and crush the white man. The time is coming!There is a white wall and a black wall. And the white wall has been closing around the black wall: but now the black wall has become bigger than the white.”\n\nBedward was arrested for sedition but sent to a mental asylum. On release he continued his role as a Revival healer and preacher. He stressed his followers to be self-sufficient and at its height the movement gathered about 30,000 followers. He told his followers to sell their possessions including owned land and give him all the profits. Some of these followers did just that. On one occasion, he told his followers that they all would fly back to Africa, however to do so they had to climb up into a breadfruit tree in August Town while wearing bed sheets for the liftoff. However, they told him to go first and it resulted in him breaking his legs where he was submitted to the university hospital of the West Indies.\n\nHe led his followers into Garveyism by finding the charismatic metaphor: Bedward and Garvey were as Aaron and Moses, one the high priest, the other prophet, both leading the children of Israel out of exile. Garvey's middle name was considered by people to be a mix of the two names Moses and Messiah.\n\nLater Bedward proclaimed that he was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ and that, like Elijah, he would ascend into heaven in a flaming chariot. He then expected to rain down fire on those that did not follow him, thereby destroying the whole world. In 1921 he and 800 followers marched in to Kingston “to do battle with his enemies.” This however didn’t result in him flying to heaven. Bedward and his followers were arrested and he was sent to mental asylum for the second time where he remained to the end of his life.\n\nHis impact was that many of his followers became Garveyites and Rastafarians, bringing with them the experience of resisting the system and demanding changes of the colonial oppression and the white oppression. Rastafari has taken the idea of Garvey as a prophet, while also casting him in the role of John the Baptist, by virtue of his \"voice in the wilderness\" call taken as heralding their expected Messiah, \"Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned.\"\n\nOne of the more famous followers of Bedwardism was Robert Hinds, Leonard Howell's second in command.\n\nBedward is mentioned in an early Trinidadian recording of Jamaican mento classic Sly Mongoose by Sam Manning, who recorded it in December 1925 for the Okeh label (the song was recorded by many artists with changing lyrics). He is mentioned in Jamaican reggae artist Etana's \"I Am Not Afraid.\" He is also mentioned in the Jamaican folk classic \"Dip Dem,\" which was recorded by Louise Bennett for her 1954 album \"Jamaican Folk Songs\". \"Bedward the Flying Preacher\" by Singers & Players featuring Prince Far I appears on the 1983 album \"Staggering Heights\", and the 1985 compilation \"Pay It All Back Vol. 1\", both on Britain's On-U Sound label. This was also released as a 7\" single on the On-U Sound offshoot Sound Boy in 2003, credited to Prince Far I, with a dub version on the B-side. Prince Pompadoe released a 7\" 45 called \"Dip them Bedward\" on the Pressure Sounds and Prophet labels in 1976. The song was produced by Vivian 'Yabby You' Jackson. It was reissued on the CD Deeper Roots, a compilation of Yabby You productions.\n\nPaul Hamilton also released a 45' entitled \"Who say Bedward Fly?\"\n\n\n\n"}

The appeal is often considered to be the origin of the French Resistance to the German occupation during World War II. De Gaulle spoke to the French people from London after the fall of France. He declared that the war for France was not yet over, and rallied the country in support of the Resistance. It is regarded as one of the most important speeches in French history.\n\nIn spite of its reputation as the beginning of the Resistance and Free French, historians have shown that the appeal was heard only by a minority of French people. De Gaulle's 22 June 1940 speech on the BBC was more widely heard.\n\nGeneral de Gaulle became the \"de facto\" leader of the Free French Forces that had escaped to London in June 1940. Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany, and led the collaborating Vichy government while the Germans occupied the country's northern portion and several leading politicians, including Georges Mandel, Leon Blum, Pierre Mendès France, Jean Zay and Edouard Daladier (and separately Paul Reynaud), were arrested while travelling to continue the war from North Africa. De Gaulle opposed the armistice and had fled France on 17 June after Pétain made clear that he would seek an accommodation with the Nazis.\n\nDe Gaulle obtained special permission from Winston Churchill to broadcast a speech on 18 June via BBC Radio from Broadcasting House over France, despite the British Cabinet's objections that such a broadcast could provoke the Pétain government into a closer allegiance with Germany. In his speech, de Gaulle reminded the French people that the British Empire and the United States of America would support them militarily and economically in an effort to retake France from the Germans.\n\nThe BBC did not record the speech, and few actually heard it. Another speech, which was recorded and heard by more people, was given by de Gaulle four days later. There is a record, however, of the manuscript of the speech of 18 June, which has been found in the archives of the Swiss intelligence agencies who published the text for their own uses on 19 June. The manuscript of the speech, as well as the recording of the 22 June speech, has been classed on 18 June 2005, by the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.\n\nOn 18 June 1940, at 19:00 (GMT), de Gaulle's voice was broadcast nationwide, saying in French (author. translation):\n\nAlthough de Gaulle's speech on 18 June is among the most famous in French history, few French listeners heard it that day. It was broadcast on the BBC, a British radio station, practically unannounced, and given by an obscure brigadier general only recently appointed junior minister. Consequently, of the 10,000 French citizens in Britain, only 300 volunteered and of the more than 100,000 soldiers temporarily on British soil, most of them recently evacuated from Norway or Dunkirk, only 7,000 stayed on to join de Gaulle. The rest returned to France and were quickly made prisoners of war. Despite this, de Gaulle's speech was undeniably influential and provided motivation for the people of France and for the oppressed of the rest of Europe.\n\nThe themes of the speech would be reused throughout the war as a means of inspiring French people to resist German occupation. Four days later, de Gaulle delivered a speech which largely reiterated the points made in his 18 June speech, and this was heard by a larger audience in France. The content of the 22 June speech is often confused for that of 18 June. In addition, in early August a poster written by de Gaulle would be distributed widely in London and would become known as \"L'affiche de Londres\" (The London Poster). Variations of this poster would be produced and displayed in Africa, South America and France itself over the course of the war.\n\nThe 70th anniversary of the speech was marked in 2010 by the issuing of a postage stamp (designed by Georges Mathieu) and a €2 commemorative coin.\n\n\n"}

Throughout his career, Hendin has also been known as a medical journalist, newspaper columnist, publishing executive, literary agent, and author. Some of Hendin's books include the groundbreaking bestseller \"Death as a Fact of Life\" as well as the extensive reference \"Guide to Biblical Coins\".\n\nDavid Bruce Hendin was born the son of Dr. Aaron and Celeste Sherman Hendin (died 1948) and Lillian Karsh Hendin (married 1949). Hendin spent his early years in St. Louis. After graduating from Ladue Horton Watkins High School in 1963, Hendin went on to attend the University of Missouri – Colombia where he received his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 1967. In 1971, Hendin received his MA Degree from Missouri's School of Journalism. In 2002, Hendin was recognized as one of Ladue's thirty-seven distinguished alumni from the school's 50-year history.\n\nHendin's interest in ancient Jewish and Biblical coins began in 1967 during a year-long stint as a biology teacher at an agricultural high school near the Israeli town of Ashkelon. During this time, Hendin learned to speak Hebrew and became fascinated with the study of ancient Jewish and Biblical coins. Aaron Hendin, David's father, had been a long-time collector and student of ancient Jewish coins when he was not working as a physician in St. Louis. David had never shown an interest in his father's hobby, but after his year in Israel, he was hooked on the subject.\n\nThe younger Hendin went on to be mentored for decades by international experts in the field. These experts included the well-known Ya’akov Meshorer, professor of Archaeology and Numismatics at Hebrew University and Chief Curator of the Israel Museum, where he founded the numismatic department. Hendin edited and published Meshorer's \"Ancient Jewish Coinage Vols. I & 2\" as well as the English edition of Meshorer's \"A Treasury of Jewish Coins\"\".\" Upon Meshorer's death in 2002, Hendin helped establish the Meshorer Prize in Numismatics given by the Israel Museum. He now sits on the board that awards this prize. Also among Hendin's mentors was Dan Barag, professor of Archaeology and Numismatics at Hebrew University and Shraga Qedar, another well-known numismatic scholar.\n\nIn 1985 and 1986, Hendin returned to Israel as the chief numismatist of the Joint Sepphoris Project excavations under the auspices of Duke University (Eric and Carol Meyers) and Hebrew University (Ehud Netzer). He again excavated in 2011 with the Duke team. Hendin is a well-known authority on Biblical and ancient Jewish coins. He has published more than 50 articles in this field and has been invited to speak at symposia in Italy, Great Britain, Israel, and the United States. His books and articles about ancient Middle Eastern coins and pre-coinage currency and weights span his 50-year study of the subjects. In 1992, Hendin was elected a Fellow of the American Numismatic Society and is now a Life Fellow. He has donated many significant numismatic and archaeological objects to the Israel Museum, Jerusalem and thus was honored in 2001 as a Sponsor of the Israel Museum. He is also a trustee and adjunct curator at the American Numismatic Society.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1993, David Hendin had a successful career with Scripps Howard's United Feature Syndicate (UFS) and Newspaper Enterprise Association. During his years as a journalist with Scripps Howard, Hendin wrote as a medical journalist. His first column, \"Man and his World,\" was the first syndicated newspaper column on ecology and ran from 1970 until 1973. Following this, Hendin wrote another syndicated newspaper column, \"The Medical Consumer,\" which was published in newspapers nationwide for six years (1973-1979). In 1973, Hendin's book \"Death as a Fact of Life\" was serialized in the \"New York Post\" and other newspapers nationwide. This and Hendin's other books have been translated into Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nOverall, Hendin wrote more than 1,000 articles for newspapers and magazines, including \"Saturday Review, Reader’s Digest,\" and \"Science News.\" His writing has been hailed as “brilliant and highly sensitive,” by \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" praised Hendin's writing as “journalism of the highest order.” Hendin became the Senior Vice President and Editorial Director for United Feature Syndicate in 1980. In that position, Hendin was responsible for signing many exceptional columnists and cartoonists, including the following:\nHendin also worked with Pulitzer Prize winning muckraker Jack Anderson and many cartoonists, including Charles M. Schulz (Peanuts), Jim Davis (Garfield), Mort Walker (Beetle Bailey, Gamin & Patches), Mike Peters, and artist Peter Max. Under Hendin's tenure, UFS launched \"The Supermarket Shopper\" by Martin Sloan, the first newspaper column that led to America's 1980's coupon-clipping craze. In 1992, he was a featured speaker at Ohio State University's Festival of Cartoon Art. From 1971 until 1986, in addition to his work with the UFS, Hendin taught as an Adjunct Professor of Journalism and established a New York Science Journalism program at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. In 1975 and 1976, Hendin lectured as an adjunct professor on science and medical journalism at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Hendin has served on the boards of trustees of the Scripps Howard Foundation, American Friends of the Bible Lands Museum/Jerusalem\",\" the Kinsey Institute for Sex, Gender and Reproduction, The Newspaper Comics Council, the Holy Land Conservation Fund, and the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing. In 1993, Hendin left UFS and became a consultant and literary agent. Prior to his retirement, he counted many talented creators as his clients, including the following:\nHendin was also co-executive producer of the 1993 PBS Special \"Miss Manners and Company.\"\n\nHendin has been married since 1985 to Jeannie (Luciano), retired vice-chair and director of trade publishing at W.W.

The conflict erupted between rebel and pro-Ottoman Druze factions over succession of the Maani rule.\n\nIn 1624, when the Ottoman Sultan recognized Fakhr-al-Din II as Lord of Arabistan (from Aleppo to the borders of Egypt), the Druze leader made Tiberias his capital. Fakhr ad Din II, one of the most famous Druze Emirs, was succeeded in 1635 by his nephew Mulhim Ma'an, who ruled through his death in 1658. Fakhr ad Din II's only surviving son, Husayn, lived the rest of his life as a court official in Constantinople. Emir Mulhim exercised Iltizam taxation rights in the Chouf, Gharb, Jurd, Matn, and Kisrawan districts of Lebanon. Mulhim's forces battled and defeated those of Mustafa Pasha, Beylerbey of Damascus, in 1642, but he is reported by historians to have been otherwise loyal to Ottoman rule. Emir Mulhim Ma'an died in 1658, succeeded by two of his sons.\n\nFollowing Mulhim's death in 1658, his sons Ahmad and Korkmaz (or Qurqmaz) entered into a power struggle with other Ottoman-backed Druze leaders.\n\nIn 1660, the Ottoman Empire moved to reorganize the region, placing the sanjaks (districts) of Sidon-Beirut and Safed in a newly formed province of Sidon, a move seen by local Druze as an attempt to assert control. An Ottoman expedition was dispatched to the area following the creation of the new administrative units, initially against the Shihabs and the Shia Hamades. The reformer - grand wazir Köprülü Mehmed Pasha came in person with the expedition. The Shihabs fled to the Hamades in the high Kisrawan, while the Ottoman troops pillaged Wadi al-Taym.\n\nClaiming that the Shihabs allied with the Ma'anis, the Ottomans demanded Ahmad and Korkmuz Ma'an to hand over the Shihabs and provide money for the Ottoman army, but the Ma'anis refused and fled to the Kisrawan as well. The Ma'anis lost control and the Druze of the Galilee lost their protection. Ottoman troops pillaged the area, seeking for the lords of Shihabs, Hamades and Ma'anis, causing \"misery\" to the peasants. As a result, the pro-Ottoman Druze overran much of the Galilee, most notably destroying the cities of Safed and Tiberias.\n\nAlternative pro-Ottoman sheikhs - Sirhal Imad and Ali Alam al-Din were briefly installed to rule the Druze country.\n\nContemporary historian Istifan al-Duwayhi reports that Korkmaz was killed in act of treachery by the Beylerbey of Damascus in 1662. His brother Ahmad Ma'an apparently escaped the plotting.\n\nIn 1666, according to al-Safa, local Shia repulsed the governor of Sidon and a Ma'an force near Nabatiyeh.\n\nIn 1667, Ahmad Ma'an and his supporters defeated the pro-Ottoman Abu Harmoush, Alam al-Din, al-Sawaf and others, and termed Yamanis near Beirut.\n\nAhmad Ma'an emerged victorious in the power struggle among the Druze in 1667, but the Maʿnīs lost control of Safad and retreated to controlling the iltizam of the Chouf mountains and Kisrawan, answerable to the Ottoman governor of Sidon. According to Abu-Husayn, after 1667 Ahmad Ma'an resumed correspondence with the Tuscans.\n\nAhmad continued as local ruler through his death from natural causes, without heir, in 1697. During the Ottoman–Habsburg War (1683–1699), Ahmad Ma'n collaborated in a rebellion against the Ottomans which extended beyond his death. Iltizam rights in Chouf and Kisrawan passed to the rising Shihab family through female-line inheritance. Despite conflicts in the 1660s, the Maan family \"played the leading role in the management of the internal affairs of this eyalet until the closing years of the 17th century, perhaps because it was not possible to manage the province-certainly not in the sanjak of Sidon-Beirut-without them.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "4097014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4097014", "title": "Error card", "text": "Error card\n\nIn the trading card collecting hobby, an error card is a card that shows incorrect information or some other unintended flaw. It can contain a mistake, such as a misspelling or a photo of someone other than the athlete named on the card. Depending on whether the manufacturer noticed the problem while the cards were still being produced, a card may exist in both correct and incorrect versions. If the correction is made sufficiently early in the print run, the error card may be significantly rarer and more valuable than the corrected version. However, the opposite may be true if the error is corrected late in the printing cycle, resulting in a smaller population of the corrected version of the card compared to the error version.\n\nIf the manufacturer never made a correction, the card is considered an \"uncorrected error\". Often, however, \"error card\" is used in a more limited sense, meaning only those cards where variant versions exist.\n\nOne example of \"variations\" happened in the 1959 and 1960 Topps baseball sets. Certain cards were printed on two different types of cardstock; one produced a white back, and the other a darker gray. The photographs and information on the cards themselves were not in error. The result was that said cards occur in two variations, based on the back color.\n\nThe Bowman cards of the 1950s contain two notable errors. The first was not technically an error, but nonetheless resulted in an anomaly in the 1954 Bowman set. The set featured Ted Williams as card number 66. Shortly after the set was released, Williams signed an exclusive contract with Topps, Bowman's primary competitor. Topps featured Williams as the first and last cards in their set that year. Now barred from using Williams's picture and name, Bowman substituted Williams' teammate Jimmy Piersall as card number 66 in all subsequent printings, duplicating the front and back of Piersall's other card in the series, number 210.\n\nThe next year, in their last set before selling out to Topps, Bowman \"flipped\" the backs of two pairs of cards. Brothers Milt Bolling of the Red Sox and Frank Bolling of the Tigers and pitchers Don Johnson of the Orioles and Ernie Johnson of the Braves were originally issued with their counterparts' card backs. Bowman corrected the error and issued cards with the correct backs.\n\nIn its 1956 set, Topps issued six team cards, the Cubs, Reds, Orioles, Indians, Braves and Phillies, in three different versions. The different cards are commonly referred to by collectors as the \"dated\", \"undated\" and \"centered\" cards. The first release showed a team picture, obviously taken the year before and correctly labeled as \"1955 Chicago Cubs, \"1955 Cincinnati Reds\" and so on. For some reason, perhaps because it was confusing to have a card labeled \"1955\" in a 1956 set, Topps reprinted these cards, blacking out the space where the date had appeared. This resulted in the team name being off-center in the black box where it appeared. Topps finally issued a third version of all six cards with the team name centered in the box.\n\nTopps's 1957 set contained Yankee great Mickey Mantle as card number 286. The card is known among collectors as the \"ghost Mantle\". Topps editors had long been expert at altering pictures to meet their needs. For example, the same photo of future major league manager Bob Kennedy appears in the 1954, '55 and '56 Topps sets. But the photo is airbrushed to show Kennedy in an Indians cap in '54, a Orioles cap in '55 and, finally, a White Sox cap in '56. The '57 Mantle card shows a posed shot of the switch hitting center fielder finishing a left-handed swing. The original photo apparently contained someone standing behind Mantle as he swung. When the card was assembled, the intruder was \"blacked out\", leaving a perfect silhouette, a \"ghost\", in back of the Mick. The outline is far more prominent and clear in some copies of the card than it is on others, inspiring debate among collectors as to whether Topps issued a corrected version, with the interloper better camouflaged.\n\nIn the 1957 Topps set, card number 20, of Henry Aaron, features a classic example of a \"flipped negative\". The photo on the card shows Aaron, a right-handed slugger, batting left-handed. A closer look at the number on Aaron's uniform, 44, shows that he was not playing a practical joke on the photographer. The number is backwards, the result of the photo negative being printed upside down. Topps never issued a corrected version.\n\nIn the 1959 Topps set, Aaron's Braves teammate Lew Burdette fooled the Topps photographer. Burdette joined with Warren Spahn to form the heart of a pitching staff that would carry the Braves to two consecutive World Series. The front of his 1959 Topps card, number 440, shows Burdette, a right-handed pitcher, with a glove on his right hand at the top of a left-handed windup. Topps got revenge on Burdette, however, when they printed his name on the card. Burdette's middle name, \"Lewis\" is shortened to \"Lou\", rather than \"Lew\". The year before Topps had taken no chances, identifying him as \"Lou\" on the front of card number 10, and \"Lew\" on the back.\n\nThe Topps 1962 baseball set saw the 'grandaddy' of all error situations. The set's entire second series (the 87 cards numbered 110 through 196) was first printed and distributed without the proper amount of ink for the photographs; the result has been known ever since as the \"Green Tint\" series, for the sky and dirt in the backgrounds of some cards are decidedly green, rather than blue or brown. All the photos were somewhat out of focus, and card number 159 (Yankees Pitcher Hal Reniff) was incorrectly numbered as 139.\n\nThe entire series was re-printed and re-distributed, with the photo inks in proper proportion and with eight photos replaced with different poses (Reniff's among them). All remaining photos were re-cropped for the re-printing (e.g., some photos were moved a bit to one side, and others moved up or down), thus giving every card in the series an error card. The Reniff card's number was still incorrect in this second printing, so a third, corrected one of his was produced, resulting in one 'true' Reniff card and 2 errors (each error card with a different photograph).\n\nThe \"wrongback\" error occurs when the sheet is mated with a back which is upside down or reversed. Most wrongbacks have the backs off center. It is possible to find a centered back and off center front.\n\nThe blankback or blankfront error is a type of error where the back or front of the card is blank. Most likely however, these are first run proofs from the company not intended for distribution. In addition, misspelled words/names, print blotches, missing border sections, and different colored backgrounds (like the 1973 manager cards) are all considered errors although relatively few of these are corrected.\n\nThe 1974 \"Washington Nat'l League\" cards are considered errors too, but were corrected during the run. This came about when there was a strong possibility that the San Diego Padres might move to Washington after the 1973 season. Anticipating that possibility, Topps substituted the term \"Washington Nat'l League\" onto early-series Padres' cards, since the nickname of the potentially re-located team was not known.\n\nBilly Ripken is also remembered for an infamous baseball card.\nIn , Ripken's Fleer card showed the player holding a bat with the expletive \"fuck face\" written in plain view on the knob of the bat. Fleer subsequently rushed to correct the error, and in their haste, released versions in which the text was scrawled over with a marker, whited out with correction fluid, and also airbrushed. On the final, corrected version, Fleer obscured the offensive words with a black box (this was the version included in all factory sets). Both the original card and many of the corrected versions have become collector's items as a result. There are at least ten different variations of this card. As of February 2009 the white out version has a book value of $120.\n\nYears later, Ripken admitted to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and did not intend to use it for the card.\n\nThe 1990 Pro Set football card release has several errors and variations. Due to a contractual dispute, the Pro Bowl card of Eric Dickerson (No. 338) was withdrawn early creating a short print. Card #338 would be reissued with Ludwell Denny on the front and it was a promotional card not available in packs.\nCard #75 in the set was meant to be Browns Center Cody Risen but the card was withdrawn early, resulting in a short print. Another variation from 1990 Pro Set is card #204, featuring Fred Marion of the New England Patriots. This card is rather controversial as it features San Francisco 49ers player John Taylor in the background and the belt from Taylor's pants are undone. The positioning of the belt gives the appearance that his private area is exposed but it is just a shadow and the belt. \n"}

The directive was implemented by several other directives thus most white goods, light bulb packaging and cars must have an EU Energy Label clearly displayed when offered for sale or rent. The energy efficiency of the appliance is rated in terms of a set of energy efficiency classes from A to G on the label, A being the most energy efficient, G the least efficient. The labels also give other useful information to the customer as they choose between various models. The information should also be given in catalogues and included by internet retailers on their websites.\n\nIn an attempt to keep up with advances in energy efficiency, A+, A++ and A+++ grades were later introduced for various products; since 2010, a new type of label exists that makes use of pictograms rather than words, to allow manufacturers to use a single label for products sold in different countries.\n\nDirective 92/75/EC was replaced by Directive 2010/30/EU which must be applied from 31 July 2011.\n\nThe energy labels are separated into at least four categories:\n\nFor refrigerating appliances, such as refrigerators, freezers, wine-storage appliances, and combined appliances, the labelling is specified in terms of an energy efficiency index EEI, which is an indication of the annual power consumption relative to a reference consumption that is based on the storage volume and the type of appliance (refrigerator or freezer). The boundary between the A and A classes is 44 up to 1 July 2014, and 42 after that date.\n\nThe label also contains:\n\nFor cold appliances (and this product alone), for models that are more economical than those of category A, categories A+, A++ and A+++ have been assigned.\n\nUp to 2010, the energy efficiency scale for washing machines is calculated based on a cotton cycle at 60 °C (140 °F) with a maximum declared load. This load is typically 6 kg. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of washing, assuming a cold-water supply at 15 °C.\n\nThe energy label also contains information on:\n\nThe washing performance is measured according to European harmonised standard EN 60456 and is based on a 60 °C cycle on fabric samples with stains of oil, blood, chocolate, milk, and red wine, using a standardised detergent and compared against a reference washing machine. The amount of stain removal is then translated into a washing performance index.\n\nThe spin-drying efficiency class is based on the remaining moisture content (RMC), which is the mass of water divided by the dry mass of cotton fabrics. It is based on a weighted average of full-load and partial-load cycles.\nA new energy label, introduced in 2010, is based on the energy efficiency index (EEI), and has energy classes in the range A+++ to D. The EEI is a measure of the annual electricity consumption, and includes energy consumed during power-off and standby modes, and the energy consumed in 220 washing cycles. For the washing cycles, a weighted mix consisting of 42% full-load cycles at 60 °C, 29% partial-load cycles at 60 °C, and 29% partial-load cycles at 40 °C. The washing performance is not mentioned any more, since all washing machines must reach class A anyway. For a 6-kg machine, an EEI of 100 is equivalent to 334 kWh per year, or 1.52 kWh per cycle.\nFor tumble dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.\n\nThe label also contains:\n\nFor combined washer dryers the energy efficiency scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle with a maximum declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of load. Different scales apply for condenser and vented dryers.\nThe label also contains:\n\nThe energy efficiency of a dishwasher is calculated according to the number of place settings. For the most common size of appliance, the 12 place setting machine the following classes apply up to 2010. \n\nAfter 2010, a new system is used, based on an energy efficiency index (EEI), which is based on the annual power usage, based on stand-by power consumption and 280 cleaning cycles, relative to the standard power usage for that type of dishwasher. For a 12-place-setting dishwasher, an EEI of 100 corresponds to 462 kWh per year.\nThe label also contains:\n\nFor ovens, the label also contains:\n\nFor air conditioners, the directive applies only to units under 12 kW. Every label contains the following information:\nLabels for air conditioners with heating capability also contain:\n\nNote that there exist units with EER and COP > 5, so take a note of the actual number when it is A rated.\n\nEvery label of light bulbs and tubes (including incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lamps, LED lamps) contains the following information:\n\nAccording to the light bulb's electrical consumption relative to a standard (GLS or incandescent), the lightbulb is in one of the following classes:\n\nClass A is defined in a different way; hence, the variable percentage. These lamp classes correspond roughly to the following lamp types\n\nSince 2012 <ref name=\"European Union 26/9/2012\"></ref> A+ and A++ classes are added and are introduced different classes for directional lamps and non-directional lamps.\n\nDirectional lamps are defined as \"having at least 80 % light output within a solid angle of π sr (corresponding to a cone with angle of 120°)\".\n\nSince September 2009, household light bulbs must be class A, with the exception of clear (transparent) lamps. For the latter category, lamps must be class C or better, with a transition period up to September 2012, and class B after September 2016.\n\nIncandescent and fluorescent lamps with and without an integrated ballast can be divided into energy efficiency classes. The division of lamps into such classes was made in EU Directive 98/11/EC on 27 January 1998, and includes lamps that are not marketed for use in the home. Light sources with an output of more than 6,500 lm and those that are not operated on line voltage are excluded. The energy efficiency class is determined as follows (Φ is the luminous flux in lm and \"P\" is the power consumption of the lamp in W):\n\nLamps are classified into class A if:\nFluorescent lamps without integrated ballast, are classified into class A if:\n\nThe classification in the energy efficiency class B-G is based on the percentage (Energy Efficiency Index) at the reference power\nabout the power consumption of a standard light bulb with the same luminous flux.\n\nIn 2010, an energy label for televisions was introduced.\n\nThe energy class is based on the Energy Efficiency Index (EEI), which is the power consumption relative to a reference power consumption. The reference power consumption of a normal television with screen area \"A\" is\n\nWhere formula_5 = 20 W for a television set with one tuner/receiver and no hard disc.\n\nSince the switch to digital terrestrial transmissions all new televisions sold in Europe have both analogue and digital tuners so the reference power was increased to 24 Watts as set out in the directive the formula is as follows\n\nAdding of a hard drive(s), then the formula is as follows\n\nFor example, a television with a diagonal of 82 cm (32 in) has a screen area \"A\" = 28.7 dm and a reference power consumption of 144 W. The energy classes are as in the table below.\nThe annual on-mode energy consumption \"E\" in kWh is calculated as \"E\" = 1,46 × P.\n\nIn televisions with automatic brightness control, the on-mode power consumption is reduced by 5% if the following conditions are fulfilled when the television is placed on the market:\nthe luminance of the television in the home-mode or the on-mode condition as set by the supplier, is automatically reduced between an ambient light intensity of at least 20 lux and 0 lux;\nthe automatic brightness control is activated in the home-mode condition or the on-mode condition of the television as set by the supplier.\n\nFor motor-vehicle it isn't electrical efficiency that is indicated but carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometre travelled.\nOther information that is indexed for the energy label is:\n\nEuropean tyre labels came into force in November 2012.

The web resource employs powerful graphical and text based data presentation methods for discovery of and simultaneous visualisation and co-examination of many studies, at genome-wide and region-specific levels. Studies of interest can now be identified using chromosomal regions/genes and markers; there is also the facility for researchers to view their own data alongside selected studies.\n\nCurrent content includes ‘top’ p-values from collections; supplementary data; direct researcher submissions; and publicly available data. Consequently, the database now hosts >21 million p-values and 708 studies (vs 3,948 p-values and 798 studies in the NHGRI GWAS catalog), representing ~5% of all such data yet produced. GWAS Central makes parts of its data freely available for download by the research community. However, only parts of the data may be downloaded freely, the whole database content can be accessed as part of a collaboration.\n\nThe Human Genome Bi-Allelic SEquence (HGBASE) database was the first version of what is now GWAS Central. It was first released in August 1998, focusing on providing a centralized collection of known human single nucleotide polymorphisms and other simple DNA variants. It was the first publicly available SNP database. The project was expanded over the next year by a consortium including the Karolinska Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Corporate support was provided by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The version released in November 2001 was renamed the Human Genome Variation database (HGVbase), as this was a better reflection of the scope of the database and its emphasis on collection from many different laboratories. In addition this also highlighted its new role as a central repository for data collection efforts in collaboration with the Human Genome Variation Society.\n\nHGVbase was scaled back in 2004 to simply provide an alternative representation of the full marker list from dbSNP, but development continued on its successor: the Human Genome Variation Genotype-to-Phenotype database (HGVbaseG2P), in many ways the natural evolution of HGVbase into a central database for summary-level genetic association data. The work was originally funded by GlaxoSmithKline, the University of Leicester, and the European Community's Sixth Framework Programme ('INFOBIOMED' Network of Excellence), but the GEN2PHEN project became the main source of funds in 2008. Early work in the project involved devising a powerful way of modeling phenotype and genotype- phenotype data, which itself was adopted and adapted to become the global standard Phenotype And Genotype Experiment Object model. In 2008 HGVbaseG2P went live and extended the project's content and scope by adding a far broader and more comprehensive range of markers (i.e., SNPs, structural variants, and STSs), along with association data from many genetic association studies.\n\nIn February 2010, the project was once again renamed to GWAS Central, to reflect the growing focus on genome-wide association studies. GWAS Central is a core component of the GEN2PHEN project and intends to provide an operational model, plus an open-source software package, so others can create similar databases across the world. These will be hosted by institutes, consortia, and even individual laboratories; providing those groups a toolkit for publicising and publishing their genetic association findings on the web and examine their data alongside others data from similar valuable resources.\n\n"}

He has recorded extensively for several labels since 1976 and played guitar on the theme for \"Monk\" and other TV series.\n\nGeissman was born in Berkeley, California and grew up in San Jose. He took guitar lessons from local musicians, such as Geoff Levin (of the pop group People!), Bud Dimock, Don Cirallo, and Terry Saunders. Encouraged by these teachers to learn jazz standards and to improvise, he began playing in rock bands on weekends and also with small jazz groups and big bands. As a high school senior, he entered formal study with avant-garde guitarist Jerry Hahn, who introduced him to the music of Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman.\n\nAfter graduating from Prospect High School, Geissman attended De Anza Junior College, where he played in both De Anza's jazz band and the Daddio Band (of older professionals). Both were led by jazz educator Herb Patnoe, who was the director of Stan Kenton's Jazz Clinics. Since the Kenton band at that time had no guitar player, Patnoe recommended Geissman to teach at Kenton's summer clinics in both Sacramento and in southern California. While teaching at these clinics for several summers, Geissman first met (and played with) drummer Peter Erskine and pianist Dan Haerle.\n\nIn 1973, Geissman moved to Los Angeles and attended one semester at Cal State Fullerton, where he played in the band led by pianist and clarinetist Tom Ranier. Transferring to Cal State Northridge in 1974 to be closer to the Hollywood studio scene, Geissman joined the Northridge \"A\" band led by jazz educator Joel Leach. While at Northridge, he began playing in both Gerald Wilson's Big Band and with Louie Bellson's Big Band, recording several albums with Bellson. For \"Louie Bellson's Live at the Concord Summer Festival\", Geissman contributed an original composition, \"Starship Concord.\" He began playing in local jazz venues with Tony Rizzi's guitar band, recording \"Tony Rizzi's Five Guitars Play Charlie Christian\" (1976), which featured Tom Ranier and Pete Christlieb.\n\nGeissman's first gig with fluegelhornist Chuck Mangione was at the Santa Monica Civic auditorium on November 9, 1976. A short tour of the Pacific Northwest followed, and soon after Mangione asked Geissman to become a permanent member of the band. Mangione's band consisted of Geissman on guitar, Charles Meeks on bass, Chris Vadala on woodwinds, and James Bradley Jr. on drums. Geissman appeared on the album \"Feels So Good\" (1977), which sold two million copies. On radio, the single \"Feels So Good\", featuring Geissman's guitar solo, was an international hit. A 1980 issue of \"Current Biography\" called it the most recognized tune since \"Michelle\" by The Beatles.\n\nIn 1978 Geissman released his first solo album, \"Good Stuff\" (Concord Jazz), which featured fellow Northridge alumnus Gordon Goodwin on sax, Tom Ranier on piano, Bob Magnussen on bass guitar, and Steve Shaeffer on drums. Grant left Mangione's band in 1981 to pursue other endeavors, including his own albums, session work, and composing. Two of his albums (\"Flying Colors\" and \"Time Will Tell\") reached number one in the Gavin and Radio and Records Contemporary Jazz airplay charts, and many his recordings reached the top ten.\n\nGeissman has been a regular member of Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band. He has appeared as a session musician on albums by Peter Allen, Sheila E., Miki Howard, Quincy Jones, Rodney Friend, Diane Schuur, and Van Dyke Parks. He has recorded with Keiko Matsui, 3rd Force, David Benoit, Cheryl Bentyne, and Lorraine Feather and had a guitar solo as a separate track on the album \"Hold an Old Friend's Hand\" by Tiffany.\n\nGeissman reunited with Mangione in 2000 when they recorded the album \"Everything for Love\" (Chesky). Geissman's early musical influences came full circle in 2003 when he played Dobro on Ringo Starr's \"Ringorama\" album. In 2006, he released his thirteenth album as a leader, \"Say That!\", on his own label, Futurism Records. A throwback to the jazz that first influenced him, he has described the sound of this album as \"Wes Montgomery meets Horace Silver meets Jimmy Smith.\" In \"All About Jazz\", John Kelman said,\n\nGeissman and Mangione appeared on many televisions shows, including \"The Tonight Show\", \"Dinah Shore\", \"Merv Griffin\", \"Phil Donahue\", \"The Midnight Special\", \"Don Kirshner's Rock Concert\" and \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\". Geissman's other albums with Mangione include \"Children of Sanchez\" (1978), \"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1979), and \"Fun and Games\" (1980).\n\nGeissman's playing has been heard on numerous television series, including \"Dawson's Creek\", \"Family Affair\", \"Boy Meets World\", \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Lizzie McGuire\". He can be heard playing the Djangoesque acoustic guitar on the theme for the television series \"Monk\", starring Tony Shalhoub. Nominated for a 2001 Emmy for co-writing the song \"No Puedo Olvidar\" for the daytime drama \"Passions\", he received an Emmy nomination in 2004 for another \"Passions\" song, \"Momma, Gotta Let Her Go\". In 2003, he was nominated for an Annie award for producing Van Dyke Parks' songs for HBO's \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\". He has written additional music for films and television movies, including \"The Ponder Heart\" (2001), \"Call Me Claus\" (2001), \"Monday Night Mayhem\" (2002), \"Die, Mommie, Die!\" (2003) and \"The Mojo Cafe\" (2004). Dennis C. Brown and Geissman collaborated on the underscore for the hit CBS-TV sitcom \"Two and a Half Men\". The show's theme, co-written by Geissman, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2004.\n\nApart from his musical career, Geissman has written three books for \"Mad\" magazine and EC Comics: \"Collectibly Mad\" (Kitchen Sink Press, 1995); \"Tales of Terror! The EC Comics Companion\", co-authored with Fred von Bernewitz (Fantagraphics, 2000); and \"Foul Play! The Art and Artists of the Notorious 1950s E.C. Comics!\" (HarperDesign, 2005). He has also compiled and/or written annotations for ten other \"Mad\"-related books, and he appears in Chip Selby's documentary, \"Tales from the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television\" (2004). In 2011, Geissman teamed with Russ Cochran to launch a publishing company, GC Press, to continue the hardcover EC Archives series originally published by Gemstone.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6229214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6229214", "title": "Henriette Avram", "text": "Henriette Avram\n\nHenriette Davidson Avram (October 7, 1919 – April 22, 2006) was a computer programmer and systems analyst who developed the MARC format (Machine Readable Cataloging), the international data standard for bibliographic and holdings information in libraries. Avram's development of the MARC format in the late 1960s and early 1970s at the Library of Congress had a revolutionizing effect on the practice of librarianship, making possible the automation of many library functions and the sharing of bibliographic information electronically between libraries using pre-existing cataloging standards.\n\nHenriette Regina Davidson was born in Manhattan on October 7, 1919, to a father who was a watch material distributor and a mother who was a \"Philadelphia Ledger\" reporter. Although she never intended to become a librarian, Henriette did spend many Saturdays of her childhood reading in neighborhood stores, which, at that time, housed mini-public libraries.\n\nHenriette Davidson dreamed of finding a cure for cancer, which was prevalent in her family. She therefore majored in pre-medicine at Hunter College. In 1941, she married Herbert Mois Avram, who was enlisted in the Navy. By the end of World War II, Herbert Avram was a decorated Lieutenant Commander who had been assigned to both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres.\n\nThe Avrams had three children: Marcie, Lloyd, and Jay, and maintained residence in New York until 1951, when Herbert Avram took a job with the National Security Agency in Washington, D.C. Herbert Avram would also work for the CIA, eventually becoming a pioneer in the digital court reporting industry, which developed Closed Captions for television.\n\nThe couple moved first to Arlington, and later to Silver Spring. Once settled in Virginia, Avram left her life of homemaking behind. She began studying mathematics at George Washington University, and joined the NSA herself in 1952. Working with the IBM 701, she soon became one of the first computer programmers. Reminiscing about her time with the NSA, Avram said, \"Learning programming in those days was ... a bootstrap operation. You were on your own with far less than perfect tools to learn from ... and the numbers of people that made it through to become programmers were few indeed. It was an exciting time.\"\n\nIn the early sixties she moved to the private sector, working first with the American Research Bureau and later for a software company, Datatrol Corporation. Both jobs consisted of systems analysis and programming, but it was at Datatrol that Avram had her first professional experience with libraries. Asked to design a computer science library, she quickly read several library science text books in order to learn the appropriate jargon. She also hired a librarian to assist her in the design process. It was through this project that Avram was introduced to the Library of Congress Card Division Service. She also did consulting work with Frederick Kilgour, father of the Online Computer Library Center, on OCLC's first attempt at computerizing bibliographic information. In March 1965, Avram heard of an opening at the Library of Congress, and was hired as a systems analyst in the Office of the Information Systems Specialist.\n\nAvram, considered a \"librarian by achievement\" by the American Library Association (ALA), owed much to the Library of Congress, about which she said, \"... when I speak of and refer to it as 'the Great Library,' I do so with sincerity and appreciation for everything that I learned within those walls.\" Avram was often noted for her petite stature, New York accent, and indefatigable drive. She was also an adept leader. \"She was able to foster a cooperative spirit among the computer specialists and librarians on her staff. In her typical fashion, she stepped into the world of libraries and learned libraries' problems, adopting them as her own.\"\n\nHer first assignment at the Library of Congress (LC) was to analyze cataloging data for computer processing. In keeping with her training at NSA, where she learned \"the prime necessity of thoroughly understanding the subject before tackling the computer solution,\" Avram, along with two librarians, began this process by examining the information contained in a catalog record.\n\nA separate mathematical algorithm would be needed for each piece of information, and there were millions of items in the catalog, in hundreds of different languages. She also studied ALA rules and LC filing rules to learn all that she could about bibliographic control. When Avram had thoroughly examined every aspect of the bibliographic record, \"she translated what she learned into a set of fields ... bearing a name (the tags), handling instructions (the indicators), and parts (the subfields).\"\n\nAvram's title at LC changed to Assistant Coordinator of Information Systems in 1967. In this position, she continued to direct the MARC Pilot Project, which concluded in June 1968; she directed the MARC Distribution Service, which began in March 1969; and she began the RECON Pilot Project, which was never completed. The RECON Project was a plan to convert retrospective materials to MARC format. Because this project was not embraced by LC, retrospective conversion has taken place across the country, rather than as a nationwide coordinated effort. Avram said, \"This failure has severely impacted all libraries.\" She also called lack of support for RECON the \"single most disappointing experience\" of her career.\n\nAvram became a part of the development of the International Standard for Bibliographic Description for Monograph Publications (ISBD(M)) when she attended an International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts sponsored by the International Federation of Library Association (IFLA) in 1969. A year later, Avram became Chief of MARC Development Office at LC. She continued to head the MARC and RECON projects, but was also responsible for all of the automation involved with LC's processing activities. Her duties further expanded when she became the Director of the Network Development Office in 1976. She was then in charge of coordinating library networking and bibliographic resources and standards at both the national and international levels. In addition, she became chair of the LC Network Advisory Committee, a position which she held for over a decade. At this time she was also chair of the IFLA Working Group on Content Designators, which used the ISBD to develop the international version of MARC format known as UNIMARC.\n\nBy 1980 Avram was directing a staff of seven hundred in the Processing Department of LC. In her position as the first Director for Processing Systems, Networks and Automation Planning, she was responsible for networking, automation activities, and bibliographic products and services. When Avram became the Assistant Librarian for Processing Services three years later, her staff doubled. She was now in charge of cataloging, acquisitions, overseas operations, and development of networking and automation planning. This position lasted for six years. In speaking of her decision to remain with LC, despite other, more lucrative opportunities, Avram said, \"I stayed because I loved the place, the people, and the challenge.\" When she retired from LC in 1992, Avram was the Associate Librarian for Collections Services. Her staff of seventeen hundred was responsible for acquisitions, cataloging, preservation, collection development, overseas operations, network and automation planning, and processing and servicing special format materials.\n\nMARC, MAchine-Readable Cataloging, is the method by which paper-and-ink card catalogs were converted to computer catalogs. This automated library systems, in turn greatly enhancing the feasibility of interlibrary lending and paving the way for networking capabilities. Avram was a key figure in the revolution of librarianship into information science.\n\nMARC, in her words, is \"an assemblage of formats, publications, procedures, people, standards, systems, equipment, etc., that has evolved over the years stimulating the development of library automation and information networks ... nationally and internationally.\" MARC has had many incarnations through the years, from the initial Planning Memorandum Number Three, which resulted from that first catalog card analysis at LC, to MARC 1 (as the format was subsequently named after the MARC Pilot System, November 1966-October 1967), and eventually to MARC 21, the format that is used today. Avram is the author of the book, \"MARC, its history and implications\", published by the Library of Congress in 1975.\n\nIn order to ensure that MARC would be adopted nationwide, she worked with the American Library Association and the American National Standards Institute to make it a national standard. Not content with earning the national standard in 1971, Avram continued lobbying until MARC became an International Organization for Standardization standard in 1973. Largely due to her efforts, MARC is now used as the basis for library automation and bibliographic communication throughout the world. Avram was also one of the original planners of the Linked Systems Project. In this role, she was \"tireless in spreading the gospel of using international standards to link databases housed on disparate computer systems.\" Though she never intended to be a librarian, Avram became a \"towering figure in library automation and bibliographic control.\"\n\nAfter retirement, Avram and her husband moved to California, Maryland. The couple remained active through St. Mary's College, where Henriette often arranged for Library of Congress officials to be guest speakers.\n\nAfter Herbert, her husband of sixty-four years, died in their home on January 15, 2006, Henriette relocated to Florida. She died of cancer at Miami's Baptist Hospital on April 22, just three months after the death of her husband. She was 86 years old. Avram once said,\n\nHer energetic, diplomatic leadership and remarkable contribution to automation and bibliographic control are proof that she achieved this goal.\n\nThough proud of her accomplishments, Avram's famous drive never quit. \"We must not sit back and be satisfied, though,\" she said, \"there is much more to do.\"\n\n\n"}

Its 2006 debut was highly publicized while she was enrolled at Harvard University, but the book was withdrawn after it was discovered that portions had been plagiarized from several sources, including the works of Salman Rushdie and Meg Cabot. Viswanathan apologized and said any similarities were \"completely unintentional and unconscious.\" All shelf copies of \"Opal Mehta\" were ultimately recalled and destroyed by the publisher, and Viswanathan's contract for a second book was canceled.\n\nWhile attending Bergen County Academies, Viswanathan showed her writing – including a several-hundred-page novel on Irish history she had already completed – to Katherine Cohen of IvyWise, a private college admissions consultancy which Viswanathan's parents had hired to help with their daughter's application process. Through Cohen, Viswanathan was signed by the William Morris Agency under senior agent and William Morris partner Jennifer Rudolph Walsh and referred to book packaging company 17th Street Productions (now called Alloy Entertainment), a media firm responsible for packaging the \"Gossip Girl\" and \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" book series, among others. On the basis of an outline and four chapters of the novel that would become \"Opal Mehta\", Viswanathan eventually signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for an advance originally reported to be $500,000. She began writing the book the summer before college, and finished it during her freshman year at Harvard College, while taking a full course load. \"Opal Mehta\" was published on April 4, 2006, and Viswanathan was profiled by \"The New York Times\" on April 6, 2006.\n\n\"Opal Mehta\" centers on an academically oriented Indian-American girl who, after being told by a Harvard College admissions officer that she is not well-rounded, doggedly works to become a typical American teen: ultrasocial, shopping- and boy-driven, and carelessly hip. With \"Publishers Weekly\" calling the book \"\"Legally Blonde\" in reverse,\" Viswanathan stated that her own college prep experience had inspired the novel: \"I was surrounded by the stereotype of high-pressure Asian and Indian families trying to get their children into Ivy League schools.\" When asked about her influences in an interview given to \"The Star-Ledger\" of Newark, New Jersey (before any allegations of plagiarism had surfaced), Viswanathan responded that \"nothing I read gave me the inspiration\" to write the novel.\n\nMichael Pietsch later told \"The New York Times\" that Viswanathan’s advance for her two-book deal was less than the previously publicized amount of $500,000, and that it was split between the author and Alloy Entertainment. Alloy President Leslie Morgenstein asserted that while the firm helped Viswanathan \"conceptualize and plot the book,\" it did not help with the actual writing. Though Alloy was no longer involved once the book was sold to Little, Brown, the company shares the copyright with Viswanathan. Her agent Walsh told \"The New York Times\" that the plot and writing of \"Opal Mehta\" had been \"1,000 percent\" Viswanathan's. The novel was edited by Asya Muchnick at Little, Brown, and the movie rights to the book were sold to DreamWorks SKG in February 2006.\n\n\"Opal Mehta\" garnered mixed reviews, many of which described Viswanathan as an author of \"chick lit.\"\n\nOn April 23, 2006, \"The Harvard Crimson\" reported that several portions of \"Opal Mehta\" appeared to have been plagiarized from Megan McCafferty's first two \"Jessica Darling\" novels, \"Sloppy Firsts\" (2001) and \"Second Helpings\" (2003), noting over a dozen similar passages. At the time, Viswanathan's novel had reached 32nd on \"The New York Times\" hardcover fiction bestseller list. McCafferty's third Jessica Darling novel, \"Charmed Thirds\", had just been released a week after \"Opal Mehta\", and was No. 19 on the same list.\n\nMcCafferty stated that she had learned about Viswanathan's plagiarism through a fan's e-mail on April 11, 2006, the same day \"Charmed Thirds\" was released and nearly two weeks before the story went public. According to McCafferty, the email's subject read: \"'Flattery or a case for litigation.' I thought, oh my God, somebody's suing me.\" Prompted by the email's allegations, McCafferty looked at \"Opal Mehta\" and later said that reading Viswanathan's book was like \"recognizing your own child's face. My own words were just leaping out at me page after page after page.\" Contacted by the \"Crimson\" the day before they broke the story, McCafferty responded via email, “I’m already aware of this situation, and so is my publisher ... After reading the book in question, and finding passages, characters, and plot points in common, I do hope this can be resolved in a manner that is fair to all of the parties involved.”\n\nOn April 24, 2006, Little, Brown issued a statement from Viswanathan:\n\"When I was in high school, I read and loved two wonderful novels by Megan McCafferty,\" Sloppy Firsts \" and \" Second Helpings, \" which spoke to me in a way few other books did. Recently, I was very surprised and upset to learn that there are similarities between some passages in my novel ... and passages in these books ... While the central stories of my book and hers are completely different, I wasn't aware of how much I may have internalized Ms. McCafferty's words. I am a huge fan of her work and can honestly say that any phrasing similarities between her works and mine were completely unintentional and unconscious. My publisher and I plan to revise my novel for future printings to eliminate any inappropriate similarities ... I sincerely apologize to Megan McCafferty and to any who feel they have been misled by these unintentional errors on my part.\"\nViswanathan's agent Walsh stated, \"Knowing what a fine person Kaavya is, I believe any similarities were unintentional. Teenagers tend to adopt each other's language.\" The day after Viswanathan's admission, Steve Ross of Crown Publishing Group – a subsidiary of Random House and the publisher of \"Sloppy Firsts\" and \"Second Helpings\" – issued a statement in response:\n\"We find both the responses of Little Brown and their author Kaavya Viswanathan deeply troubling and disingenuous. Ms. Viswanathan's claim that similarities in her phrasing were 'unconscious' or 'unintentional' is suspect. We have documented more than forty passages from Kaavya Viswanathan's recent publication \"How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life\" that contain identical language and/or common scene or dialogue structure from Megan McCafferty's first two books, \"Sloppy Firsts\" and \"Second Helpings\". This extensive taking from Ms. McCafferty's books is nothing less than an act of literary identity theft ... Based on the scope and character of the similarities, it is inconceivable that this was a display of youthful innocence or an unconscious or unintentional act.\"\nRoss said later that \"We all felt it was important that we come to [McCafferty's] defense and make clear that we support our author. The notion that this was accidental stretches credibility to the breaking point.\" McCafferty's agent Joanna Pulcini also identified 45 \"strikingly similar\" passages, stating via email that \"Many include identical phrasing, establish primary characters, and contain shared plot developments ... It is understandably difficult for us to accept that Ms. Viswanathan’s plagiarism was ‘unintentional and unconscious,’ as she has claimed.\" Ross added that at that time, McCafferty was \"devastated\" by the plagiarism, feeling \"like something fundamental was taken\" and \"not sleeping, not eating.\"\n\nIn an April 26, 2006 interview with \"The New York Times\", Viswanathan suggested that some of the plagiarism may have happened because she read both of McCafferty's books multiple times and has a photographic memory. \"I remember by reading,\" she said. \"I never take notes.\" She added \"I've never read a novel with an Indian-American protagonist ... The plot points are reflections of my own experience. I'm an Indian-American.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2006, Viswanathan appeared on NBC's \"The Today Show\" with Katie Couric. Viswanathan maintained her innocence, saying that any and all similarities were \"completely unconscious and unintentional\" and that she must have \"internalized [McCafferty's] words,\" never deliberately meaning to \"take any.\" She maintained, \"as I was writing, I genuinely believed that every single word I wrote was my own. I was so surprised and horrified when I found these similarities, when I heard about them over this weekend.\" Asked about the plot similarities between \"Opal Mehta\" and McCafferty's novels, Viswanathan told Couric, “I wrote about what I knew, my personal experiences. I’m an Indian-American girl who got good grades, from New Jersey, who wanted to go to an Ivy League school, and I drew upon my own experiences, upon quirks of the people around me and my culture, to create my character Opal Mehta.” Viswanathan stated her intention to put an acknowledgement to McCafferty in the foreword of future printings of \"Opal Mehta\", and said of McCafferty \"I hope that she can forgive me for whatever distress I’ve caused her.\" Couric then asked, \"Do you think that's realistic ... given all the controversy surrounding James Frey and his book ... Or do you think that ... they can forgive and forget?\" Viswanathan responded, \"I mean, that's what I'd hope that people can do. I hope that people who know me will believe that I'm telling the truth, that I've never been anything less than honest in my entire life, that I'm so horribly sorry for this mistake. But that's all it was, a completely unintentional mistake.\"\n\nWithin days after the story broke, Viswanathan's name became one of the most searched terms at the blog search engine Technorati, and the scandal was a popular topic for commentators at web forums from MetaFilter to Amazon.com and Gawker.com. On May 1, 2006, \"The New York Times\" ran a story giving national prominence to claims on the Sepia Mutiny blog that Viswanathan may have lifted text from Salman Rushdie's 1990 novel \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\".\n\nOn May 2, 2006, \"The New York Times\" noted \"striking similarities\" between passages in \"Opal Mehta\" and those in Sophie Kinsella's 2003 \"chick-lit\" novel \"Can You Keep a Secret?\". Viswanathan and Little, Brown declined to comment.\n\nOn May 2, 2006, \"The Harvard Crimson\" identified passages that Viswanathan had lifted from Meg Cabot's 2000 novel \"The Princess Diaries\". In the same article, \"Crimson\" noted that \"few—if any—'chick-lit' works have ever received the level of intense scrutiny that 'Opal Mehta' is now enduring, and it is not clear whether the new allegations suggest further plagiarism, or whether Viswanathan is simply employing tropes that are widely-used in the genre.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2006, Viswanathan had told \"The New York Times\", \"I've never read a novel with an Indian-American protagonist ... The plot points are reflections of my own experience. I'm an Indian-American.\" Subsequently, on May 3, 2006, \"The Harvard Independent\" noted three passages in \"Opal Mehta\" similar to Tanuja Desai Hidier's \"Born Confused\" (2002), another young adult novel about an Indian-American teenager in New Jersey. They cited \"uncanny resemblance in imagery, sentence structure, and paragraph organization\" between the two books. Hidier later stated that she had \"ironically\" been alerted to the allegations on the day Viswanathan was quoted in \"The New York Times\". Hidier said:\n\"I was stunned to find two dozen instances of lifting from \"Born Confused\" in the \"Opal Mehta\" book ... I also drew largely from autobiography to tell the story of my 17-year-old Indian American Jersey girl, Dimple Lala. And I hadn't read any books I could recall with a South Asian American teen protagonist at that point (I wrote \"Born Confused\" in 2000/2001 and it launched in 2002). To the best of my knowledge \"Born Confused\" was the first book with a US female teen desi heroine; that was one of the reasons my publisher wanted it, and it is certainly one of the reasons I wrote it ... And so I was extremely surprised to find that the majority, though not all, of the passages in \"Opal Mehta\" taken from \"Born Confused\" are those dealing with descriptions of various aspects of South Asian culture (food, dress, locale, even memories of India, etc.) and the way that culture is expressed in America; essentially every scene of \"Opal Mehta\" that deals with any aspect of South Asian culture in more than passing detail has lifted something from \"Born Confused\". One would think that these kinds of cultural details at least could have been drawn from Ms. Viswanathan's personal experience, given our similar cultural backgrounds (and the similar cultural backgrounds and ages of our protagonists).\"\nAn excerpt of \"Born Confused\" had appeared in \"Seventeen\" magazine in 2002. Hidier was subsequently contacted by Viswanathan's future book packager 17th Street/Alloy, but she declined their offer to collaborate with her on an \"Indian-American teen story.\" Hidier noted in 2006 that \"several parts of this excerpt – including the opening and closing – are present and strongly echoed in the \"Opal Mehta\" book.\" She added that \"Born Confused\" contained many specific details from her own life which had been recycled by Viswanathan:\n\"It was a surreal experience for me, looking at these and the other parallel parts side by side. The feeling was almost as if someone had broken into your home – and in some ways this is what literally had happened, considering so much of \"Born Confused\" is drawn from my life (and home): The alcohol cabinet in my non-drinking household in small town Massachusetts was now in Opal's, the details of my family's two dinnertimes because of all the years of working late into the night by my father, too; my mother's food, from her mother's recipes, transplanted to Opal's table, her slinky black outfit too; my ecstatic and eye-opening discovery of Jackson Heights, Queens during an enthralled and emotional day there many years ago, suddenly turned to Edison, New Jersey ... Did [Viswanathan and/or Alloy] think you could just substitute one kind of Indian for another? A friend brought my attention to a couple observant bloggers who seemed to have caught on early to this grand error, commenting on how jarring it was to see a Gujarati/Marathi meal on a South Indian table ... and that some of the memories of India hearken back to a much older India in the \"Opal Mehta\" book (which makes sense considering the many years that separate Ms. Viswanathan and myself) – details that may have escaped a person not familiar with the culture.\"\n\nIn her initial statement on April 24, 2006, Viswanathan had stated that she and the publisher would be revising the novel for future printings \"to eliminate any inappropriate similarities.\" The same day, Michael Pietsch of Little, Brown stated, “Kaavya Viswanathan is a decent, serious, and incredibly hard-working writer and student, and I am confident that we will learn that any similarities in phrasings were unintentional.\" He subsequently noted that an acknowledgment to McCafferty would be added to future printings, an intention echoed by Viswanathan in her April 26, 2006 interview with Katie Couric on \"The Today Show\". Little, Brown recalled all copies of \"Opal Mehta\" on April 27, 2006. The next day, first edition copies of the novel were priced at $80 on eBay. On May 2, 2006, after further allegations of plagiarism had come to light, Little, Brown released a statement from Pietsch saying, \"Little, Brown and Company will not be publishing a revised edition of \"How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life\" by Kaavya Viswanathan, nor will we publish the second book under contract.\" DreamWorks had already halted development of the film adaptation in late April 2006. Harvard University said soon after controversy broke that it would not affect her academic standing there. She graduated with honors in 2008.\n\nOn May 18, 2006, McCafferty noted, \"I had heard so much about her book and I had planned on reading it [before the allegations surfaced] ... It was sad and it was a shock that it could happen on such a big scale ... This was a big book that was getting so much attention and publicity. It is the most surreal thing that's ever happened to me.\" Alerted to the situation two weeks before \"The Harvard Crimson\" picked up the story, she stated that \"The media broke it and I was sick to my stomach ... People don't know how hard it was to have somebody else take that from me and try and profit. As someone [who has been] writing my entire life, to build my career, it almost made me lose faith in the publishing industry.\" Though Alloy Entertainment had previously stated that it helped Viswanathan conceptualize the book but did not help with the actual writing, McCafferty also raised the issue of their possible culpability in the scandal. As book packagers sometimes use their own staff or hire freelance writers to ghostwrite manuscripts for publishers, McCafferty asked, \"Was it the book packagers who really wrote the book and plagiarized my books or was it her?\"\n\nOf Viswanathan being remembered for the scandal, McCafferty also said, \"I wouldn't want to be defined by a mistake made in such a public way ... I hope she can move on from this. I hope that for both of us.\" In addition, she noted that \"Books for teens have taken a huge beating in the media\" in the aftermath of the incident. \"These very elitist comments about 'how all books for teens are crap; so isn't this just crap stealing from crap'. My books are not crap.\" McCafferty noted that she was insulted by an opinion letter published in \"The New York Times\" in which one writer wrote that teen books are \"undemanding literature for undemanding readers.\" \"There's so much good writing for teenagers now,\" she said. \"People make across the board judgments.\"\n\n"}

The report was first issued in 1998 as a response to the United States' practice of criticizing China in its own annual \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\", which each of the Chinese reports cites in the first paragraph.\n\nThe \"Human Rights Record of the United States\" is published as a retort to U.S. criticism of China's human rights policies in the annual \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\", published by the State Department of the United States. The Chinese report states that the State Department reports are \"full of distortions and accusations of the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions including China. However, the United States turned a blind eye to its own terrible human rights situation and seldom mentioned it.\" It says that the United States uses the human rights issues as \"a political instrument to defame other nations' image and seek its own strategic interests.\" The report asserts \"\"[The U.S. State department] released the 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices' year after year to accuse and blame other countries for their human rights practices. These moves fully expose the United States' hypocrisy by exercising double standards on human rights and its malicious design to pursue hegemony under the pretext of human rights.\"\n\nThe Report criticizes U.S. domestic social and economic issues, such as poverty, crime and racism. Some of the data cited in the report is derived from official or authoritative sources; other sections are composed from a variety of material found online, some of which may be anecdotal.\n\nRegarding the 2010 report, Fareed Zakaria wrote: \"The report loses itself and takes away from the more serious charges it does make about Guantanamo Bay and CIA detention facilities. The Chinese government should get the report done by serious Chinese scholars, of whom there are many, rather than the propaganda department of its Communist Party, which seems to have written this one.\"\n\nThe \"Human Rights Record of the United States in 2003\", published on March 1, 2004, criticizes the USA PATRIOT Act, saying it has \"encroached upon rights and freedom of citizens, especially the people of ethnic minorities.\" It also argues that the freedom of press has been neglected, citing examples such as the firing of Peter Arnett and limited access to \"al Jazeera\" television broadcasts. The report emphasized U.S. military actions abroad, including the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, conducted without the approval of the United Nations.\n\nThe report concludes that the United States should \"reflect on its erroneous position and behavior on human rights, and stop its unpopular interference with other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of promoting human rights\".\n\nThe 2004 report stated:\nIn 2004 the atrocity of U.S. troops abusing Iraqi POWs exposed the dark side of human rights performance of the United States. The scandal shocked the public and was condemned by the international community. It is quite ironic that on Feb. 28 of this year, the State Department of the United States once again posed as 'the world human rights police' and released its 'Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2004'. As in previous years, the reports pointed fingers at human rights situation in more than 190 countries and regions (including China) but kept silent on the U.S. misdeeds in this field. Therefore, the world people have to probe the human rights record behind the Statue of Liberty in the United States.\n\nXinhua News Agency posted the text of the 2010 report on its website. It stated in part, \"The violation of [US] citizens' civil and political rights by the government is severe ... the United States applies double standards ... by requesting unrestricted 'internet freedom' in other countries, which becomes an important diplomatic tool for the United States to impose pressure and seek hegemony, and imposing strict restriction within its territory. The 2010 report by China's State Council stated in response to the United States' Record that the mortgage crisis in the U.S. triggered an economic recession globally.\n\nChina issued the 2011 report () on May 25, 2012.\nThe detailed report is made of 6 sections (). The section II make a detailed overview of the occupy movement and US's security forces abuses of power.\n\nChina published a report on the United States' human rights situation on June 26, 2015, hitting back at U.S. remarks about China.\n\nThe report, titled \"The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2014,\" was released by the Information Office of the State Council, China's Cabinet, in response to \"the 2014 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\" issued by the U.S. State Department on June 25 local time.\n\nChina's report states that the U.S. made comments on the human rights situations in many countries while showing not a bit of regret for or intention to improve its own terrible human rights record.\n\n\"The U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, saw no improvements in its existent human rights issues, but reported numerous new problems,\" it says.\n\nWhile its own human rights situation was increasingly grave, the U.S. violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more \"red cards\" in the international human rights field, according to the report.\n\nJi Hong, a research fellow with Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said America does not hold the moral high ground to tutor or judge others in that itself is also plagued by major human rights issues.\nAccording to Ji, who took part in drafting the report, US racial problems even deteriorated during the Obama presidency. \"In the past, there were only implicit discrimination against ethnic minorities, but recent cases such as Charleston shooting spree reflected a more flagrant bias.\"\n\nVIOLENCE & TORTURE\n\nThe U.S. was haunted by spreading guns, frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens' civil rights.

In essence, it's the same because the two are interdependent.\"\n\nThe 2014 report stated:\n\nOn June 25 local time, the State Department of the United States released its country reports on human rights practices once again, making comments on the human rights situations in many countries while showing not a bit of regret for or intention to improve its own terrible human rights record. Plenty of facts show that, in 2014, the U.S., a self-proclaimed human rights defender, saw no improvements in its existent human rights issues, but reported numerous new problems. While its own human rights situation was increasingly grave, the U.S. violated human rights in other countries in a more brazen manner, and was given more \"red cards\" in the international human rights field.\n\nThe U.S. was haunted by spreading guns, frequent occurrence of violent crimes, which threatened citizens' civil rights. Statistics showed that the use of firearms in the U.S. was behind 69 percent of murders, while for robberies, the figure was 40 percent, and for aggravated assaults, 21.6 percent (edition.cnn.com). The excessive use of force by police officers led to many deaths, sparking public outcry. An unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown was shot dead by a white police officer named Darren Wilson in Ferguson, a town in Missouri. After the grand jury of both Missouri and New York decided to bring no charges against the white police officer, massive protests broke out in more than 170 cities nationwide (cn.nytimes.com, November 25, 2014).\n\nThe U.S. used cruel tortures indiscriminately, notably those carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). To acquire intelligence from suspects of terrorism and extremism, the CIA used brutal methods, such as sleep deprivation, waterboarding, long-term solitary confinement, slamming prisoners against the wall, lashing, death threat and even \"rectal rehydration\" or rectal feeding. United Nations human rights convention institutions such as the UN Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture had raised their concerns over issues in the U.S., including terrible detention conditions for convicts awaiting execution, abuse of brutal methods, secret detention, indefinite arbitrary detention, and illegal wire-tapping which infringed citizens' privacy. These institutions called on the U.S. to conduct swift, effective and fair investigations into all brutal behaviors and abuse of forces of the police force (www.un.org).\n\nThe U.S. is a country with grim problems of racial discrimination, and institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities continued. Serious racial bias persisted in the police and justice systems. Minority groups and indigenous people are subject to unfairness in environment, election, health care, housing, education and other fields. In August 2014, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its concluding observation on the periodic report of the U.S. on the latter's implementation of relevant convention, slammed the U.S. for violating the rights of ethnic minorities, indigenous people, immigrants and other minority groups. It criticized the fact that members of racial and ethnic minorities continued to be disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher sentences (tbinternet.ohchr.org).\n\nMoney is a deciding factor in the U.S. politics, and the U.S. citizens' political rights were not properly protected. Despite the highest midterm election spending in history, general election voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest since World War II. \"Dark money\" flowed into elections, and the voting rights of racial minorities and other groups were intentionally suppressed. A few interest groups with power were able to influence the government's decision-making. As a renowned scholar pointed out sharply, the U.S. democratic system was experiencing a crisis of representation. \"Ordinary citizens feel that their supposedly democratic government no longer truly reflects their interests and is under the control of a variety of shadowy elites (Foreign Affairs, September/October 2014).\"\n\nAlthough the U.S. is the most developed country in the world, it is hard for the economic and social rights of its citizens to be soundly ensured. In the process of economic recovery, the income inequality continued to be enlarged, the basic living conditions for the homeless people deteriorated, the health care system operated terribly and the education rights of average citizens were violated. In October 2014, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs criticized the unprecedented water shut-offs in Detroit disproportionately affected the most vulnerable and poorest people, violating their right of access to drinking water and other international human rights.\n\nAmerican women and children's rights were not fully protected. Women were discriminated at workplaces, and domestic violence was prevalent. Each year, 2.1 million American women on average were assaulted by men. Three females were murdered by their partner each day, and four females died each day as a result of abuse. In the U.S. military, reports of female soldiers getting harassed were on the rise, and more faced repercussions for reporting assaults. Millions of American children were homeless. Three children died each day as a result of abuse. School violence and sex assaults were pervasive and gun shootings happened from time to time.\n\nNational Security Agency and other intelligence-gathering apparatus of the U.S. for a long time have spied on world leaders and civilians. The U.S. has not ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. government often takes an evasive or uncooperative attitude toward the criticism of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of UN, the council's working groups and special rapporteurs. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3061134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3061134", "title": "Josippon", "text": "Josippon\n\nJosippon is a chronicle of Jewish history from Adam to the age of Titus believed to have been written by Josippon or Josephus Flavius (Joseph ben Matityahu) or maybe by a medieval Italian Jew called Yosef Ben Gurion. The Ethiopic version of \"Josippon\" is recognized as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Sefer Josippon was compiled in Hebrew early in the 10th century by a Jewish native of the Greek speaking Jewish community of South Italy, which was at that time part of the Byzantine Empire. Later Judah Leon ben Moses Mosconi, a Romaniote Jew from Achrida edited and expanded the Sefer Josippon. The first edition was printed in Mantua in 1476. The book subsequently appeared in many forms, one of the most popular being in Yiddish, with quaint illustrations. Though the chronicle is more legendary than historical, it is not unlikely that ancient sources were used by the first compiler. The book enjoyed great popularity in England. In 1558, Peter Morvyn translated an abbreviated version into English, and edition after edition was called for. Lucien Wolf has shown that the English translations of the Bible aroused so much interest in the Jews that there was a widespread desire to know more about them. This led to the circulation of many editions of \"Josippon\", which thus formed a link in the chain of events which culminated in the readmission of the Jews to England by Oliver Cromwell. \nThe work is ascribed to Joseph ben Gorion (יוסף בן גוריון), a Jew living in southern Italy in either the 9th or the 10th century. As the Muslim writer ibn Hazm (d. 1063) was acquainted with the Arabic translation by a Yemenite Jew, Daniel Chwolson proposes that the author lived at the beginning of the 9th century.\n\nThe author professes to be the old Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, giving to the name \"Joseph\" the Greek ending \"on\" (\"Josephon,\" \"Joseppon,\" or \"Josippon\". His Arabic name \"Yusibus\" is, according to Wellhausen, identical with \"Hegesippus\"). A gloss gives the form from the Italian, \"Giuseppe.\" Trieber held the singular view that the author lived in the 4th century, and derived much of his material from Hegesippus.\n\nCommencing with Adam and the geographical conditions of the first millennium BCE, the author passes to the legendary history of Rome and Babylon, to the accounts of Daniel, Zerubbabel (according to the Apocrypha), the Second Temple, and Cyrus the Great, and to the histories of Alexander the Great and his successors. He then gives the history of the Jews down to the destruction of the Temple. The last part contains, among other things, a brief history of Hannibal and an account of the coronation of an emperor, which, according to Basnage refers to that of Otto the Great (crowned 962); this would be the only and a most valuable source of information concerning this event. If Basnage's conjecture is correct, the date of the composition of the \"Yosippon\" may be placed at the end of the 10th century. \"Yosippon\" is written in comparatively pure Biblical Hebrew, shows a predilection for certain Biblical phrases and archaisms, and is rich in poetical passages and in maxims and philosophical speculations.\n\n\"Yosippon\" was much read and was highly respected as a historical source by the Jews of the Middle Ages. Joseph Justus Scaliger in his \"Elenchus Trihæresii Nicolai Serarii\" was the first to doubt its worth; Jan Drusius (d. 1609) held it to be historically valueless on account of its many chronological mistakes; Zunz and Delitzsch have branded the author as an impostor. In fact, both the manuscripts and printed editions are full of historical errors, misconceptions of its sources, and extravagant outbursts of vanity on the part of the author. But there is scarcely any book in Jewish literature that has undergone more changes at the hands of copyists and compilers; Judah ibn Moskoni knew of no less than four different compilations or abridgments. The later printed editions are one-third larger than the editio princeps of Mantua.\n\nIt was perhaps due to Jerahmeel ben Solomon that the work received its traditional title \"Yosippon.\" He supplemented his copy from Josephus, whom he designates as \"the great Joseph.\" The original title of the work, according to Trieber, was probably \"History of Jerusalem\", or, as a manuscript suggests, \"History and Wars of the Jews.\" It is quoted in the Hebrew-Persian dictionary of Solomon ben Samuel (14th century), under the title \"History of the Second Temple.\"\n\nSebastian Münster's edition omits as not genuine the legendary introduction with its genealogical list, and also ch. lxvii. to the end, narrating the expedition of Vespasian and Titus against Jerusalem. Azariah dei Rossi also recognized that the Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes in a Hebrew translation had been smuggled into the first edition; and, following David Kimchi, Rapoport showed that the last chapter belonged to Abraham ibn Daud. Zunz has shown many other portions of the work to be Spanish additions, made in the 12th century. Almost the whole account of Alexander the Great and his successors has been proved by Trieber to be of later origin. According to that critic, the part of the work original with its author ended with ch. lv. (the dedication of Herod's Temple), more or less of the remainder being taken from Pseudo-Hegesippus, and perhaps added as early as the 5th century. This would explain the numerous contradictions and style-differences between these two parts.\n\nThere remains, as the nucleus of the whole chronicle, a history of the Second Temple, beginning with the apocryphal stories concerning Daniel, Zerubbabel, etc., and finishing with the restoration of the Temple under Herod. A copyist of Pseudo-Hegesippus, however, identified the \"Joseph ben Gorion\" (Josephum Gorione Genitum), a prefect of Jerusalem, mentioned in iii. 3, 2 et seq., with the historian Josephus ben Mattithiah, at this time governor of the troops in Galilee. This may account for the fact that the chronicle was ascribed to Joseph b. Gorion.\n\nJulius Wellhausen, agreeing with Trieber, denies that the genuine part has any historical value whatever. Trieber contends that the author did not draw his information directly from Josephus or from the Second Book of Maccabees, as is usually believed, and as Wellhausen maintains. He believes that both II Maccabees and the \"Yosippon\" used the work of Jason of Cyrene, and Josephus and the \"Yosippon\" that of Nicholas of Damascus.\n\n\nA Yiddish translation with illustrations was published by Michael Adam (Zürich, 1546; Prague, 1607; Amsterdam, 1661); it was later revised by Menahem ben Solomon ha-Levi, and published under the title \"Keter Torah\" (Amsterdam, 1743). Another Latin translation, with Tam ibn Yahya's preface, was published by Joseph Gagnier (Oxford, 1706); a French translation of Kyberus' Latin supplement by F. de Belleforest was published in Genebrard's French translation of Josephus (Paris, 1609). The oldest extant abstract was made in southern Italy, about 1150, by Jerahmeel ben Solomon and the translation of a portion by Moses Gaster. Another abstract, made in 1161 by Abraham ibn Daud and used as the third book of his \"Sefer Seder ha-Qabbalah\" was published (Mantua, 1513; Venice, 1545; Basel, 1580, etc.), with Münster's Latin translation, at Worms (1529) and Basel (1559). \n\nAn English translation of this abstract was made by Peter Morvyn (London, 1558, 1561, 1575, 1608). A Yiddish compendium by Edel bat Moses was published in Kraków in 1670; the oldest German extract, under the title \"Joseppi Jüdische Historien\" (author not known) is described in Wolf, \"Bibl. Hebr.\" (iii. 389). Some short extracts, in German, are given in Joseph Zedner, \"Auswahl aus Hebräischen Schriftstellern\" (pp. 16 et seq.), and in Winter and Wünsche, \"Die Jüdische Litteratur.\" iii. 310 et seq.). \n\nIn the Arabic and Yemenite translations, the author is called \"Yusuf ibn Qaryun.\"\n\nJerusalem, 1978,1980;\n"}
{"id": "2376901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2376901", "title": "Kaiserchronik", "text": "Kaiserchronik\n\nThe Kaiserchronik (\"Imperial Chronicle\") is a 12th-century chronicle written in 17,283 lines of Middle High German verse. It runs from Julius Caesar to Conrad III, and seeks to give a complete account of the history of Roman and German emperors and kings, based on a historiographical view of the continuity of the Roman and German successions. The overall pattern is of a progression from pagan to Christian worlds, and theological disputations stand at the turning-points of the Christianization of the Empire. However, much of the material is legendary and fantastic, suggesting that large sections are compiled from earlier works, mostly shorter biographies and saints' lives.\n\nThe chronicle was written in Regensburg some time after 1146. The poet (or at least the final compiler) was presumably a cleric in secular service, a partisan of the Guelphs. However the view that it was written by Konrad der Pfaffe, author of the \"Rolandslied\", has been discredited. Known sources include the \"Chronicon Wirzeburgense\", the Chronicle of Ekkehard of Aura, and the \"Annolied\"; the relationship to the \"Annolied\" has received particular attention in scholarship, as earlier views of the priority of the \"Kaiserchronik\", or of a shared source, were gradually dismissed. Judging from the large number of surviving manuscripts (twelve complete and seventeen partial), it must have been very popular, and it was twice continued in the 13th century: the first addition, the \"Bavarian continuation\", comprised 800 verses, while the second, the \"Swabian continuation\", which brought the poem to the Interregnum (1254–73), consisted of 483 lines. The \"Kaiserchronik\" in turn was used as an important source for other verse chronicles in the thirteenth century, most notably that of Jans der Enikel.\n\nThe text of the \"Kaiserchronik\" is preserved in a total of some 50 manuscripts, of which 20 have the full text.\nOf these, five predate the 14th century, including one of the late 12th century (the Vorau ms.).\nThe main witnesses are:\n\nThe chronicle was first edited in full in 1849-54 by Hans Ferdinand Massmann,\nMassmann was in a bitter academic dispute with August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben, an \"almost proprietal struggle\" over the priority of the respective manuscripts they had access to. Müller (1999) categorizes Massmann's work as an an \"editionsphilologischer Amoklauf\" (as it were \"editorial philology gone postal\"), as Massmann goes out of his way to ignore the Vorau ms., to the point of using the 1639 edition of \"Annolied\" by Martin Opitz as a \"Kaiserchronik fragment\" in higher standing than the Vorau ms.\nThe only critical edition besides Massmann's is that of Edward Schröder (1892). \nThere is also a classroom edition of excerpts with parallel translations in English. \n\n"}

() was a Norwegian-language encyclopedia published by Yrkesforlaget in 1935.\n\nIt featured approximately 10,000 short biographical entries for Norwegian businesspeople, and was edited by Einar Hoffstad (1894–1959). It was printed by Grøndahl & Søns Boktrykkeri. The purpose of the encyclopedia was to \"remedy the need to know something about the individuals one is trading with\". The entries contain little genealogical information, and the parents of the portrayed businesspeople are not included. Abbreviations are used extensively to save space and money.\n\nThe editor, Einar Hoffstad, stated in the foreword of the encyclopedia that it was not a parallel to the \"Who's Who\" reference works, although the title could imply that. Hoffstad argued that \"Merkantilt biografisk leksikon\" featured too few and too many names for being a \"Who is Who\"—too few from areas such as art, literature, science and politics, whilst too many from the enterprise. He also admitted that the encyclopedia included too many people, even from commerce, to be called a mercantile reference work. The notability standards for the encyclopedia were mostly based on the discretion of the staff, and whether the portrayed individuals were of general interest at the time. Trustees in commercial organisations, editors of trade press and successful traders were automatically included.\n\nIn a book review, the newspaper \"Aftenposten\" stated that the Mercantile Biographical Encyclopedia had a \"pretentious\" title as it was a \"strange mixture of book and advertising\". According to the reviewer Tharald Borgir there were several errors, and he lamented that Hoffstad in the foreword had disclaimed responsibility for such errors. The reviewer found it \"unbelievable\" that the book was being offered, and that \"gullible\" people paid to buy it. He suggested that the Ministry of Justice be on guard for further \"backslide\" regarding the \"freedom of liability\" when it came to such information. Hoffstad replied that although a large reference work was bound to contain some errors, his helpers had been reliable, and Borgir had been inquired six times to aid Hoffstad with the encyclopedia without replying.\n\nThe encyclopedia was published in a second, revised edition in 1939, this time by Halvorsen & Larsen. In October 2009, Project Runeberg scanned and made the encyclopedia's first edition available online.\n"}

{"id": "32452758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32452758", "title": "Private Apartments of the Winter Palace", "text": "Private Apartments of the Winter Palace\n\nThe Private Apartments of the Winter Palace are sited on the piano nobile of the western wing of the former imperial palace, the Winter Palace in St Petersburg. Access to the private rooms, for members of the Imperial Family, from the exterior was usually through the Saltykov Entrance (\"centre in the photograph to the right\") which was reserved for use by only the Tsar, Tsaritsa and grand dukes and grand duchesses. A second access was through a discrete box-like porch, on the western end of the Palace's Neva façade. From the ground floor, it can be accessed from the October Staircase, formerly known as His Majesty's Own Staircase; this double-flighted imperial staircase was a secondary entrance to the private apartments, and provided a more convenient route to the palace's ground floor and private entrances than the more formal and ceremonial public route through the state apartments. During the October Revolution of 1917, this was the entrance by which the revolutionaries gained access to the palace in order to arrest the Provisional Government in the small private dining room. Since that date it has been known as the October Staircase and has a plaque commemorating the event. Despite its size and grandeur, the October Staircase was a secondary staircase, the Jordan Staircase being the principal.\n\nFrom the palace's more formal rooms, the private apartments are entered through the rotunda, a circular room which served as an ante and waiting room for those to be received by the Tsar. Another entrance is from the Malachite Drawing Room, which served as both a private and state room, and was often the assembly point for the beginning of imperial processions from the neighbouring Arabian Hall which led to the principal state apartments – particularly for imperial weddings, when the bride would be formally dressed in the Romanoff wedding regalia by the Tsaritsa in the Malachite Drawing Room.\n\nThe private rooms overlook a lawned and wooded garden, created from a former parade ground by the last Empress of Russia, who wanted a private place for her children to play.\n\nUntil 1917, this wing was rather like a private house within a palace; it was used by the Imperial Family whenever in residence. Following a severe fire in 1837 when most of the palace was destroyed, the private apartments were rebuilt in various styles according to the tastes of their intended, individual occupants, the immediate family of Tsar Nicholas I; thus they are an array of eclectic styles and loose interpretations of earlier 18th century tastes and fashions. During the reigns of the following three Tsars many changes were made in decoration and use, but the layout remained essentially unchanged. In 1904, the last Tsar Nicholas II and his family abandoned the Winter Palace in favour of the more private Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. From this date until the fall of the monarchy, the Winter Palace was used only for formal state occasions.\n\nIt was in the Private wing of the Winter Palace, following the February Revolution of 1917, that the Russian Provisional Government established itself. A few months later during the October Revolution this was the area of the palace most damaged during the famous Storming of the Winter Palace, a defining moment in Russia's history.\n\nThe plan used \"(right)\" is based on the arrangement of rooms prior to 1917; it has since been altered to accommodate the palace's use today as part of the complex of buildings which comprise the State Hermitage Museum. Many of the former private rooms are not regularly open to the public, or have been much changed.\n\nThe apartments of Nicholas I and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, were in the northwest corner of the palace, a suite traditionally occupied by the monarch since the time of Catherine the Great, and now form part of the Apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna. Catherine the Great had her throne room here, before Giacomo Quarenghi completed the building of the larger St George's Hall in the eastern wing in 1787, suggesting that rooms were formerly less intimate and private than they latterly became. During the 1780s, the interior design of the palace was changed from the ornate rococo designed by Francesco Rastrelli to the simpler Neoclassical decoration still prevalent in the state rooms today; the private rooms, however, seem to have been frequently redecorated according to the (often simple) tastes of their occupants; and in terms of decoration, luxury and use they do not correspond to the Petit appartement du roi at Versailles.\n\nFollowing the fire of 1837, Nicholas I was responsible for the rapid rebuilding of the palace. He insisted that the exterior remain unchanged, but allowed large parts of the interior to be redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as \"A 19th-century palace inspired by a model in rococo style.\"\n\nSeveral eminent architects were employed to rebuild the palace, most notably Vasily Stasov, who was charged with the rebuilding of the state rooms in identical or similar styles to that which had been before, and Alexander Brullov. It is Brullov who is most closely associated with the private apartments. Able to work competently in a variety of styles, his commission was to rebuild the private and semi-private rooms according to the tastes of their intended occupants.\n\nThe architects involved in the rebuilding of the palace were able to take advantage of construction developments not available to Rastrelli and Quarenghi in their original plans. Following the fire, it was discovered that large quantities of wood and hidden voids had been one of the reasons the fire had spread so drastically. In order to avoid a repeat of this, hidden behind the new but classical façades, the architects were able to use the latest techniques in building. These included the large-scale use of steel to support the vast ceiling spans of the Baroque state rooms, avoiding the need for supporting columns. However, in the smaller rooms the ceilings were built with less flammable brick vaults, which were to have a significant effect on Brullov's decorative schemes for the private rooms. Vaulting lent itself to both Gothic and Byzantine forms of interior design. Nowhere in the palace is the Gothic more evident than in the ground floor drawing room created by Brullov in 1838 for the daughters of Nicholas I.\n\nLater the architect Andrei Stakenschneider was employed to carry out many projects at the palace. He decorated the crimson boudoir of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna in a Rococo revival that Quarenghi had all but eradicated from the palace 70 years earlier.\n\nThis suite of rooms is at the centre and southern end of the private wing, overlooking the Admiralty and Palace Square. In the apartment of the Tsaritsa, originally rebuilt by Brullov, the hand of Andrei Stakenschneider is evident. His chief distinction was an ability to combine an eclectic mix of architectural styles, frequently combining Classical, Gothic and Oriental motifs in the same scheme. This is nowhere more obvious that in the suite created for Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna, where the Gold Drawing Room combines all of these motifs. Maria Alexandrovna used the Gold Drawing room as her state Drawing Room with her more private rooms beyond: the Crimson Drawing Room followed by her Boudoir, before the most private of her rooms, the bedroom. Her study, in a corner of the palace, by contrast with the preceding Gold Drawing Room was simply decorated having plain white walls adorned only with gilded sconces, and a vaulted ceiling broken onto palales by gilded moulding. By contrast again, the small boudoir beyond was in an ornate rococo revival style created by the architect Harald Bosse in 1853.\n\nUntil the assassination of Alexander II, this room was traditionally the Tsar's study, having been used for this purpose by both Alexander I and Nicholas I. Originally designed by Giacomo Quarenghi in 1791, the room contains a recessed alcove in the style of a Baroque state bedroom, indicative of its original use. Following the fire of 1837 it was redesigned by Alexander Brullov.\n\nIt was here, in March 1881, that the fatally wounded Alexander II was carried to die (on the chaise longue to the right of the picture). Following his death a memorial bust was placed on the spot where he died; this remains in place today. The room, like many of the private rooms, is accessed from the aptly named \"dark corridor.\" It was along this long passageway that Maria Fedorovna in her memoirs talked of following great drips of congealed blood to find the dying Tsar in his study.\n\nNicholas II ascended the throne in 1894 and married his wife, Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna in the first days of his reign in a lavish ceremony at the Winter Palace. Immediately after the ceremony, his mother insisted the couple make their home with her at the Anichkov Palace. There they began their married life in six small rooms.\n\nThe Dowager Tsaritsa forbade the new Tsar and his wife to set up their own court until six months after her husband's death. Therefore it was not until May 1895, when the Dowager went to Copenhagen, that the couple could set up their own household, but it was first a small palace at Peterhof and then the Alexander Palace in the imperial compound at Tsarskoe Selo, which even at this early stage in their marriage and reign became their near-permanent home.\n\nFrom December 1895, however, the Tsar and Tsaritsa did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. They extended and redesigned the rooms which had been prepared for Nicholas, as Tsarevich two years earlier. The architect, Alexander Krasovsky, was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the northwest corner of the palace. He lowered many of the vaults, the flatter ceilings creating a more intimate atmosphere. He often employed a different era as the theme for each room, ranging from medieval to rococo and art nouveau. In style and content, the suite was intended to epitomise the domestic ethic of the couple, which was to live in an almost bourgeois fashion in small cosy home; at heart the Tsaritsa was a \"hausfrau\". She was criticised for her taste, which was to \"make over in the style of an English gentlewoman, stuffing rooms with knickknacks and drowning them in chintz.\" The court was horrified that the furniture was purchased mail order from Maples of London, while her mauve boudoir has been described as \"a horror to all who saw it.\"\n\nUnlike most sovereigns of the day, Nicholas II and his wife shared a bedroom (5). From this was a large bathroom (overlooking an internal courtyard) designed by the court architect, Krasovsky, which had a sunken bath reached by eight marble steps. The bath was in a recess lined with Dresden tiles.\n\nThe Tsaritsa also created the private garden (35) beneath the windows of the private apartments on the site of a former parade ground. Before this, the only garden of the palace was the very overlooked one (32) created in the palace's principal courtyard for her mother-in-law a few years earlier. These two areas remain the only gardens of the palace.\n\nDuring the reign of Nicholas II and his wife, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of St Petersburg's high society. In the Tsaritsa's opinion: \"Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian.\" Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end, to be briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which \"no one enjoyed.\" Then even the theatricals ceased.\n\nThe Silver and Empire Drawing Rooms were part of the suite of rooms reserved for the private use of the Tsaritsa. They form an enfilade which culminates in the Malachite Drawing Room, which served as the Tsaritsa's State Drawing Room, where she gave audiences and conducted her official business. It was also in the Malachite Drawing Room that Romanov brides were traditionally robed before walking in procession through the state rooms to the Palace's Grand Church for their weddings.\n\nOriginally part of the suite of Maria Feodorovna, these two drawing rooms were redesigned for Nicholas II and his wife in a French style, the Silver Drawing Room in a 19th-century interpretation of the Louis XVI style and the Empire Drawing Room in a faux Napoleonic empire style. From these rooms, the Tsaritsa was able to withdraw to still more private apartments, her boudoir, dressing room and bedroom.\n\nThe former study or boudoir (4 on plan) of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna (wife of Nicholas II) was redesigned for her by Alexander Krasovsky between 1894 and 1895. The room had previously formed the private suite of the wife of Nicholas I when, as her boudoir, it was decorated in red. For Nicholas I, devoted to his wife, spending an evening in this room with her was one of his favourite pastimes.\n\nToday the room displays the work of Heinrich Gambs, a notable Russian cabinet maker of the early 19th century.\n\nThe Gothic library (9 on the plan) is the largest room of the suite refurbished for Nicholas II by Krasovsky; he designed it in a form of heavy Puginesque wooden gothic, redolent of romantic perceptions of the Middle Ages. Elsewhere, he employed themes ranging from the rococo to art nouveau. The library and the small dining rooms are the only rooms to retain their Krasovsky decoration. Many of the rooms formerly belonging to Nicholas II are small, narrow, dark and awkward in design, especially Nicholas's narrow study.\n\nFormerly known as the Pompeian Dining Room, the Small Dining-room was redecorated in 1894–95 for the newly married Nicholas II and his Tsaritsa, by Krasovsky. A rococo plaster-work style was chosen to frame 18th-century St Petersburg tapestries.\n\nAbove the fireplace is a plaque recording the facts of the arrest of the Provisional Government which took place in this room on the night of 25 October 1917.\n\nFollowing the Government's arrest in the Small Dining Room, an eyewitness account records a systematic destruction of the apartments by the Bolsheviks:\n\nThe Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents smashed or carried off. The library...was forced open and ransacked...the Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. Desks, pictures, ornaments—everything was destroyed.\n\nFor a brief period following the revolution, the private apartments were open to the public to display the life of the former rulers, as this was the area of the palace where entry had been gained by the revolutionaries, and as a consequence, much had been destroyed so it is hard to know how accurate the depiction of the imperial private lives could have been. Today, with the exception of the library, the rooms are simply decorated and display part of the Hermitage Museum's vast collection of art; no reference is made to their former use. Much of the art collection displayed in the palace today is not original to the Winter Palace, but has been brought from numerous other palaces and estates which were nationalised after the revolution.\n\n\n"}

Detailed information on each of the state's 254 counties is provided, along with analytical essays on a variety of topics unique to each edition; for example, topics in the 2006-2007 edition include the state's film industry and the history of Lebanese and Syrian immigration to Texas. As with many other almanacs, an extensive astronomical calendar is included. The present publisher is the Texas State Historical Association, which acquired the Texas Almanac as a gift from the A. H. Belo Corporation on May 5, 2008.\n\nThe \"Galveston News\" published the first edition in 1857, scarcely a decade after the Republic of Texas joined the United States. This early version was published annually through 1873, with the sole exception of the year 1866. During the Civil War years, the document consisted of a pamphlet of fewer than 70 pages, published in Houston (1862) or Austin (1863–65) due to Galveston's being blockaded by Union Army forces during that period. From 1867 through 1873, publication resumed in Galveston, although the name of the book was changed in 1869 to \"The Texas Almanac and Emigrant’s Guide to Texas\". Following the 1875 death of the publisher, the \"Almanac\" ceased publication for almost 30 years, until George Bannerman Dealey was sent by the Galveston paper to establish a branch in Dallas and decided that resuming the \"Almanac\" would foster investment in the state's growing economy.\n\nFrom 1904 through 1929, the \"Almanac\" was published more or less annually, with breaks in publication due to events such as World War I. Beginning in 1929 with the Great Depression, publication was switched to a biennial cycle; this change was not reflected in the title until the 1941-1942 edition. Special editions were created for the occasions of the 100th anniversary of the \"Almanac\", the death of G. B. Dealey, the coinciding 110th anniversary of the \"Almanac\" and 125th anniversary of Belo Corporation, the Texas Sesquicentennial celebrating 150 years of independence from Mexico, and the sesquicentennial of the \"Almanac\", which was the first full-color edition. In 2006, Southern Methodist University issued a limited edition reprint of the 1936 \"Texas Almanac\", which commemorated the centennial of Texas' independence.\n\nAn electronic edition, \"Texas Almanac Online\", is published by Thomson Gale; the electronic edition is not available online to the general public, but only through subscribing institutions such as public libraries. Belo Corporation also publishes an educators' guide to the \"Texas Almanac\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47128725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47128725", "title": "The Cactaceae", "text": "The Cactaceae\n\nThe Cactaceae is a monograph on plants of the cactus family written by the American botanists Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose and published in multiple volumes between 1919 and 1923. It was landmark study that extensively reorganized cactus taxonomy and is still considered a cornerstone of the field. It was illustrated with drawings and color plates principally by the British botanical artist Mary Emily Eaton as well as with black-and-white photographs.\n\nNathaniel Lord Britton was a Columbia University geology and biology professor who left the university in 1895 to become the founding director of the New York Botanical Garden. Much of his own field work was done in the Caribbean. Joseph Nelson Rose was an authority on several plant families, including parsley (Apiaceae) and cacti (Cactaceae). He had been a plant curator at the Smithsonian since 1896, and while working there he made several field trips to Mexico, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian and for Britton's newly founded New York Botanical Garden. Together, Britton and Rose published many articles on the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae) before embarking in 1904 on research leading towards \"The Cactaceae\". With the support of Douglas T. MacDougal, director of the Carnegie Institution for Science's Desert Botanical Laboratory, the Carnegie Institution agreed to fund the project. Rose took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to pursue it, and both Rose and Britton were named Carnegie Institution Research Associates in 1912, when more focused work on the project began. Between 1912 and 1916 Rose and Britton did extensive field work, collecting specimens and touring the botanical gardens and notable collections of Europe, the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America.\n\nIn this period, cactus taxonomy was in a disorganized state with only a few very large and heterogeneous genera. Britton and Rose broke these old-style catch-all genera into smaller, more defined genera, ultimately classifying 1255 species under 124 genera. It has been argued that with this first major overhaul of cactus genera, they ushered in an era of 'splitting' or liberalism in cactus taxonomy, in contrast to the conservative 'lumping' approach that characterized their predecessors.\n\nBritton and Rose defined their genera by the characteristics of the cactus plants' vegetation, flowers, and fruit, as well as by their geographic distribution. They drew on their own and others' field work, as well as on greenhouse studies and specimens in herbaria to describe species included in their exhaustive study. An important aspect of their work was their careful reexamination of existing type specimens, many of which turned out to have been incorrectly identified.\n\nBritton and Rose published \"The Cactaceae\" in four volumes through the Carnegie Institution between 1919 and 1923. It \"set new standards in cactus botany\" and has been called Britton's \"magnum opus\". Though it was considered definitive in its own day, the taxonomy of Cactaceae has remained problematic, due in part to difficulties in preserving type specimens of cactus. Several taxonomic reorganizations have succeeded Britton and Rose's work, with the most recent major one dating to 1984. (See Cactus entry for more details.) Despite this, the excellence of their work is reflected in the fact that some 50 of the 79 genera they authored are still considered phylogenetically sound, though some have been redefined.\n\nA black-and-white reprint of the second (1937) edition of \"The Cactaceae\" was published by Dover Publications in 1963. In 2006, Daniel Schweich undertook a project to digitize the entire book, and all four volumes can now be downloaded in full color.\n\nIn 1911, the British illustrator Mary Emily Eaton moved to New York, where she was employed by the New York Botanical Garden for two decades. The great majority of color plates in the four volumes of \"The Cactaceae\" are by Eaton, with a handful by other artists such as Deborah Griscom Passmore, H.A. Wood, and Kako Morita. Eaton's compositions are striking and her watercolors are noted for their crispness and accuracy of botanical detail. \n\nThe color plates are supplemented by black-and-white line drawings as well as by black-and-white photographs of cacti, ranging from long shots taken in the field to close-up details. One contemporary reviewer called \"The Cactaceae\" “the most sumptuous botanical publication\" since William Rickatson Dykes’ 1913 book \"The Genus Iris\".\n\n"}
{"id": "41902597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41902597", "title": "The Forgiveness Project", "text": "The Forgiveness Project\n\nThe Forgiveness Project is a UK-based charity that uses real stories of victims and perpetrators of crime and violence to help people explore ideas around forgiveness and alternatives to revenge. With no political or religious affiliations, The Forgiveness Project’s independent and inclusive approach ensures its core message – that everyone has the potential to change their perspective and break the cycle of vengeance – resonates across all cultures.\n\nThe charity’s goals are centred on:\n\nThe charity was founded in 2004 by Marina Cantacuzino, a journalist who in the build up to the Iraq War began to gather personal stories from people whose lives had been affected by violence and terrorism but who had learned to forgive and move on.\n\nCantacuzino spent all of 2003 collecting stories of reconciliation and forgiveness for an exhibition of words and images which she created with the photographer Brian Moody. These stories subsequently formed the basis of The Forgiveness Project’s \"The F Word\" exhibition.\n\nCentral to their work is the sharing of personal accounts about people’s transformative journeys. Having collected over 130 personal stories on their website, this is also done through its exhibition, \"The F Word\", and via the award-winning programmes it runs within prisons, schools, community groups and companies.\n\nIn providing tools that can facilitate conflict resolution and reconciliation, The Forgiveness Project encourages behavioural change and improves people’s lives, whatever their story.\n\nThese story-led initiatives operate at a local, national and international level and encourage individuals to reflect on their current perspective and their future life path. Rather than give advice or tell people what to think, The Forgiveness Project works by inviting those involved to see whether they can relate to the stories they hear and to take steps in trying to see a different perspective on their circumstances.\n\nStories collected by The Forgiveness Project follow multiple themes that the Project states \"provide a framework to these forgiveness stories, adding a dimension to the narrative of hate, hurt, and healing.\" These themes are feeling pain and anger, being curious, forgiving yourself, developing empathy, seeking revenge, transforming hate, and making meaning. The Forgiveness Project believes that analyzing the themes \"shows that while forgiveness is not a linear process, and seldom a one-off event, nevertheless certain qualities and values feature in most of the stories.\"\n\n\nAnger can be self destructive--holding in feelings to reconcile with pain as well as enduring hate to others but anger can also be a good thing. It can be empowering; \"reclaiming your voice or fighting for justice. Indeed, rage, sorrow and despair are part of the healing process, and may well become the launch pad for forgiveness.\"\n\n\ncuriosity is a crucial part of forgiveness and is antidote for hate. Curiosity opens up the door to imagination and allows you to be kept from the thought of having everyone else figured out. \"To be prepared to forgive means moving from \"why me?\", to \"why them?\"\"\n\n\nIt is very difficult to forgive others when you haven't had acceptance for your own faults. By putting an end to punishing yourself for things you have or haven't done is just one step closer to self-forgiveness. \"It's about letting go of regret and self-pity, and becoming more aware of yourself without being overwhelmed by what you find. Forgiving yourself is an act of self-healing.\"\n\n\nPeople who forgive have a boarder understanding of human behavior. By forgiving you are showing empathy; standing in someone else's shoes, and broadening your perspective on other peoples beliefs and ideas. \"Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, author of Zero Degrees of Empathy, has described empathy as \"a skill like any human skill\", and lack of empathy \"a disability\" which isn’t permanent and which, if you get a chance to practice, can \"get better\".\"\n\n\nForgiveness further allows us to improve our ability to transform the impulse to seek revenge and allows us to look for the bigger meaning in all of it. \"Anger and bitterness towards those who have shamed or wronged you can lead to some people wanting to take revenge. However while thoughts of revenge and retaliation may initially bring relief, they can quickly become obsessive and ultimately deeply destructive. Repetitive revenge fantasies can actually increase someone’s torment and even turn the victim into the aggressor.\" \n\n\n\"Forgiveness in this sense is an act of surrender which may mean relinquishing your justified right to retaliate, giving up your moral indignation, or letting go of grievances, grudges and resentments.\" When you start recognizing a common humanity in all people you start to come out of your old identity of being the victim because something must be given up to stop holding on to the cycles of hat we all carry.\n\n\nThe energy used to harbor resentment and cover up the feelings can be put elsewhere. People have found forgiveness and healing by finding a purpose and pursue the things that really matter to them. Instead of holding in all the suffering they turn it into something meaningful and puts purpose back into their lives.These stories are shared in hope that everyone will have a little forgiveness in there heart with any situation.\n\nThis collection of thought-provoking narratives document personal tales of forgiveness and reconciliation around the world. The exhibition can be hired in a range of formats and regularly tours Germany, the UK and the USA. There are also permanent exhibitions in France, Kenya, South Africa and Sweden.\n\n\"The F Word\" exhibition has been displayed in more than 500 venues across 13 countries to an audience of over 60,000 people since being launched in London’s Oxo Gallery in January 2004. The exhibition was described by the charity's founding patron, Anita Roddick Anita Roddick, as “truly an education of the human spirit”.\n\nThe Exhibition is made up of Storytellers, who engage others and share their traumas in order to help others heal.\n\nAn updated collection of some of the charity's stories which examine the charity's core themes of forgiveness, reconciliation and conflict transformation have been brought together into an illustrated 240-page book. Released in hardback by Jessica Kingsley Publishers on 26 March 2015, the book was written by founder Marina Cantacuzino and includes forewords from patron Desmond Tutu and Alexander McCall Smith. It has also been received endorsements from actress Emma Thompson, journalist and news presenter Jon Snow, historian and TV presenter Dan Snow, cultural thinker and founding faculty member of The School of Life in London, Roman Krznaric, Cambridge University professor Simon Baron-Cohen, humanitarian and former hostage Terry Waite and journalist Bel Mooney.\n\nThe charity believes that hearing someone speak first-hand and being able to ask questions is the most powerful form of story-telling so over 30 of those who share their stories with The Forgiveness Project are also part of the charity’s Speaker’s Bureau. This facility allows schools, prisons, conferences and organisations hiring the F Word exhibition to have one of the featured storytellers on hand to share their experience of forgiveness.\n\nIn addition to regular talks, The Forgiveness Project has also hosted five annual lectures to date.\n\n\nRESTORE is the charity’s intensive, group-based victim empathy programme for offenders that encourages the sharing of experiences within a framework influenced by Restorative Justice principles. The project has delivered over 160 programmes in custodial and non-custodial settings in England and Wales since 2007.\n\nOver nine years in the judicial system: The Restore Programme has helped over 3,ooo people including 180 Prison Officers.\n\nCo-facilitated by trained victims of crime and ex-offenders, the workshop leaders use their personal testimonies to encourage prisoners to take responsibility for their actions and change how they think and feel about their offending behaviour.\n\nWhilst Restorative Justice (RJ) traditionally focuses on bringing a victim and offender into communication, this process can be stalled if both parties aren’t at the same life stage. The Forgiveness Project’s approach is to help offenders unravel their own stories and develop empathy by understanding the effect their actions have on others. This enables them to start the restorative process without being entirely dependent on their victim’s willingness or availability to participate.\n\nIn many cases, having encouraged behavioural change, the programme may result in the offender having the confidence, motivation and support to meet their victims as part of future RJ conferencing. RESTORE assists in victims’ recovery by enabling them to play a role in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe organization has won recognition such as: \n\nCantacuzino received a 2013 Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship which enabled her to spend five weeks visiting and learning from other restorative justice programmes in custodial and community settings in the USA and Canada.\n\nIndependent evaluation was commissioned on the work of RESTORE within prisons and the effect that it has had on young offenders and adult prisoners who had participated in the programme.\n\n\nSince Dame Anita Roddick first lent her support in advance of the inaugural \"The F Word\" exhibition in 2004, The Forgiveness Project has attracted endorsements and ongoing support from a number of high-profile organisations and individuals.\n\nThe charity’s patrons include Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rt Hon the Lord Woolf, philanthropist Lady Edwina Grosvenor, actress Emma Thompson and comedian Shappi Khorsandi whilst supporters include Tony Benn, clothes designer Katharine Hamnett, actors Dame Helen Mirren and Linus Roache plus Terry Waite.\n\nThe Forgiveness Project is also a peace partner of the Charter for Compassion.\n\n"}

Using Tim's inheritance, Graeme has made a modern high-tech residence/office that contains various features such as a fully stocked supermarket, a high-tech computer and a picture window that can show various images when the blinds close. Delighted with the new office (aside from the lack of a phone for which they utilize an old lady downstairs), they set to work on promoting their business, which isn't exactly clear to any of them, considering their marketing catch-phrase \"Anything, anytime\" is too vague.\n\nBill, who was in charge of advertising their agency, has put advertisements into various magazines and newspapers. Graeme comments that Bill is casting the net a bit wide. Bill replies that he does not know what they (the Goodies) do. Tim comments that they were \"going to do...good to...people\" — to which Bill responds \"How wet!\".\n\nThe Goodies are almost immediately summoned to the Tower of London, where they meet the Chief Beefeater in the kitchens of the Tower (renovated from a disused torture chamber). He tells them that somebody is stealing the Beefeaters' beef and, as a result, the Beefeaters are starving as they refuse to eat anything else and are now only 3 feet tall. The Chief Beefeater asks the Goodies to find out who is stealing the beef and why.\n\nBack at their office, the Goodies attempt to solve the mystery by suggesting \"bulls or poultry farmers\" as the conspirators. However, Bill has a mental image (a strange effect from sucking on lemon sherbert) of a pictogram revealing that someone is starving the Beefeaters in order to steal the Crown Jewels. They are called back to the Tower (disguised as Beefeaters) by the Chief Beefeater where they discover that the last remaining Beefeaters have perished \"from the lack of beef\".\n\nThe Goodies get to work, setting up an elaborate security system protecting the Crown Jewels from attempted robbery. Soon after, they catch a burglar who, strangely enough, bears an official royal seal that reads \"by appointment\". As the Chief Beefeater interrogates the burglar, the Goodies spot a man on a horse outside the Tower who appears to resemble Prince Charles. Believing him to be an imposter and accomplice to the robbery, they go on a wild chase throughout London. When he escapes into Buckingham Palace, they realize that it was indeed Prince Charles.\n\nLater, as the Goodies wallow in their shame, they receive a message from the Queen herself. She explains how the Goodies were actually protecting a fake set of Jewels as the real ones were pawned \"due to a recent financial embarrassment\". The Goodies had mistakenly foiled an attempt to put the real Crown Jewels back. They are let off the hook for their noble actions and are requested to treat the embarrassing incident as a secret. Still in business and safe from jail, the Goodies rejoice.\n\n\n\nThe office that Graeme designed for them survived until the 1973 story \"The New Office\".\n\n\nThis episode has been released on both DVD and VHS.\n\n\n"}

A basic sentence demonstrating this would be as follows.\n\nWinfred P. Lehmann is the first to propose the reduction of the six possible permutations of word order to just two main ones, VO and OV, in what he calls the Fundamental Principle of Placement (FPP), arguing that the subject is not a primary element of a sentence. VO languages are primarily right-branching, or head-initial: heads are generally found at the beginning of their phrases.\n\nVO languages have a tendency to favor the use of prepositions instead of postpositions, with only 42 using postpositions of the documented 498 VO languages.\n\nSome languages, such as Finnish, Hungarian, Russian, and Yiddish, use both VO and OV constructions, but in other instances, such as Early Middle English, some dialects may use VO and others OV. Languages that contain both OV and VO construction may solidify into one or the other construction. A language that moves the verb or verb phrase more than the object will have surface VO word order, and a language that moves the object more than the verb or verb phrase will have surface OV word order.\n\n"}
{"id": "3928410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3928410", "title": "Watauga Association", "text": "Watauga Association\n\nThe Watauga Association (sometimes referred to as the Republic of Watauga) was a semi-autonomous government created in 1772 by frontier settlers living along the Watauga River in what is now Elizabethton, Tennessee. Although it lasted only a few years, the Watauga Association provided a basis for what later developed into the state of Tennessee and likely influenced other western frontier governments in the trans-Appalachian region. North Carolina annexed the Watauga settlement area, by then known as the Washington District, in November 1776. Within a year, the area was placed under a county government, becoming Washington County, North Carolina, in November 1777. (This is the present day Washington County, Carter County and other areas now located in the northeast part of the state of Tennessee.)\n\nWhile there is no evidence that the Watauga Association ever claimed to be outside the sovereign territory of the British Crown, historians have often cited the Association as the earliest attempt by American-born colonists to form an independent democratic government. In 1774, Virginia governor Lord Dunmore called the Watauga Association a \"dangerous example\" of Americans forming a government \"distinct from and independent of his majesty's authority.\" President Theodore Roosevelt later wrote that the Watauga settlers were the \"first men of American birth to establish a free and independent community on the continent.\" While no copy of the settlers' compact, known as the \"Articles of the Watauga Association\", has ever been found, related documents tend to imply that the Watauga settlers still considered themselves British subjects, even after the initial hostilities of the American Revolution had commenced.\n\nEuropean settlers began arriving in the Watauga, Nolichucky, and Holston river valleys in the late 1760s and early 1770s, most migrating from Virginia via the Great Valley, although a few were believed to have been Regulators fleeing North Carolina after their defeat at the Battle of Alamance. These settlers mistakenly believed (or at least claimed to have believed) the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys were part of lands ceded to Virginia by the Cherokee in the 1770 Treaty of Lochaber, but a subsequent survey by Colonel John Donelson confirmed that these lands were still part of the Cherokee domain. As settlement on lands west of colonial boundaries violated the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers were ordered to leave.\n\nIn May 1772, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers negotiated a 10-year lease directly with the Cherokee, and being outside the claims of any colony, established the Watauga Association to provide basic government functions. The lease and the subsequent purchase of these lands in 1775 were considered illegal by the British Crown, and were vehemently opposed by a growing faction of the Cherokee led by the young chief Dragging Canoe. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (April 1775), the settlers organized themselves into the \"Washington District,\" loyal to the \"united colonies,\" and formed a Committee of Safety to govern it, marking the end of the so-called \"Watauga Republic\".\n\nIn Spring of 1776, the Washington District Committee of Safety drafted a petition asking the colony of Virginia to annex the district. After Virginia refused, the Committee drafted a similar petition (dated July 5, 1776) asking the North Carolina Assembly to annex the district. In November of that year, North Carolina granted the petition and formally annexed the area. The Washington District was finally admitted to North Carolina as Washington County in November 1777.\n\nThe Cherokee, who were aligned with the British, launched an all-out invasion against the settlements in July 1776, but were soundly defeated. In 1777, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long Island, ceding control of the Watauga and Nolichucky valleys to the American colonies.\n\nSince no copy of the \"Articles of the Watauga Association\" has ever been found, most of what is known about it comes from other sources, primarily the 1776 \"Petition of the Inhabitants of the Washington District\", commonly called the \"Watauga Petition,\" in which the Wataugans requested annexation by North Carolina. According to the Petition, the \"Articles\" were fashioned after the laws of Virginia and were enacted by unanimous consent of the settlers. The primary reason given for the establishment of the Watauga Association was to prevent the Watauga and Nolichucky regions from becoming a haven for debtors and felons, and for conducting \"public business\" such as the recording of deeds and wills. Other sources, such as the later writings of Washington District Committee of Safety clerk \"pro tem\" William Tatham (1752–1819) and documents collected by historian J. G. M. Ramsey in the mid-19th century, reveal that the \"Articles\" established a five-member court (the members of which were elected), and that the Wataugans erected a courthouse and jail at Sycamore Shoals.\n\nHistorians disagree over the first five magistrates of the court, although most agree that it included John Carter, James Robertson, Charles Robertson, and Zachariah Isbell. The fifth member was probably Jacob Brown. Later court members included Andrew Greer, John Roddye, and John Sevier. James Smith was probably the court's first clerk, replaced by Sevier in 1775. When Sevier was elected to the court, Felix Walker took over as clerk, with Tatham serving in his absence.\n\nWataugan militiamen were present at multiple engagements on the frontier and throughout the American Revolution. A company of 20 Wataugans took part in the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774 during Lord Dunmore's War, and another contingent aided in the defense of Boonesborough and Harrodsburg later in the decade.\n\nThe Washington District Committee of Safety, created in 1775, consisted of John Carter, Zachariah Isbell, Jacob Brown, John Sevier, James Smith, James and Charles Robertson, William Bean, John Jones, George Russell, and Robert Lucas. The Committee acquired arms and oversaw the construction of Fort Watauga (initially named Fort Caswell and located at present day Elizabethton, Tennessee), where they thwarted one wing of the Cherokee invasion of July 1776. Wataugans took part in William Christian's punitive expedition and the Rutherford Light Horse expedition against the Overhill towns in the latter half of 1776.\n\nEven at the height of the Cherokee threat in the Spring and Summer of 1776, the Wataugans heeded a call to arms and dispatched a company of riflemen under Felix Walker to aide in the defense of Charleston in South Carolina. In August 1780, a small contingent led by Col. Isaac Shelby fought in the American Patriot victory at the Battle of Musgrove Mill near present-day Clinton, South Carolina. In late September 1780, the Overmountain Men—the frontier militia that crossed the Appalachian Mountains and defeated an army of British loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain—mustered at Sycamore Shoals, and included 240 Wataugans under the command of Cols. John Sevier and Isaac Shelby. After the battle, Sevier led a second punitive expedition against the Cherokee in which he destroyed the Chickamauga Cherokee villages near modern Chattanooga.\n\nAt least one Wataugan, William Tatham, was present at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.\n\nThe \"Articles of the Watauga Association\" likely influenced the Cumberland Compact (drafted in 1780), the main link between the two pacts being James Robertson, who in 1779 led a group of colonists into what is now the Nashville area. The Clarksville Compact, drafted for the Clarksville settlement in 1785, may have also been inspired by the Watauga Association (the Clarksville Compact even adopted the laws of Virginia, even though the settlement was clearly within the territory of North Carolina). In the mid-1780s, some former Wataugans (especially John Sevier) played a key role in the establishment of the failed State of Franklin.\n\nNumerous historians in the 19th and early 20th centuries romanticized the Watauga Association as the first democratic or constitutional government formed by American-born colonists. Historian Andrew C. McLaughlin, in his first major work on the history of the U.S. Constitution, wrote of the Wataugans, \"one can find no more striking fact in American history, nor one more typical, than the simple ease with which those frontiersmen ... formed an association and extended the rights and privileges of self-government.\" McLaughlin's colleague Claude Van Tyne wrote of the Wataugans, \"like the Pilgrim Fathers they were without formal laws and institutions, and they made them.\" In \"The Winning of the West\", Theodore Roosevelt treated the Watauga Association as a microcosm of the subsequent American Revolution, writing, \"the Watauga settlers outlined in advance the nation's work. They tamed the rugged and shaggy wilderness, they bid defiance to outside foes, and they successfully solved the difficult problem of self-government.\" Recent historians point out that while the Watauga Association was one of the first constitutional governments west of the Appalachians, it was not intended as a government separate from the English colonies.\n\n\n"}
