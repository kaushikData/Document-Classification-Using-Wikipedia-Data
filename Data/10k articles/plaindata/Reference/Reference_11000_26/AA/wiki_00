BiblioCore, the online catalog, integrates with existing Integrated library systems (ILSs) and creates a complete OPAC replacement that features intuitive searching, account integration, new tools for discovery, eBook integration, library staff recommendations, and the ability to create a community around the library collection.\n\nOther services include a mobile suite with BiblioMobile; the ability to manage web sites that have dynamic web options with BiblioCMS (content management system); to integrate summer reading microsites with Biblio Summer Sites; to make public library resources available through school library catalogs with BiblioSchools; to integrate ebook lending and buying within the catalog with BiblioDigital; and to integrate event listings straight into the catalog with BiblioEvents. There are more options, modules, and improvements being worked on all the time.\n\nIn 2008, \"Library Journal\" called BiblioCommons \"a revolutionary social discovery system for libraries\".\n\nBiblioCommons has an arrangement with Knowledge Ontario that makes it Knowledge Ontario's \"Connect Ontario\" project.\n\nBiblioCommons began not as a software company, but as a nonprofit youth literacy initiative. Co-founder Beth Jefferson was interested in the ways teens were using emerging technologies to engage with popular culture and wondered how youth literacy could be improved if a social context around reading could be established online. The perF!nk Project (Perceive. Feel. Think) that emerged won a national award from the Information Technology Association of Canada (ITAC) and began attracting broader attention – particularly, from libraries.\n\nAsking questions, the team began to explore the potential leverage of the public library’s online catalog for the end user. Could they create conversation and engagement where people already were, in the library’s web catalog?\n\nThe perf!nk project caught the attention of The Ontario Library Association, which committed research funding. Over the next 18 months, BiblioCommons conducted surveys and more than 100 one-on-one interviews in four library systems to explore the possibilities for re-envisioning the library catalog.Three Canadian provincial agencies were sufficiently impressed with the research and resulting vision to fund prototypes, and ultimately to purchase advance subscriptions. Their early commitments enabled BiblioCommons to build the envisioned services and roll them out to interested libraries in those jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing 18 months of user research and a year-long beta test, with six libraries, as well as ongoing research and feedback, BiblioCommons created prototypes of the BIblioCore catalog and improved scalability, usability, and configurability before rolling out to broader audiences.\n\nBiblioCommons re-launched its re-designed services to several large systems in late 2009.\n\nThe basic BiblioCore search box is built with automatic relevance ranking algorithms, data mapping, faceted searches, natural language detection, and a \"did-you-mean?\" functionality to make searching the online public library catalog easier and more intuitive. Advanced searches allow a user to narrow down their query by format, location, availability, topic, publication date, tag, and more.\n\nUsers that are logged into the library system can add tags to books, ratings, age recommendations, book reviews, and more. Anything added to the BiblioCore catalog can be seen by other users on the BiblioCommons system, making the library catalog a larger, more diverse and more robust online community.\n\nUsers can also create shelves with which to group books; create \"completed\", \"in progress\", and \"for later\" shelves to manage and sequence their reading progress; and follow other library users for book recommendations and reviews.\n\nBiblioCommons also offers other modules and products that work with BiblioCore for public libraries.\n\n\nAs of April 2014, BiblioCommons has been adopted by over 200 libraries in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, and has over five million registered BiblioCommons users.\n\nBiblioCommons beta tested at Oakville Public Library, Ontario. Testing started in July 2008.\n\nThe second library network to launch BiblioCommons was the Perth County Information Network in Ontario, which includes Perth East Public Library, Stratford Public Library, and West Perth Public Library. The library network went live with BiblioCommons in August 2009 and officially launched in October 2009.\n\nSince 2011, the Brooklyn Public Library and New York Public Library have been using the BiblioCommons catalog, and other libraries using the system include: the Boston Public Library, Chicago Public Library, Christchurch City Libraries, Edmonton Public Library, Multnomah County Public Library, Ottawa Public Library, Princeton Public Library, Seattle Public Library, Vancouver Public Library, Yarra Plenty Regional Library, and many others.\n\nKing County Library System went live with the BiblioCore catalog in December 2013, and the Chicago Public Library system went live with both the BiblioCore catalog and the redesigned BiblioCMS (Content Management System) in April 2014.\n\nBiblioCore works by integrating with a library's current Integrated Library System (ILS).\n\nThe ILSs that BiblioCommons currently works with are: Carl-X, Evergreen, Horizon, Millennium, Polaris, Sierra, Symphony, SirsiDynix, and VTLS.\n\nBiblioCommons collects some personally identifiable information, such as library card number, from users who access their library account from the service. BiblioCommons secures and encrypts all personal information provided by the user during the registration process, Bibliocommons does not share information or activity with ad networks or other entities that are not directly involved in the library's services, and BiblioCommons does not store any information regarding a user's borrowing data, book history, or recently returned items. Nonetheless, the fact that BiblioCommons collects personally identifiable information at all has raised concerns,\nwhich persisted into 2015.\n\n"}

It was initiated by Dr. Leonard Cutler Sanford and financially supported by Frederick F. Brewster, both of New Haven, Connecticut. The expedition took place from 1912 to 1917, with its core members the experienced bird collector Rollo Beck and his wife Ida, though additional assistance was used at many places. Although most of the nearly 8,000 specimens collected were seabirds, land birds were opportunistically acquired as well. Various watercraft were used in the course of the expedition, where much of the collection work was carried out at sea.\n\nThe Becks left San Francisco on 4 December 1912. The first collecting was carried out in Peru, working along the coast as well as making some inland trips. Based at shore stations, and using hired fishing boats, Rollo Beck would often row out to sea alone, and sometimes with a man to assist him, as far as 20 km offshore, collecting birds from dawn to dusk. 1913 was taken up by work along the coasts of Peru and Chile, with trips also made to the Juan Fernández Islands. 1914 saw the Becks working their way southwards along the Chilean coast to the Chiloé Archipelago and then, in July, to Magallanes Province.\n\nRamifications of the outbreak of war in Europe caused some difficulties for the Becks, but in August 1914 they visited the Falkland Islands and then moved to Mar del Plata, Argentina, where they were based until November. Then, after revisiting the Falklands, and using a hired sloop, the “\"Leguri\",” the Becks spent December and January sailing and collecting in the waterways and islands around Cape Horn and the Beagle Channel.\n\nFrom February 1915 the Becks collected from Magallanes and around Tierra del Fuego using the schooner “\"Antarctica\".” They visited the Falklands in September and again in October, where they stayed through January 1916 before moving northwards to Uruguay and the coast of Brazil which they worked for several months before sailing to the Caribbean and collecting through the island of Hispaniola from September 1916 to July 1917. From mid July to the end of August 1917 the Becks collected in Cuba and returned to the United States at the beginning of September.\n\nBeck’s report and narrative of the expedition was summarised by Robert Cushman Murphy in his “Oceanic Birds of South America,” in which he comments:\n”The specimens of birds obtained during the course of the Brewster-Sanford Expedition number 7,853. Those that may be broadly classed as water birds comprise upwards of a hundred species. The collection is, naturally, more notable for its full representation of the South American sea bird fauna, including hitherto little known rarities, than it is for forms new to science.”\n“When one considers the faultless character of the skins, and the great body of associated data, such as nests, eggs, notes, and photographs – and when one balances all of these tangible credits against the obstacles, disappointment, and discomforts of the journey briefly retold above – then it becomes clear that the treasure obtained by Mr Beck and his courageous helpmeet is a monument to rare skill and indomitable persistence. Up to date, it is safe to say, no other ornithological collector has carried through a similar campaign, or matched such scientific spoils.”\n\nNew birds described from Hispaniola include the least poorwill (\"Siphonorhis brewsteri\"), the white-winged warbler (\"Xenoligea montana\"), and the Hispaniolan subspecies of the grey-fronted quail-dove (\"Geotrygon caniceps leucometopia\").\n\n"}

The area had been placed under cultivation and settled by the end of the 12th century. It survives in two manuscripts. The work is sometimes referred to as the Brookmerbrief, using the modern spelling of \"Brookmerland\".\n\nThe Brokmerbrief is the most complete source on Frisian law. It describes the polity and judicial system of a country whose law was based on the will of the assembled people (the 'Frisian freedom'): political and judicial power was in the hands of functionaries selected annually from the ranks of the farmers, who were known as \"redjeven\" (consuls, counsellors); their power in turn was regulated by the Brokmerbrief.\n\nThe period of independent rural self-rule came to an end by about the mid-14th century. However, unlike for example Emsigerland, Brokmerland remained a discrete unit, since the Brokmerbrief forbids the erection of fortified stone residences and castles and this had prevented the establishment of such starting points for localised rule. Thus feudalism, otherwise widespread throughout Europe at this time, remained unknown in East Frisia.\n\nHowever, Emsig Law eventually prevailed in the area, probably as a result of the emergence of the tom Brok dynasty, but certainly by the time of Cirksena hegemony. In the early 16th century, Edzard I then based his East Frisian Law () on the Emsig Law.\n\nThe Brokmerbrief is unique among the documents of Old Frisian law in consisting of a code of law in the strict sense, rather than a compilation. It is preserved in two manuscripts, one of which is in the State Archives of Lower Saxony in Oldenburg and the other in the Lower Saxony State Library in Hanover.\n\nThe middle section of the text strongly resembles the Emsig law on fines, indicating a common source.\n\nThe text is a valuable source of localised and dateable information on Old Frisian.\n\n\n"}

It was developed in 2009 by Shay Gal-On at EEMBC and is intended to become an industry standard, replacing the antiquated Dhrystone benchmark. The code is written in C and contains implementations of the following algorithms: list processing (find and sort), matrix manipulation (common matrix operations), state machine (determine if an input stream contains valid numbers), and CRC.\n\nThe CRC algorithm serves a dual function; it provides a workload commonly seen in embedded applications and ensures correct operation of the CoreMark benchmark, essentially providing a self-checking mechanism. Specifically, to verify correct operation, a 16-bit CRC is performed on the data contained in elements of the linked-list.\n\nTo ensure compilers cannot pre-compute the results at compile time every operation in the benchmark derives a value that is not available at compile time. Furthermore, all code used within the timed portion of the benchmark is part of the benchmark itself (no library calls).\n\nCoreMark draws on the strengths that made Dhrystone so resilient - it is small, portable, easy to understand, free, and displays a single number benchmark score. Unlike Dhrystone, CoreMark has specific run and reporting rules, and was designed to avoid the well understood issues that have been cited with Dhrystone.\n\nMajor portions of Dhrystone are susceptible to a compiler’s ability to optimize the work away; thus it is more a compiler benchmark than a hardware benchmark. This also makes it very difficult to compare results when different compilers/flags are used.\n\nLibrary calls are made within the timed portion of Dhrystone. Typically, those library calls consume the majority of the time consumed by the benchmark. Since the library code is not part of the benchmark, it is difficult to compare results if different libraries are used.\nGuidelines exist on how to run Dhrystone but since results are not certified or verified, they are not enforced. There is no standardization on how Dhrystone results should be reported, with various formats in use (DMIPS, Dhrystones per second, DMIPS/MHz)\n\nCoreMark results can be found on the CoreMark web site, and on processor data sheets. \nResults are in the following format:\n\nCoreMark 1.0 : N / C / P / M\n\nFor example: CoreMark 1.0 : 128 / GCC 4.1.2 -O2 -fprofile-use / Heap in TCRAM / FORK:2\n\n\nEEMBC launches MIPS busting benchmark, New Electronics magazine, Graham Pitcher, August 2009.\nRoving Reporter: Benchmarks: An inside look at CoreMark, Intel Embedded Design Center - \nHardware Blog, Don Dingee, OpenSystems Media, by special arrangement with Intel ECA, August 2009.\nARM Announces Support For EEMBC CoreMark Benchmark, ARM Holdings plc, June 2009.\nCoreMark - Open-Source-Benchmark von EEMBC, elektronik net.de, Andrea Gillhuber, February 2009.\nBenchmarks Atom vs iPad A4 vs iPhone 3GS ARM Cortex and much more..., EEE Journal\nPublished Kal-El performance: is NVIDIA SoC truly faster than a Core2?\nImagining a quad-core Motorola Xoom, CNet News, February 2011.\n\n"}

The Gallery features a unique collection of wall paintings and architectural elements from the Faras Cathedral, discovered by an archeological mission led by Professor Kazimierz Michałowski.\n\nMost of the artworks shown in the Faras Gallery found their way there thanks to the archaeologists participating in the international effort to save the remains of old Nile basin cultures, known as the Nubian Campaign. The Nubian Campaign took place between 1961 and 1964 and was initiated by UNESCO. During the excavations the archaeologists discovered well-preserved ruins of places of worship, layered one over another, within the area of the city Faras (ancient Pachoras), next to the Sudanian-Egyptian border. The buildings originated from between the 7th and 14th centuries, and were decorated with wall paintings depicting Christian religious themes.\n\nIn order to remove the wall paintings from the cathedral walls and move them to specially prepared screens, it was necessary to secure and reinforce the surface to prevent cracking. To do this, the faces of paintings were covered with sheets of japanese tissue paper and impregnated with a thick mix of wax-rosin. Upper parts of the paintings were secured by pressing stripes of canvas into them. Next, fragments of plaster with the paintings attached to them were cut off from walls using knives and saws. The removed paintings were then moved onto wooden screens. It was necessary to remove excess plaster from the backs of paintings and to reinforce the paintings with gypsum. The artworks were wrapped in cotton blankets and transported to museums in Warsaw and Khartoum. There they underwent a complex restoration process and were prepared for exhibition. The protective layers were then removed, original plaster was removed from the reverse sides of paintings, and a thin (ok. 2–3 mm) layer was moved to an artificial background.\n\n67 paintings and many other objects discovered in Faras have been transported to Poland. The first group of artworks arrived at the Museum in 1962. The collection held by the National Museum in Warsaw is the largest and most valuable set of archaeological heritage found outside Poland residing in Polish museum collections.\n\nThe Nubian Campaign generated scientific interest in Sudan and its ancient cultures. Polish archaeologists have conducted numerous excavations and research expeditions in Old Dongola, the capital of Makuria, Banganarti or the IVth region of Nile cataract. These expeditions considerably expanded the original collection of the Faras Gallery.\n\nThe Faras Gallery at the National Museum in Warsaw was opened to the public in 1972, and accompanied by the first nubiology congress and the announcement of a new scientific discipline: nubiology.\n\nOn 17 October 2014 the renovated and rearranged Faras Gallery was reopened. The authors of the architectural design and modernised concept of the gallery space are Mirosław Orzechowski and Grzegorz Rytel. The exhibition is curated by Bożena Mierzejewska. The modernisation was funded by Wojciech Pawłowski. The Faras Gallery was reopened under the auspices of UNESCO and the Minister of Culture and National Heritage Małgorzata Omilanowska.\n\nRoom I presents objects found at the Faras Cathedral, such as the frieze fragment from the apse of the First Cathedral; the founding inscription of bishop Paulos (commemorating the renovation of the Cathedral in 707 AD, \"a holy Catholic place and a church of the Apostles of God\"), stone blocks with inscriptions, and other elements. These objects are directly related to the history of the cathedral and its numerous building stages, happening from the 7th until the 14th century. The Cathedral was built on the foundations of an older church, built in the beginning of the 7th century AD.\n\nIn rooms II and III the visitors can view films on the history of discoveries, Nubia and the Nubian Campaign, as well as individual paintings, their style and iconography. Also shown are the photographs of the archaeological campaigns and the photographs of artworks which were transferred to the National Museum of Sudan. Another presentation concerns professor Kazimierz Michałowski, the archaeologist who discovered the Faras Cathedral, and the patron of the gallery.\n\nThis room contains the objects related to the burial of Faras bishops. Most of the objects were found in the burial chambers or grave constructions. The objects include epitaphs, water containers or chest crosses, which were buried with the bishops.\n\nSixteen bishops of Faras had been buried in the close vicinity of the Cathedral or inside it. Information about their identity was provided by the texts of epitaphs written in Greek or Coptic. Many epitaphs feature texts of prayers for the bishops. In Room V there are numerous examples of these epitaphs, including the epitaph of Bishop Ignatios, Bishop Maththaios, and Bishop Stephanos.\n\nThe Room VI is designed to evoke the character of a temple, with arcades forming subsequent annexes in which the wall paintings are presented. The spatial arrangement is similar to that of the Faras Cathedral. The arcades are complemented by an apse. This room contains wall paintings removed from the walls of the nartex, northern nave and presbytery. The paintings have been created between the 7th and 14th centuries and were found on various layers of plaster (due to multiple stages of building of the Cathedral and covering the walls with newer images). The wall paintings are images of Christ, Mary, angels and archangels, saints, bishops and rulers. They are painted al secco.\n\nAmong the most characteristic paintings presented in this room are: Saint Anne, Archangels Michael and Gabriel, bishops Marianos and Petros, various iconographic representations of Mary, and others.\n\nCeramics and pottery frequently constitute a majority of archaeological finds at excavation sites. The majority of finds in the case of the Faras expedition dates from the Christian period. In that time (650–1000 AD) Faras was the most important manufacturing centre for ceramics in northern Nubia. This activity came to a halt in the 10th century.\n\nThe gallery presents also Coptic ceramics as well as ceramics from earlier periods. All the items originate from Faras and the IVth Nile cataract.\n\nAnother collection is that of Coptic textiles, originating from Christian-era Egypt. This collection arrived at the National Museum in Warsaw in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century thanks to antiquarians and private collectors.\n\nThe Louvre contains several artworks from Faras, belonging to the National Museum in Warsaw. Among these is the image of Archangel Michael and a Faras archbishop.\n\n\n"}

ISRR is a free mutual consent adoption reunion registry for persons desiring a reunion with next-of-kin. This agency serves the needs of family members who have been separated from each other by adoption, divorce, foster care, abandonment, or other means.\n\nThe registries filing system was based originally on Soundex Code which is a phonetic way of coding giving numeric value to consonants and ignores vowels, except as a first letter. This system allows for matching despite some differences in spelling. It was a perfect foundation for a situation where often people did not know exact spelling.\n\nThe founder, Emma May Vilardi, was a remarkable woman of extraordinary vision and courage who undertook this important, humane task of providing a safe and secure way for persons seeking contact to make themselves available to each other. This registry remains her legacy to the adoption community and the hundreds of thousands served. \"It was not until Emma began looking for the reasons behind the many illnesses that she had suffered that she learned that ancestors and genetics were the key to understanding her health problems. Daring a probate judge to unseal an adoption record, she quickly learned that her ancestors had succumbed to the same diseases.\" \n\nThe ISRR Executive Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring the operation of the registry for future generations. The registry motto is, \"United today for the reunions of tomorrow.\" For many it remains a place of hope when they feel all other resources have been exhausted, for others it was a quick and easy step that led them to connect with family members they longed to know.\n\nNow one of many existing adoption reunion registries, Soundex is the oldest and largest of its kind. It served as a model for many state registries, for Senator Carl Levin's U.S. Senate Bill's in the 1980s trying to establish a national adoption registry, and into the 1990s and for the abundance of online registries established to help adoptees and birth family member find each other.\n\nThe adoption reform movement groups supported ISRR and recommended their members register. Most state registries, agencies and courts also refer directly to ISRR as an option for those seeking reunification with family. There are many articles and references archived in newsletters, clippings and other resources. Registration at ISRR is free because of the donations made by registrants, and the time given by volunteers. \n\n\"Dear Abby\" referred to ISRR many times over the years. Each time registrations would arrive by the thousands resulting in many matches. One story is of an adoptee who registered 20 years to the day of when his birthmother's registration arrived. Both had read the same \"Dear Abby\" article. The adoptee had carried it in his wallet for twenty years.\nThere are around 225,000 active registrations, at any given time. ISRR was paper based until 2003, when the volunteers began an imaging project that took five years to complete. Now all forms are digitized.\n\n"}
{"id": "6037917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6037917", "title": "Islam", "text": "Islam\n\nIslam () is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion which teaches that there is only one God, and that Muhammad is the messenger of God. It is the world's second-largest religion and with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1% of the world's population, most commonly known as Muslims. Muslims make up a majority of the population in 50 countries which are located in the Old World. Islam teaches that God is merciful, all-powerful, unique and has guided humankind through prophets, revealed scriptures and natural signs. The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran, viewed by Muslims as the verbatim word of God, and the teachings and normative example (called the \"sunnah\", composed of accounts called \"hadith\") of Muhammad ( 570–8 June 632 CE).\n\nMuslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. Muslims consider the Quran to be the unaltered and final revelation of God. Like other Abrahamic religions, Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous punished in hell. Religious concepts and practices include the Five Pillars of Islam, which are obligatory acts of worship, and following Islamic law (\"sharia\"), which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, from banking and welfare to women and the environment. The cities of Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam.\n\nAside from the theological viewpoint, Islam is historically believed to have originated in the early 7th century CE in Mecca, and by the 8th century the Umayyad Islamic caliphate extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east. The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century, during the Abbasid Caliphate, when much of the historically Muslim world was experiencing a scientific, economic and cultural flourishing. The expansion of the Muslim world involved various caliphates and empires, traders and conversion to Islam by missionary activities (\"dawah\").\n\nMost Muslims are of one of two denominations: Sunni (75–90%) or Shia (10–20%). About 13% of Muslims live in Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, 23% in the Middle East–North Africa, where it is the dominant religion, 31% in South Asia, the largest population of Muslims in the world, and 15% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sizeable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas, the Caucasus, Central Asia, China, Europe, Mainland Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and Russia. Islam is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.\n\nIslam (, ) is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root S-L-M which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, safeness, and peace. In a religious context it means \"voluntary submission to God\". \"Islām\" is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root, and means \"submission\" or \"surrender\". \"Muslim\", the word for an adherent of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter\" or \"one who surrenders\". The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: \"Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam.\" Other verses connect Islam and religion (\"dīn\") together: \"Today, I have perfected your religion (\"dīn\") for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion.\" Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith. In the Hadith of Gabriel, \"islām\" is presented as one part of a triad that also includes \"imān\" (faith), and \"ihsān\" (excellence).\n\nIslam was historically called Muhammadanism in Anglophone societies. This term has fallen out of use and is sometimes said to be offensive because it suggests that a human being rather than God is central to Muslims' religion, parallel to Buddha in Buddhism. Some authors, however, continue to use the term \"Muhammadanism\" as a technical term for the religious system as opposed to the theological concept of Islam that exists within that system.\n\nFaith (Iman) in the Islamic creed (Aqidah) is often represented as the six articles of faith, notably spelled out in the Hadith of Gabriel.\n\nIslam is often seen as having the simplest doctrines of the major religions. Its most fundamental concept is a rigorous monotheism, called tawḥīd (). God is described in chapter 112 of the Quran as: \"Say, He is God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him\" (). Muslims repudiate polytheism and idolatry, called \"Shirk\", and reject the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. In Islam, God is beyond all comprehension and thus Muslims are not expected to visualise or anthropomorphise him. God is described and referred to by certain names or attributes, the most common being \"Al-Rahmān\", meaning \"The Compassionate\" and \"Al-Rahīm\", meaning \"The Merciful\" (See Names of God in Islam).\n\nMuslims believe that the creation of everything in the universe was brought into being by God's sheer command, \"Be, and it is\" and that the purpose of existence is to worship or to \"know\" God. He is viewed as a personal god who responds whenever a person in need or distress calls him. There are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God who states, \"I am nearer to him than (his) jugular vein.\" God consciousness is referred to as Taqwa.\n\n\"Allāh\" is the term with no plural or gender used by Muslims and Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews to reference God, while \"\" () is the term used for a deity or a god in general. Other non-Arab Muslims might use different names as much as Allah, for instance \"Tanrı\" in Turkish, \"Khodā\" in Persian or \"Ḵẖudā\" in Urdu.\n\nBelief in angels is fundamental to the faith of Islam. The Arabic word for angel ( \"\") means \"messenger\", like its counterparts in Hebrew (\"malʾákh\") and Greek (\"angelos\"). Angels do not possess any bodily desire and are not subject to temptations such as eating, drinking or procreation. Angels' duties include communicating revelations from God, glorifying God, recording every person's actions, and taking a person's soul at the time of death. Muslims believe that angels are made of light. They are described as \"messengers with wings—two, or three, or four (pairs): He [God] adds to Creation as He pleases...\" Some scholars have emphasized a metaphorical reinterpretation of the concept of angels. Pictorial depictions of angels are generally avoided in Islamic art, as the idea of giving form to anything immaterial is not accepted. Muslims therefore do not generally share the perceptions of angelic pictorial depictions, such as those found in Western art.\n\nThe Islamic holy books are the records which most Muslims believe were dictated by God to various prophets. Muslims believe that parts of the previously revealed scriptures, the \"Tawrat\" (Torah) and the \"Injil\" (Gospel), had become distorted—either in interpretation, in text, or both. The Quran (literally, \"Recitation\") is viewed by Muslims as the final revelation and literal word of God and is widely regarded as the finest literary work in the classical Arabic language.\n\nMuslims believe that the verses of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad by God through the archangel Gabriel (\"Jibrīl\") on many occasions between 610 CE until his death on June 8, 632. While Muhammad was alive, all of these revelations were written down by his companions (\"sahabah\"), although the prime method of transmission was orally through memorization.\n\nThe Quran is divided into 114 chapters (\"suras\") which combined, contain 6,236 verses (\"āyāt\"). The chronologically earlier suras, revealed at Mecca, are primarily concerned with ethical and spiritual topics. The later Medinan suras mostly discuss social and legal issues relevant to the Muslim community.\n\nThe Quran is more concerned with moral guidance than legislation, and is considered the \"sourcebook of Islamic principles and values\". Muslim jurists consult the \"hadith\" (\"reports\"), or the written record of Prophet Muhammad's life, to both supplement the Quran and assist with its interpretation. The science of Quranic commentary and exegesis is known as \"tafsir\". The set of rules governing proper elocution of recitation is called \"tajwid\".\n\nMuslims usually view \"the Quran\" as the original scripture as revealed in Arabic and that any translations are necessarily deficient, which are regarded only as commentaries on the Quran.\n\nMuslims identify the 'prophets' ( \"\" ) of Islam as those humans chosen by God to be his messengers. According to the Quran, the prophets were instructed by God to bring the \"will of God\" to the peoples of the nations. Muslims believe that prophets are human and not divine, though some are able to perform miracles to prove their claim. Islamic theology says that all of God's messengers preached the message of Islam—submission to the will of God. The Quran mentions the names of numerous figures considered prophets in Islam, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, among others.\n\nMuslims believe that God finally sent Muhammad as the last law-bearing prophet (\"Seal of the prophets\") to convey the divine message to the whole world (to sum up and to finalize the word of God). In Islam, the \"normative\" example of Muhammad's life is called the Sunnah (literally \"trodden path\"). Muslims are encouraged to emulate Muhammad's actions in their daily lives and the Sunnah is seen as crucial to guiding interpretation of the Quran. This example is preserved in traditions known as hadith, which recount his words, his actions, and his personal characteristics. Hadith Qudsi is a sub-category of hadith, regarded as verbatim words of God quoted by Muhammad but is not part of the Quran.\n\nA hadith involves two elements: a chain of narrators, called sanad, and the actual wording, called matn. Hadiths can be classified, by studying the narration, as \"authentic\" or \"correct\", called \"Sahih\" (), \"good\", called \"Ḥasan\" () or \"weak\", called \"Ḍaʻīf\" () among others. Muhammad al-Bukhari collected over 300,000 hadith, but only included 2,602 distinct hadith that passed veracity tests that codified them as authentic into his book Sahih al-Bukhari, which is considered by Sunnis to be the most authentic source after the Quran. Another famous source(s) of hadiths is known as The Four Books, which Shias consider as the most authentic hadith reference.\n\nBelief in the \"Day of Resurrection\", \"Yawm al-Qiyāmah\" () is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of \"Qiyāmah\" is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and tribulations preceding and during the \"Qiyāmah\" are described in the Quran and the hadith, and also in the commentaries of scholars. The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.\n\nOn Yawm al-Qiyāmah, Muslims believe all humankind will be judged on their good and bad deeds and consigned to \"Jannah\" (paradise) or \"Jahannam\" (hell). The Qurʼan in Surat al-Zalzalah describes this as, \"So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it (99:7) and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it (99:8).\" The Qurʼan lists several sins that can condemn a person to hell, such as disbelief in God ( \"\"), and dishonesty; however, the Qurʼan makes it clear God will forgive the sins of those who repent if he so wills. Good deeds, such as charity, prayer and compassion towards animals, will be rewarded with entry to heaven. Muslims view heaven as a place of joy and blessings, with Qurʼanic references describing its features. Mystical traditions in Islam place these heavenly delights in the context of an ecstatic awareness of God. \"Yawm al-Qiyāmah\" is also identified in the Quran as \"Yawm ad-Dīn\" (), \"Day of Religion\"; \"as-sāʿah\" (), \"the Last Hour\"; and \"al-Qāriʿah\" (), \"The Clatterer\".\n\nIslamic apocalyptic literature describing Armageddon is often known as \"fitna\" or \"malahim\". A common expectation depicts Armageddon with the arrival of the Mahdi (prophesied redeemer) who will be sent and with the help of Jesus, to battle the Antichrist. They will triumph, liberating Islam from cruelty, and this will be followed by a time of serenity with people living true to religious values.\n\nThe concept of divine will is referred to as \"\", which literally derives from a root that means \"to measure\". Everything, good and bad, is believed to have been decreed.\n\nThere are five basic religious acts in Islam, collectively known as 'The Pillars of Islam' (\"arkan al-Islam\"; also \"arkan ad-din\", \"pillars of religion\"), which are considered obligatory for all believers. The Quran presents them as a framework for worship and a sign of commitment to the faith. They are (1) the creed (Shahada), (2) daily prayers (Salah), (3) almsgiving (Zakat), (4) fasting during Ramadan (Sawm) and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) at least once in a lifetime. Both Shia and Sunni sects agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts. Apart from these, Muslims also perform other religious acts. Notable among them are charity (Sadaqah) and recitation of the Quran.\n\nThe Shahadah, which is the basic creed of Islam that must be recited under oath with the specific statement: \"\", or \"I testify that there is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God\" (). This testament is a foundation for all other beliefs and practices in Islam. Muslims must repeat the \"shahadah\" in prayer, and non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.\n\nRitual prayers are called Ṣalāh or Ṣalāt (Arabic: ). Salat is intended to focus the mind on God, and is seen as a personal communication with him that expresses gratitude and worship. Performing prayers five times a day is compulsory but flexibility in the timing specifics is allowed depending on circumstances. The prayers are recited in the Arabic language, and consist of verses from the Quran. The prayers are done with the chest in direction of the kaaba though in the early days of Islam, they were done in direction of Jerusalem. The act of supplicating is referred to as dua.\n\nA Mosque is a place of worship for Muslims, who often refer to it by its Arabic name \"masjid\". A large mosque for gathering for Friday prayers or Eid prayers are called masjid jāmi. Although the primary purpose of the mosque is to serve as a place of prayer, it is also important to the Muslim community as a place to meet and study. In Medina, Al-Masjid al-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque, was also a place of refuge for the poor. Modern mosques have evolved greatly from the early designs of the 7th century, and contain a variety of architectural elements such as minarets. The means used to signal the approach of prayer time is a vocal call, known as the adhan.\n\n\"Zakāt\" ( \"\" \"alms\") is giving a fixed portion of accumulated wealth by those who can afford it to help the poor or needy and for those employed to collect Zakat; also, for bringing hearts together, freeing captives, for those in debt (or bonded labour) and for the (stranded) traveller. It is considered a religious obligation (as opposed to voluntary charity) that the well-off owe to the needy because their wealth is seen as a \"trust from God's bounty\". Conservative estimates of annual zakat is estimated to be 15 times global humanitarian aid contributions. The amount of zakat to be paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1/40) per year, for people who are not poor.\n\nSadaqah means optional charity which is practiced as religious duty and out of generosity. Both the Quran and the hadith have put much emphasis on spending money for the welfare of needy people, and have urged the Muslims to give more as an act of optional charity. The Quran says: \"Spend something (in charity) out of the substance which We have bestowed on you, before Death should come to any of you\" (). One of the early teachings of Muhammad was that God expects men to be generous with their wealth and not to be miserly (Quran ). Accumulating wealth without spending it to address the needs of the poor is generally prohibited and admonished. Another kind of charity in Islam is waqf which means perpetual religious endowment.\n\nFasting ( \"\") from food and drink, among other things, must be performed from dawn to dusk during the month of Ramadan. The fast is to encourage a feeling of nearness to God, and during it Muslims should express their gratitude for and dependence on him, atone for their past sins, develop self-control and restraint and think of the needy. \"Sawm\" is not obligatory for several groups for whom it would constitute an undue burden. For others, flexibility is allowed depending on circumstances, but missed fasts must be compensated for later.\n\nThe obligatory Islamic pilgrimage, called the \"\" (), has to be performed during the Islamic month of \"Dhu al-Hijjah\" in the city of Mecca. Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must make the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in his or her lifetime. Rituals of the Hajj include: spending a day and a night in the tents in the desert plain of Mina, then a day in the desert plain of Arafat praying and worshiping God, following the foot steps of Abraham; then spending a night out in the open, sleeping on the desert sand in the desert plain of Muzdalifah; then moving to Jamarat, symbolically stoning the Devil recounting Abraham's actions; then going to Mecca and walking seven times around the Kaaba which Muslims believe was built as a place of worship by Abraham; then walking seven times between Mount Safa and Mount Marwah recounting the steps of Abraham's wife, while she was looking for water for her son Ismael in the desert before Mecca developed into a settlement. Another form of pilgrimage, Umrah, can be undertaken at any time of the year.\n\nMuslims recite and memorize the whole or part of the Quran as acts of virtue. Reciting the Quran with elocution has been described as an excellent act of worship. Pious Muslims recite the whole Quran at the month of Ramadan. In Islamic societies, any social program generally begins with the recitation of the Quran. One who has memorized the whole Quran is called a \"hafiz\" who, it is said, will be able to intercede for ten people on the Last Judgment Day. Apart from this, almost every Muslim memorizes some portion of the Quran because they need to recite it during their prayers.\n\nSharia is the religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith. In Arabic, the term \"sharīʿah\" refers to God's divine law and is contrasted with \"fiqh\", which refers to its scholarly interpretations. The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.\n\nTraditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources of sharia: the Quran, \"sunnah\" (Hadith and Sira), \"qiyas\" (analogical reasoning), and \"ijma\" (juridical consensus). Different legal schools developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as \"ijtihad\" (inference). Traditional jurisprudence distinguishes two principal branches of law, \"ʿibādāt\" (rituals) and \"muʿāmalāt\" (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics. Its rulings assign actions to one of five categories: mandatory, recommended, permitted, abhorred, and prohibited. Thus, some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God's will.\n\nHistorically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists (muftis). Their legal opinions (fatwas) were taken into account by ruler-appointed judges who presided over \"qāḍī's\" courts, and by \"maẓālim\" courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law. In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models. While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in personal status (family) laws. Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence. The Islamic revival of the late 20th century brought along calls by Islamist movements for full implementation of sharia. The role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world. There are ongoing debates as to whether sharia is compatible with secular forms of government, human rights, freedom of thought, and women's rights.\n\nIslam, like Judaism, has no clergy in the sacerdotal sense, such as priests who mediate between God and people. However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term \"ulema\" () is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of Islamic sciences. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a mufti () and often issues judicial opinions, called fatwas. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a faqih (). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a muhaddith. A qadi is a judge in an Islamic court. Honorific titles given to scholars include shiekh, mullah and maulvi. Imam () is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.\n\nA school of jurisprudence is referred to as a \"madhab\" (). The four major Sunni schools are the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and sometimes Ẓāhirī while the two major Shia schools are Ja'fari and Zaidi. Each differ in their methodology, called Usul al-fiqh. The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called taqlid. The term \"ghair muqallid\" literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and by extension do not have a madhab. The practice of an individual interpretating law with independent reasoning is called ijtihad.\n\nTo reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, Islamic economic jurisprudence encourages trade, discourages the hoarding of wealth and outlaws interest-bearing loans (usury; the term is \"riba\" in Arabic). Therefore, wealth is taxed through Zakat, but trade is not taxed. Usury, which allows the rich to get richer without sharing in the risk, is forbidden in Islam. Profit sharing and venture capital where the lender is also exposed to risk is acceptable. Hoarding of food for speculation is also discouraged.\n\nThe taking of land belonging to others is also prohibited. The prohibition of usury has resulted in the development of Islamic banking. During the time of Muhammad, any money that went to the state, was immediately used to help the poor. Then in 634, Umar formally established the welfare state Bayt al-mal. The Bayt al-mal or the welfare state was for the Muslim and Non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-mal ran for hundreds of years under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century and continued through the Umayyad period and well into the Abbasid era. Umar also introduced Child Benefit and Pensions for the children and the elderly.\n\nJihad means \"to strive or struggle\" (in the way of God). Jihad, in its broadest sense, is \"exerting one's utmost power, efforts, endeavors, or ability in contending with an object of disapprobation\". Depending on the object being a visible enemy, the Devil, and aspects of one's own self (such as sinful desires), different categories of jihad are defined. Jihad also refers to one's striving to attain religious and moral perfection. When used without any qualifier, Jihad is understood in its military form. Some Muslim authorities, especially among the Shi'a and Sufis, distinguish between the \"greater jihad\", which pertains to spiritual self-perfection, and the \"lesser jihad\", defined as warfare.\n\nWithin Islamic jurisprudence, jihad is usually taken to mean military exertion against non-Muslim combatants. Jihad is the only form of warfare permissible in Islamic law and may be declared against illegal works, terrorists, criminal groups, rebels, apostates, and leaders or states who oppress Muslims. Most Muslims today interpret Jihad as only a defensive form of warfare. Jihad only becomes an individual duty for those vested with authority. For the rest of the populace, this happens only in the case of a general mobilization. For most Twelver Shias, offensive jihad can only be declared by a divinely appointed leader of the Muslim community, and as such is suspended since Muhammad al-Mahdi's occultation in 868 AD.\n\nIn a Muslim family, the birth of a child is attended with some religious ceremonies. Immediately after the birth, the words of Adhan is pronounced in the right ear of the child. In the seventh day, the aquiqa ceremony is performed, in which an animal is sacrificed and its meat is distributed among the poor. The head of the child is also shaved, and an amount of money equaling the weight of the child's hair is donated to the poor. Apart from fulfilling the basic needs of food, shelter, and education, the parents or the elderly members of family also undertake the task of teaching moral qualities, religious knowledge, and religious practices to the children. Marriage, which serves as the foundation of a Muslim family, is a civil contract which consists of an offer and acceptance between two qualified parties in the presence of two witnesses. The groom is required to pay a bridal gift (\"mahr\") to the bride, as stipulated in the contract.\nMost families in the Islamic world are monogamous. Polyandry, a practice wherein a woman takes on two or more husbands is prohibited in Islam. However, Muslim men are allowed to practice polygyny, that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per Sura 4 Verse 3. A man does not need approval of his first wife for a second marriage as there is no evidence in the Qur'an or hadith to suggest this. The testimony of a woman is deemed in Islam to be worth half that of a man. With Muslims coming from diverse backgrounds including 49 Muslim-majority countries, plus a strong presence as large minorities throughout the world there are many variations on Muslim Weddings. Generally in a Muslim family, a woman's sphere of operation is the home and a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world. However, in practice, this separation is not as rigid as it appears. With regard to inheritance, a son's share is double that of a daughter's.\n\nCertain religious rites are performed during and after the death of a Muslim. Those near a dying man encourage him to pronounce the Shahada as Muslims want their last word to be their profession of faith. After the death, the body is appropriately bathed by the members of the same gender and then enshrouded in a threefold white garment called \"kafan\". Placing the body on a bier, it is first taken to a mosque where funeral prayer is offered for the dead person, and then to the graveyard for burial.\n\nMany practices fall in the category of \"adab\", or Islamic etiquette. This includes greeting others with \"as-salamu 'alaykum\" (\"peace be unto you\"), saying \"bismillah\" (\"in the name of God\") before meals, and using only the right hand for eating and drinking. Islamic hygienic practices mainly fall into the category of personal cleanliness and health. Circumcision of male offspring is also practiced in Islam. Islamic burial rituals include saying the \"Salat al-Janazah\" (\"funeral prayer\") over the bathed and enshrouded dead body, and burying it in a grave. Muslims are restricted in their diet. Prohibited foods include pork products, blood, carrion, and alcohol. All meat must come from a herbivorous animal slaughtered in the name of God by a Muslim, Jew, or Christian, with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself. Food permissible for Muslims is known as halal food.\n\nIn a Muslim society, various social service activities are performed by the members of the community. As these activities are instructed by Islamic canonical texts, a Muslim's religious life is seen incomplete if not attended by service to humanity. In fact, In Islamic tradition, the idea of social welfare has been presented as one of its principal values. The verse of the Quran is often cited to encapsulate the Islamic idea of social welfare. Similarly, duties to parents, neighbors, relatives, sick people, the old, and minorities have been defined in Islam. Respecting and obeying one's parents, and taking care of them especially in their old age have been made a religious obligation. A two-fold approach is generally prescribed with regard to duty to relatives: keeping good relations with them, and offering them financial help if necessary. Severing ties with them has been admonished. Regardless of a neighbor's religious identity, Islam teaches Muslims to treat neighboring people in the best possible manner and not to cause them any difficulty. Concerning orphaned children, the Quran forbids harsh and oppressive treatment to them while urging kindness and justice towards them. It also rebukes those who do not honor and feed orphaned children (Quran ).\n\nThe Quran and the sunnah of Muhammad prescribe a comprehensive body of moral guidelines for Muslims to be followed in their personal, social, political, and religious life. Proper moral conduct, good deeds, righteousness, and good character come within the sphere of the moral guidelines. In Islam, the observance of moral virtues is always associated with religious significance because it elevates the religious status of a believer and is often seen as a supererogatory act of worshipping. One typical Islamic teaching on morality is that imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is permissible and just; but forgiving the offender is better. To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence. The Quran says: 'Repel (evil) with what is best' (). Thus, a Muslim is expected to act only in good manners as bad manners and deeds earn vices. The fundamental moral qualities in Islam are justice, forgiveness, righteousness, kindness, honesty, and piety. Other mostly insisted moral virtues include but not limited to charitable activities, fulfillment of promise, modesty and humility, decency in speech, tolerance, trustworthiness, patience, truthfulness, anger management, and sincerity of intention.\n\nAs a religion, Islam emphasizes the idea of having a good character as Muhammad said: 'The best among you are those who have the best manners and character' (). In Islam, justice is not only a moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances. The Quran and the hadith describe God as being kind and merciful to His creatures, and tell people to be kind likewise. As a virtue, forgiveness is much celebrated in Islam, and is regarded as an important Muslim practice. About modesty, Muhammad is reported as saying: ' Every religion has its characteristic, and the characteristic of Islam is modesty'.\n\nMainstream Islamic law does not distinguish between \"matters of church\" and \"matters of state\"; the scholars function as both jurists and theologians. Currently no government conforms to Islamic economic jurisprudence, but steps have been taken to implement some of its tenets.\n\nMuslim tradition views Muhammad (c. 570 – June 8, 632) as the seal of the prophets. During the last 22 years of his life, beginning at age 40 in 610 CE, according to the earliest surviving biographies, Muhammad reported revelations that he believed to be from God, conveyed to him through the archangel Gabriel (\"Jibril\"). Muhammad's companions memorized and recorded the content of these revelations, known as the Quran.\n\nDuring this time, Muhammad in Mecca preached to the people, imploring them to abandon polytheism and to worship one God. Although some converted to Islam, the leading Meccan authorities persecuted Muhammad and his followers. This resulted in the Migration to Abyssinia of some Muslims (to the Aksumite Empire). Many early converts to Islam were the poor, foreigners and former slaves like Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi who was black. The Meccan élite felt that Muhammad was destabilising their social order by preaching about one God and about racial equality, and that in the process he gave ideas to the poor and to their slaves.\n\nAfter 12 years of the persecution of Muslims by the Meccans and the Meccan boycott of the Hashemites, Muhammad's relatives, Muhammad and the Muslims performed the \"Hijra\" (\"emigration\") to the city of Medina (formerly known as \"Yathrib\") in 622. There, with the Medinan converts (\"Ansar\") and the Meccan migrants (\"Muhajirun\"), Muhammad in Medina established his political and religious authority. The Constitution of Medina was formulated, instituting a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish, Christian and pagan communities of Medina, bringing them within the fold of one community—the Ummah.\n\nThe Constitution established:\n\n\nAll the tribes signed the agreement to defend Medina from all external threats and to live in harmony amongst themselves. Within a few years, two battles took place against the Meccan forces: first, the Battle of Badr in 624 – a Muslim victory, and then a year later, when the Meccans returned to Medina, the Battle of Uhud, which ended inconclusively.\n\nThe Arab tribes in the rest of Arabia then formed a confederation and during the Battle of the Trench (March–April 627) besieged Medina, intent on finishing off Islam. In 628, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was signed between Mecca and the Muslims and was broken by Mecca two years later. After the signing of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah many more people converted to Islam. At the same time, Meccan trade routes were cut off as Muhammad brought surrounding desert tribes under his control. By 629 Muhammad was victorious in the nearly bloodless conquest of Mecca, and by the time of his death in 632 (at the age of 62) he had united the tribes of Arabia into a single religious polity.\n\nThe earliest three generations of Muslims are known as the Salaf, with the companions of Muhammad being known as the Sahaba. Many of them, such as the largest narrator of hadith Abu Hureyrah, recorded and compiled what would constitute the sunnah.\n\nWith Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Abu Bakr, a companion and close friend of Muhammad, was made the first caliph. Under Abu Bakr, Muslims put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\". The Quran was compiled into a single volume at this time.\n\nAbu Bakr's death in 634 resulted in the succession of Umar ibn al-Khattab as the caliph, followed by Uthman ibn al-Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hasan ibn Ali. The first four caliphs are known in Sunni Islam as \"al-khulafā' ar-rāshidūn\" (\"Rightly Guided Caliphs\"). Under them, the territory under Muslim rule expanded deeply into the parts of the Persian and Byzantine territories.\n\nWhen Umar was assassinated by Persians in 644, the election of Uthman as successor was met with increasing opposition. The standard copies of the Quran were also distributed throughout the Islamic State. In 656, Uthman was also killed, and Ali assumed the position of caliph. This led to the first civil war (the \"First Fitna\") over who should be caliph. Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. To avoid further fighting, the new caliph Hasan ibn Ali signed a peace treaty, abdicating to Mu'awiyah, beginning the Umayyad dynasty, in return that he not name his own successor. These disputes over religious and political leadership would give rise to schism in the Muslim community. The majority accepted the legitimacy of the first four leaders and became known as Sunnis. A minority disagreed, and believed that only Ali and some of his descendants should rule; they became known as the Shia. Mu'awiyah appointed his son, Yazid I, as successor and after Mu'awiyah's death in 680, the \"Second Fitna\" broke out, where Husayn ibn Ali was killed at the Battle of Karbala, a significant event in Shia Islam.\n\nThe Umayyad dynasty conquered the Maghreb, the Iberian Peninsula, Narbonnese Gaul and Sindh. Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests.\n\nThe generation after the death of Muhammad but contemporaries of his companions are known as the Tabi'un, followed by the Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in. The Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz set up the influential committee, \"The Seven Fuqaha of Medina\", headed by Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Malik ibn Anas wrote one of the earliest books on Islamic jurisprudence, the Muwatta, as a consensus of the opinion of those jurists.\n\nThe descendants of Muhammad's uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib rallied discontented non-Arab converts (\"mawali\"), poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them, inaugurating the Abbasid dynasty in 750.\n\nDuring this time, the Delhi Sultanate took over northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Religious missions converted Volga Bulgaria to Islam. Many Muslims also went to China to trade, virtually dominating the import and export industry of the Song dynasty.\n\nThis era is sometimes called the \"Islamic Golden Age\". Public hospitals established during this time (called Bimaristan hospitals), are considered \"the first hospitals\" in the modern sense of the word, and issued the first medical diplomas to license doctors. The Guinness World Records recognizes the University of Al Karaouine, founded in 859, as the world's oldest degree-granting university. The doctorate is argued to date back to the licenses to teach in Islamic law schools. Standards of experimental and quantification techniques, as well as the tradition of citation, were introduced. An important pioneer in this, Ibn al-Haytham is regarded as the father of the modern scientific method and often referred to as the \"world's first true scientist\". The government paid scientists the equivalent salary of professional athletes today. It is argued that the data used by Copernicus for his heliocentric conclusions was gathered and that Al-Jahiz proposed a theory of natural selection. Ibn Sina pioneered the science of experimental medicine, and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials. His two most notable works, \"The Book of Healing\" and \"The Canon of Medicine\", were used as standard medicinal texts in the Islamic world and later in Europe. Amongst his contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases, and the introduction of clinical pharmacology. In mathematics, the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi gave his name to the concept of the algorithm, while the term algebra is derived from \"al-jabr\". Rumi wrote some of the finest Persian poetry and is still one of the best selling poets in America. Legal institutions introduced include the trust and charitable trust (Waqf).\n\nAl-Shafi'i codified a method to determine the reliability of hadith. During the early Abbasid era, the major Sunni hadith collections were compiled by scholars such as Bukhari and Muslim while major Shia hadith collections by scholars such as Al-Kulayni and Ibn Babawayh were also compiled. The Ja'fari jurisprudence was formed from the teachings of Ja'far al-Sadiq while the four Sunni Madh'habs, the Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Shafi'i, were established around the teachings of Abū Ḥanīfa, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Malik ibn Anas and al-Shafi'i respectively. In the 9th century, al-Shafi'i provided a theoretical basis for Islamic law by codifying the principles of jurisprudence in his book \"ar-Risālah\". Al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir completed the most commonly cited commentaries on the Quran, the Tafsir al-Tabari in the 9th century and the Tafsir ibn Kathir in the 14th century, respectively. Philosophers Al-Farabi and Avicenna sought to incorporate Greek principles into Islamic theology, while others like Al-Ghazali argued against them and ultimately prevailed.\n\nCaliphs such as Mamun al Rashid and Al-Mu'tasim made the mutazilite philosophy an official creed and imposed it upon Muslims to follow. Mu'tazila was a Greek influenced school of speculative theology called kalam, which refers to dialectic. Many orthodox Muslims rejected mutazilite doctrines and condemned their idea of the creation of the Quran. In inquisitions, Imam Hanbal refused to conform and was tortured and sent to an unlit Baghdad prison cell for nearly thirty months. The other branch of kalam was the Ash'ari school founded by Al-Ash'ari.\n\nSome Muslims began to question the piety of indulgence in a worldly life and emphasised poverty, humility and avoidance of sin based on renunciation of bodily desires. Ascetics such as Hasan al-Basri would inspire a movement that would evolve into Tasawwuf (Sufism). Beginning in the 13th century, Sufism underwent a transformation, largely because of efforts to legitimize and reorganize the movement by Al-Ghazali, who developed the model of the Sufi order—a community of spiritual teachers and students.\n\nThe first Muslims states independent of a unified Islamic state emerged from the Berber Revolt (739/740-743). In 930, the Ismaili group known as the Qarmatians unsuccessfully rebelled against the Abbassids, sacked Mecca and stole the Black Stone, which was eventually retrieved. The Mongol Empire put an end to the Abbassid dynasty in 1258.\n\nTwo Turkish tribes, the Karahanids and the Seljuks, converted to Islam during the 10th century, who are later subdued by the Ottomans, who share the same origin and language. It is important to note, that the following Islamic reign by the Ottomans was strongly influenced by a symbiosis between Ottoman rulers and Sufism since the beginning. According to Ottoman historiography, the legitimation of a ruler is attributed to Sheikh Edebali. Accordingly, he interpretated a dream of Osman Gazi as God's legitimation of his reign. The Mevlevi Order and the Bektashi Order had close relation to the sultans.\n\nIslam spread with Muslim trade networks and Sufi orders activity that extended into Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Malay archipelago. Under the Ottoman Empire, Islam spread to Southeast Europe. Throughout this expanse, Islam blended with local cultures everywhere, as illustrated when the prophet Mohammed showed up in Hindu epics and folklore. Conversion to Islam, however, was not a sudden abandonment of old religious practices; rather, it was typically a matter of \"assimilating Islamic rituals, cosmologies, and literatures into... local religious systems.\" The Muslims in China who were descended from earlier immigration began to assimilate by adopting Chinese names and culture while Nanjing became an important center of Islamic study.\n\nThe Turks incorporated elements of Turkish Shamanism into their new religion and became part of a new Islamic interpretation. One major change was the status of woman. Unlike Arabic traditions, the Turkic traditions were build on a matriarchal society. Turks preserved this status of woman even after conversion to Islam. Further, the Turks must have found striking similarities between the Sufi rituals and Shaman practises. However, the influence of Turkish belief was not limited to Sufism, but also to Muslims who subscribed an orthodox version of Islam in Anatolia, Central-Asia and Balkans. As a result, many (formerly) Shaman traditions were considered as genuine Islamic by average Muslims. Many shamanistic beliefs, such as the belief in sacred nature, spirits, trees and animals, even remained today.\n\nThe Muslim world was generally in political decline starting the 1800s, especially relative to the non-Muslim European powers. This decline was evident culturally; while Taqi al-Din founded an observatory in Istanbul and the Jai Singh Observatory was built in the 18th century, there was not a single Muslim-majority country with a major observatory by the twentieth century. The Reconquista, launched against Muslim principalities in Iberia, succeeded in 1492. By the 19th century the British Empire had formally ended the Mughal dynasty in India. The Ottoman Empire disintegrated after World War I and the Caliphate was abolished in 1924.\n\nThe majority and oldest group among Shia at that time, the Zaydis, named after the great grandson of Ali, the scholar Zayd ibn Ali, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as did most Sunnis. The Shia Safavid dynasty rose to power in 1501 and later conquered all of Iran. The ensuing mandatory conversion of Iran to Twelver Shia Islam for the largely Sunni population also ensured the final dominance of the Twelver sect within Shiism over the Zaidi and Ismaili sects. Nader Shah, who overthrew the Safavids, attempted to improve relations with Sunnis by propagating the integration of Shiism by calling it the Jaafari Madh'hab.\n\nA revival movement during this period was an 18th-century Salafi movement led by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in today's Saudi Arabia. Referred to as Wahhabi, their self-designation is Muwahiddun (unitarians). Building upon earlier efforts such as those by Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim, the movement allegedly seeks to uphold monotheism and purify Islam of what they see as later innovations. Their zeal against idolatrous shrines led to the desecration of shrines around the world, including that of Muhammad and his companions in Mecca and Medina. In the 19th century, the Deobandi and Barelwi movements were initiated.\n\nAhle Sunnat movement or more popularly known as Barelwi movement emphasize the primacy of Islamic law over adherence to Sufi practices and personal devotion to the prophet Muhammad. It grew from the writings of muhaddith and jurist Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri, Allama Fazle Haq Khairabadi,\nShah Ahmad Noorani and Mohammad Abdul Ghafoor Hazarvi in the backdrop of an intellectual and moral decline of Muslims in British India. The movement was a mass movement, defending popular Sufism and reforming its practices, grew in response to the radical Deobandi movement in South Asia and the Wahhabi movement elsewhere.\nThe movement opposed Ahmadiyya Movement and is famous for the celebration of Mawlid. Today the movement is spread across the globe with followers in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, South Africa, United States, and UK among other countries. The movement now has over 200 million followers.\n\nContact with industrialized nations brought Muslim populations to new areas through economic migration. Many Muslims migrated as indentured servants, from mostly India and Indonesia, to the Caribbean, forming the largest Muslim populations by percentage in the Americas. The resulting urbanization and increase in trade in sub-Saharan Africa brought Muslims to settle in new areas and spread their faith, likely doubling its Muslim population between 1869 and 1914. Muslim immigrants began arriving, many as guest workers and largely from former colonies, in several Western European nations since the 1960s.\n\nThere are more and more new Muslim intellectuals who increasingly separate perennial Islamic beliefs from archaic cultural traditions. Liberal Islam is a movement that attempts to reconcile religious tradition with modern norms of secular governance and human rights. Its supporters say that there are multiple ways to read Islam's sacred texts, and they stress the need to leave room for \"independent thought on religious matters\".\nWomen's issues receive significant weight in the modern discourse on Islam.\n\nSecular powers such as the Chinese Red Guards closed many mosques and destroyed Qurans, and Communist Albania became the first country to ban the practice of every religion. About half a million Muslims were killed in Cambodia by communists who, it is argued, viewed them as their primary enemy and wished to exterminate them since they stood out and worshipped their own god. In Turkey, the military carried out coups to oust Islamist governments, and headscarves were banned in official buildings, as also happened in Tunisia.\n\nJamal-al-Din al-Afghani, along with his acolyte Muhammad Abduh, have been credited as forerunners of the Islamic revival. Abul A'la Maududi helped influence modern political Islam. Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood advocate Islam as a comprehensive political solution, often in spite of being banned. In Iran, revolution replaced a secular regime with an Islamic state. In Turkey, the Islamist AK Party has democratically been in power for about a decade, while Islamist parties did well in elections following the Arab Spring. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), consisting of Muslim-majority countries, was established in 1969 after the burning of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nPiety appears to be deepening worldwide. In many places, the prevalence of the hijab is growing increasingly common and the percentage of Muslims favoring Sharia laws has increased. With religious guidance increasingly available electronically, Muslims are able to access views that are strict enough for them rather than rely on state clerics who are often seen as stooges.\n\nIt is estimated that, by 2050, the number of Muslims will nearly equal the number of Christians around the world, \"driven primarily by differences in fertility rates and the size of youth populations among the world's major religions, as well as by people switching faiths.\" Perhaps as a sign of these changes, most experts agree that Islam is growing faster than any other faith in East and West Africa.\n\nThe largest denomination in Islam is Sunni Islam, which makes up 75%–90% of all Muslims and is arguably the world's largest religious denomination. Sunni Muslims also go by the name \"Ahl as-Sunnah\" which means \"people of the tradition [of Muhammad]\".\n\nSunnis believe that the first four caliphs were the rightful successors to Muhammad; since God did not specify any particular leaders to succeed him and those leaders were elected. Sunnis believe that anyone who is righteous and just could be a caliph but they have to act according to the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad and give the people their rights.\n\nThe Sunnis follow the Quran and the Hadith, which are recorded in sunni traditions known as Al-Kutub Al-Sittah (six major books). For legal matters derived from the Quran or the Hadith, many follow four sunni madh'habs (schools of thought): Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Shafi'i. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim may choose any one that he or she finds agreeable. Ahl al-Hadith is a movement that deemphasized sources of jurisprudence outside the quran and hadith, such as informed opinion (ra'y).\n\nThe Salafi movement claim to take the first three generations of Muslims, known as the salaf, as exemplary models.\nIn the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab led a salafi movement, referred by outsiders as Wahhabism, in modern-day Saudi Arabia. The Deobandi movement is a reformist movement originating in South Asia, influenced by the Wahhabi movement.\n\nThe Shia constitute 10–20% of Islam and are its second-largest branch.\n\nWhile the Sunnis believe that a Caliph should be elected by the community, Shia's believe that Muhammad appointed his son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, as his successor and only certain descendants of Ali could be Imams. As a result, they believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was the first \"Imam\" (leader), rejecting the legitimacy of the previous Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr, Uthman ibn al-Affan and Umar ibn al-Khattab. Other points of contention include certain practices viewed as innovating the religion, such as the mourning practice of tatbir, and the cursing of figures revered by Sunnis. However, Jafar al-Sadiq himself disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr and Zayd ibn Ali revered Abu Bakr and Umar. More recently, Ali Khamenei and Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the practice.\n\nShia Islam has several branches, the most prominent being the Twelvers (the largest branch), Zaidis and Ismailis. Different branches accept different descendants of Ali as Imams. After the death of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq who is considered the sixth Imam by the Twelvers and the Ismaili's, the Ismailis recognized his son Isma'il ibn Jafar as his successor whereas the Twelver Shia's (Ithna Asheri) followed his other son Musa al-Kadhim as the seventh Imam. The Zaydis consider Zayd ibn Ali, the uncle of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, as their fifth Imam, and follow a different line of succession after him. Other smaller groups include the Bohra as well as the Alawites and Alevi. Some Shia branches label other Shia branches that do not agree with their doctrine as Ghulat.\n\nSufism, or tasawwuf (), is a mystical-ascetic approach to Islam that seeks to find a direct personal experience of God. It is not a sect of Islam and its adherents belong to the various Muslim denominations. Classical Sufi scholars have focused on the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God by making use of \"intuitive and emotional faculties\" that one must be trained to use. Hasan al-Basri was inspired by the ideas of piety and condemnation of worldliness preached by Muhammad and these ideas were later developed by the influential theologian Al-Ghazali. Traditional Sufis, such as Bayazid Bastami, Jalaluddin Rumi, Haji Bektash Veli, Junaid Baghdadi, and Al-Ghazali, argued for Sufism being based upon the tenets of Islam and the teachings of the prophet. Sufi practices such as veneration of saints have faced stiff opposition from followers of Salafism and Wahhabism, who have sometimes physically attacked Sufi places of worship, leading to deterioration in Sufi–Salafi relations.\n\nThe Barelvi movement is a Sufi-influenced revivalist movement within Sunni Islam with over 200 million followers, largely in South Asia. Sufism enjoyed a strong revival in central Asia and South Asia. Central Asia is considered to be a center of Sufism. Sufism has played a significant role in fighting against Tsars of Russia and Soviet colonization. Here, Sufis and their different orders are the main religious sources. Sufism is also strong in African countries such as Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Chad and Niger.\n\n\nNon-denominational Muslims is an umbrella term that has been used for and by Muslims who do not belong to or do not self-identify with a specific Islamic denomination. Prominent figures who refused to identify with a particular Islamic denomination have included Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Recent surveys report that large proportions of Muslims in some parts of the world self-identify as \"just Muslim\", although there is little published analysis available regarding the motivations underlying this response. The Pew Research Center reports that respondents self-identifying as \"just Muslim\" make up a majority of Muslims in seven countries (and a plurality in three others), with the highest proportion in Kazakhstan at 74%. At least one in five Muslims in at least 22 countries self-identify in this way.\n\nSome movements, such as the Druze, Berghouata and Ha-Mim, either emerged from Islam or came to share certain beliefs with Islam and whether each is separate a religion or a sect of Islam is sometimes controversial. Yazdânism is seen as a blend of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to Kurdistan by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir in the 12th century. Bábism stems from Twelver Shia passed through Siyyid 'Ali Muhammad i-Shirazi al-Bab while one of his followers Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri Baha'u'llah founded the Bahai Faith. Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak in late-fifteenth-century Punjab, incorporates aspects of both Islam and Hinduism. African American Muslim movements include the Nation of Islam, Five-Percent Nation and Moorish scientists.\n\nA comprehensive 2015 demographic study of 232 countries and territories reported that 24.1% of the global population, or 1.8 billion people, are Muslims. Of those, it is estimated that over 75–90% are Sunni and 10–20% are Shia with a small minority belonging to other sects. Approximately 57 countries are Muslim-majority, and Arabs account for around 20% of all Muslims worldwide. The number of Muslims worldwide increased from 200 million in 1900 to 551 million in 1970, and tripled to 1.8 billion by 2015.\n\nThe majority of Muslims live in Asia and Africa. Approximately 62% of the world's Muslims live in Asia, with over 683 million adherents in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In the Middle East, non-Arab countries such as Turkey and Iran are the largest Muslim-majority countries; in Africa, Egypt and Nigeria have the most populous Muslim communities.\n\nMost estimates indicate that the China has approximately 20 to 30 million Muslims (1.5% to 2% of the population). However, data provided by the San Diego State University's International Population Center to \"U.S. News & World Report\" suggests that China has 65.3 million Muslims. Islam is the second largest religion after Christianity in many European countries, and is slowly catching up to that status in the Americas, with between 2,454,000, according to Pew Forum, and approximately 7 million Muslims, according to the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), in the United States.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Islam is set to equal Christianity worldwide in number of adherents by the year 2050. Islam is set to grow faster than any other major world religion, reaching a total number of 2.76 billion (an increase of 73%). Causes of this trend involve high fertility rates as a factor, with Muslims having a rate of 3.1 compared to the world average of 2.5, and the minimum replacement level for a population at 2.1. Another factor is also due to fact that Islam has the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (34% of the total religion) of any major religion, compared with Christianity's 27%. 60% of Muslims are between the ages of 16 and 59, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). Countries such as Nigeria and the Republic of Macedonia are expected to have Muslim majorities by 2050. In India, the Muslim population will be larger than any other country. Europe's non-Muslim population is set to decline as opposed to their Muslim population which is set to grow to 10% of Europe's total. Growth rates of Islam in Europe was due primarily to immigration and higher birth rates of Muslims in 2005.\n\nThe term \"Islamic culture\" could be used to mean aspects of culture that pertain to the religion, such as festivals and dress code. It is also controversially used to denote the cultural aspects of traditionally Muslim people. Finally, \"Islamic civilization\" may also refer to the aspects of the synthesized culture of the early Caliphates, including that of non-Muslims, sometimes referred to as \"Islamicate\".\n\nPerhaps the most important expression of Islamic architecture is that of the mosque. Varying cultures have an effect on mosque architecture. For example, North African and Spanish Islamic architecture such as the Great Mosque of Kairouan contain marble and porphyry columns from Roman and Byzantine buildings, while mosques in Indonesia often have multi-tiered roofs from local Javanese styles.\n\nIslamic art encompasses the visual arts produced from the 7th century onwards by people (not necessarily Muslim) who lived within the territory that was inhabited by Muslim populations. It includes fields as varied as architecture, calligraphy, painting, and ceramics, among others.\n\nWhile not condemned in the Quran, making images of human beings and animals is frowned on in many Islamic cultures and connected with laws against idolatry common to all Abrahamic religions, as 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood reported that Muhammad said, \"Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers\" (reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/382). However this rule has been interpreted in different ways by different scholars and in different historical periods, and there are examples of paintings of both animals and humans in Mughal, Persian and Turkish art. The existence of this aversion to creating images of animate beings has been used to explain the prevalence of calligraphy, tessellation and pattern as key aspects of Islamic artistic culture.\n\nThe formal beginning of the Muslim era was chosen, reportedly by Caliph Umar, to be the Hijra in 622 CE, which was an important turning point in Muhammad's fortunes. It is a lunar calendar with days lasting from sunset to sunset. Islamic holy days fall on fixed dates of the lunar calendar, which means that they occur in different seasons in different years in the Gregorian calendar. The most important Islamic festivals are \"Eid al-Fitr\" () on the 1st of \"Shawwal\", marking the end of the fasting month \"Ramadan\", and \"Eid al-Adha\" () on the 10th of \"Dhu al-Hijjah\", coinciding with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nCriticism of Islam has existed since Islam's formative stages. Early criticism came from Christian authors, many of whom viewed Islam as a Christian heresy or a form of idolatry and often explained it in apocalyptic terms. Later there appeared criticism from the Muslim world itself, and also from Jewish writers and from ecclesiastical Christians.\n\nObjects of criticism include the morality of the life of Muhammad, the last law bearing prophet of Islam, both in his public and personal life, as seen in medieval Christian views on Muhammad. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the Quran, the Islamic holy book, are also discussed by critics.\n\nOther criticisms focus on the question of human rights in modern Muslim-majority countries, and the treatment of women in Islamic law and practice. In wake of the recent multiculturalism trend, Islam's influence on the ability of Muslim immigrants in the West to assimilate has been criticized.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21224219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21224219", "title": "John Calvin bibliography", "text": "John Calvin bibliography\n\nThe French Reformer John Calvin (1509–1564) was a theological writer who produced many sermons, biblical commentaries, letters, theological treatises, and other works. Although nearly all of Calvin's adult life was spent in Geneva (1536–38 and 1541–64), his publications spread his ideas of a properly reformed church to many parts of Europe and from there to the rest of the world. It is especially on account of his voluminous publications that he exerts such a lasting influence over Christianity and Western history.\n\nCalvin's first published work was an edition of the Roman philosopher Seneca's \"De Clementia\", accompanied by a commentary demonstrating a thorough knowledge of antiquity. His first theological work, the \"Psychopannychia\", attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by Christians whom Calvin called \"Anabaptists.\" He finished it in 1534 but, on the advice of friends, didn't publish it until 1542. The work demonstrates that since his conversion, Calvin had undertaken serious study and now showed a mastery of the Bible, and he had become, using Karl Barth's words, a \"theological Humanist\" and a \"biblicist\" — that is, \"no matter how true a teaching might be, he was not ready to lend an ear to it apart from the Word of God.\"\n\nAt the age of twenty-six, Calvin published the first edition of his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" (Latin title: \"Institutio Christianae Religionis\"), a seminal work in Christian theology that is still read by theological students today. It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of church and sacraments to justification by faith alone and Christian liberty, and it vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered unorthodox, particularly Roman Catholicism to which Calvin says he had been \"strongly devoted\" before his conversion to Protestantism. The overarching theme of the book – and Calvin's greatest theological legacy – is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in salvation and election.\n\nCalvin also produced many volumes of commentary on most of the books of the Bible. For the Old Testament, he published commentaries for all books except the histories after Joshua (though he did publish his sermons on First Samuel) and the Wisdom literature other than the Book of Psalms. For the New Testament, he omitted only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation. These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.\n\nCalvin also wrote more than 1,300 letters on a wide range of topics.\n\nCalvin developed his theology, the most enduring component of his thought, in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, and he gave the most concise expression of his views on Christian theology in his \"magnum opus\", the \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\". The various editions of that work span nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's \"Loci Communes\". In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the \"Institutes\" appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.\n\nCalvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on Romans was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire New Testament. However, it took six years before he wrote his second, a commentary on I Corinthians. He did not lose any more time in reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the Pauline epistles, and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then turned his attention on the general epistles, dedicating them to Edward VI of England. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the Acts and the Gospels (he did omit only the brief second and third Epistles of John and the Book of Revelation).\n\nFor the Old Testament, he wrote commentaries on Isaiah, the books of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Joshua. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he would re-work for publication. However, from 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These \"Praelectiones\" covered the minor prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and part of Ezekiel.\n\nIn the controversial matter of interpreting prophecy such as that in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, which is to say that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the early church and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view. Calvin is also in distinction to many of his later successors who look a future fulfillment.\n\nDutch theologian Jacobus Arminius, after whom the anti-Calvinistic movement Arminianism was named, says with regard to the value of Calvin's writings:\n\nThese commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.\n\nCalvin's body of letters has not received the wide readership of the \"Institutes\" and bible commentaries since his correspondence obviously addressed the particular needs and occasions of his day. Even so, the scale of his letter writing was just as prodigious as his better-known works: his letters number some 1,300, and, along with some 3,000 letters written to him, fill eleven of Calvin's fifty-nine volumes in the \"Corpus Reformatorum\". B. B. Warfield calls Calvin \"the great letter-writer of the Reformation age.\"\n\nHis letters, often written under the pseudonym Charles d'Espeville, concern issues ranging from disputes about local theater to raising support for fledgling churches to choosing sides in a political alliance. They also reveal personal qualities that are not evident in his exegetical prose. One example came after the massacre of the Waldensians of Provence in 1545 where 3,600 were slaughtered. Calvin was so dismayed that in a space of twenty-one days he visited Berne, Aurich, Schaffhausen, Basle, and Strasbourg, before addressing the deputies of the Cantons at the Diet of Arau, pleading everywhere for an intercession on behalf of those who survived. He wrote of his grief to William Farel:\n\nOne of Calvin's better known letters was his reply to Jacopo Sadoleto's \"Letter to the Genevans,\" and this \"Reformation Debate\" remains in print today.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written \"under seal\" by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removed the need for consideration in contract law). However, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect.\n\nWith the onset of the Internet and electronic equipment such as the personal computers and cell-phones, legal instruments or formal legal documents have undergone a progressive change of dematerialisation. In this electronic age, document authentication can now be verified digitally using various software. All documents needing authentication can be processed as digital documents with all the necessary information such as date and time stamp imbedded. To prevent tampering or unauthorized changes to the original document, encryption is used. In modern times, authentication is no longer limited to the type of paper used, the specialized seal, stamps, etc., as document authentication software helps secure the original context. The use of electronic legal documents is most prominent in the United States' courts. Most United States' courts prefer the filing of electronic legal documents over paper. However, there is not yet a public law to unify the different standards of document authentication. Therefore, one must know the court's requirement before filing court papers. \n\nTo address part of this concern, the United States Congress enacted the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act in 2000 (P.L. 106-229 of 2000, 15 USCS sec. 7001) specifying that no court could thereafter fail to recognize a contract simply because it was digitally signed. The law is very permissive, making essentially any electronic character in a contract sufficient. It is also quite restrictive in that it does not force the recognition of some document types in electronic form, no matter what the electronic character might be. No restriction is made to signatures which are adequately cryptographically tied to both the document text (see message digest) and to a particular key whose use should be restricted to certain persons (e.g., the alleged sender). There is thus a gap between what the cryptographic engineering can provide and what the law assumes is both possible and meaningful. \n\nSeveral states had already enacted laws on the subject of electronic legal documents and signatures before the U.S. Congress had acted, including Utah, Washington, and California to name only a few of the earliest. They vary considerably in intent, coverage, cryptographic understanding, and effect. \n\nSeveral other nations and international bodies have also enacted statutes and regulations regarding the validity and binding nature of digital signatures. \nand with the signatures at the bottom.\n\nTo date, the variety (and inadequacy) of the definitions used for digital signatures (or electronic signatures) have produced a legal and contractual minefield for those who may be considering relying on the legality and enforceability of digitally signed contracts in any of many jurisdictions. Adequate legislation adequately informed by cryptographic engineering technology remains an elusive goal. That it has been fully, or adequately, achieved (in any jurisdiction) is a claim which must be taken with considerable caution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37381055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37381055", "title": "Let's Go (book series)", "text": "Let's Go (book series)\n\nLet's Go is a travel guide series researched, written, edited, and run entirely by students at Harvard University. The first of the budget/backpacker-oriented travel guides, \"Let's Go\" promotes itself as \"the student travel guide\" but is aimed at readers \"both young and young at heart\". \"Let's Go\" was founded in 1960 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe first Let's Go guide was a 25-page mimeographed pamphlet put together by an 18-year-old Harvard freshman named Oliver Koppell and handed out on student charter flights to Europe; the first professionally published guide was issued in 1961. Early guides tended to be freewheeling—for example, advising travelers on motorbiking through Southeast Asia in the late 1960s and financing travel in Europe by singing in the street. The first edition described how to travel from Europe to Asia on just four cents: by taking the ferry across the Bosphorus, from the European to the Asian side of the city of Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nAs the guide became more popular throughout the 1960s, increasing quantities were printed every year. Let's Go also commissioned an artist, Richard Copaken, to give the series a logo: its trademark hot-air balloon. (That other Let's Go logo, the hitchhiker thumb, did not appear until 1973.) Maps and a \"general introduction\" section (the \"Before You Go\" of modern guidebooks) were added, and the venture went national. Sales skyrocketed after Let's Go Business Manager Andrew Tobias promoted the books on the \"Today\" show in 1966.\n\nThe company's success inspired it to produce spin-off titles in the late 1960s. One of Let's Go's most irreverent titles, \"Let's Go II: The Student Guide to Adventure\", covered \"exotic\" destinations such as \"Red China\" and wrote in its Vietnam chapter, \"Just about no one \"wants\" to go to Vietnam these days. Most Americans who do travel there go with the army and leave as soon as they can.\" Additional one-offs for budget travelers included \"Let's Go: The Student Guide to America\" and \"Let's Go: Caribbean\".\n\nIn 1971, Let's Go became weary of self-publishing (i.e., \"cutting and pasting on Oliver's living-room floor\") and signed on with publisher E.P. Dutton. At this time, Let's Go's only title remained the original flagship \"Let's Go: Europe\". The book's popularity, however, caused its staff to consider additional titles. The first permanent new guide, \"Let's Go: Britain and Ireland\", was published in 1976. After excellent sales, \"Let's Go: France\" and \"Let's Go: Italy\" soon followed. All four were updated every year thereafter. Indeed, for much of its history, Let's Go was the only travel guide to update each of its titles every single year.\n\nLet's Go continued expanding as it added further European titles as well as a new, permanent book on domestic travel. In 1982, Let's Go signed a contract with new publisher St. Martin's Press to publish its roster of six titles. By 1985, Let's Go was publishing 10 books a year, including \"Let's Go: Mexico\", the first new title not written from previously existing content. In 1986, 440,000 copies of Let's Go books were printed and sold in dozens of countries within three months of being researched—a new industry record.\n\nBy the 1990s, Let's Go branched out into city-specific guidebooks, allowing expansion to continue at a rate of multiple new guidebooks per year. Around this time, Let's Go earned some of its most famous monikers, including \"the granddaddy of budget guides\" (the New York Times) and \"the Bible of the budget traveler\" (the Boston Globe). At 15 titles in 1992, the student-run company emphasizing travel on a budget had become one of the largest travel guides in the world.\n\nIn 1996, Let's Go launched its website, Letsgo.com, while publishing 22 titles and a new line of mini map guides. By this time, Let's Go had branched out beyond just Europe (its traditional turf) and North America to Africa and Asia, as well. The company's first South American guide, \"Let's Go: Ecuador and the Galapagos\", came in 1997 as the 24th title. \"Let's Go: Australia\" and \"Let's Go: New Zealand\" followed the next year, putting Let's Go on every continent but Antarctica.\n\nInto the 2000s, the physical books evolved as well, with updated covers, new editorial features like a \"Price Diversity\" scale, and photos in the guides for the first time. The company was still expanding at a breakneck speed, from 30 titles in 2000 to 33 in 2001, 37 in 2002, 41 in 2003, 45 in 2004, and 48 in 2005. At this point, Let's Go employed over 200 students every year.\n\nLet's Go also expanded its web presence dramatically in this decade. The company profited from strong online advertising and partnerships and gradually populated its website with blogs, podcasts, and videos. In 2008, a redesigned website was unveiled that made Let's Go the first travel guide to offer all of its book content online free of charge. Let's Go has also brought its content to smartphones and tablets as well: since 2011, its guidebooks have also been available for download as e-books, and the company has released dozens of free, destination-specific mobile apps, with more in the works. The Let's Go Travel Guides App has been rated as \"a must have brilliant app\".\n\nLet's Go also announced a new print publisher, Avalon Travel, upon the expiration of its contract with St. Martin's Press in 2009. The switch led to a new format for the insides of the books, new retro covers for the outsides, and a rebranding to emphasize Let's Go's student origins. The theme has been changed in 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2009. In 2014, Let's Go began self-publishing for the first time since 1970.\n\nAs a subsidiary of Harvard Student Agencies, Let's Go's charter states that the company may only employ degree-seeking Harvard students; because of this, Let's Go's business model is unique among publishers. Every year, a student management team is chosen from the previous year's staff. This core group works out of Let's Go's Cambridge offices all year round on the company's website, publicity, and editorial matters. Over the winter, the management team hires a staff of Editors, who in turn hire the company's traveling Researcher-Writers. Editors work part-time throughout the spring semester to prepare and train Researcher-Writers for their trips. After the semester ends, the Researcher-Writers leave Cambridge for their destination, while the Editors begin working full-time at the Cambridge office. Researcher-Writers, traveling alone, typically spend from six to eight weeks of their summer (June–July) on the road, visiting the assigned establishments in their assigned cities and sending raw copy back to Cambridge. In order to keep the writing true to the budget heritage of the series, Researcher-Writers are paid a daily stipend intended to cover only basic expenses (although Let's Go does cover airfare to and from their destination). Meanwhile, Editors work throughout the entire summer, aiding the Researcher-Writers and editing the copy. The guides are assembled from the edited copy in August and September, and are released in bookstores the following winter—just as the publishing process for the next year's guides has begun.\n\nLet's Go has used many words to describe the style of its content. \"Witty and irreverent\" is possibly the most frequently used descriptor; the company takes pride in its youthful, casual, sometimes zany tone and trains its writers to avoid \"brochure-ese\". Let's Go also promotes the unvarnished opinions of its reviews, stating that they want the takeaway of every single listing, good or bad, to be clear to the reader. This honesty led to a lawsuit against Let's Go in 1990 as a result of a scathing review of an Israeli hostel, but the travel guide was victorious in court, upheld by the judges as \"the modern equivalents of Thomas Paine or John Peter Zenger.\" Other traits the company has emphasized include its budget roots and social consciousness.\n\nAs of the 2017 series of guidebooks, Let's Go has published 75 titles covering six continents. The books range from country guides to adventure, city, budget, and road trip guides, many of which are still updated annually. Let's Go has also published 20 abridged, pocket-sized \"map guides\" (Amsterdam, Berlin, Boston, Chicago, Dublin, Florence, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, New Orleans, New York City, Paris, Prague, Rome, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney, Venice, and Washington DC), though these have been discontinued.\n\nBecause Let's Go employees are all students when working for the travel guide, many of its alumni have gone on to distinguished careers in travel writing and other areas.\n\n\nThere have been references (in a non-review/article context) to Let's Go in:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Statutes of Kilkenny, 1366, complained that\n\" ... now many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies\".\n\nThe phrase (in Latin) was used by the Irish priest and historian John Lynce (c1599–1677) in his work \"Cambrensis Eversus\". He was strongly influenced by the writings of the historian Geoffrey Keating (1569 – c. 1644), whose \"History of Ireland\" he translated into Latin. \"Cambrensis Eversus\" was translated from the Latin, with notes and observations, by Theophilus O'Flanagan, Dublin, 1795.\n\nJohn Henry Wilson, in his \"Sketch of Jonathan Swift\" (1804), wrote that Swift used the phrase (\"Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis\") in a discussion with his landlord.\n\nThe phrase remained in use by romantic nineteenth-century nationalists to promote the common Irishness of 'Planter and Gael'. An example is found in the 1844 poem by the Young Irelander, Thomas Davis called 'The Geraldines', which concerns the FitzGerald dynasty:\n\nThe phrase remains in common use, both colloquially and in the media, in reference to recent immigration and assimilation in Ireland, and to some degree about some of the Irish diaspora (for example in \"The Irish Times\", Senator Jim Walsh, Liam Twomey, or \"Irish Emigrant\") or in conversation discussing the relationship between the cultural heritage of the Irish diaspora and the Irish in Ireland. While still echoing its original meaning, contemporary usage of the phrase usually takes a more open interpretation of assimilation or, in the case of the diaspora, the maintenance of Irish heritage.\n\nDebates of the Oireachtas demonstrate the age and range of contemporary applications of the phrase. Either when discussing the diaspora:\nOr, more light-heartedly, on assimilation:\nHowever, S. J. Connolly has written, \"The descendents of the English conquerors, it was confidently proclaimed, had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves'. Today it is recognized that the supposedly contemporary phrase dates only from the late eighteenth century, the Latin form (\"Hiberniores ipsis Hibernis\") sometimes used to give it an authentic medieval ring from later still.\"\n\n"}

Nehemiah Strong (24 February 1729 (N.S.) – 13 August 1807) was an American astronomer and meteorologist who was the first Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Yale College from 1770 and produced a series of annual ephemerides, the astronomical element in almanacs, which were printed in Hartford, Connecticut, and in New Haven.\n\nStrong was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, eldest of three children of Nehemiah and Hannah Strong and the grandson of Samuel and Esther (Clapp) Strong, of Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\nNehemiah Strong graduated from Yale College in 1755. He entered on a tutorship at Yale in November 1757 and was soon licensed to preach and was settled Congregationalist minister at Turkey Hill, now part of East Granby, Connecticut, 1761-67.\n\nHis marriage to Lydia Smith proved to be an embarrassment, when after she had been granted a divorce in February 1759 on grounds of abandonment, her husband, Andrew Burr Jr of New Haven, having gone to the West Indies in January 1755, Burr reappeared and her marriage to Nehemiah Strong was necessarily annulled, and as a result of entanglements he was dismissed from his pastorate at Turkey Hill, 23 June 1767. He married Mrs Mary Thomas, the widow of Dr Lemuel Thomas of Newtown, 15 June 1778.\n\nThereafter he resided in Newtown, in New Milford, where he kept an academy for boys, and, from 1803 in Bridgeport, giving occasional sermons and teaching to the time of his death. He resigned his chair at Yale in 1781, in a dispute over his salary, exacerbated by the sense on the part of the Corporation that he was not a sufficiently ardent Patriot. He represented Newtown in the Connecticut General Assembly, May 1784. His portrait by Ralph Earl, painted in 1789-90, was presented to Yale by the artist and remains in the University's collection.\n\nHis treatise on astronomy won him such a wide reputation that anonymous almanacs were attributed to him. His first essay at compiling an almanac was anonymous, for \"Watson's Register\" for 1775, printed at Hartford; his second essay was \"The Connecticut Almanack\" for 1778, which identified his Yale title only. From 1782 he published almanacs under his own name at Hartford and as \"Hosea Stafford\" in New Haven (1776–1804). In addition, finding that he was publicly assumed to be the \"Isaac Bickerstaff\", having disclaimed authorship in a letter to the \"Connecticut Journal\", New Haven, 27 October 1784, he apparently decided to take up the slack and issue almanacs as \"Bickerstaff\" himself: they appeared at Hartford for several years after 1785.\n\nIn a letter of 6 May 1803 to Elisha Babcock, Strong remarks that the calculations for the forthcoming year will be his last:\nHe recommended his pupil David Sanford of Newtown, Connecticut.\n"}

He graduated from officer candidate school in 1942 and earned a commission in the 121st Infantry Regiment of the 8th Infantry Division. Boesch deployed to Europe with his unit after the D-Day landings to take part in the offensive against Nazi Germany. As commanding officer of Company G, 1st Lt. Boesch led his rifle company in one of the bloodiest and most desperate battles of the war on the Western Front, the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. His unit took heavy casualties during the fighting, and Boesch himself was seriously injured by a German artillery shell. For his service, Boesch was awarded numerous decorations, including the Purple Heart, the Silver Star with oak leaf clusters, the Bronze Star with oak leaf clusters, and the French Croix de Guerre with star. He also earned the prized Combat Infantryman Badge and the Distinguished Unit Citation, awarded to the soldiers of the 121st Infantry for their meritorious efforts in the Hürtgen Forest. After the war, he was honored with a Distinguished Citizens Award from the 121st Infantry Association for his outstanding community service with charitable groups including the Boys Club of America. Boesch authored a well-regarded memoir of his experiences in World War II entitled, \"Road to Huertgen: Forest in Hell\".\n\nAfter World War II, Boesch returned to wrestling, competing in matches across North America. In 1947 he was injured in a car accident, forcing him to retire from competition. It was at this time that Houston Wrestling promoter Morris Sigel approached him to work for his growing Texas organization. Boesch became an advisor to Sigel as well as a radio announcer, and two years later became the promotion's first television commentator when the show debuted on local television. Boesch's wrestling broadcasts remained a fixture on Houston television for over 30 years, airing on station KHTV channel 39 (now KIAH, a CW Network affiliate).\n\nAfter Sigel died in 1966, Boesch bought out Houston Wrestling from Sigel's widow. Boesch had essentially been training for this opportunity for 20 years, and he quickly brought the organization to new levels of success and visibility. Under Boesch’s leadership, Houston Wrestling quickly attained gained a reputation as one of the top regional wrestling promotions of its time. Promoters such as Gary Hart (World Class Championship Wrestling) and wrestlers such as Barry Darsow would repeatedly praise Boesch's acumen and honesty as a promoter and businessman. Boesch is also credited with the invention of mud wrestling, a concept he devised for a major match between Gus Sonnenberg and Harnam Singh in Seattle, Washington.\n\nTogether with his nephew Peter Birkholz, Boesch entered Houston Wrestling into affiliations with Mid South Wrestling, World Wrestling Federation, Universal Wrestling Federation, and World Class Championship Wrestling to ensure that top talent from all over the country would appear on his weekly Friday Night shows. As professional wrestling became a major entertainment business in the 1980s, most of Boesch's affiliates joined the National Wrestling Alliance. Boesch eventually shut down Houston Wrestling in favor of signing with Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation, an affiliation that lasted only four months.\n\nAfter 55 years of working in the industry as a wrestler, announcer, and promoter, Paul Boesch retired on August 28, 1987 due to health concerns. The now-WWE hosted the Paul Boesch Retirement Show in Houston in his honor, which drew a sell-out crowd to the Sam Houston Coliseum. During the show, personal friend and then-Vice President George Bush had a telegram delivered praising Boesch for his lifelong commitment to service.\n\nBoesch died on March 7, 1989 after suffering a heart attack in Sugar Land, Texas. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame as a charter member in 1996. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2005 as a non-wrestler participant in the business.\n\nPaul Boesch's contribution to the wrestling industry has been praised by numerous observers as well as by former wrestlers themselves. WWE commentator Jim Ross has publicly stated that he believes Boesch is worthy of enshrinement in the WWE Hall of Fame. The Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame states that \"his influence in professional wrestling cannot be overestimated\" due to his expansive promotion of the sport throughout Texas. Through his efforts, Boesch turned Houston into one of the top promotions on the regional wrestling circuit. In addition to his professional accomplishments, Boesch was active in numerous philanthropic endeavors throughout his life. He was a highly visible fixture in the community during his many years in Houston, serving in charitable organizations like the Boys Club and promoting the benefits and necessity of physical fitness for America's youth. To generations of Houstonians and Texans in general, Boesch was the face of professional wrestling.\n\nDuring his life, Boesch wrote four books:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "533563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533563", "title": "Pearls Before Swine (comics)", "text": "Pearls Before Swine (comics)\n\nPearls Before Swine, (also known as Pearls) is an American comic strip written and illustrated by Stephan Pastis. It chronicles the daily lives of five anthropomorphic animals: a Pig, a Rat, a Zebra, a Goat, and a fraternity of crocodiles, as well as a number of supporting characters. Each character represents an aspect of Pastis' own personality and world view. The daily and Sunday comic strip is distributed by Universal Uclick (by United Media's United Feature Syndicate before 2011).\n\nThe strip's style is most notable for its dark humor, breaking of the fourth wall, mockery of other comic strips and stories concocted in elaborate fashion leading into a pun.\n\nPrior to creating \"Pearls Before Swine\", Pastis worked as a lawyer in California. Bored in his law school classes, Pastis started to doodle a rat, eventually casting it in a non-syndicated comic strip which he titled \"Rat\". The title character of Rat would later become one of the main characters in \"Pearls Before Swine\". Pastis continued to draw comics; the character Pig came from a failed strip titled \"The Infirm\".\n\nIn 1999, Pastis first submitted \"Pearls Before Swine\" to syndicates. Several expressed interest and three accepted it, but they could not convince their sales staff that it was marketable. However, Amy Lago, an editor at United Media, saw the strip's potential and launched it on the United Media website in November 2000, to see what kind of response it would generate. Pastis recalled in 2009,\n\"Pearls Before Swine\" debuted in 2000 as a website strip under United Feature Syndicate. When Scott Adams, creator of \"Dilbert\" and supporter of the strip, told his fans about \"Pearls Before Swine\", interest skyrocketed, and the strip was taken to print. Aiding Pastis in the artistic elements of the strip was Darby Conley, creator of the comic strip \"Get Fuzzy\".\n\nUnited Feature Syndicate launched the strip in newspapers on December 31, 2001 in \"The Washington Post\". On January 7, 2002, \"Pearls\" was running in approximately 150 papers. Since 2011, the strip has been appearing in 750 newspapers worldwide. \n\n\"Pearls\" style and humor are inspired by several comic strips, chiefly \"Peanuts\", \"Dilbert\", \"Calvin and Hobbes\", \"Bloom County\" and \"The Far Side\". Pastis has drawn tributes to these influences in his strip. When asked in an interview about whether his profession as an attorney inspired the humor in the comic, he said, \"I was very unhappy as a lawyer, and humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness... if you dislike what you’re doing to the extent that I did, it gives you the impetus to get out.\"\n\nCartoonist Darby Conley, creator of \"Get Fuzzy\", helped teach Pastis the technical aspects of cartooning. The two remain friends, sometimes poking fun at each other in their strips.\n\nRat (debut: December 30, 2001) is a narcissistic, misanthropic rat, the antihero of the comic strip. He frequently breaks the fourth wall.\n\nRat is an insensitive character in the strip, whose interactions with others are typically sarcastic, condescending, self-centered, insulting and often violent. In particular, he will frequently berate his creator on the general quality of the strip. Often self-employed, most of his businesses involve either punishing or defrauding people for their ignorance, much in the same vein as Dogbert, though with darker humor. His political views are right-wing, especially in foreign policy.\n\nRat's short stories, which are mostly extremely cynical reflections on life and love, make up several comic strips.\n\nPastis has mentioned that the character of Rat is his \"voice\" and that he identifies himself with Rat more than any other character.\n\nPig (debut: December 30, 2001) is the character that receives the most abuse from Rat (though ironically, he is Rat's only friend). He is kind by nature, but extremely stupid. Pig's jokes generally involve his stupidity; Pastis once stated that Pig is easy to write for because he misunderstands everything said to him, and, once it is explained, he misunderstands the explanation. Pig has a habit of talking to inanimate objects such as food, stop lights, or bait. Pig's moody on-and-off girlfriend, Pigita, often misunderstands his ignorant statements and will often become violent toward him.\n\nPig loves to eat, including pork products, making him a cannibal, although he appears to misunderstand this. Unlike the other characters, Pig almost never uses mock profanity.\n\nGoat (debut: January 18, 2002) is the intellectual of the strip, usually appearing whenever there is a small issue dealing with a character or a conflict to be mediated. Goat has a hard time dealing with both Pig's stupidity and Rat's cruelty and occasional ignorance. He is sometimes seen telling other characters about various philosophical, political, and social issues, though usually the others do not care.\n\nGoat's real name is revealed as \"Paris\" in the September 21, 2007 strip; he claims \"Goat\" is his stage name.\n\nIn early strips, Goat has a beard; he first appears without it in the March 31, 2004 strip.\n\nZebra (debut: February 4, 2002), also known as \"zeeba neighba\" (zebra neighbor) by the crocodiles, is a zebra who is often seen trying to patch up relations between his herd back home and its predators. Pastis has stated that the Zebra's only goal is to avoid being eaten by his inarticulate next-door neighbors, the crocodiles. Jokes involving Zebra usually involve his interactions with predators.\n\nBecause Stephan Pastis was once unable to draw lions, these particular predators were not shown in the strip until May 31, 2007, when two of them moved next door to Zebra, on the opposite side from the crocodiles. Zebra's lion neighbors, however, are male lions, which do not hunt, and they awkwardly remain friends.\n\nPrior to their appearance, Zebra has been corresponding with the lions by mail.\n\nThe Guard Duck is, as his name implies, is the \"guard duck\" for Pig and Rat's home.\n\nHis first appearance was March 14, 2005, when Pig bought him instead of a more expensive guard dog for the house.\n\nOriginally, Guard Duck was described as a violent duck with anger management problems, but he transformed into a deluded soldier who sees the world as his battlefield. He responds to neighborhood problems militaristically, often using excessive violence (usually with an RPG, his usual weapon).\n\nIn the treasury \"The Crass Menagerie\", Stephan Pastis remarks that the Guard Duck has become so popular that he's become a sixth main character (after Rat, Pig, Goat, Zebra, and the crocs).\n\nThe ZZE fraternity of crocodiles (whose name supposedly means \"Zeta Zeta Epsilon\" but actually means \"Zeeba Zeeba Eata\") is described by Pastis as \"inept and inarticulate neighbors\" of Zebra. They repeatedly attempt to kill and eat Zebra, but fail every time as a result of their stupidity.\nEach croc has very little regard for his fellow crocs' lives; dozens of crocs have died in their botched attempts to kill Zebra. They speak in a \"language\" called \"Croc-ese\": English with very bad grammar and pronunciation. According to Pastis, \"Croc-ese\" is not meant to imitate any accent. They are on poor terms with all five main characters (with the possible occasional exception of Rat).\n\nIn addition to the fraternity of crocodiles, there is a separate family of crocodiles that live in the neighborhood and are also neighbors to Zebra. The family consists of Larry, his wife Patty, and their son Junior (originally named Billy). Larry is a typical croc similar to those in the fraternity: he is also characterized by his stupidity and his failure to kill Zebra. In contrast, both his wife and son are intelligent and do not speak \"Croc-ese\". Patty is a housewife with a bob haircut. She is often frustrated with her husband's insensitivity and stupidity and even responds with physical violence in many cases. Despite this, Patty is still shown to love her husband. Junior is the only child of his family. He is a vegetarian, and also loves his father.\n\nStephan Pastis appears self-reflexively in the strip. He is often seen with Rat, who makes him the target of criticism about his artwork and jokes involving puns. His character has also expressed his hate of being an attorney, which was his former career. He is usually depicted wearing a baseball cap backward, a plain white T-shirt, and blue jeans.\n\nSnuffles (also known as Mister Snuffles) is Zebra's cat. Originally, he was adopted by the crocodiles on September 30, 2007, to kill Zebra, but the plan backfired. He does not talk like the other characters, only saying \"Meow\" (but the other characters can understand what he says). However, he is still shown to have human-like intelligence. While he is always obedient and good-natured to Zebra, he can be violent to others. He often commits illegal or immoral acts, which range from scalping tickets to hiding weapons of mass destruction. Snuffles is often seen with Guard Duck.\n\n\nThe strip is set in a fictional suburb in Albany, California. Venues where the characters can be found include a brick wall, a beach, a curb, a bar, and a diner.\n\nArtistically, \"Pearls\" is extremely simple. Pastis stated, \"People say that they like my strip's simplicity, but I'm doing the best I can to just to get up to that level. I'm not dumbing the art down.\"\n\n\"Pearls\" is a meta-comic in that it often satirizes the comics medium, and its characters frequently break the fourth wall. Characters frequently communicate with the author or with characters from other strips. Some strips are based on the premise that the characters live in a comic strip: for example, the strip published on January 14, 2008, had \"roof fish\" sitting on top of the panel fishing for the characters, and other strips have had smeared newsprint or beer affect the appearance of the strip.\n\n\"Pearls\" will often also mock older strips, such as \"Cathy\" and \"The Family Circus\". The frequent comedic jabs at long-running comic strips has earned Pastis the disdain of many comic artists, which the author referenced in a storyline where the \"Pearls\" cast is not invited to the 75th-anniversary crossover party of \"Blondie\".\n\nPastis will often employ a shaggy dog story, using a great amount of dialogue to spin an elaborate premise often resolved with a character's unforeseen death or near death. A variation known as a feghoot builds to an intentionally bad pun in the penultimate panel, with the final panel showing the cartoon version of Pastis as the target of criticism, hostility, or even physical violence from the characters, usually Rat.\n\n\"Pearls\" uses dark humor, at times involving topics such as death, depression and human suffering.\n\nIn an interview on \"The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch\" that aired on February 7, 2008, Pastis mentioned that he had been approached by producers about an animated TV series based on \"Pearls\".\n\nIn 2009, a line of \"Pearls\" plush dolls was released by Aurora World, Inc., featuring four characters (Rat, Pig, Zebra and Croc) from the comic, to which Pastis jokingly said he would use for reference when unsure how to draw the characters.\n\nOn October 20, 2010, RingTales launched their series of animated \"Pearls\" strips on Babelgum. Pastis has since begun to release these cartoons on YouTube.\n\nThere are over a dozen \"Pearls Before Swine\" books, mostly strip collections and treasuries.\nPastis won the National Cartoonists Society's Division Award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip for \"Pearls\" in 2003, 2006 and 2014. He was also nominated for the award in 2002 and 2008.\n\nPastis was one of the National Cartoonists Society's nominees for Cartoonist of the Year in 2008,\n\n"}

{"id": "104957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=104957", "title": "Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation", "text": "Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1937 by philanthropist Solomon R. Guggenheim and his long-time art advisor, artist Hilla von Rebay. The foundation is a leading institution for the collection, preservation, and research of modern and contemporary art and operates several museums around the world. The first museum established by the foundation was The Museum of Non-Objective Painting, in New York City. This became The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952, and the foundation moved the collection into its first permanent museum building, in New York City, in 1959. The foundation next opened the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, in 1980. Its international network of museums expanded in 1997 to include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Bilbao, Spain, and it expects to open a new museum, Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates in 2017.\n\nThe mission of the foundation is \"to promote the understanding and appreciation of art, architecture, and other manifestations of visual culture, primarily of the modern and contemporary periods, and to collect, conserve, and study\" modern and contemporary art. The Foundation seeks, in its constituent museums, to unite distinguished architecture and artworks. The foundation's first permanent museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, is housed in a modern spiral building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Guggenheim Bilbao was designed by Frank Gehry. Both of these innovative designs received wide press and critical attention. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is housed in an 18th-century Italian palace, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, on the Grand Canal.\n\nThe permanent collection of the foundation is based primarily on nine private collections: Solomon R. Guggenheim's collection of non-objective paintings; Karl Nierendorf's collection of German expressionism and early abstract expressionism; Katherine S. Dreier's gift of paintings and sculptures; Peggy Guggenheim's collection, concentrating on abstraction and surrealism; Justin K. and Hilde Thannhauser's collection of impressionist, post-impressionist, and early modern masterpieces; part of Hilla von Rebay's collection; Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's holdings of American minimalist, post-minimalist, environmental and conceptual art of the 1960s and 1970s; a collection of photographs and mixed media from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation; and the Bohen Foundation's collection of film, video, photography and new media. The foundation's collections have expanded greatly through eight decades and include every major movement of 20th- and 21st-century art. Its directors and curators have attempted to form a single collection that is not encyclopedic, but rather based on their unique visions. The collection has grown in scope to include new media and performance art, and the foundation has entered into collaborations with YouTube and BMW.\n\nSolomon R. Guggenheim, a member of a wealthy mining family, began collecting works of the old masters in the 1890s. He retired from his business in 1919 to devote more time to art collecting. In 1926, at age 66, he met artist Hilla von Rebay, who was commissioned by Guggenheim's wife, Irene Rothschild, to paint his portrait. Rebay introduced him to European avant-garde art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect (non-objective art). Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy. In 1930, the two visited Wassily Kandinsky's studio in Dessau, Germany, and Guggenheim began to purchase Kandinsky's work. The same year, Guggenheim began to display the collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Guggenheim's purchases continued with the works of Rudolf Bauer, Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay, and great artists who were not of the non-objective school, such as Marc Chagall, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Pablo Picasso and László Moholy-Nagy.\nIn 1937, Guggenheim established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation to foster the appreciation of modern art. The foundation's first venue for the display of art was called the \"Museum of Non-Objective Painting\". It opened in 1939 under the direction of Rebay, its first curator, in a former automobile showroom at East 54th Street in midtown Manhattan. This moved, in 1947, to another rented space at 1071 Fifth Avenue. Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time, such as Kandinsky's \"Composition 8\" (1923), Léger's \"Contrast of Forms\" (1913) and Delaunay's \"Simultaneous Windows\" (2nd Motif, 1st Part)\" (1912).\n\nBy the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent building to house the art collection had become apparent. In 1943, Guggenheim and Rebay commissioned architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design the museum building. Rebay conceived of the space as a \"temple of the spirit\" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection. In 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf's estate of some 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. By that time, the foundation's collection included a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Miró. Guggenheim died in 1949, and the museum was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952. The foundation expanded its display activities with a series of traveling exhibitions.\n\nAfter Guggenheim's death, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation's board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum. Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, Alexander Calder, Gleizes, Piet Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters.\n\nIn 1953, the foundation's collecting boundaries extended even further under its new director, James Johnson Sweeney. Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of \"objective\" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired Constantin Brâncuși's \"Adam and Eve\" (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul Cézanne's \"Man with Crossed Arms\" (c. 1899). In 1953, the foundation received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of Katherine S. Dreier, a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the Société Anonyme. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included \"Little French Girl\" (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by Juan Gris, a bronze sculpture (1919) by Alexander Archipenko and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian Dadaist Schwitters. It also included works by Calder, Marcel Duchamp, El Lissitzky and Mondrian. Among others, Sweeney also acquired the works of Alberto Giacometti, David Hayes, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. He also established the Guggenheim International Awards in 1956. Sweeney oversaw the last half dozen years of the construction of the museum building, during which time he had an antagonistic relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright, especially regarding the building's lighting issues.\n\nThe distinctive cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, with a spiral ramp climbing gently from ground level to the skylight at the top, turned out to be Wright's last major work, as the architect died six months before its opening. The building opened in October 1959 to large crowds and instantly polarized architecture critics, though today it is widely praised. Some of the criticism focused on the idea that the building overshadows the artworks displayed inside, and that it is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral. Prior to its opening, twenty-one artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space. Upon opening, the museum received a largely favorable response from the public, despite the early misgivings: \"overall Wright's design was, and still is, admired for being highly personal and inviting\".\n\nThomas M. Messer succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors. When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has curved walls. Almost immediately, in 1962, he took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised \"the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell\", where any vertical object appears tilted in a \"drunken lurch\" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions.\n\nIt turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, \"I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.\" Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, \"suggesting hallucination\" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.\n\nThe next year, Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser for the foundation's permanent collection. These 73 works include Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and French modern masterpieces, including important works by Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh and 32 works by Pablo Picasso.\n\nPeggy Guggenheim, Solomon's niece, collected and displayed art beginning in 1938. At Messer's urging, she donated her art collection and home in Venice, the \"Palazzo Venier dei Leoni\", to the foundation in 1976. After her death in 1979, the collection of more than 300 works was re-opened to the public as the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 1980 by the foundation, which was then under the direction of Peter Lawson-Johnston. It includes early 20th century works of prominent American modernists and Italian futurists. Pieces in the collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and Abstract expressionism. Some of the notable artists are Picasso, Dalí, Magritte, Brâncuși (including a sculpture from the \"Bird in Space\" series), eleven works by Pollock, Braque, Duchamp, Léger, Severini, Picabia, de Chirico, Mondrian, Kandinsky, Miró, Giacometti, Klee, Gorky, Calder, Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim's daughter, Pegeen Vail Guggenheim.\n\nSince 1985, the United States has selected the foundation to operate the U.S. Pavilion of the Venice Biennale, an exhibition held every other summer. In 1986, the foundation purchased the Palladian-style pavilion, built in 1930.\n\nThomas Krens, director of the foundation from 1988 to 2008, led a rapid expansion of the foundation's collections. In 1991, he broadened the foundation's holdings by acquiring the Panza Collection. Assembled by Count Giuseppe di Biumo and his wife, Giovanna, the Panza Collection includes examples of Minimalist sculptures by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, and Minimalist paintings by Robert Mangold, Brice Marden and Robert Ryman, as well as an array of Post-Minimal, Conceptual, and perceptual art by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, James Turrell, Lawrence Weiner and others, notably American examples of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1992, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation gifted 200 of his best photographs to the foundation. The works spanned his entire output, from his early collages, Polaroids, portraits of celebrities, self-portraits, male and female nudes, flowers and statues. It also featured mixed-media constructions and included his well-known 1998 \"Self-Portrait\". The acquisition initiated the foundation's photography exhibition program.\n\nAlso in 1992, the New York museum building's exhibition and other space was expanded by the addition of an adjoining rectangular tower, taller than the original spiral, and a renovation of the original building. The same year, the foundation opened a small Guggenheim Museum SoHo in the SoHo neighborhood of downtown Manhattan. This space was kept after the main museum was re-opened, but it closed in 2002 due to an economic downturn. To finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani to raise $47 million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for \"trendy\" latecomers. In \"The New York Times\", critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales \"stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.\" Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its \"postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings\" and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums.\nOne of Krens's most significant initiatives was to expand the foundation's international presence. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in 1997. Designed by Frank Gehry, the titanium, glass and limestone Guggenheim Bilbao is a centerpiece of the revitalization of the Basque city of Bilbao, Spain. The building was greeted with glowing praise from architecture critics. The Basque government funded the construction, while the Foundation purchased the artworks and manages the facility. The museum's permanent collection includes works by modern and contemporary Basque and Spanish artists like Eduardo Chillida, Juan Munoz and Antonio Saura, as well as works from the foundation, and it has organized various exhibitions curated by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n\nAlso in 1997, the foundation opened a small gallery in the Unter den Linden area of Berlin, Germany, as the Deutsche Guggenheim, in cooperation with the Deutsche Bank. The Deutsche Guggenheim had four exhibitions each year, complemented by educational programming, and it annually commissioned one, or occasionally two, new artworks or series by contemporary artists, which were then displayed at the museum in a special exhibition. After 14 years of operation, Deutsche Guggenheim closed at the end of 2012.\n\nUnder Krens, the foundation mounted some of its most popular exhibitions: \"Africa: The Art of a Continent\" in 1996; \"China: 5,000 Years\" in 1998, \"Brazil: Body & Soul\" in 2001; and \"The Aztec Empire\" in 2004. It has shown unusual exhibitions on occasion, for example commercial art installations of Giorgio Armani suits and motorcycles. \"The New Criterion\"'s Hilton Kramer condemned both \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" and the retrospective of the work of fashion designer Armani. Others disagreed. A 2009 retrospective of Frank Lloyd Wright at the original building in New York showcased the architect on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building and was the museum's most popular exhibit since it began keeping such attendance records in 1992.\nIn 2001, the foundation opened two new museums in Las Vegas, Guggenheim Las Vegas and Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, both designed by architect Rem Koolhaas. The museums showcased highlights of the collections, respectively, of the foundation and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The first and larger of the two hosted one exhibition: \"The Art of the Motorcycle\", before closing in 2003. The latter, held ten exhibitions of masterworks by leading artists from the last six centuries, including Van Eyck, Titian, Velázquez, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock and Lichtenstein. The Guggenheim Hermitage Museum closed in 2008.\n\nIn 2001 the foundation also established the Sackler Center for Arts Education on the campus of the original New York building. The same year, the foundation received a gift of the large collection of the Bohen Foundation, which, for two decades, commissioned new works of art with an emphasis on film, video, photography and new media. Artists included in the collection are Pierre Huyghe, Sophie Calle and Jac Leirner. The foundation planned for a large Guggenheim museum on the waterfront in lower Manhattan, and it engaged Frank Gehry as the architect. His essentially complete designs for the building were showcased in 2001 at the Fifth Avenue museum, but these plans were disrupted by the economic downturn of the early 2000s and the September 11, 2001 attacks, which prompted reconsideration of any plans in lower Manhattan. Other projects in Rio de Janeiro, Vilnius, Salzburg, Guadalajara and Taichung were also considered but not completed.\n\nOn January 19, 2005, the philanthropist Peter B. Lewis resigned from his position as chairman of the foundation, expressing his opposition to Krens' plans for further global expansion of the Guggenheim museums. Lewis had been the largest donor in the history of the Guggenheim. Tensions continued, however, and on February 27, 2008, Krens resigned from his position in the foundation. He has remained, however, as an advisor for international affairs. Over his two decades at the head of the foundation, Krens was criticized not only for the deaccessioning of older works of the museum but for both his businesslike style and perceived populism and commercialization. One writer commented, \"Krens has been both praised and vilified for turning what was once a small New York institution into a worldwide brand, creating the first truly multinational arts institution. ... Krens transformed the Guggenheim into one of the best-known brand name in the arts.\"\nRichard Armstrong became the fifth director of the foundation on November 4, 2008. He had been director of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for 12 years, where he had also served as chief curator and curator of contemporary art. In addition to its permanent collections, which continue to grow, the foundation administers loan exhibitions and co-organizes exhibitions with other museums to foster public outreach.\n\nIn 2006, Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, announced an agreement with the Guggenheim Foundation to build a new museum, \"Guggenheim Abu Dhabi\". Gehry designed the structure, which will, if completed, be the foundation's largest by far. It has begun construction on the northwest tip of Saadiyat Island, along with a performing arts center, the Zayed National Museum and a branch of the Louvre. The museum is expected to \"create an exhibition space intended to turn this once-sleepy desert city along the Persian Gulf into an international arts capital and tourist destination.\" The completion date has been pushed back repeatedly, and the museum is now expected to open in 2017 at the earliest. The museum is expected to house modern and contemporary collections that will focus on Middle-Eastern contemporary art and to display special exhibitions from the foundation's main collection.\n\nIn 2011, the city of Helsinki, Finland, commissioned the foundation to study the feasibility of constructing a museum there. The feasibility study recommended building the museum in Helsinki's South Harbor. In 2012, the proposal was rejected by the city board \"over concerns about the cost and a proposed merger with the Helsinki Art Museum\". In 2013, the foundation made a revised proposal that provideed that the project's architect would be chosen through an international competition. The proposal anticipated that the Guggenheim's licensing fee would be funded by private sources, with decreased operating costs and increased revenues; one journalist called the Foundation's estimates \"speculative at best\". In 2014, the city council approved an international architecture competition to solicit designs for the museum, and the following year, a design was chosen. In 2016 the Helsinki city council voted to reject the plan.\n\nThe foundation has long sought, in its constituent museums, to unite its artworks with distinguished architecture. In 1943, Hilla von Rebay and Solomon R. Guggenheim commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build the foundation's first permanent museum. Rebay wrote to Wright that \"each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. … I want a temple of spirit, a monument!\" The resultant achievement, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders. The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, \"there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion.\" Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it \"socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.\"\n\nBefore settling on the present site for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River. Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city. Nature also provided the museum with inspiration. The building embodies Wright's attempts \"to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture.\" The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright. The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.\n\nWright's original concept was called an inverted \"ziggurat\", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting. Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels. The spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another.\n\nEven as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry. Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes. He explained, \"these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.\" Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors.\nWright's vision took 16 years to be fulfilled. Set in sharp contrast to typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum building opened in October 1959. Even before it opened, the design polarized architecture critics. Some believed that the building would overshadow the museum's artworks. \"On the contrary\", wrote the architect, the design makes \"the building and the painting an uninterrupted, beautiful symphony such as never existed in the World of Art before.\" Other critics, and many artists, felt that it is awkward to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral. The building, nevertheless, became widely praised and inspired many other architects.\n\nThe building's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted. The small rotunda (or \"Monitor building\", as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space. In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990–92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum. Wright's original plan for an adjoining tower, artists' studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons. However, as part of the restoration, architects Gwathmey Siegel and Associates analyzed Wright's original sketches to design the rectangular 10-story limestone tower, that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral building (replacing a much smaller structure), which has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are \"more appropriate for the display of art.\" Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wight's carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. Funding for the alterations was raised partly through the controversial sale of masterworks by the foundation in 1991.\n\nIn 2001, the museum opened the Sackler Center for Arts Education to the public, which was another part of Wright's original design for the building, through a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family. Located just below the large rotunda, this 8,200-square-foot education facility provides classes and lectures about the visual and performing arts and opportunities to interact with the museum's collections and special exhibitions through its labs, exhibition spaces, conference rooms and the Peter B. Lewis Theater. Between September 2005 and July 2008, the Guggenheim Museum underwent a significant exterior restoration to repair cracks and modernize systems and exterior details. Artist Jenny Holzer painted a tribute, \"For the Guggenheim\", in honor of Peter B. Lewis, a major benefactor in the restoration project. The museum was registered as a National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008.\n\nPeggy Guggenheim purchased the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni in 1948 to house and display her collection to the public, and she resided there for thirty years. Although sometimes mistaken for a modern building, it is an 18th-century palace designed by the Venetian architect Lorenzo Boschetti. The building was unfinished and has an unusually low elevation on the Grand Canal. The museum's website describes its \"long low façade, made of Istrian stone and set off against the trees in the garden behind that soften its lines, forms a welcome \"caesura\" in the stately march of Grand Canal palaces from the Accademia to the Salute.\"\n\nThe Foundation took control of the building in 1979 following Guggenheim's death and took steps to expand gallery space. By 1985, \"all of the rooms on the main floor had been converted into galleries ... the white Istrian stone facade and the unique canal terrace had been restored\", and a protruding arcade wing, called the barchessa, had been rebuilt by architect Giorgio Bellavitis. Since 1985, the museum has been open year-round. In 1993, the foundation converted apartments adjacent to the museum into a garden annex, a shop and more galleries. In 1995, the Nasher Sculpture Garden was completed, Since 1993, the museum has doubled in size, from 2,000 to 4,000 square meters. and it was renovated in 2012.\n\nIn 1991, the Basque government suggested to the foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao. The foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative. The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \"the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\". The interior \"is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country.\"\n\nWhen the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings, a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as \"the greatest building of our time\", while critic Calvin Tomkins, in \"The New Yorker\", characterized it as \"a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium\", its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its \"mercurial brilliance\" in \"The New York Times Magazine\". \"The Independent\" calls the museum \"an astonishing architectural feat\".\n\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500-square-meter site along the Nervión River in the old industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. Eleven thousand square meters of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding. The largest gallery measures 30 meters wide and 130 meters long. Since 2005, it has housed Richard Serra's monumental installation \"The Matter of Time\".\n\nDeutsche Guggenheim, in Berlin, opened one month after the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in 1997. Designed by American architect Richard Gluckman in a minimalist style, the modest Berlin gallery occupied a corner of the ground floor of the sandstone Deutsche Bank building, in the Unter der Linden boulevard, constructed in 1920. It closed in 2013.\n\nThe museum in Abu Dhabi is planned to be the foundation's largest facility by far. Gehry's design features exhibition galleries, education and research space, a conservation laboratory, a center for contemporary Arab, Islamic and Middle Eastern culture, and a center for \"art and technology\". Inspired by traditional middle-eastern covered courtyards and wind towers, used to cool structures exposed to the desert sun, the museum's clusters of horizontal and vertical galleries of various sizes are connected by catwalks and planned around a central, covered courtyard, incorporating natural features intended to maximize the energy efficiency of the building. The largest galleries will offer a grand scale for the display of large contemporary art installations. Parts of the building will be four stories tall, with \"clusters of block and cone-shaped connected galleries seemingly piled on top of each other.\" The museum is intended to be a centerpiece in the island's plan for contemporary art and culture\".\n\nThe new museum began construction on a peninsula at the northwestern tip of Saadiyat Island adjacent to Abu Dhabi. Gehry commented, \"The site itself, virtually on the water or close to the water on all sides, in a desert landscape with the beautiful sea and the light quality of the place suggested some of the direction.\" The completion date was pushed back from 2011 to at least 2017. In March 2011, over 130 artists announced a plan to boycott the Abu Dhabi museum, citing reports of abuses of foreign workers, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions and failure of companies to pay recruitment fees to laborers. Continued progress awaits the approval of construction applications and contracts by the Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC). As of early 2016, no progress had been made on construction, and the Guggenheim Foundation confirmed that \"TDIC has not yet awarded a contract.\"\n\nThe Guggenheim Helsinki Design Competition in 2014–2015 was the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's first open, international architectural competition. It received 1,715 submissions from 77 countries, a record for a museum design competition. The design chosen for a proposed €130 million Guggenheim museum in Helsinki, Finland, envisions \"an indistinct jumble of pavilions faced in charred wood\" and glass. The winning design is by Paris-based Moreau Kusunoki Architectes. Critics objected to the dark color of the design's exterior, which contrasts with the surrounding architecture, as well as the shape of the building. Osku Pajamaki, vice chairman of the city's executive board, said: \"The symbol of the lighthouse is arrogant in the middle of the historical center ... [like] a Guggenheim museum next to Notre Dame in Paris. People are approaching from the sea, and the first thing that they will see is that the citizens of Helsinki bought their identity from the Guggenheim.\" The proposed museum was rejected by the Helsinki city council in 2016.\n\nThe foundation annually lends hundreds of works of art from its collections to other museums and institutions around the world. It also enters into collaborations with partners throughout the world to engage with diverse audiences and to promote cultural discourse. From 2006 to 2011, exhibitions of the foundation's works were seen in more than 80 museums, such as the National Art Museum of China in Beijing during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nIn 2010, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and YouTube, in collaboration with Hewlett-Packard and Intel, presented \"YouTube Play, A Biennial of Creative Video\". More than 23,000 videos from 91 countries were submitted in response to an open call for submissions aimed \"to discover and showcase the most exceptional talent working in the ever-expanding realm of online video\". Foundation curators selected a short list of 125 videos from which a jury, including artists Laurie Anderson and Takashi Murakami and the musical group Animal Collective, picked a playlist of 25 works. These were featured at the \"YouTube Play\" event at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York on October 21, 2010, during which the videos were projected on the exterior of the museum building and inside the museum's rotunda.\n\nThe 25 selected works continued on view at the museum until October 24, 2010. The 125 short list videos were on view throughout the fall of 2010 at kiosks at Guggenheim museums in New York, Berlin, Bilbao and Venice. The project's YouTube channel, youtube.com/play, features all of the short list videos, as well as highlights from the event in New York and information about the project. The collaboration was intended to reach wide audiences beyond the museum environment. \"New York Times\" art critic Roberta Smith commented: \"It is an idea whose time has come. ... In many ways it is simply an old-fashioned open-submission exhibition of the kind that regional museums and art centers around the country have staged for decades – except that it has gone digital.\"\n\nThe BMW Guggenheim Lab is an interdisciplinary travelling project that began in 2011. A collaboration between the BMW Group and the foundation, the lab is part urban think tank, part community center, and part gathering space, which explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse. The program is designed to proactively engage residents from each city that it visits, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and to address ideas and issues of urban living with particular relevance to each city. The Lab's Advisory Committee of experts nominates each city's lab team, an interdisciplinary group that creates the programming for that location. The lab was expected to visit nine cities for three months each over the course of six years, with three different structures housing the lab, each of which was to travel to three cities. In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project.\n\nThe lab's structure was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm Atelier Bow-Wow. The project's three-city cycle was designed around the theme \"Confronting Comfort\", which explored ways of making urban environments more responsive to people's needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility. The Lab's Advisory Committee members were: Daniel Barenboim, Elizabeth Diller, Nicholas Humphrey, Muchadeyi Masunda, Enrique Peñalosa, Juliet Schor, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Wang Shi. The lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City's East Village and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries. The Lab was open in Berlin from May 24 to July 29, 2012. The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (Gómez-Márquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti). The Lab opened in Mumbai, India, on December 9, 2012, and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum, with additional satellite locations around the city. Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects.\n\nThe program ended with an exhibition, \"Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab\", which was on view at the New York museum from October 11, 2013, through January 5, 2014.\n\nThe Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative is a five-year program, supported by Swiss bank UBS in which the Foundation identifies and works with artists, curators and educators from Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invites one curator from the chosen region to the Guggenheim Museum in New York City for a two-year curatorial residency, where he or she works with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities. The Foundation acquires these artworks for its permanent collection and includes them as the focus of exhibitions that open at the museum in New York and subsequently travel to two other cultural institutions or other venues around the world. The Foundation supplements the exhibitions with a series of public and online programs based on the theme of cross-cultural exchange. UBS is reportedly contributing more than $40 million to the project to pay for its activities and the art acquisitions. Foundation director Richard Armstrong commented: \"We are hoping to challenge our Western-centric view of art history.\"\n\nThe first exhibition (phase 1) focuses on art from South and Southeast Asia and is curated by Singaporean June Yap, who has worked for six years in the curatorial departments of modern and contemporary art museums, including the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum. The second and third phases of the project will focus on Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation made a $10 million grant to help the New York museum to commission works for its permanent collection by at least three Chinese-born artists and to hire a curator dedicated to its Chinese art collection. The works are expected to be exhibited at the museum in New York in three exhibitions between 2014 and 2017 and also at the other Guggenheim museums. The commissions are part of an effort by the museum to broaden the geographical scope of its collection, and the Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation hopes that the collaboration will foster \"a greater understanding of Chinese culture.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "175322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175322", "title": "Summons", "text": "Summons\n\nA summons (also known in England and Wales as a claim form and in the Australian state of New South Wales as a Court Attendance Notice (CAN)) is a legal document issued by a court (a \"judicial summons\") or by an administrative agency of government (an \"administrative summons\") for various purposes.\n\nA judicial summons is served on a person involved in a legal proceeding. Legal action may be in progress against the person, or the person's presence as witness may be required. In the former case, the summons will typically announce to the person to whom it is directed that a legal proceeding has been started against that person, and that a case has been initiated in the issuing court. In some jurisdictions, it may be drafted in legal English difficult for the layman to understand, while several U.S. states expressly require summonses to be drafted in plain English and that they must start with this phrase: \"Notice! You have been sued.\"\n\nThe summons announces a date by which the person or persons summoned must either appear in court, or respond in writing to the court or the opposing party or parties. The summons is the descendant of the writ of the common law. It replaces the former procedure in common-law countries by which the plaintiff actually had to ask the sheriff to arrest the defendant in order for the court to obtain personal jurisdiction in both criminal and civil actions.\n\nA citation, traffic violation ticket, or notice to appear is a type of summons prepared and served at the scene of the occurrence by a law enforcement official, compelling the appearance of a defendant before the local magistrate within a certain period of time to answer for a minor traffic infraction, misdemeanor, or other summary offence. Failure to appear within the allotted period of time is a separate crime of failure to appear.\n\nIn Australia, minor traffic and some summary offences are known as an Infringement Notice or a Fine and can be dealt with by paying a particular monetary amount depending on the offence. The accused person has the right to have the matter heard in a Court; if found not guilty the accused person pays nothing other than his legal costs (if any); if found guilty the accused person faces the prospect of a conviction for the offence and/or a substantial increase in the fine up to the maximum. For example, proceeding through a red light could go from A$353 up to A$2,200 if convicted in NSW. For more serious offences, a Field Court Attendance Notice is issued.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, law enforcement officials may deal with certain minor offences, such as littering, by issuing a fixed penalty notice, colloquially called an \"on-the-spot fine\", although legally they are not fines. They allow the recipient to avoid going to court by paying a penalty fixed by statute. If a notice is ignored or disputed, a court summons will be issued as for any other offence.\n\nA civil summons is most often accompanied by a complaint. Depending on the type of summons, there is often an option to endorse a summons so that the entity being served may be identified. In the court system in California, for civil unlimited cases in the superior court, a summons will often have these options to endorse:\n\nOne example of an administrative summons is found in the tax law of the United States. The Internal Revenue Code authorizes the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue a summons for a taxpayer—or any person having custody of books of account relating to a business of a taxpayer—to appear before the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (generally, this means the IRS employee who issued the summons) at the time and place named in the summons. The person summoned may be required to produce books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony under oath before an IRS employee.\n\nThe IRS is also empowered to issue the section 7602 summons for the purpose of \"inquiring into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws.\"\n\nThe summons may be enforced by a court order, and the law provides a criminal penalty of up to one year in prison or a fine, or both, for failure to obey the summons, except that the person summoned may, to the extent applicable, assert a privilege against self incrimination or other evidentiary privileges, if applicable.\n\nIn the U.S. immigration court system, a \"Notice to Appear\" is an administrative summons ordering a respondent to appear before an immigration court for removal proceedings.\n\nIn the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) the service of a Court Attendance Notice can be issued in a number of ways, the most common of which is by the NSW Police Force when charging someone after an arrest is made, a Bail Court Attendance Notice (with bail conditions) or regular Court Attendance Notice is issued. Other methods the Police use include via a paper form called a Field Court Attendance Notice (Field CAN) which is issued to the accused person on the spot after an offence has been detected. Or by way of a Future Court Attendance Notice (Future CAN), which replaced the old court issued summons and is served in person by Police or sometimes by mail. In all of these cases, the CAN is filed at the court after it has been served.\n\nHistorically, in old English law, a summons was called an \"auxilium curiae\", although this term is now obsolete. In England and Wales, the term writ of summons for the originating document in civil proceedings has been replaced with the term \"claim form\" by the Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (CPR). This is part of the reforms to simplify legal terminology. However, despite its name, the claim form does not present the details of the claim itself (in other words, it does not replace the complaint). The complaint is now known as the \"particulars of claim\". \n\nIn criminal matters, either a requisition, summons or warrant is issued to initiate criminal proceedings.\n\nIn most U.S. jurisdictions, the service of a summons is in most cases required for the court to have jurisdiction over the party who is being summoned. The process by which a summons is served is called service of process. The form and content of service in the federal courts is governed by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the rules of many state courts are similar. The federal summons is usually issued by the clerk of the court. In many states, the summons may be issued by an attorney, but some states use filing as the means to commence an action and in those states, the attorney must first file the summons in duplicate before it becomes effective. One or more copies are stamped by the court clerk with the court seal and returned to the attorney, who then uses it to actually serve the defendants. Other jurisdictions may only require that the summons be filed after it is served on the defendants. New York is distinguished by its permissive filing system, in which the summons or complaint need not be filed at all.\n\n\n"}

He is a private investigator employed as an operative of the Continental Detective Agency's San Francisco office. The stories are all told in the first person and his name is never mentioned.\n\nThe Continental Op is a master of deceit in the exercise of his occupation. In his 1927 \"Black Mask\" story \"$106,000 Blood Money\" the Op is confronted with two dilemmas: shall he expose a corrupt fellow detective, thereby hurting the reputation of his agency; and shall he also allow an informant to collect the $106,000 reward in a big case even though he is morally certain—but cannot prove—that the informant has murdered one of his agency's clients? The Op resolves his two problems neatly by manipulating events so that the corrupt detective and the informant get into an armed confrontation in which both are killed.\n\nDecades of witnessing human cruelty, misery, and ruin, as well as being instrumental in sending hundreds of people to jail, or to the gallows, have greatly weakened the Op's natural sympathy with his fellow men. He fears becoming like his boss, \"The Old Man\", whom he describes as \"a shell, without any human feelings whatsoever\".\n\nIn the penultimate chapter of \"The Dain Curse\", a female client, whose life the Op has saved three times, while also curing her of morphine addiction, says to him:\n\nThe Op is one of the first major hardboiled detectives later developed in such characters as Hammett's own Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer and others.\n\nThe Continental Op made his debut in an October 1923 issue of \"Black Mask\", making him one of the earliest hard-boiled private detective characters to appear in the pulp magazines of the early twentieth century. He appeared in 36 short stories, all but two of which appeared in \"Black Mask.\"\n\nIn 1927, Hammett began writing linked stories, which formed the basis for his first two novels, \"Red Harvest\" and \"The Dain Curse\", both released in 1929. Two other stories, \"The Big Knockover\" and \"$106,000 Blood Money\" were published as \"Blood Money\" in 1943. Hammett also wrote a two-story sequence in the summer of 1924 consisting of \"The House on Turk Street\" and \"The Girl with the Silver Eyes\". These were recently published (along with \"The Dain Curse\", \"The Glass Key\", and \"Blood Money\") in a Modern Library edition, though they are not officially called a novel as was \"Blood Money\".\n\nOf the 28 stories not a part of \"Red Harvest\" or \"The Dain Curse\", 26 are available in one of three collections from Vintage Crime, \"The Big Knockover\" (1966), \"The Continental Op\" (1974), and \"Nightmare Town\" (1999), and/or the Library of America collection \"Crime Stories and Other Writings\" (2001).\n\nA number of collections of Hammett stories, both books collecting Continental Op stories (\"The Continental Op\", \"The Return of the Continental Op\") and others with miscellaneous Hammett stories, were published as Dell mapbacks.

{"id": "5730199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5730199", "title": "WAGs", "text": "WAGs\n\nWAGs (or Wags) is an acronym used to refer to wives and girlfriends of high-profile sportspersons. The term may also be used in the singular form, WAG, to refer to a specific female partner or life partner who is in a relationships with an athlete.\n\nThe term was first used by the British tabloid press to refer to the wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers, originally the England national football team. It came into common use during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, although the term had been used occasionally before that. The acronym has since been used by the media in other countries to describe the female partners of sportspeople in general.\n\nIt is popular belief that the first recorded use of the term WAG was in 2002: \"It was never guaranteed that the wives and girlfriends (or \"the Wags\", as staff at the Jumeirah Beach Club call them for short) would get along. Mrs Beckham's tongue, for one thing, has previously run away with itself.\"\n\nIn 2006 it was generally printed as \"WAGs\", but a singular, \"Wag\" or \"WAG\", quickly came into vogue for example: \"any additional pounds she gained during Wag drinking sessions\"; \"a property heiress, model and actress, appears a likely sports WAG\". Susie Dent's annual \"Language Report\" for the Oxford University Press (2006) capitalised the entire acronym as \"WAG\" (\"wife and/or girlfriend\") .\n\n\"WAG\"/\"wag\" came also to be used somewhat redundantly (\"deluxe-edition Wag girlfriend\"), although in such usage \"girlfriend\" (or \"wife\") could be interpreted as further denotative specification within the set of people fitting both the denotation and the connotation of \"WAG\", and increasingly in non-footballing contexts: for example, the first wife of comedian Peter Cook (1937–95) was described as a \"Sixties Wag\" and actress Jennifer Ellison, because of her former choice of clothes, \"once ... the epitome of a Wag\". Fashion writer Shane Watson coined a collective noun, \"waggery\". One can also be \"Wagged\"\n\nThis type of acronym is of long standing in British English. For example, during the Second World War, a series of County War Agricultural Executive Committees or CWAECs was known widely as \"War Ags\".\n\nDuring the 2006 World Cup the press gave increasing coverage to the socialising and shopping activities of the English WAGs, who were based in the German town of Baden-Baden. It was frequently suggested that England's exit from the tournament in the quarterfinals was a result of such distractions.\n\nProminent WAGs of that year included Victoria Beckham, wife of then England captain David Beckham, whom the \"New Yorker\" described as \"Queen of the Wags\" and the \"Sunday Times\" as \"the original Wag\"; Cheryl, \"née\" Tweedy, of the group Girls Aloud, who shortly afterwards married Ashley Cole (\"Wag weds\"), from whom she was divorced in 2010; Coleen Rooney, \"née\" Mcloughlin, who married Wayne Rooney in June 2008 and who was variously described as a \"chavette\", by \"The Sun\" a \"super WAG\" and, by the end of the year, listed by the \"Times\" as a \"national treasure\"; and fitness instructor Carly Cole née Zucker, wife of Joe Cole, described by Susie Whally in the \"Sunday Times\" as a \"new WAG on the block [who] has set the tone for the season's most wanted muscles\". Other WAGs that aroused considerable interest included Melanie Slade, due to her relative youth – she was an A-level student at the time – girlfriend of Theo Walcott, who, at seventeen, was himself the youngest member of the England squad; Abbey Clancy, girlfriend of Peter Crouch; Steven Gerrard's fiancé Alex Curran, a model frequently featured in tabloids and fashion magazines; and former Spanish waitress Elen Rives, the then fiancée of Frank Lampard.\n\nNancy Dell'Olio, an Italian property lawyer who was the girlfriend of the then England coach Sven-Göran Eriksson, enjoyed quite a high public profile of her own, partly as a result of long-running press interest in aspects of Eriksson's private life.\n\nThere are many celebrities who are also considered WAGs, by either marrying or dating a notable athlete. Some famous WAGs include La La Anthony, Victoria Beckham, Gisele Bündchen, Cheryl, Ciara, Ayesha Curry, Hilary Duff, Savannah James, Khloe Kardashian, Carrie Underwood and Gabrielle Union.\n\nThe WAGs' activities did however provide a \"benchmark\" of sorts. A Labour member of the UK Parliament, Denis MacShane, described the Conservative Party's summer ball of 2006 (for which tickets cost £400) as \"mak[ing] the WAGs of Baden Baden look like the Bloomsbury set\", a comparison with the \"Bohemian\" artistic group of the early 20th century that grew up initially around sisters Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf.\n\nLeo Beckett, husband of British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett was described as the \"political equivalent of a WAG\" because of the extent to which he accompanied his wife on official business.\n\nFashion writers of 2006 identified certain consequences of what Lisa Armstrong described as \"WAG fall-out\" and Tina Gaudoin as \"Waglash\". These were mostly the implications of \"over-exposure\" of certain styles: for example, that the Hermès \"Birkin\" bag had become less desirable as a result of being \"de rigueur\" among WAGs in Baden-Baden (a development dubbed by Shane Watson as \"baglash\"); or that reaction to WAGs’ excessively coiffed hair and \"vacant perfection\" had perhaps been the \"tipping point\" for a revival of fashions of the 1980s, commended by Armstrong as \"the last era of anti-slick\".\n\nArmstrong also assured readers who wished to perfect the elements of \"\" that the use of denture cleaner to whiten the tips of nails would not make them \"look like a WAG\", while her colleague Sarah Vine offered advice on \"buying some nice perfume that won't make you smell like a WAG on heat\". When it was reported, in 2007, that Coleen Rooney would be launching a range of beauty products, \"London Lite\" coined the term, \"eau de wag\" and asked, \"who, tell us, who really wants to smell like Coleen McLoughlin?\"\n\nHowever, some women did aspire to the \"WAG\" look. Mrs Rooney noted that \"apparently more and more women are getting into debt because they try to shop and party like a footballer's wife. If I heard of anyone doing that, I'd tell them to get a grip\". \"Sunday Times\" columnist India Knight observed, while waiting in an airport queue, that \"it's as if a low-level wannabe footballer's wife vibe that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor edifying has become the norm ... I saw this phenomenon \"en masse\"\". Among other features, Knight identified \"enough pink glitter to satisfy the girliest of five-year-olds\", massive handbags and huge designer sunglasses.\n\nReflecting on sunglasses as an accessory, \"Sunday Times Style\"'s senior fashion writer Colin McDowell suggested that, whereas women had been sure that the poise of Jacqueline Kennedy (1929–94) and Audrey Hepburn (1929–93), style icons of the mid-20th century, had been due to their shading their eyes, \"Wags ... far from using dark glasses to encourage others to leave them alone, treat them as a weapon to attract and excite the paparazzi\".\n\nInterest in the partners of footballers dates back at least to the late 1950s when the long-serving England captain Billy Wright married the singer Joy Beverley. By the late 1960s, then-captain Bobby Moore (1941–93) and his first wife Tina had become regarded as a stylish and \"golden\" couple. During the 1970 World Cup in Mexico the England manager Sir Alf Ramsey (1920–99) expressed concern at the effects on the team's cohesion of the presence of the wives of four players, a view that seems to have been shared by some other members of the squad. England's quarter-final defeat by West Germany in that competition has been widely attributed to goalkeeping lapses by Peter Bonetti, whose pre-match nerves were thought by many, including Ramsey himself, to have been accentuated by rumours circulating about the alleged behaviour of his wife Frances. By contrast, during the 1966 World Cup, their wives drove themselves to Wembley and the FA booked them a single function room in the Royal Garden Hotel at Kensington.\n\nInterest in such partnerships scaled new heights in the late 1990s and early 21st century with the marriage (in 1999) of David Beckham to singer Victoria Adams (\"Posh Spice\") of the Spice Girls. The couple were widely known as \"Posh and Becks\" and every aspect of their relationship and nuance of dress were subjected to scrutiny in the press and other media. Victoria Beckham was quoted as saying that she and her husband had \"so many wider interests ... fashion, make-up. I mean you think, yeah, football's great, and singing's great. But you've got to look at the bigger picture\".\n\nFormer Manchester United captain Roy Keane had lashed out at footballers' wives and girlfriends, as well as their lavish lifestyle, during their trophyless season in 2001–2002. Keane blamed United's loss of form on some of his teammates' fixation with wealth, claiming that they had \"forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion.\" Earlier in the season, Keane had publicly advocated the break-up of the Treble-winning team as he believed the teammates who had played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final no longer had the motivation to work as hard. When Keane became manager of Sunderland A.F.C, he complained about the difficulty signing players to the city in northeast England, as their wives or girlfriends insisted they only move to teams based in London. He remarked \"If someone doesn't want to come to Sunderland then all well and good,\" Keane said. \"But if they don't want to come to Sunderland because their wife wants to go shopping in London, then it is a sad state of affairs. Unfortunately that is what is influencing a lot of footballers' decisions. Priorities have changed for footballers and they are being dictated to by their wives and girlfriends.\"\n\nIt was widely assumed that perceptions of the lifestyle of Victoria Beckham influenced the ITV drama series \"Footballers' Wives\" (2002) and in particular the character of Chardonnay Lane-Pascoe (played by Susie Amy). The term \"footballer's wife\" came to be associated with a spouse leading a \"high\" life of socialising and shopping. Alf Ramsey, who thought the role of a footballer's wife essentially that of a housewife, had once observed that he \"didn't know much about women and the only women I know are footballers' wives\". However, as his biographer noted, this remark was made \"at a time when the phrase 'footballers' wives' had yet to become the embodiment of predatory lust.\"\n\nBroadly speaking \"Footballer's wife\" and \"WAG\" were synonymous, but the latter was more generic, while the former connoted someone who seemed particularly pampered, perhaps with some of the characteristics also of an \"Essex girl\".\n\nDuring the 2005–6 season the actress Joanna Taylor, wife of Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy, wrote a regular column for the \"Times\" whose title, \"Footballer's Wife\", was no doubt partially ironic.\n\nUndoubtedly the \"WAG\" image of shopping and clubbing, as portrayed in the press in 2006, tended to stick. This led some WAGs, such as Girls Aloud member Cheryl Cole, to reject the eponym and to emphasise their credentials as career women in their own right.\n\nThe singer Jamelia (whose footballer boyfriend, Darren Byfield, played for Jamaica, which failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup) drew a distinction between, on the one hand, those WAGs, such as Victoria Beckham, who are \"businesswoman\", and Cole and Rooney, who \"have a job\", and, on the other, those who, in her view, had the wrong \"priorities\" and simply spent their boyfriends' money. This categorisation had some similarities both with Lisa Armstrong's comparison of supermodels with WAGs and with the suggested \"WAG\"/\"footballers' wife\" distinction. Indeed, it is possible to argue that, over the two-month period of 2006 that the WAGs were in the public spotlight, a subtle distinction emerged between \"WAG\" as a general acronym and the increasingly used \"Wag\" in the colloquial sense of a \"footballer's wife\".\n\nIn January 2007 a \"reality\" television series called \"WAGs Boutique\" (ITV2) was launched. This featured two teams of WAGs (few of whom had been among the party in Baden Baden the previous year) who competed to run fashion boutiques over a period of three months. The separation of one of the contenders, Michaela Henderson-Thynne, from her erstwhile partner, Middlesbrough midfielder Stewart Downing, raised some issues of principle and terminology. Giles Smith in the \"Times\" enquired whether \"one can still be registered as a WAG after one has separated from one's footballer?\" Smith noted also that a former beauty queen and controversial \"Celebrity Big Brother\" contestant, Danielle Lloyd, whose relationship with West Ham United's Teddy Sheringham was \"less than concrete\", was referred to, during a guest appearance on \"WAGs Boutique\", as \"an on-off WAG\". Smith wondered whether, in those moments when a woman was an \"off-WAG\", she was really a WAG at all. \"London Lite\" referred to Henderson-Thynne and Cassie Sumner, a \"WAGs Boutique\" participant whose supposed relationship with Michael Essien was the subject of some doubt, as \"fake WAGs\".\n\nAs if to emphasise the perceptive opinion of former England full-back Jimmy Armfield that there was \"a real international flavour to this World Cup\", the \"Sunday Times\" published during the 2006 tournament a photograph of the wives of French players Thierry Henry and David Trézéguet with the caption \"French Wags Nicole Henry and Beatrice Trezeguet share a smacker [\"i.e.\" kiss]\".\n\nFor its part, the French press referred to the English wives and girlfriends (\"les épouses et petites amies des joueurs\") as \"les Wags\": \"Et lorsque les Wags ont fini leur shopping ...\" [And when the Wags had finished their shopping]. Similarly, in German, \"die WAGs\" was adopted. Austria's \"Seitenblicke\", for example, carried a story \"Ich bin keine WAG!\" in German about Cheryl Cole's apparent disclaiming of the appellation of \"WAG\": \"Ich war bei 'Girls Aloud' bevor ich Ashley [Cole] kennenlernte ...\" [I was with Girls Aloud before I met Ashley].\n\nWhen the father of Melanie Slade (Theo Walcott's girlfriend), Councillor John Slade, was installed as Mayor of Southampton, Hampshire on 17 May 2006, he was introduced by a fellow councillor, Alec Samuels, as \"about the most famous mayor this city has had in 790 years ... He is the father of the girlfriend of a footballer\".\n\nWhen it was announced in 2007 that David Beckham would be joining the American club Los Angeles Galaxy, the \"Mail on Sunday\" referred to the \"LA WAGs whose husbands earn less in ten years than Beckham in one week\". The \"Mail\" claimed that these WAGs, who included actress Bianca Kajlich, married to Beckham teammate Landon Donovan, were \"stay-at-home girls\" who \"possess not a Chloé dress, a Prada handbag or a Manolo Blahnik shoe between them. And they are awaiting the arrival of Victoria Beckham with some trepidation\".\n\nDuring the course of the World Cup, the \"Times\" coined the term \"WWAGs\" (\"Wimbledon Wives and Girlfriends\") for the girlfriends of male participants in the All-England Lawn Tennis Championships in 2006. The most photographed WWAG in the British press during the tournament of 2006 was Kim Sears, the girlfriend of Scottish player Andy Murray. Sears is the daughter of Nigel Sears, former coach of the Slovak player Daniela Hantuchová.\n\n\"The Sun\" used an alternative form, \"WOWs\" (\"Wives of Wimbledon\"), to draw attention to photographs of such \"girls with WOW factor\" as the Australian actress, Bec Hewitt, \"née\" Cartwright, wife of Lleyton Hewitt, Wimbledon champion in 2002.\n\nInterest in the private lives of golfers has been popular in the tabloids since the relationships of Nick Faldo and Tony Jacklin, though not to the extent of footballers. Jacklin, who was then widowed at the time in 1988 had a date with a teenage girl, who then sold the story to \"The Sun\" newspapers. Faldo is best remembered in the frontpage outside of sports, in 1998, having his Porsche 959 trashed by an ex-girlfriend with his golf clubs. More recently, the marriage of Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren received substantial media coverage; their marriage ended after even more widely publicised revelations of Woods' serial infidelity.\n\nThe term \"wives and girlfriends\" (in unabbreviated term) was commonly used during the Ryder Cup golfing competitions at The Belfry in 2002 and Oakland Hills near Detroit in 2004, the press having given these partners about as much coverage as the golfers themselves, due to the patriotic competitive nature of the sport which extends to themselves. \"London Lite\" and \"Metro\" used the slightly patronising acronym \"WABs\" (\"wives and birdies\", the latter a pun on the term for a one under par score for a hole) with reference to the partners of the European team as they arrived in Ireland for the 2006 Ryder Cup at The K Club, Straffan, County Kildare.\n\"CWAGs\" (Cricket Wives and Girlfriends) was applied to partners of the England cricket team in the series of test matches against Australia that began in Brisbane, Queensland in November 2006: for example, \"Jessica the Cwag knocks Ashes Test crowd for six\" (the subject of this headline being singer Jessica Taylor, of the group Liberty X, fiancée of batsman and occasional off-spinner Kevin Pietersen). Although \"CWAG\" (rather than \"WAG\") was not used all that widely, there were predictable claims after England had lost the series 5–0 that the presence of wives and girlfriends had undermined the cohesion of the touring party. \"WAG\" had previously been applied in the context of cricket: for example to model Minki van der Westhuizen, who had been associated with the South African captain, Graeme Smith.\n\nMore recently, the Australian media has started to use the \"WAG\" term to describe the partners of their own cricket team. See Australian Cricket WAGs.\n\nIn July 2006 \"The Sun\" carried an article on the \"RAGs\" (\"Royals and Girlfriends\"), a term introduced for young female members of the British Royal Family, as well as Kate Middleton, then girlfriend and now wife of Prince William, and Chelsy Davy, then girlfriend of Prince Harry. Others identified as \"RAGs\" were Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, champion equestrian eventer Zara Phillips, and Lady Gabriella Windsor. Subsequently, under the heading \"Windsor Mads outdo the Wags\", Jasper Gerard reported in the \"Sunday Times\" on festivities involving \"the Windsor Mads (mothers and daughters), as Fergie [Sarah, Duchess of York] and Eugenie celebrated Beatrice's forthcoming 18th birthday\".\n\nThough the term has never been used, many high-profile sportsmen in motor racing have publicly enjoyed high-profile relationships with celebrities, for instance Jacques Villeneuve's relationship with Dannii Minogue and the former marriage of Dario Franchitti and Ashley Judd.\n\nOne example of a well known wife of a sportsman is Michaela Fogarty, the wife of former Superbike World Championship star Carl. At the height of her husband's fame, she has been photographed in pit and paddock areas and has also appeared in print advertisements for Ducati motorcycles, which her husband has ridden for. Despite never appearing in the spotlight, much of her popularity is within the motorcycling fraternity, as she is known for her support of her husband. The two have even appeared in a series which they embark on an adventure riding.\n\nMany partners of Rugby League players are increasingly being associated with the WAGs term by the media. Examples include Terry Biviano, Candice Falzon and Lauryn Eagle\n\nMany partners of Rugby Union players are increasingly being associated with the WAGs term by the media. Examples include The Saturdays singer Una Healy who is married to English rugby player Ben Foden and actress Susie Amy who is in a relationship with Irish rugby player Rob Kearney. The British equestrian and grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II Zara Phillips has been labelled a WAG for her marriage to English centre Mike Tindall.\n\nNew Zealand field hockey player Honor Dillon has been called a WAG since her marriage to out-half Dan Carter. Irish model Holly Carpenter also has the WAG title from the press due to being the girlfriend of Cian Healy.\n\nThe traditional Scottish sport of shinty has developed the terminology \"SWAGs\" to refer to the wives and partners of shinty players. The terms was given further credence by an hour long documentary on BBC Alba, following various partners throughout a shinty season. Some of the \"SWAGs\" featured in the programme have been given further prominence in print and at shinty events.\n\nOther imitative acronyms to emerge in 2006 included:\n\nIn an irreverent parody – \"Those World Cup Acronyms in Full\" – the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\" (which had, among other things, imagined a table-top game, with a Gucci ball, called \"Subbuteo Footballers' Wives\" and referred to Coleen (McLoughlin) Rooney as \"Noleen McCleavage\") offered such additional terms as \"SHAGS\" (\"unofficial girlfriends whose numbers appear on footballers' mobile phones\") and \"GAGS\" (\"Writs served by footballers accused of relationships with SHAGS\"). Both of these were allusions to rumours two years earlier about the private life of an England international player.\n\nFollowing the weddings of four England players in a single weekend in 2007, the \"Eye\"'s \"Glenda Slagg\" column referred jokingly to \"SLAGS\": \"that's 'Stupid Lazy and Grasping Slappers' – Geddit?!?\".\n\nIn an October 2008 press conference, England and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand heavily criticised the WAGS culture, particularly in Baden-Baden two years previously, calling it a \"circus\" and giving praise to new England manager Fabio Capello's more disciplined regime, and after England had qualified for the 2010 World Cup by beating Croatia 5–1, Capello made his first public comment on the WAGs by making it clear that the England players will only be able to see their wives and partners the day after a match, stating that \"We are there to play, not for a holiday\". As it happened, the England team were knocked out of that tournament at an even earlier stage.\n\nIn the Estelle song \"American Boy\", Kanye West raps the lyrics; \"But I still talk that ca-a-sh, Cuz a lotta WAGS wanna hear it\". Two novels have been published about WAGs. The first, \"A Wag's Diary\", was released in October 2007, published by Harper Collins; the second, \"A Wag's Diary in LA\", was published in June 2008. Both books are written by Alison Kervin.\n\nA 2015 American reality television series titled \"WAGS\" aired on the E! network, featuring both the professional and personal lives of several WAGs. Two spin-off series, \"WAGS Miami\" and \"WAGS Atlanta\", were also produced, focusing on WAGs in Miami and Atlanta, respectively. VH1's \"Basketball Wives\" and its various spin-offs have also featured the concept, instead involving the significant others of professional basketball players.\n\n"}
