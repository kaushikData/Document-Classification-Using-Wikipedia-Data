{"id": "3279786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3279786", "title": "Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems", "text": "Comparison of the imperial and US customary measurement systems\n\nBoth the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement derive from earlier English systems used in the Middle Ages, that were the result of a combination of the local Anglo-Saxon units inherited from German tribes and Roman units brought by William the Conqueror after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.\n\nHaving this shared heritage, the two systems are quite similar, but there are differences. The US customary system is based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial system was defined in 1824, after American independence.\n\nVolume may be measured either in terms of units of cubic length or with specific volume units. The units of cubic length (the cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic mile, etc.) are the same in the imperial and US customary systems but with the specific units of volume (the bushel, gallon, fluid ounce, etc.) they differ. The US customary system has one set of units for fluids and another set for dry goods. The imperial system has only one set defined independently of and subdivided differently from its US counterparts.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century various systems of volume measurement were in use throughout the British Empire. Wine was measured with units based on the Queen Anne's gallon of 231 cubic inches (3.785 L). Beer was measured with units based on an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (4.621 L). Grain was measured with the Winchester measure with a gallon of approximately 268.8 cubic inches (one eighth of a Winchester bushel or 4.405 L). In 1824 these were replaced with a single system based on the imperial gallon. \nOriginally defined as the volume of of distilled water (under certain conditions), then redefined by the Weights and Measures Act 1985 to be exactly (277.4 cu in), the imperial gallon is close in size to the old ale gallon.\n\nThe Winchester measure was made obsolete in the British Empire but remained in use in the US. The Winchester bushel was replaced with an imperial bushel of 8 imperial gallons. The subdivisions of the bushel were maintained. As with US dry measures the imperial system divides the bushel into 4 pecks, 8 gallons, 32 quarts or 64 pints. Thus all of these imperial measures are about 3% larger than their US dry measure counterparts.\n\nFluid measure is not as straightforward. The American colonists adopted a system based on the 231-cubic-inch wine gallon for all fluid purposes. This became the US fluid gallon. Both the imperial and US fluid gallon are divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints or 32 gills. However, whereas the US gill is divided into 4 US fluid ounces, the imperial gill is divided into 5 imperial fluid ounces. So whilst the imperial gallon, quart, pint and gill are about 20% larger than their US fluid measure counterparts, the fluid ounce is about 4% smaller. Note that one avoirdupois ounce of water has an approximate volume of one imperial fluid ounce at 62 °F (16.67 °C). This convenient fluid-ounce-to-avoirdupois-ounce relation does not exist in the US system.\n\nOne noticeable comparison between the imperial system and the US system is between some Canadian and American beer bottles. Many Canadian brewers package beer in a 12-imperial-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 341 mL each. American brewers package their beer in 12-US-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 355 mL each. This results in the Canadian bottles being labelled as 11.5 fl oz in US units when imported into the United States. Because Canadian beer bottles predate the adoption of the Metric System in that country, they are still sold and labelled in Canada as 341 mL. Canned beer in Canada is sold and labelled in 355 mL cans, and when exported to the US are labelled as 12 fl oz.\n\nThe international yard is defined as exactly 0.9144 metres. This definition was agreed by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand through the international yard and pound agreement of 1959.\n\nThe US survey foot and survey mile have been maintained as separate units for surveying purposes to avoid the accumulation of error that would follow replacing them with the international versions, particularly with State Plane Coordinate Systems. (The choice of unit for surveying purposes is based on the unit used when the overall framework or geodetic datum for the region was established, so that - for example - much of the former British empire still uses the Clarke foot for surveying.) The US survey foot is defined so that 1 metre is exactly 39.37 inches, making the international foot of 0.3048 metres exactly two parts per million shorter. This is a difference of just over 3.2 mm or a little over one eighth of an inch per mile.\n\nThe main units of length (inch, foot, yard and international mile) were the same in the US, though the US rarely uses some of the intermediate units, such as the (surveyor's) chain (22 yards) and the furlong (220 yards).\n\nAt one time the definition of the nautical mile was based on the sphere whose surface is the same as the Clarke Ellipsoid. In the US, the full value of 1853.256 metres was used, but in the Commonwealth, this was rounded to 6080 feet (1853.184 m). These have been replaced by the international version, which rounds the sixtieth part of the 45° to the nearest metre, as 1852 metres.\n\nTraditionally, both Britain and the US used three different weight systems: troy weight for precious metals, avoirdupois weight for most other purposes and apothecaries' weight for medicines. However, apothecaries' weight has now been superseded by the metric system.\n\nOne important difference is the widespread use in Britain of the stone of 14 pounds () for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence was seen in the practice, until World War II, of selling flour by a barrel of 196 pounds (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the \"troy pound\" () on January 6, 1879, leaving only the \"troy ounce\" () and its decimal subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and pennyweight are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.\n\nIn all the systems, the fundamental unit is the pound (lb), and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it. The tables of imperial troy mass and apothecaries' mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling \"drachm\" in the table of apothecaries' mass. The table of imperial avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound, but above that point the tables differ.\n\nThe imperial system has a hundredweight, defined as eight stone or 112 lb (), whereas a US hundredweight is 100 lb (). In both systems, 20 hundredweights make a ton. In the US, the terms \"long ton\" (, ) and \"short ton\" (; ) are used to distinguish them. The term \"metric ton\" is also used to denote a tonne (, ), which is about 2% less than the long ton.\n\n"}

The sovereign credit rating indicates the risk level of the investing environment of a country and is used by investors when looking to invest in particular jurisdictions, and also takes into account political risk.\n\nThe \"country risk rankings\" table shows the ten least-risky countries for investment . Ratings are further broken down into components including political risk, economic risk. Euromoney's bi-annual country risk index monitors the political and economic stability of 185 sovereign countries. Results focus foremost on economics, specifically sovereign default risk or payment default risk for exporters (also known as a trade credit risk).\n\nA. M. Best defines \"country risk\" as the risk that country-specific factors could adversely affect an insurer's ability to meet its financial obligations.\n\nA rating expresses the likelihood that the rated party will go into default within a given time horizon. In general, a time horizon of one year or under is considered short term, and anything above that is considered long term. In the past institutional investors preferred to consider long-term ratings. Nowadays, short-term ratings are commonly used.\n\nCredit ratings can address a corporation's financial instruments i.e. debt security such as a bond, but also the corporations itself. Ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, the largest of which are Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings. They use letter designations such as A, B, C. Higher grades are intended to represent a lower probability of default.\n\nAgencies do not attach a hard number of probability of default to each grade, preferring descriptive definitions such as: \"the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong,\" or \"less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues ...\" (Standard and Poors' definition of an AAA-rated and a BB-rated bond respectively).\nHowever, some studies have estimated the average risk and reward of bonds by rating. One study by Moody's claimed that over a \"5-year time horizon\" bonds it gave its highest rating (Aaa) to had a \"cumulative default rate\" of 0.18%, the next highest (Aa2) 0.28%, the next (Baa2) 2.11%, 8.82% for the next (Ba2), and 31.24% for the lowest it studied (B2). (See \"Default rate\" in \"Estimated spreads and default rates by rating grade\" table to right.) Over a longer period, it stated \"the order is by and large, but not exactly, preserved\".\nAnother study in \"Journal of Finance\" calculated the additional interest rate or \"spread\" corporate bonds pay over that of \"riskless\" US Treasury bonds, according to the bonds' rating. (See \"Basis point spread\" in table to right.) Looking at rated bonds for 1973–89, the authors found a AAA-rated bond paid 43 \"basis points\" (or 43/100 of a percentage point) over a US Treasury bond (so that it would yield 3.43% if the Treasury yielded 3.00%). A CCC-rated \"junk\" (or speculative) bond, on the other hand, paid over 7% (724 basis points) more than a Treasury bond on average over that period.\n\nDifferent rating agencies may use variations of an alphabetical combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, with either plus or minus signs or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating (see colored chart). The Standard & Poor's rating scale uses uppercase letters and pluses and minuses.\nThe Moody's rating system uses numbers and lowercase letters as well as uppercase.\n\nWhile Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings control approximately 95% of the credit ratings business, they are not the only rating agencies. DBRS's long-term ratings scale is somewhat similar to Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings with the words high and low replacing the + and −. It goes as follows, from excellent to poor: AAA, AA (high), AA, AA (low), A (high), A, A (low), BBB (high), BBB, BBB (low), BB (high), BB, BB (low), B (high), B, B (low), CCC (high), CCC, CCC (low), CC (high), CC, CC (low), C (high), C, C (low) and D. The short-term ratings often map to long-term ratings though there is room for exceptions at the high or low side of each equivalent.\n\nS&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS are the only four ratings agencies that are recognized by the European Central Bank (ECB) for determining collateral requirements for banks to borrow from the central bank. The ECB uses a first, best rule among the four agencies that have the designated ECAI status, which means that it takes the highest rating among the four agencies – S&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS – to determine haircuts and collateral requirements for borrowing. Ratings in Europe have been under close scrutiny, particularly the highest ratings given to countries like Spain, Ireland and Italy, because they affect how much banks can borrow against sovereign debt they hold.\n\nA. M. Best rates from excellent to poor in the following manner: A++, A+, A, A−, B++, B+, B, B−, C++, C+, C, C−, D, E, F, and S. The CTRISKS rating system is as follows: CT3A, CT2A, CT1A, CT3B, CT2B, CT1B, CT3C, CT2C and CT1C. All these CTRISKS grades are mapped to one-year probability of default.\n\n\nIndividuals:\n"}

{"id": "380683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380683", "title": "Endowment (Mormonism)", "text": "Endowment (Mormonism)\n\nIn Mormonism, the endowment is an ordinance (ceremony) designed to prepare participants to become kings, queens, priests, and priestesses in the afterlife. As part of the ceremony, participants take part in a scripted reenactment of the Biblical creation and fall of Adam and Eve. The ceremony includes a symbolic washing and anointing, and receipt of a \"new name\" which they are not to reveal to others except at a certain part in the ceremony, and the receipt of the temple garment, which Mormons then are expected to wear under their clothing day and night throughout their life. Participants are taught symbolic gestures and passwords considered necessary to pass by angels guarding the way to heaven, and are instructed not to reveal them to others. As practiced today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the endowment also consists of a series of covenants (promises to God) that participants make, such as a covenant of consecration to the LDS Church. All Latter-day Saints who choose to serve as missionaries for the LDS Church or who choose to contract a celestial marriage in an LDS Church temple must first complete the endowment ceremony.\n\nThe endowment as practiced today was instituted by founder Joseph Smith in the 1840s with further contributions by Brigham Young and his successors. The ceremony is performed in Latter Day Saint temples, which are dedicated specifically for the endowment and certain other ordinances sacred to Mormons, and are open only to Mormons who meet certain requirements. There was a brief period during the construction of the Salt Lake Temple where a small building referred to as the Endowment House was used to administer the endowment ordinance. The endowment is currently practiced by the LDS Church, several denominations of Mormon fundamentalism, and a few other Mormon denominations. The LDS Church has simplified its ceremony from its 19th century form and has removed some of the more controversial elements.\n\nA distinct endowment ceremony was also performed in the 1830s in the Kirtland Temple, the first temple of the broader Latter Day Saint movement, which includes other smaller churches such as the Community of Christ. The term \"endowment\" thus has various meanings historically, and within the other branches of the Latter-Day Saint movement.\n\nThe prevalence of LDS members who undergo the endowment ceremony is difficult to determine. However, estimates show that fewer than half of converts to the LDS Church ultimately undergo the endowment ceremony, and young people preparing for missions account for about one-third of \"live\" endowments (as contrasted with proxy endowments for the deceased).\n\nLatter-day Saints cite various Old Testament references to temple ordinances such as those found in Exodus 29:4-9 and Exodus 28:2-43 and Leviticus 8:6-13. The words \"HOLINESS TO THE LORD\" can be found on LDS temples as referenced in Exodus 28:36.\n\nThe Latter-day Saint temple is referred to as a \"house of learning\" since it is a \"kind of educational environment teaching by action and educating through ritual.\" The endowment ordinance, as presented in Latter-day Saint temples, has been referred to as a \"ritual drama\" that commemorates episodes of sacred history due to its “theatrical setting.” When viewed as a restoration of ancient rites, the ritual drama and aesthetic environment in which the endowment is presented are both rich in Judeo-Christian symbolism. Comparative studies of the art, architecture, and rituals found in Mormonism, such as the endowment, reveal parallels to early Catholic and Jewish traditions.\n\nThe meaning and scope of the term \"endowment\" evolved during the early Latter Day Saint movement, of which Mormonism is a part. The term derives from the Authorized King James Version, referring to the spiritual gifts given the disciples of Jesus on the day of Pentecost, in which they were \"endowed with power from on high,\" Christians generally understand this endowment to refer to the gift of the Holy Spirit, which the Latter Day Saints believe is given at the Confirmation ceremony. In 1831, however, Smith began teaching that the elders of the church needed to be further \"endowed with power from on high\" in order to be effective proselytizers. He therefore gathered the elders together at a General Conference in June 1831 and \"endowed\" them with this power by ordaining them to the High Priesthood.\n\nBy the mid-1830s, Smith was teaching that a further endowment was necessary, this time requiring the completion of the Kirtland Temple as a house of God where God could pour out his Holy Spirit. Upon the completion of the Kirtland Temple after three years of construction (1833–1836), the elders of the church gathered for this second promised endowment in early 1836. The Kirtland endowment included a ritual ceremony involving preparatory washings and anointings with oil, followed by a gathering in the temple in which many reported spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and visions.\n\nThe Nauvoo endowment consists of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consists of a washing and anointing, culminating in the clothing of the patron in a \"Garment of the Holy Priesthood\", which is thereafter worn as an undergarment.\n\nThe instructional and testing phase of the endowment consists of a scripted reenactment of Adam and Eve's experience in the Garden of Eden (performed by live actors—called officiators; in the mid-20th century certain portions were adapted to a film presentation). The instruction is punctuated with oaths, symbolic gestures, and a prayer around an altar, and at the end of instruction, the initiate's knowledge of symbolic gestures and key-words is tested at a \"veil.\"\n\nOn May 3, 1842, Joseph Smith prepared the second floor of his Red Brick Store, in Nauvoo, Illinois, to represent \"the interior of a temple as circumstances would permit\". The next day, May 4, he introduced the Nauvoo endowment ceremony to nine associates: Associate President and Patriarch to the Church Hyrum (Joseph Smith's brother); first counselor in the First Presidency, William Law; three of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards; Nauvoo stake president, William Marks; two bishops, Newel K. Whitney and George Miller; and a close friend, Judge James Adams of Springfield, Illinois.\n\nConcerning the day's activities, Smith recorded:\nThroughout 1843 and 1844 Smith continued to initiate other men, as well as women, into the endowment ceremony. By the time of his death on June 27, 1844, more than 50 persons had been admitted into the Anointed Quorum, the name by which this group called themselves.\n\nThere are many similarities between Smith's endowment ceremony and certain rituals of Freemasonry, particularly the Royal Arch degree. These specific similarities included instruction in various signs, tokens, and passwords, and the imposition of various forms of the penalties for revealing them. The original wording of the penalties, for example, closely followed the wording of the Masonic penalties.\n\nAccording to the predominant view by historians, Smith used and adapted material from the Masonic rituals in creating the endowment ceremony. All of those first initiated by Smith on May 4, 1842, were longstanding or recent Masons: Adams was the Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Illinois; Whitney, Miller and Kimball had previously been Lodge Masters; Smith's brother, Hyrum, had been a Mason since 1827; and the remaining five participants (Law, Marks, Young, Richards, and Smith himself) had been initiated as Freemasons just weeks before the meeting. However, none of these Masons ever charged Smith with breaking any of Masonry's oaths or revealing its secrets. As a matter of fact, one Mormon historian has noted that these Masonic parallels confirmed to these men \"the breath of the restoration impulse and was evidence of Smith's divine calling\".\n\nThe LDS Church has never commented officially on these similarities, although certain features of the two rituals have been called \"analogous\" by one official Church Historian. The LDS Church apostle John A. Widtsoe downplayed the similarities, arguing that they \"do not deal with the basic matters [the endowment] but rather with the mechanism of the ritual.\" One LDS Church educator, however, was censured in the 1970s by the Church Educational System for arguing that the endowment ceremony had a dependent relationship with the rituals of freemasonry.\n\nSome within the LDS Church, particularly Smith's contemporaries, have expressed the view that the endowment was given anciently by God in its original form at the Temple of Solomon, but that the form of the ritual degenerated into the form used by Freemasons. Heber C. Kimball clearly supported this position: \"We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing\"\n\nAfter Smith officiated in Brigham Young's endowment in 1842 Smith told him, \"Brother Brigham, this is not arranged perfectly; however we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed. I wish you to take this matter in hand: organize and systematize all these ceremonies\". Young did as Smith directed, and under Young's direction the Nauvoo endowment ceremony was introduced to the church at large in the Nauvoo Temple during the winter of 1845–46. A spacious hall in the temple's attic was arranged into appropriate ordinance \"rooms\" using canvas partitions. Potted plants were used in areas representing the Garden of Eden, and other areas were furnished appropriately, including a room representing the celestial kingdom. Over 5,500 persons received their endowments in this temple.\n\nYoung introduced the same ceremony in the Utah Territory in the 1850s, first in the Endowment House and then in the St. George Temple. During this period the ceremony had never been written down, but was passed orally from temple worker to worker. Shortly after the dedication of the St. George Temple, and before his death in 1877, Young became concerned about the possibility of variations in the ceremony within the church's temples and so directed the majority of the text of the endowment to be written down. This document became the standard for the ceremony thereafter. Also in 1877, the first endowments for the dead were performed in the St. George Temple.\n\nIn 1893, minor alterations in the text were made in an attempt to bring uniformity to the ceremony as administered in the temples. Between 1904 and 1906, the temple ceremony received very public scrutiny during the 1904 Senate investigation of LDS Apostle and U.S. Senator, Reed Smoot. Of particular concern to senators was the ceremony's \"law of vengeance\", in which, during the hearings, it was revealed that participants took an oath of vengeance to pray that God would \"avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation\". The \"prophets\" were Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and \"this nation\" was the United States.\n\nBeginning in 1919, church president Heber J. Grant appointed a committee charged with revising the ceremony, which was done under the direction of Apostle George F. Richards from 1921 to 1927. Richards received permission to write down the previously unwritten portions of the ceremony. Among his revisions was the elimination of the \"law of vengeance\". Previous versions of the ceremony into the 1880s also had the representative of the Lord cut the symbols in the garments with a knife through the veil, with one source suggesting an early version cut into the knee of the participant to create a scar. The committee also removed the violent language from the \"penalty\" portions of the ceremony. Prior to 1927, participants made an oath that if they ever revealed the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would be subject to the following:\n\nThe first filmed versions of the endowment were introduced in the 1950s, by a committee headed by Gordon B. Hinckley. That change was initiated by church president David O. McKay as a way of providing the instruction simultaneously in different languages, an innovation made necessary by the construction of the Bern Switzerland Temple, the church's first temple in Europe. , ceremonies in all but two (Salt Lake Temple and Manti Temple) of the church's 128 operating temples are presented using the filmed version.\n\nIn 1990, further changes included the elimination of all blood oaths and penalties. These penalties, representing what the member would rather suffer than reveal the sacred signs given them in the ceremony, were symbolized by gestures for having the throat cut, the breast cut open, and the bowels torn out. Changes also included the elimination of the five points of fellowship, the role of the preacher, and all reference to Lucifer's \"popes and priests\" were dropped. The ceremony was also changed to lessen the differences in treatment between men and women. Women no longer are required to covenant to obey their husbands, but instead must covenant only to follow their husbands as their husbands follow God. Also, Eve is no longer explicitly blamed for the Fall, and several references to Adam were replaced with references to Adam and Eve. The lecture at the veil was also cut, and some repetition was eliminated.\n\nA 1996 estimate by Richard Cowan states that around 150 million endowments have been performed, most of which were in behalf of deceased persons.\n\nThe most well-known Mormon endowment ceremony is that performed by the LDS Church in its temples. This ceremony is open only to members of the church deemed worthy and given a \"temple recommend\" by their ecclesiastical leaders after one or more personal interviews. It comprises four parts:\n\nThe \"initiatory\" is a prelude to the endowment proper, similar to Chrismation, and consists of (1) instruction, (2) multiple symbolic washing and anointing ordinances, (3) being clothed in the temple garment, and (4) receiving a \"new name\" in preparation for the endowment.\n\nWashing and anointing are perhaps the earliest practiced temple ordinances for the living since the organization of the LDS Church. There is evidence that these ordinances have been performed since 1832. They were first practiced in the Whitney Store as part of the School of the Prophets and were part of the Kirtland endowment.\n\nAs part of the endowment ceremony, the ordinance of washing and anointing symbolizes the ritual cleansing of priests that took place at Israel's Tabernacle, Solomon's Temple, and the Second Temple, later known as Herod's Temple. The washing symbolizes being \"cleansed from the blood of this generation,\" and being anointed to become \"clean from the blood and sins of this generation.\"\nAfter the washing and anointing, the patron is given the temple garment, formally called the \"Garment of the Holy Priesthood\". This garment represents the \"coats of skins\" given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.\n\nSimilar ordinances are performed for the living and the dead in LDS temples, where men are:\nWomen receive the same ordinances, except for the ordination.\n\nAs the final part of the initiatory, the patron is given a new name, which is a key word used during the ceremony. In general, this name is only known to the person to whom it is given; however, an endowed LDS woman reveals her name to her endowed husband (but not vice versa). The \"new name\" is supported in part by Book of Revelation 2:17 and 3:12, referring to a \"white stone\" with \"a new name written\" thereon. According to some sources, the same male and female names are given to each man and woman participating in the ceremony on a given day, depending on whether they are receiving the endowment for themselves or on behalf of a deceased person. If a new name coincides with their own name, \"Adam\" or \"Eve\" is given instead.\n\nMost Latter-day Saints who attend the temple believe that the endowment focuses heavily on the plan of salvation and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Parts of the plan of salvation explained include:\n\n\nThe following description is given in an LDS Church publication of what to expect when one enters the temple:\n\nThe endowment is often thought of as a series of lectures where Latter-day Saints are taught about the creation of the world, the events in the Garden of Eden, what happened after Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden into the \"telestial world\", and the progression of righteous individuals through \"terrestrial\" laws to the celestial kingdom and exaltation.\nDuring the ceremony, Latter-day Saints are dressed in temple clothes or temple robes, are taught about various gospel laws (including obedience, chastity, sacrifice and consecration) and make covenants to obey these laws. The early Mormon leader Brigham Young taught that participants are given \"signs and tokens\" that \"enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels\" and gain eternal exaltation. At the end of the ceremony, the participant is \"tested\" on their knowledge of what he or she was taught and covenanted to do and then admitted into the celestial room, where he or she may meditate and pray.\n\nThe LDS Church defines a covenant as:\nThe temple ceremony involves entering into solemn covenants. Critics have expressed concern that a person may be denied access to the specific details of these covenants until that person is faced with making them in the temple, making it impossible to reflect on their meaning or ramifications. The LDS Church does offer a temple preparation seminar and freely publishes both the student booklet, \"Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple\", and the teacher's manual, \"Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar\", on its website. These books and the seminar which may be held are designed to help prepare members for the temple; attendance at the seminar is often required before a bishop will issue a temple recommend for the first time to a member. In the seminar, it is taught that all of the covenants entered into during the endowment have a basis in Latter-day Saint scripture; however, the specifics of the covenants are not revealed.\n\nAt the end of the endowment ceremony the participant is tested at a physical veil by a man representing the Lord on the signs and tokens just learned. Before 1990 at the veil the participant also put their arm around and pressed their cheek, shoulders, knees and feet against the person through the veil in what was called \"the five points of fellowship.\"\n\nThe endowment is open only to Mormons who have a valid \"temple recommend.\" To be eligible to receive a temple recommend, one must be deemed worthy by church leadership and have been a member of the LDS Church for at least one year. A male member of the church must hold the Melchizedek priesthood to participate in the endowment. A temple recommend is signed by the person receiving the recommend, a member of the person's bishopric and a member of the stake presidency, who each perform a personal, one-on-one \"worthiness interview.\" Persons seeking a recommend to attend the temple for the first time and receive their endowment will generally meet with their bishop and stake president.\n\nThese interviews cover what the church believes to be the most important factors of personal morality and worthiness, including whether the person has a basic belief in key church doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus and the restoration; whether the person attends church meetings and supports the leadership of the LDS Church; whether the person affiliates with Mormon fundamentalists or other people considered by the church to be apostate; whether the person is honest and lives the law of chastity and the Word of Wisdom; whether the person abuses family members; whether the person pays tithing and any applicable spousal or child support; and whether the person has confessed to serious past sins.\n\nPrior to participating in the endowment, members of the LDS Church frequently participate in a six-part temple preparation class which discusses temple-related topics but does not directly discuss the details of the ceremony.\n\nOfficial church publications state that temple ceremonies are confidential and not to be discussed outside the temple. B. H. Roberts declared that certain aspects of the endowment ceremony were intended to be \"secret from the world\". In this regard, Facsimile No. 2 in the Book of Abraham (part of the LDS Church standard works) clarifies that there are things that \"cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in the Holy Temple of God.\" This information includes, in the initiation and instructional/testing phases of the endowment ceremony, certain \"names\" and symbolic gestures called \"tokens\" and \"signs.\" Prior to revisions in 1990, the LDS Church's version of the endowment also included a gesture called a \"penalty.\" The ceremony stated that the \"representation of the execution of the penalties indicates different ways in which life may be taken\". However, the LDS Church has removed the \"penalty\" portions of the ceremony, protecting the \"names\", \"tokens,\" and \"signs\" by a simple \"covenant and promise.\" Still, such information has been published in various sources, unauthorized by the LDS Church.\n\nOther than the ceremony's signs and tokens (and formerly penalties), which remain a central part of the ceremonies, the remainder of the ceremony carries with it no covenants of secrecy. However, most Latter-day Saints are generally unwilling to discuss the specific details of the ceremony. Latter-day Saints commonly state that the rituals are \"sacred\" but not \"secret,\" and Latter-day Saint apostle Boyd K. Packer has encouraged members not to \"discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples\".\n\nIn practice, Latter-day Saints keep silent about the ceremony for numerous reasons. Most Latter-day Saints hold the making of these covenants to be highly sacred. Most church members also believe that details of the ceremony should be kept from those who are not properly prepared. Many Latter-day Saints believe that Jesus often taught in parables for the same reason. Other Latter-day Saints remain silent about the ceremony because they believe that its meaning cannot be properly conveyed without the experience in the temple. Brigham Young stated:\n\nIn addition, church members are colloquially taught that the only place where the temple ceremonies should be discussed, even amongst faithful members, is within the temple.\n\nSome Mormons have suggested that the Latter-day Saint reluctance to discuss the endowment encourages attacks and unauthorized exposés by evangelical Christians and others, and therefore advocate a more transparent attitude toward the ceremony.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35947951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35947951", "title": "Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives", "text": "Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives are sensitive and incriminating collections of documents from Britain's former colonial governments that were sent back to the UK (hence \"migrated\") on the eve of decolonisation for storage in the FCO archives to avoid their disclosure and subsequent embarrassment to Her Majesty's Government. A great many similar documents were not repatriated, but instead destroyed.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1994 the migrated archives were stored in Hayes repository; in 1994 they were moved to Hanslope Park, home of Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre, to save on storage costs. In 1967, in 1974, and again in the early 1980s, Kenya asked for them to be released, but the UK refused.\n\nBen Macintyre of the \"Times\" summarised the procedure for declassifying Foreign Office archival material as follows:\n\nIn 2005, two Freedom of Information (FoI) requests were submitted to the FCO by researchers wanting Mau Mau-era government files. The second request was very specific, and did not warrant checking the migrated archives, but the first request should have warranted such a check, yet none was made. More seriously still, in 2006, lawyers for Leigh Day, the legal firm representing former Mau Mau members who were attempting to sue the UK for their torture during the uprising, submitted a court disclosure request for \"a final tranche of documents relating to the suppression of the Mau Mau\" that the government was \"refusing to release\"; the FCO response explicitly denied the existence of this tranche of documents, i.e. the migrated archives, stating that all information they had held had been transferred to The National Archives (TNA). The Treasury Solicitor's response to Leigh Day went even further, stating that not only were all relevant documents with TNA but that they were also in the public domain. It was only the persistence of a handful of FCO officials, notably Edward Inglett, and a witness statement by Oxford professor David Anderson in December 2010 alleging \"systematic withholding by HMG of 1,500 files in 300 boxes taking up 100 linear feet\", that eventually resulted in the migrated archives coming to light in January 2011.\n\nUpon their 'discovery', Foreign Secretary William Hague requested Anthony Cary, a former British High Commissioner to Canada, to conduct an internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request. Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows:\n\nThough sympathetic to the FCO, Cary's report nonetheless judged that despite the involvement of relatively junior staff, who had been genuinely ignorant about the contents of the migrated archives, there were more knowledgeable staff who had not been. Conveniently, in 2006, after the FoI requests came in, the fifty-year-old migrated archives were relocated to the section for \"FCO material of between 3 and 30 years old\".\n\nOne excuse offered by the FCO for their failure to consult the files was that the ownership of the papers was confused, that the FCO merely possessed stewardship, thus the archives had been considered \"out of bounds\" for FoI requests (the FCO were not the owners, so they did not have the right to go through the documents). Cary, however, managed to uncover the fact that this was not the case, that there had been \"major exceptions to the general principle that these papers have been considered 'out of bounds'.\" Such an excuse became irrelevant after the 2006 legal request from Leigh Day because \"all\" documents have to be checked when it comes to court cases. \"It was perhaps convenient to [think] that the migrated archives . . . did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the 'too difficult' tray\", Cary concluded.\n\nAfter making Cary's report public in May 2011, Hague declared his \"intention to release every part of every paper of interest subject only to legal exemptions\"; \"the sooner the better\", urged David Anderson. Edward Inglett conveyed \"sincere and unreserved apologies on the FCO's behalf to both the claimants and the court\", and the Foreign Office promised a \"process of transparency\" and the appointment by Hague of an independent \"colonial files tsar\" to oversee the release as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe search that turned up the \"lost\" documents on Mau Mau revealed a second raft of documents had also been \"lost\" and, hopefully, also therefore awaited discovery. This second batch included files on: the rebellion against British rule in Cyprus; Special Branch; the Colonial Office's use of witch doctors during Mau Mau; Uganda; Nigeria; and Sierra Leone. This second batch were labelled \"Top Secret\" and held separately from the other files \"migrated\" from former colonies, which suggests they contain the most sensitive and incriminating material.\n\nDocuments that were to be left to post-independence governments, known as \"legacy files\", were separated from \"watch files\", which were marked for destruction or repatriation. In Uganda, the process was codenamed Operation Legacy; in Kenya, the process was described as \"a thorough purge\" and directed by colonial Special Branch officers. Africans were forbidden from involvement: only \"a servant of the Kenya government who is a British subject of European descent\" could participate. The watch-file instructions also made clear to leave no trace of their existence to successor governments: \"The legacy files must leave no reference to watch material. Indeed, the very existence of the watch series, though it may be guessed at, should never be revealed.\" If possible, a dummy file was inserted to ensure file and page numbering was uninterrupted by the cull; when too many dummies were needed, they simply removed or destroyed the entire section. In Kenya, instructions insisted that \"emphasis is placed upon destruction\", meaning much of the most shocking material was probably destroyed, and \"the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up\", so that not even a trace of the destruction was left. Large quantities of files were also \"packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast\". Malaya's purge was less rigorous, and was facilitated by less experienced officials.\n\nCary's report and the documents initially released had shown that, on 3 December 1963, nine days before Kenya formally declared independence, three wooden packing crates containing 1,500 highly sensitive government files were loaded on to a British United Airways flight bound for Gatwick. On the eve of Kenya's independence, Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod ordered that sensitive colonial-government documentation be destroyed or flown out of the country because its disclosure \"might embarrass Her Majesty's Government\". \"Embarrassment hardly covers it,\" remarked a \"Times\" editorial, noting that \"the covert history of colonial administration in Kenya bears comparison to the methods of torture and summary execution in the French war in Algeria.\" In April 2011, the government officially admitted for the first time not merely to having relevant Mau Mau documents, but that it had a total of 8,800 files from 37 ex-colonies, which it would make public in batches from April 2012 to November 2013. The \"Times\" opined: \"Even given the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's apparent skill in such matters, it is quite a feat to ignore 300 boxes of documents filling 110ft of shelving for almost half a century.\"\n\nDavid Anderson, describing the Mau Mau initial 2011 revelations as just a start, emphasised that other former British domains, including Malaya, Cyprus, and the Gulf States, likewise await a final reckoning, and that colonial personnel and tactics subsequently made their way into the policing of The Troubles. In particular, noted Aileen McColgan, the techniques alleged in 1950s Kenya were refined into what are now known as the \"five techniques\" for use in internment in 1970s Northern Ireland: wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink. She went on to note: \"The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1977 that Britain had breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and 'inhuman and degrading treatment', by the use of the five techniques in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, told the Commons in 1972 that the techniques would never again be used 'as an aid to interrogation', a commitment reiterated before the European Court.\"\n\nAfter the Cary investigation, Hague appointed Cambridge's Tony Badger as \"colonial files tsar\" to oversee the review and transfer of the hidden files to the public domain. The Foreign Office duly released a first batch of more than 1,200 records from 12 former colonial territories in April 2012, a portion of some 10,000 files that Britain removed from 37 of its colonies. Badger described the migrated archives episode as \"embarrassing, scandalous. . . . These documents should have been in the public archives in the 1980s. It's long overdue.\" Harvard's Caroline Elkins observed: \"At the time, Britain was in the middle of parallel, massive cover-ups. While the government was besieged publicly with allegations of brutalities in the detention camps and the cover-up of systematised violence—and denying all allegations—it was culling and purging the record. The process—practised in other colonies as well—deliberately sought to remove incriminating evidence. So, too, did it seek to shape the future colonial archive and the realities it would produce.\"\n\nIt is not the first time a UK government department has systematically withheld files regarding British colonial crimes—and not the first time that Professor Anderson has been involved in challenging it. As he and two colleagues noted in 2006 after their reconstruction of the Chuka massacre: \"Evidence on these events should have been released into the Public Record Office in 1984. The file was withheld by the Ministry of Defence and marked for closure until 2038. . . . But not everything on this [Chuka] file has been revealed: and that raises tough questions about the culpability of the British Army in colonial war crimes, official secrecy, and the inadequacies of Freedom of Information legislation\". In 2009, British taxpayers were presented with a £1 million bill after the Ministry of Defence failed to disclose relevant evidence in a 2009 court case involving allegations of murder by British troops in Iraq.\n\nThe \"Guardian\" stated:\nAs the \"Guardian\"'s summary shows, even after the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO continued to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: \"When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of '.\" Elkins agreed that it was \"frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off.\" Drayton also noted that the FCO \"refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled.\" Drayton further mused that \"it was almost as if the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c. 1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain.\"\n\nThere was wide agreement that the FCO was still withholding files. Keith Flett said: \"It is likely to be correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record.\" Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: \"This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming.\" Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it \"excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) in the context of the Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. . . . The first release of the 'migrated archives' is, at first glance, lacking in substantive files, particularly for former colonies like Cyprus and Malaya where future lawsuits potentially loom.\"\n\nLaleh Khalili of SOAS declared:\nJournalist Ian Cobain and others suggested that, owing to the nature of the British withdrawal from the Colony of Aden, the incriminating material may, instead of being withheld, actually have been more comprehensively destroyed at the time of decolonisation, rather than migrated.\n\nBadger accepted that historians believed the FCO was \"up to its old tricks again\", and added: \"Given the failure of the Foreign Office to acknowledge the existence of the migrated archives, I understand the legacy of suspicion. It is difficult to overestimate the degree of suspicion.\"\n\nOminously, the \"Guardian\" noted:\n\nDavid Anderson expressed alarm at the Foreign Office refusal to release the index of the files that might enable historians to know what is missing.\n\nRegarding the Mau Mau Uprising, the records included confirmation of \"the extent of the violence inflicted on suspected Mau Mau rebels\" in British detention camps documented in Caroline Elkins' study. Numerous allegations of murder and rape by British military personnel are recorded in the files, including an incident where an African baby was \"burnt to death\", the \"defilement of a young girl\", and a soldier in Royal Irish Fusiliers who killed \"in cold blood two people who had been his captives for over 12 hours\". Baring himself was aware of the \"extreme brutality\" of the sometimes-lethal torture meted out—which included \"most drastic\" beatings, solitary confinement, starvation, castration, whipping, burning, rape, sodomy, and forceful insertion of objects into orifices—but took no action. Baring's inaction was despite the urging of people like Arthur Young, Commissioner of Police for Kenya for less than eight months of 1954 before he resigned in protest, that \"the horror of some of the [camps] should be investigated without delay\". In February 1956, a provincial commissioner in Kenya, \"Monkey\" Johnson, wrote to Attorney General Reginald Manningham-Buller urging him to block any enquiry into the methods used against Mau Mau: \"It would now appear that each and every one of us, from the Governor downwards, may be in danger of removal from public service by a commission of enquiry as a result of enquiries made by the CID.\" The April 2012 release also included detailed accounts of the policy of seizing livestock from Kenyans suspected of supporting Mau Mau rebels.\n\nCommenting on the papers, David Anderson stated that the \"documents were hidden away to protect the guilty\", and \"that the extent of abuse now being revealed is truly disturbing.\" \"Everything that could happen did happen. Allegations about beatings and violence were widespread. Basically you could get away with murder. It was systematic\", Anderson said. An example of this impunity is the case of eight colonial officials accused of having prisoners tortured to death going unpunished even after their crimes were reported to London. Huw Bennett of King's College London, who had worked with Anderson on the Chuka massacre, said in a witness statement to the court that the new documents \"considerably strengthen\" the knowledge that the British Army were \"intimately involved\" with the colonial security forces, whom they knew were \"systematically abusing and torturing detainees in screening centres and detention camps\". In April 2011, lawyers for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office continued to maintain that there was no such policy. As early as November 1952, however, military reports noted that \"[t]he Army has been used for carrying out certain functions that properly belonged to the Police, eg. searching of huts and screening of Africans\", and British soldiers arrested and transferred Mau Mau suspects to camps where they were beaten and tortured until they confessed. Bennett said that \"the British Army retained ultimate operational control over all security forces throughout the Emergency\", and that its military intelligence operation worked \"hand in glove\" with the Kenyan Special Branch \"including in screening and interrogations in centres and detention camps\".\n\nThe Kenyan government sent a letter to Hague insisting that the UK government was legally liable for the atrocities. The Foreign Office, however, reaffirmed its position that it was not, in fact, liable for colonial atrocities, and argued that the documents had not \"disappeared\" as part of a cover up. Nearly ten years before, in late 2002, as the BBC aired a damning documentary on British crimes committed during the rebellion and 6,000 depositions had been taken for the legal case, former district colonial officer John Nottingham had expressed concern that compensation be paid soon, since most victims were in their 80s and would soon pass away. He told the BBC: \"What went on in the Kenya camps and villages was brutal, savage torture. It is time that the mockery of justice that was perpetrated in this country at that time, should be, must be righted. I feel ashamed to have come from a Britain that did what it did here [in Kenya].\"\n\nThirteen boxes of \"top secret\" Kenya files are still missing.\n\nThe release of material in 2011 sparked legal threats from veterans of EOKA, who fought a campaign against the British occupation of Cyprus.\n\nDavid French also utilised the FCO files on Cyprus from the Migrated Archives to prove that the British did not intentionally use a colonial policy of 'Divide and Rule' to flare up Community Tensions on the Island.\n\nThe April 2012 documents suggested that the British never intended peace talks with the rebels to succeed. The UK conspired with its Seychelles colony to deport the troublesome Archbishop Makarios even as the talks took place.\n\nIn 1943, Britain planned to test a \"very virulent\" type of poison gas in what was Bechuanaland (now Botswana). On 6 June 1943, Harold Eddey Priestman, Administrative Secretary to the High Commissioner in South Africa, sent a hand-written letter, marked \"secret and personal\", to Aubrey Denzil Forsyth-Thompson, Resident Commissioner of Bechuanaland, in which he explained: \"Certain types of poison gas are being manufactured in the union [South Africa] on UK account. The UK Ministry of Aircraft Production have now asked that practical trials may be carried out on a considerable scale. . . . We understand this poison gas is a very virulent type. It would therefore be necessary 1) to preclude access to the experimental area for a considerable time after the experiments had ceased. 2) and also to take into consideration any danger of the gas being carried by wind to areas adjacent to the experimental area.\"\n\nThe British looked for an \"isolated area\" within \"reasonable distance\" of an air base, that had a 15-mile buffer zone with no water sources, and that was \"comparatively free from vegetation\". Nowhere suitable could be found in South Africa, but they provisionally settled on somewhere in the Makgadikgadi Pan. Forsyth-Thompson later said that he was unwilling to consider testing in that area because it was surrounded by farms and it would be impossible to maintain secrecy. Under the codename of FORENSIC, air-launched trials were envisaged, but the approach of the rainy season prevented testing from going ahead. There is currently no evidence FORENSIC was actually executed.\n\nAlthough it was never deployed, Britain stockpiled poison gas because of fears of its possible use by Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2036479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036479", "title": "Guide book", "text": "Guide book\n\nA guide book or travel guide is \"a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists\". It will usually include information about sights, accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet.\n\nTravel guides can also take the form of travel websites.\n\nA forerunner of the guidebook was the \"periplus\", an itinerary from landmark to landmark of the ports along a coast. A \"periplus\" such as the \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" was a manuscript document that listed, in order, the ports and coastal landmarks, with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore. This work was possibly written in the middle of the 1st century CE. It served the same purpose as the later Roman itinerarium of road stops.\n\nThe \"periegesis\", or \"progress around\" was an established \"literary\" genre during the Hellenistic age. A lost work by Agaclytus describing Olympia () is referred to by the Suda and Photius. Dionysius Periegetes (literally, Dionysius the Traveller) was the author of a description of the habitable world in Greek hexameter verse written in a terse and elegant style, intended for the \"klismos\" traveller rather than the actual tourist on the ground; he is believed to have worked in Alexandria and to have flourished around the time of Hadrian. An early \"remarkably well-informed and interesting guidebook\" was the \"Hellados Periegesis\" (\"Descriptions of Greece\") of Pausanias of the 2nd century A.D. This most famous work is a guide to the interesting places, works of architecture, sculpture, and curious customs of Ancient Greece, and is still useful to Classicists today. With the advent of Christianity, the guide for the European religious pilgrim became a useful guidebook. An early account is that of the pilgrim Egeria, who visited the Holy Land in the 4th century CE and left a detailed itinerary.\n\nIn the medieval Arab world, guide books for travelers in search of artifacts and treasures were written by Arabic treasure hunters, magicians, and alchemists. This was particularly the case in Arab Egypt, where treasure hunters were eager to find valuable ancient Egyptian antiquities. Some of the books claimed to be imbued with magic that could dispel the magical barriers believed to be protecting the artifacts.\n\nTravel literature became popular during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) of medieval China. The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style. Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\" by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.\n\nIn the West, the guidebook developed from the published personal experiences of aristocrats who traveled through Europe on the Grand Tour. As the appreciation of art, architecture and antiquity became ever-more essential ingredients of the noble upbringing so they predominated in the guidebooks, particularly those devoted to the Italian peninsula. Richard Lassels (1603-1668) wrote a series of manuscript guides which were eventually published posthumously in Paris and London (1670) as \"The Voyage of Italy\". Grand Tour guidebooks poured off the presses throughout the eighteenth century, those such as Patrick Brydone's \"A Tour Through Sicily and Malta\" being read by many who never left England. \n\nAn important transitional figure from the idiosyncratic style of the Grand Tour travelogues to the more informative and impersonal guidebook was Mariana Starke. Her 1824 guide to travel in France and Italy served as an essential companion for British travelers to the Continent in the early 19th century. She recognized that with the growing numbers of Britons traveling abroad after 1815 the majority of her readers would now be in family groups and on a budget. She therefore included for the first time a wealth of advice on luggage, obtaining passports, the precise cost of food and accommodation in each city and even advice on the care of invalid family members. She also devised a system of !!! exclamation mark ratings, a forerunner of today's star ratings. Her books, published by John Murray, served as a template for later guides.\n\nIn the United States, the first published guidebook was Gideon Minor Davison's \"The Fashionable Tour\", published in 1822, and Theodore Dwight's \"The Northern Traveller\" and Henry Gilpin's \"The Northern Tour\", both from 1825.\n\nThe modern guidebook emerged in the 1830s, with the burgeoning market for long distance tourism. The publisher John Murray began printing the \"Murray's Handbooks for Travellers\" in London from 1836. The series covered tourist destinations in Europe, Asia and northern Africa, and he introduced the concept of \"sights\" which he rated in terms of their significance using stars for Starke's exclamation points. According to scholar James Buzard, the Murray style \"exemplified the exhaustive rational planning that was as much an ideal of the emerging tourist industry as it was of British commercial and industrial organization generally.\"\nIn Germany, Karl Baedeker acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Johannes August Klein entitled \"Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende\" (\"A Rhine Journey from Mainz to Cologne; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move\"). He published this book with little changes for the next ten years, which provided the seeds for Baedeker's new approach to travel guides. After Klein died, he decided to publish a new edition in 1839, to which he added many of his own ideas on what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller. Baedeker's ultimate aim was to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide; whether about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks or prices. Baedeker emulated the style of John Murray's guidebooks, but included unprecedented detailed information.\n\nIn 1846, Baedeker introduced his star ratings for sights, attractions and lodgings, following Mrs. Starke's and Murray's. This edition was also his first 'experimental' red guide. He also decided to call his travel guides 'handbooks', following the example of John Murray III. Baedeker's early guides had tan covers, but from 1856 onwards, Murray's red bindings and gilt lettering became the familiar hallmark of all Baedeker guides as well, and the content became famous for its clarity, detail and accuracy.\nBaedeker and Murray produced impersonal, objective guides; works prior to this combined factual information and personal sentimental reflection. The availability of the books by Baedeker and Murray helped sharpen and formalize the complementary genre of the personal travelogue, which was freed from the burden of serving as a guide book. The Baedeker and Murray guide books were hugely popular and were standard resources for travelers well into the 20th century. As William Wetmore Story said in the 1860s, \"Every Englishman abroad carries a Murray for information, and a Byron for sentiment, and finds out by them what he is to know and feel by every step.\" During World War I the two editors of Baedeker's English-language titles left the company and acquired the rights to Murray's Handbooks; the resulting guide books, called the Blue Guides to distinguish them from the red-covered Baedekers, constituted one of the major guide book series for much of the 20th century and are still published today.\n\nFollowing World War II, two new names emerged which combined European and American perspectives on international travel. Eugene Fodor, a Hungarian-born author of travel articles, who had emigrated to the United States before the war, wrote guidebooks which introduced English-reading audiences to continental Europe. Arthur Frommer, an American soldier stationed in Europe during the Korean War, used his experience traveling around the Continent as the basis for \"Europe on $5 a Day\" (1957), which introduced readers to options for budget travel in Europe. Both authors' guidebooks became the foundations for extensive series, eventually covering destinations around the world, including the United States. In the decades that followed, Let's Go, Lonely Planet, Insight Guides, Rough Guides, and a wide variety of similar travel guides were developed, with varying focuses.\n\nSpecialist guides for mountains have a long history owing to the special needs of mountaineering, climbing, hill walking and scrambling. The guides by W A Poucher for example, are widely used for the hill regions of Britain. There are many more special guides to the numerous climbing grounds in Britain published by the Climbers Club, for example.\n\nWith the emergence of digital technology, many publishers turned to electronic distribution, either in addition to or instead of print publication. This can take the form of downloadable documents for reading on a portable computer or hand held device such a PDA or iPod, or online information accessible via a web site. This enabled guidebook publishers to keep their information more current. Traditional guide book incumbents Lonely Planet, Frommers, Rough Guides, and In Your Pocket City Guides, and newcomers such as Schmap or Ulysses Travel Guides are now offering travel guides for download. New online and interactive guides such as Tripadvisor, Wikivoyage, and Travellerspoint enable individual travelers to share their own experiences and contribute information to the guide. Wikivoyage, CityLeaves, and Travellerspoint make the entire contents of their guides updatable by users, and make the information in their guides available as open content, free for others to use.\n\nThis list is a select sample of the full range of English language guide book publishers - either contemporary or historical.\n\n"}

It was devised by Alfred Kaiming Chiu (1898–1977). The system was primarily created for the classification of Chinese language materials in the Harvard–Yenching Library which was founded in 1927 at the Harvard–Yenching Institute.\n\nDuring that early period other systems, such as the early edition of the Library of Congress Classification, did not consist of appropriate subject headings to classify the Chinese language materials, particularly the ancient published materials. As many American libraries started to collect the ancient and contemporary published materials from China, a number of American libraries subsequently followed Harvard University to adopt Harvard–Yenching classification system, such as the East Asian Library of the University of California in Berkeley, Columbia University, The University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis etc.\n\nIn addition to American libraries, the libraries of other universities in the world including England, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. also followed Harvard University to adopt the system. During the period from the 1930s to the 1970s, the use of the system became popular for classifying not only Chinese language materials but also other East Asian materials including Korean and Japanese language materials.\n\nDuring the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, a comprehensive subset of subject headings for Chinese language materials was gradually established in the Library of Congress Classification System so that almost a full spectrum of ancient and contemporary Chinese topics can be widely covered. As a result of this, the Library of Congress Classification System eventually replaced the Harvard–Yenching Classification System for all Chinese language materials acquired after the 1970s in many American Libraries.\n\nThough the system has largely been phased out, the system is still being used in some libraries for Chinese language materials acquired prior to the Library of Congress update. Such previously acquired books are normally stored in separate stacks in libraries. However, some of the university libraries in the Commonwealth countries of the United Kingdom such as England, Australia and New Zealand still continue to use the Harvard–Yenching system; for example, the Institute for Chinese Studies Library of the University of Oxford, University of Sydney, and University of Auckland.\n\nThe key classes of the system are listed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official library classification in China is:\n\n\nThe other library classifications for Chinese materials outside China are:\n\n\n"}

It uses DNS functionality to provide access to databases of information that change infrequently. In Unix environments it often serves to distribute information kept in the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/printcap files, among others.\nFrequently an LDAP server is used to distribute the same kind of information that Hesiod does. However, because Hesiod can leverage existing DNS servers, deploying it to a network is fairly easy.\n\nIn a Unix-like system users usually have a line in the /etc/passwd file for each local user like:\n\nThis line is composed of seven colon-separated fields which hold the following data:\n\nThis system works fine for a small number of users on a small number of machines. But when more users start using more machines having this information managed in one location becomes critical. This is where Hesiod enters.\n\nInstead of having this information stored on every machine, Hesiod stores it in records on your DNS server. Then each client can query the DNS server for this information instead of looking for it locally. In BIND the records for the above user might look something like:\n\nThere are three records because the system needs to be able to access the information in different ways. The first line supports looking up the user by their login name and the second two allow it to look up information by the user's uid. Note the use of the \"HS\" class instead of \"IN\" as might be expected. The Domain Name System has a special class of service for Hesiod's purpose.\n\nOn the client side some configuration also needs to happen. The /etc/hesiod.conf file for this setup might look something like:\n\nAlso make sure the /etc/resolv.conf file is using the name servers that have the Hesiod records. Once this is configured one can test the setup using the \"hesinfo\" program:\n\nshould return\n\nWhat happens here is that the \"foo\" and the \"passwd\" are combined with the \"lhs\" and \"rhs\" values in the /etc/hesiod.conf file to create a fully qualified name of \"foo.passwd.ns.hesiod\".

{"id": "14193626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14193626", "title": "June Byers", "text": "June Byers\n\nDeAlva Eyvonnie Sibley (May 25, 1922 – July 20, 1998), better known by her ring name of June Byers, was an American women's professional wrestler famous in the 1950s and early 1960s. She held the Women's World Championship for ten years and is a member of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, the tomboyish Sibley grew up around wrestling. Her uncle, Ottoway Roberts, worked for local wrestling promoter Morris Siegel, and as she got older, she often hung around the wrestlers and asked them to teach her their moves. On one occasion while DeAlva was playing around in the ring, the women's wrestling promoter Billy Wolfe happened to see her and recognized her potential. Already divorced once and facing poverty, she accepted Wolfe's offer to be trained as a professional wrestler.\n\nTaking her family nickname of \"June\" and her ex-husband's last name of \"Byers\" for her ring name, Sibley made her professional debut in 1944. She spent the first years of her career traveling the country in Wolfe's promotion, sometimes winning preliminary matches but regularly losing to the more established stars such as Mae Young and champion Mildred Burke. Slowly rising in the ranks, she first won gold in 1952 when she and partner Millie Stafford won the Tag Title over Young and Ella Waldek.\n\nThat same year Mildred Burke had a bitter falling-out with husband Wolfe and departed the promotion, leaving the world title vacant. On June 14, 1953, a still relatively unknown Byers won a 13-woman tournament in Baltimore to claim the belt. She quickly became a popular fan favorite champion, even appearing as a contestant on the popular game shows \"What's My Line?\" and \"I've Got A Secret\" on August 16, 1953.\n\nAfter a year of tense negotiation, Wolfe finally coaxed Burke into meeting Byers in a definitive two out of three falls match on August 20, 1954 in Atlanta, Georgia. Byers won the first fall, and then the match was called after an hour during the second fall. In the book \"The Queen of the Ring\" author Jeff Leen writes that despite battling injuries, Burke was able to hold Byers to a stalemate after dropping the first fall and thus deprive her of the second fall she needed to truly defeat Burke. Despite the inconclusive finish, the Atlanta Athletic Commission eventually awarded the match to Byers. Burke angrily returned to her own promotion, the World Women's Wrestling Association, where she held its title and billed herself as world champion. She maintained later that she had dropped the first fall with the intent to compete stronger in the second, and it is noted that Wolfe used all possible connections to try to get a win for his new star (and daughter-in-law) Byers. Byers, for her part, stressed that \"Mildred claims she wasn't defeated, but I pinned her in the first fall. During the second fall, she left the ring and refused to come back. Regardless of what she told people, it was a shoot.\" Whatever the truth, the match outcome was satisfactory enough for the media to discredit Burke and acknowledge Byers as the legitimate world champion. Jeff Leen's account in \"Queen of the Ring\" contradicts Byer's claims about Burke leaving the ring and refusing to return. Furthermore, Leen details how Billy Wolfe had a great deal to do with putting Byers over as the \"winner\" and he quotes the ring announcer following the match as saying, \"Commissioner stops the bout. Mildred Burke is still officially champion of the world\".\n\nAs the face of women's wrestling for the next decade, Byers's athleticism and technical skills did much to open new markets for women's wrestling and improve its perception in the eyes of the public as being more than mere tawdry spectacle. Complementing her repertoire of scientific moves was her toughness in an age of very tough women, and she was known for working incredibly stiff against newcomers: one such wrestler recalled getting a broken nose and two black eyes from Byers intentionally punching her in the face. Byers wrestled many matches with Penny Banner, and the two had great respect for one another: Byers ranked Banner as among her toughest opponents, while Banner named Byers the greatest of all time.\n\nIn 1956, the Baltimore Athletic Commission stripped Byers of the NWA Championship when she announced her plans to retire as champion. A thirteen-woman battle royal was used to determine the new champion. After The Fabulous Moolah won the championship, Byers came out of retirement to challenge her for the title, but Byers lost the match.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Byers was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Legacy wing.\n\nThe Fabulous Moolah alleges that while traveling with Billy Wolfe's troupe of female wrestlers, Byers often slept with Wolfe (despite his marriage to Burke) in order to get better bookings.\n\nUpon Wolfe's death, Byers moved to St. Louis to work for promoter Sam Meneker, who became her third husband. In 1963, while attempting to drive after being hit in the head with a Coke bottle, Byers experienced quadruple vision and collided with a tree. The leg damage from the auto accident cut her career short at age 41 and forced her to retire on January 1, 1964. In her later life, she had double vision from the incident.\n\nByers returned to Texas after retirement from the ring, becoming a real estate agent. She had two children, Billy and Jewel. Her son was fatally electrocuted in an accident, and Byers was reportedly never the same afterward. She died of pneumonia at her Houston home in 1998.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ehrich (January 23, 1849 – October 23, 1911) was an American businessman, art dealer, and politician. He was active in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century politics, with ties to the Anti-Imperialist movement and the Gold Democrats. In addition to his presence in the political and commercial circles of his day, he is notable for having established the Ehrich Galleries, an institution that provided Old Masters to Gilded Age art collectors, including the industrialists Henry Clay Frick and Henry E. Huntington.\n\nEhrich was born in Albany, New York on January 23, 1849, to Joseph and Rebecca Sporburg Ehrich. He attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, CT before graduating from Yale University in 1869. He went on to study at the University of Berlin, and divided his time between New York and Europe for much of the 1870s and 1880s, studying the Renaissance and Baroque paintings that would become his livelihood.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Ehrich helped his brother William run the Ehrich Brothers Dry Goods Store (est. 1857). Telling the New York Tribune that the stress of retail had left William with a \"shattered constitution,\" Louis resigned from his own position in 1886. His health led him to relocate to Colorado Springs in 1889, where he served as vice president of the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway company, director of the First National Bank, and president of the Board of Trade of Colorado Springs, acting in several smaller business ventures simultaneously. Along with his interest in trade and land development, Ehrich was heavily involved in politics for much of his life. Throughout the 1890s and early 1910s, he was an executive member of the Anti-Imperialist League and the Gold Democrats Party, as well as an advocate for free trade, often publishing op eds on the subject. In 1896, he was the sole delegate from the Rocky Mountain Region at the 1896 Democratic National Convention, also known as the Gold Convention of 1896. He wrote and published \"The Question of Silver\" to further explicate his views on the Free Silver issue. Despite his early opposition to William Jennings Bryan because of their differing opinions on the Gold Standard, Ehrich reconciled with him by the date of the 1900 election, largely thanks to Bryan's firm stance against the American annexation of the Philippines.\n\nIn the mid 1890s, Ehrich combined his interest in European paintings with his knowledge of business to found the Ehrich Galleries in New York City. Located on Fifth Avenue, the galleries originally specialized in Old Masters exclusively. Ehrich's judgement was purportedly esteemed by well-known art expert Bernard Berenson. He provided art to individuals such as Samuel Untermyer, Stanford White, and Archer M. Huntington. Paintings from the Ehrich Galleries were sometimes donated to or purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or became part of private collections. Ehrich Galleries remained open after Ehrich's death in 1911. Ownership passed to his sons, Harold and Walter Ehrich, who donated some of its holdings to the Yale University Art Gallery in memory of their father Louis. Under Harold and Walter's leadership, the galleries began to incorporate a greater number of modern and American paintings in the 1920s and 1930s.\nIt merged with the Newhouse Galleries in 1934, becoming the Ehrich-Newhouse Galleries. The galleries continued to exhibit and sell art until Walter Ehrich's death in 1936, after which the Newhouse Galleries became an independent entity once again.\n\nEhrich married Henrietta Minsezheimer in 1874. In addition to Harold and Walter, who ran Ehrich Galleries after Louis's death, they had a daughter named Leah. Louis Ehrich was a trustee at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a member of the Yale Club, the American Jewish Historical Society, and the Mozart Choral Society of Colorado Springs.\n\n"}

It is situated between the Field of Mars and Palace Quay, slightly to the east from New Michael Palace.\n\nThe palace was built by Count Grigory Orlov, the favorite of Empress Catherine the Great and the most powerful Russian nobleman of the 1760s. Construction started in 1768 to designs by Antonio Rinaldi, who previously had helped decorate the grand palace at Caserta near Naples. The combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicizing monumentality, as practiced by Rinaldi, may be attributed to his earlier work under Luigi Vanvitelli in Italy.\n\nThe palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome marbles. A rough-grained Finnish granite on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink Karelian marble of the pilasters and white Urals marble of capitals and festoons. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while Tallinn dolomite was employed for ornamental urns. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace.\n\nThe plan of the edifice is trapezoidal: each of its four facades, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. One of the facades conceals a recessed courtyard, where an armored car employed by Lenin during the October Revolution used to be mounted on display between 1937 and 1992. Nowadays, the court is dominated by a sturdy equestrian statue of Alexander III of Russia, the most famous work of sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy; formerly it graced a square before the Moscow Railway Station.\n\nFedot Shubin, Mikhail Kozlovsky, Stefano Torelli and other Russian and foreign craftsmen decorated the interior with inlaid coloured marbles, stucco, and statuary until 1785, by which time Count Orlov had already died (1783), and the Empress had the palace purchased for her own heirs. In 1797–1798 the structure was leased to Stanisław II Augustus, the last king of Poland. Thereafter the palace belonged to Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and his heirs from the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanov family.\n\nIn 1843, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace and engaging Alexander Brullov as the architect. An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the eclectic tastes of its new owner. Only the main staircase and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor. \n\nDuring the Soviet era, the palace successively housed the Ministry of Labour (1917–19), the Academy of Material Culture (1919–36), and, most notably, the main local branch of the Moscow-based Central (i.e. National) Lenin Museum (1937–91) with sub-branches across Leningrad in Lenin's memorial apartments all over the city - the places where he lived or stayed during his various periods in what was then Saint Petersburg.\n\nCurrently, the palace accommodates permanent exhibitions of the Russian State Museum, notably \"Foreign Artists in Russia (18th and 19th centuries)\" and the \"Peter Ludwig Museum at the Russian Museum\", featuring canvases by Andy Warhol and other Pop Art idols.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19464350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19464350", "title": "Mentalism (discrimination)", "text": "Mentalism (discrimination)\n\nMentalism or sanism is a form of discrimination and oppression against a mental trait or condition a person has, or is judged to have. This discrimination may or may not be described in terms of mental disorder or cognitive impairment. The discrimination is based on numerous factors such as: stereotypes about neurodivergence (e.g. autism spectrum, learning disorders, ADHD, bipolar, schizophrenia, personality disorder diagnoses), specific behavioral phenomena (e.g. stuttering, tics), or intellectual disability. \n\nLike other \"isms\" such as sexism and racism, mentalism involves multiple intersecting forms of oppression, complex social inequalities and imbalances of power. It can result in covert discrimination by multiple, small insults and indignities. It is characterized by judgments of another person's perceived mental health status. These judgments are followed by actions such as blatant, overt discrimination which may include refusal of service, or the denial of human rights. Mentalism impacts how individuals are treated by the general public, by mental health professionals, and by institutions, including the legal system. The negative attitudes involved may also be internalized.\n\nThe terms mentalism (from mental) and sanism (from sane) have some widespread use, though concepts such as social stigma, and in some cases ableism, may be used in similar but not identical ways.\n\nWhile mentalism and sanism are used interchangeably, sanism is becoming predominant in certain circles, such as academics, those who identify as mad and mad advocates and in a socio-political context where sanism is gaining ground as a movement. The movement of sanism is an act of resistance among those who identify as mad, consumer survivors, and mental health advocates. In academia evidence of this movement can be found in the number of recent publications about sanism and social work practice.\n\nThe term \"sanism\" was coined by Morton Birnbaum during his work representing Edward Stephens, a mental health patient, in a legal case in the 1960s. Birnbaum was a physician, lawyer and mental health advocate who helped establish a constitutional right to treatment for psychiatric patients along with safeguards against involuntary commitment. Since first noticing the term in 1980, New York legal professor Michael L. Perlin subsequently continued its use.\nIn 1975 Judi Chamberlain coined the term mentalism in a book chapter of \"Women Look at Psychiatry\". The term became more widely known when she used it in 1978 in her book \"On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System,\" which for some time became the standard text of the psychiatric survivor movement in the US. People began to recognize a pattern in how they were treated, a set of assumptions which most people seemed to hold about mental (ex)patients regardless of whether they applied to any particular individual at any particular time – that they were incompetent, unable to do things for themselves, constantly in need of supervision and assistance, unpredictable, likely to be violent or irrational etc. It was realized that not only did the general public express mentalist ideas, so did ex-patients, a form of internalized oppression.\n\nAs of 1998 these terms have been adopted by some consumers/survivors in the UK and the USA, but had not gained general currency. This left a conceptual gap filled in part by the concept of 'stigma', but this has been criticized for focusing less on institutionalized discrimination with multiple causes, but on whether people perceive mental health issues as shameful or worse than they are. Despite its use, a body of literature demonstrated widespread discrimination across many spheres of life, including employment, parental rights, housing, immigration, insurance, health care and access to justice. However, the use of new \"isms\" has also been questioned on the grounds that they can be perceived as divisive, out of date, or a form of undue political correctness. The same criticisms, in this view, may not apply so much to broader and more accepted terms like 'discrimination' or 'social exclusion'.\n\nThere is also the umbrella term ableism, referring to discrimination against those who are (perceived as) disabled. In terms of the brain, there is the movement for the recognition of neurodiversity. The term \"psychophobia\" (from psyche and phobia) has occasionally been used with a similar meaning.\n\nAccording to Coni Kalinowski (a psychiatrist at the University of Nevada and Director of Mojave Community Services) and Pat Risser (a mental health consultant and self-described former recipient of mental health services), mentalism at one extreme can lead to a categorical dividing of people into an empowered group assumed to be normal, healthy, reliable, and capable, and a powerless group assumed to be sick, disabled, crazy, unpredictable, and violent. This divide can justify inconsiderate treatment of the latter group and expectations of poorer standards of living for them, for which they may be expected to express gratitude. Further discrimination may involve labeling some as \"high functioning\" and some as \"low-functioning\"; while this may enable the targeting of resources, in both categories human behaviors are recast in pathological terms.\n\nThe discrimination can be so fundamental and unquestioned that it can stop people truly empathizing (although they may think they are) or genuinely seeing the other point of view with respect. Some mental conditions can impair awareness and understanding in certain ways at certain times, but mentalist assumptions may lead others to erroneously believe that they necessarily understand the person's situation and needs better than they do themselves.\n\nReportedly even within the disability rights movement internationally, \"there is a lot of sanism\", and \"disability organisations don't always 'get' mental health and don't want to be seen as mentally defective.\" Conversely, those coming from the mental health side may not view such conditions as disabilities in the same way.\n\nSome national government-funded charities view the issue as primarily a matter of stigmatizing attitudes within the general public, perhaps due to people not having enough contact with those (diagnosed with) mental illness, and one head of a schizophrenia charity has compared mentalism to the way racism may be more prevalent when people don't spend time together throughout life. A psychologist who runs The Living Museum facilitating current or former psychiatric patients to exhibit artwork, has referred to the attitude of the general public as psychophobia.\n\nMentalism may be enshrined in clinical terminology in subtle ways, including in the basic diagnostic categories used by psychiatry (as in the DSM or ICD). There is some ongoing debate as to which terms and criteria may communicate contempt or inferiority, rather than facilitate real understanding of people and their issues.\n\nSome oppose the entire process as \"labeling\" and some have responded to justifications for it – for example that it is necessary for clinical or administrative purposes – as the way a person may justify the use of ethnic slurs because they intend no harm. Others argue that most aspects could easily be expressed in a more accurate and less offensive manner.\n\nSome clinical terms may be used far beyond the usual narrowly defined meanings, in a way that can obscure the regular human and social context of people's experiences. For example, having a bad time may be assumed to be decompensation; incarceration or solitary confinement may be described as \"treatment\" regardless of benefit to the person; regular activities like listening to music, engaging in exercise or sporting activities, or being in a particular physical or social environment (milieu), may be referred to as \"therapy\"; all sorts of responses and behaviors may be assumed to be \"symptoms\"; core adverse effects of drugs may be termed \"side\" effects.\n\nThe former director of a US-based psychiatric survivors organization focused on rights and freedoms, David Oaks, has advocated the taking back of words like \"mad\", \"lunatic\", \"crazy\" or \"bonkers\". While acknowledging that some choose not to use such words in any sense, he questions whether medical terms like \"mentally ill\", \"psychotic\" or \"clinically depressed\" really are more helpful or indicative of seriousness than possible alternatives. Oaks says that for decades he has been exploring the depths of sanism and has not yet found an end, and suggests it may be the most pernicious 'ism' because people tend to define themselves by their rationality and their core feelings. One possible response is to critique \"normality\" and the problems associated with \"normal\" functioning around the world, although in some ways that could also potentially constitute a form of mentalism. After his 2012 accident breaking his neck and subsequent retirement, Oaks refers to himself as \"PsychoQuad\" on his personal blog.\n\nBritish writer Clare Allen argues that even reclaimed slang terms such as \"mad\" are just not accurate. In addition, she sees the commonplace mis-use of concepts relating to mental health problems – including for example jokes about people hearing voices as if that automatically undermines their credibility – as equivalent to racist or sexist phrases that would be considered obviously discriminatory. She characterises such usage as indicating an underlying psychophobia and contempt.\n\nInterpretations of behaviors, and applications of treatments, may be done in an arrogant unjustified way because of an underlying mentalism, according to critics. If a recipient disagrees or does not change, they may be labeled as \"non-compliant\", \"uncooperative\", \"treatment-resistant\". This is despite the fact that the issue may be inadequate understanding of the person or his/her problems, adverse medication effects, a poor match between the treatment and the person's lifestyle, stigma associated with the treatment, difficulty with access, cultural unacceptability, or many other issues.\n\nMentalism may lead people to assume that someone is not aware of what they are doing and that there is no point trying to communicate with them, despite the fact that they may well have a level of awareness and desire to connect even if they are acting in a seemingly irrational or self-harming way. In addition, mental health professionals and others may tend to equate subduing a person with treatment; a quiet client who causes no community disturbance may be deemed \"improved\" no matter how miserable or incapacitated that person may feel as a result.\n\nClinicians may blame clients for not being sufficiently motivated to work on treatment goals or recovery, and as \"acting out\" when things are not agreed with or are found upsetting. But critics say that in the majority of cases this is actually due to the client having been treated in a disrespectful, judgmental, or dismissive manner. Nevertheless, such behavior may be justified by characterizing the client as demanding, angry or \"needing limits\". To overcome this, it has been suggested that power-sharing should be cultivated and that when respectful communication breaks down, the first thing that needs to be asked is whether mentalist prejudices have been expressed.\n\nMentalism has been linked to negligence in monitoring for adverse effects of medications (or other interventions), or to viewing such effects as more acceptable than they would be for others. This has been compared to instances of maltreatment based on racism. Mentalism has also been linked to neglect in failing to check for, or fully respect, people's past experiences of abuse or other trauma. Treatments that do not support choice and self-determination may cause people to re-experience the helplessness, pain, despair, and rage that accompanied the trauma, and yet attempts to cope with this may be labeled as \"acting out\", \"manipulating\", or \"attention-seeking\".\n\nIn addition, mentalism can lead to \"poor\" or \"guarded\" predictions of the future for a person, which could be an overly pessimistic view skewed by a narrow clinical experience. It could also be made impervious to contrary evidence because those who succeed can be discounted as having been misdiagnosed or as not having the \"real\" form of a disorder — the No true Scotsman fallacy. While some mental health problems can involve very substantial disability and can be very difficult to overcome in society, predictions based on prejudice and stereotypes can be self-fulfilling because individuals pick up on a message that they have no real hope, and realistic hope is said to be a key foundation of recovery. At the same time, a trait or condition might be considered more a form of individual difference that society needs to include and adapt to, in which case a mentalist attitude might be associated with assumptions and prejudices about what constitutes 'normal' society and who is deserving of adaptations, support, or consideration.\n\nOffensive and injurious practices may be integrated into clinical procedures, to the point where professionals no longer recognize them as such, in what has been described as a form of institutional discrimination. This may be apparent in physical separation, including separate facilities or accommodation, or in lower standards for some than others. Mental health professionals may find themselves drawn into systems based on bureaucratic and financial imperatives and social control, resulting in alienation from their original values, disappointment in \"the system\", and adoption of the cynical, mentalist beliefs that may pervade an organization. However, just as employees can be dismissed for disparaging sexual or ethnic remarks, it is argued that staff who are entrenched in negative stereotypes, attitudes, and beliefs about those labeled with mental disorders need to be removed from service organizations. A related theoretical approach, known as expressed emotion, has also focused on negative interpersonal dynamics relating to care givers, especially within families. However, the point is also made in such views that institutional and group environments can be challenging from all sides, and that clear boundaries and rights are required for everyone.\n\nThe mental health professions have themselves been criticised. While social work (also known as clinical social work) has appeared to have more potential than others to understand and assist those using services, and has talked a lot academically about anti-oppressive practice intended to support people facing various -isms, it has allegedly failed to address mentalism to any significant degree. The field has been accused, by social work professionals with experience of using services themselves, of failing to help people identify and address what is oppressing them; of unduly deferring to psychiatric or biomedical conventions particularly in regard to those deemed most unwell; and of failing to address its own discriminatory practices, including its conflicts of interest in its official role aiding the social control of patients through involuntary commitment.\n\nIn the \"user/survivor\" movement in England, Pete Shaughnessy, a founder of mad pride, concluded that the National Health Service is \"institutionally mentalist and has a lot of soul searching to do in the new Millennium\", including addressing the prejudice of its office staff. He suggested that when prejudice is applied by the very professionals who aspire to eradicate it, it raises the question of whether it will ever be eradicated. Shaughnessy committed suicide in 2002.\n\nThe psychiatric survivors movement has been described as a feminist issue, because the problems it addresses are \"important for all women because mentalism acts as a threat to all women\" and \"mentalism threatens women's families and children.\" A psychiatric survivor and professional has said that \"Mentalism parallels sexism and racism in creating an oppressed underclass, in this case of people who have received psychiatric diagnosis and treatment\". She reported that the most frequent complaint of psychiatric patients is that nobody listens, or only selectively in the course of trying to make a diagnosis.\n\nOn a society-wide level, mentalism has been linked to people being kept in poverty as second class citizens; to employment discrimination keeping people living on handouts; to interpersonal discrimination hindering relationships; to stereotypes promoted through the media spreading fears of unpredictability and dangerousness; and to people fearing to disclose or talk about their experiences.\n\nWith regard to legal protections against discrimination, mentalism may only be covered under general frameworks such as the disability discrimination acts that are in force in some countries, and which require a person to say that they have a disability and to prove that they meet the criteria.\n\nIn terms of the legal system itself, the law is traditionally based on technical definitions of sanity and insanity, and so the term 'sanism' may be used in response. The concept is well known in the US legal community, being referred to in nearly 300 law review articles between 1992 and 2013, though is less well known in the medical community.\nMichael Perlin, Professor of Law at New York Law School, has defined sanism as \"an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses.\"\n\nPerlin notes that sanism affects the theory and practice of law in largely invisible and socially acceptable ways, based mainly on \"stereotype, myth, superstition, and deindividualization.\" He believes that its \"corrosive effects have warped involuntary civil commitment law, institutional law, tort law, and all aspects of the criminal process (pretrial, trial and sentencing).\" According to Perlin, judges are far from immune, tending to reflect sanist thinking that has deep roots within our culture. This results in judicial decisions based on stereotypes in all areas of civil and criminal law, expressed in biased language and showing contempt for mental health professionals. Moreover, courts are often impatient and attribute mental problems to \"weak character or poor resolve\".\n\nSanist attitudes are prevalent in the teaching of law students, both overtly and covertly, according to Perlin. He notes that this impacts on the skills at the heart of lawyering such as \"interviewing, investigating, counseling and negotiating\", and on every critical moment of clinical experience: \"the initial interview, case preparation, case conferences, planning litigation (or negotiation) strategy, trial preparation, trial and appeal.\"\n\nThere is also widespread discrimination by jurors, who Perlin characterizes as demonstrating \"irrational brutality, prejudice, hostility, and hatred\" towards defendants where there is an insanity defence. Specific sanist myths include relying on popular images of craziness; an 'obsession' with claims that mental problems can be easily faked and experts duped; assuming an absolute link between mental illness and dangerousness; an 'incessant' confusion and mixing up of different legal tests of mental status; and assuming that defendants acquitted on insanity defenses are likely to be released quickly. Although there are claims that neuroimaging has some potential to help in this area, Perlin concludes that it is very difficult to weigh the truth or relevance of such results due to the many uncertainties and limitations, and as it may be either disregarded or over-hyped by scientists, lawyers or in the popular imagination. He believes \"the key to an answer here is a consideration of sanism\", because to a great extent it can \"overwhelm all other evidence and all other issues in this conversation\". He suggests that \"only therapeutic jurisprudence has the potential power to 'strip the sanist facade'.\"\n\nPerlin has suggested that the international Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a revolutionary human rights document which has the potential to be the best tool to challenge sanist discrimination.\n\nHe has also addressed the topic of sanism as it affects which sexual freedoms or protections are afforded to psychiatric patients, especially in forensic facilities.\n\nSanism in the legal profession can affect many people in communities who at some point in their life struggle with some degree of mental health problems, according to Perlin. This may unjustly limit their ability to legally resolve issues in their communities such as: \"contract problems, property problems, domestic relations problems, and trusts and estates problems.\"\n\nSusan Fraser, a lawyer in Canada who specializes in advocating for vulnerable people, argues that sanism is based on fear of the unknown, reinforced by stereotypes that dehumanize individuals. She argues that this causes the legal system to fail to properly defend patients' rights to refuse potentially harmful medications; to investigate deaths in psychiatric hospitals and other institutions in an equal way to others; and to fail to properly listen to and respect the voices of mental health consumers and survivors.\n\nSimilar issues have been identified by Perlin in how children are dealt with in regard to learning disabilities, including in special education. In any area of law, he points out, two of the most common sanist myths are presuming that persons with mental disabilities are faking, or that such persons would not be disabled if they only tried harder. In this particular area, he concludes that labeled children are stereotyped in a process rife with racial, class and gender bias. Although intended to help some children, he contends that in reality it can be not merely a double-edged sword but a triple, quadruple or quintuple edged sword. The end result of sanist prejudices and misconceptions, in the context of academic competition, is that \"we are left with a system that is, in many important ways, stunningly incoherent\".\n\nA spiral of oppression experienced by some groups in society has been identified. Firstly, oppressions occur on the basis of perceived or actual differences (which may be related to broad group stereotypes such as racism, sexism, classism, ageism, homophobia etc.). This can have negative physical, social, economic and psychological effects on individuals, including emotional distress and what might be considered mental health problems. Then, society's response to such distress may be to treat it within a system of medical and social care rather than (also) understanding and challenging the oppressions that gave rise to it, thus reinforcing the problem with further oppressive attitudes and practices, which can lead to more distress, and so on in a vicious cycle. In addition, due to coming into contact with mental health services, people may become subject to the oppression of mentalism, since society (and mental health services themselves) have such negative attitudes towards people with a psychiatric diagnosis, thus further perpetuating oppression and discrimination.\n\nPeople suffering such oppression within society may be drawn to more radical political action, but sanist structures and attitudes have also been identified in activist communities. This includes cliques and social hierarchies that people with particular issues may find very difficult to break into or be valued by. There may also be individual rejection of people for strange behavior just because it's not considered culturally cool, or alternatively insensitivity to emotional states including suicidality, or denial that someone has issues if they appear \"normal\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6964765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6964765", "title": "Metatheatre", "text": "Metatheatre\n\nMetatheatre, and the closely related term metadrama, describes the aspects of a play that draw attention to its nature as drama or theatre, or to the circumstances of its performance.\n\nThese may include: the direct address of the audience (especially in soliloquies, asides, prologues, and epilogues); expression of an awareness of the presence of the audience (whether they are addressed directly or not); an acknowledgement of the fact that the people performing are actors (and not actually the characters they are playing); an element whose meaning depends on the difference between the represented time and place of the drama (the fictional world) and the time and place of its theatrical presentation (the reality of the theatre event); plays-within-plays (or masques, spectacles, or other forms of performance within the drama); references to acting, theatre, dramatic writing, spectatorship, and the frequently employed metaphor according to which \"all the world's a stage\" (\"Theatrum mundi\"); scenes involving eavesdropping or other situations in which one or several characters observe another or others, such that the former relate to the behaviour of the latter as if it were a staged performance for their benefit.\n\nThe words \"metatheatre\" and \"metadrama\" combine theatre or drama with the Greek prefix \"meta—\", which implies \"a level beyond\" the subject that it qualifies.\n\nMetatheatre has in modern times involved into the term \"meta acting\", usually in reference to movies, whereas the character gives an indication that he realizes he is in a movie, also called \"breaking the fourth wall.\"\n\nMetatheatricality has been a dimension of drama ever since its invention in the theatre of classical Greece 2,500 years ago. One major purpose of this metatheatricality was to keep then spectators away from utter involvement or belief in the development of the plot presented. Ancient Greek comedy in particular made frequent use of it (though examples can also be found in tragedy).\n\nIn early modern English theatre, characters often adopt a downstage position in close contact with the audience and comment on the actions of others sarcastically or critically, while the other actors assume the convention that the first remains unheard and unseen while so doing. Following the work of Robert Weimann and others, theatre studies uses the terms \"locus\" and \"platea\" (relating to \"location\" and \"place\", borrowed from medieval theatre) to describe this performance effect—the \"locus\" is localised within the drama such that its characters are absorbed in its fiction and unaware of the presence of the audience; while the \"platea\" is a neutral space in close contact with the spectators that exists on the boundary between the fiction and the audience's reality.\n\nWhen the defeated Cleopatra, performed by a boy player in act five of Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\", fears her humiliation in the theatres of Rome in plays staged to ridicule her, she says: \"And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore\". While the actor is not necessarily engaged at this point in the direct address of the audience, the reality of the male performer beneath the female character is openly, and comically, acknowledged (qualifying in important ways, supported further in the scene and the play as a whole, the tragic act of her imminent suicide). Metatheatricality of this kind is found in most plays of that period.\n\nIn \"Hamlet\", there occurs the following exchange between Hamlet and Polonius:\n\nIf the only significance of this exchange lay in its reference to characters within another play, it might be called a metadramatic (or \"intertextual\") moment. Within its original performance context, however, there is a more specific, metatheatrical reference. Historians assume that Hamlet and Polonius were played by the same actors who had played the roles mentioned in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" a year or two earlier on the same stage. Apart from the dramatic linking of the character of Hamlet with the murderer Brutus (foreshadowing Hamlet's murder of Polonius later in the play), the audience's awareness of the identities of the actors and their previous roles is comically referenced.\n\nIn the modern era, the rise of realism and naturalism led to the development of a performance convention known as the \"fourth wall\". The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-scène behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, the \"fourth\" of them would run along the line dividing the room from the auditorium (technically called the \"proscenium\"). The fourth wall is thus an invisible, imagined wall that separates the actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this \"wall\", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. In this sense, the \"fourth wall\" is a convention of acting, rather than of set design. It can be created regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.\n\n\"Breaking the fourth wall\" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is disregarded. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical.\n\nA similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase \"breaking the fourth wall\" is used to describe such effects in those media.\n\nInstances of metatheatricality \"other\" than \"breaking the fourth wall\" occur in plays by many of the realist playwrights, including Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Anton Chekhov. As with modernism more generally, metareference in the form of metatheatricality comes to play a far more central and significant role in the modernist theatre, particularly in the work of Bertolt Brecht, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Luigi Pirandello, Thornton Wilder, Samuel Beckett, and many others.\n\nIn more recent times, \"With the People from the Bridge\" by Dimitris Lyacos employs metatheatrical techniques whereby a makeshift play centered on the vampire legend is viewed from the angle of a spectator who records in his diary the setting and preparations as well as the sequence of the actors' soliloquies interspersed with personal notes on the development of the performance.\n\nThe term \"metatheatre\" was coined by Lionel Abel in 1963 and has since entered common critical usage. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously. Abel relates it to the character of Don Quixote, whom he considers to be the prototypical, metatheatrical, self-referring character. Don Quixote looks for situations of which he wants to be a part, not waiting for life to oblige, but replacing reality with imagination when the world is lacking in his desires. The character is aware of his own theatricality.\n\n\n"}

The aluminum tubes act in compression, held in tension by the stainless steel cables threaded through in the ends of the tubes.\n\nThe piece was a gift of Joseph Hirshhorn in 1974.\n\nSnelson's unique sculpture style is well articulated in \"Needle Tower\". \nThe structure style displayed is known as \"tensegrity,\" a description given by Snelson's former professor Buckminster Fuller to the melding of tension and structural integrity. According to Snelson: Tensegrity describes a closed structural system composed of a set of three or more elongate compression struts within a network of tension tendons, the combined parts mutually supportive in such a way that the struts do not touch one another, but press outwardly against nodal points in the tension network to form a firm, triangulated, prestressed, tension and compression unit.\n\nMuch has been said about the geometric shapes seen in Snelson's works. Looking up from the inside of \"Needle Tower\" one may see the Star of David. According to Snelson, his works are not symbolic and it's common to see six-pointed stars in his work. In \"Needle Tower\" the six pointedness comes from the natural geometry of the three compression struts that make up each layer. Sets of three alternate with left and right helical modules, adding up to six when viewed upwards from the base of the tower.\n\nIn April 2010 conservation work was completed on the sculpture by the Hirshhorn Museum. It took 15 staff members to stand the tower upright after conservation completion.\n\nA second \"Needle Tower\", \"Needle Tower II\", was completed in 1968 and was acquired by the Kröller-Müller Museum in 1971.

It was first published in 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary\", previously entitled the \"Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English\", started life as the \"Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary\", edited by Albert Sydney Hornby. It was first published in Japan in 1942. It then made a perilous wartime journey to Britain where it came under the wing of OUP, which decided it would be the perfect counterpart for the prestigious OED.\n\nA. S. Hornby was a teacher of English studies at a small college in Japan; he had gone there in 1923 to teach literature, but his experiences in the classroom drew his attention to the need for sound principles of language teaching. At that time Harold E. Palmer headed the Institute for Research into English Teaching in Tokyo, and in 1931 he invited Hornby to work on vocabulary development at the Institute. The result of this was the \"Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary\", published by Kaitakusha in 1942. A year before publication, Hornby had managed to send an advance copy in sheets of the book to B. Ifor Evans at the British Council, a tough feat during the war. Ifor Evans offered him a job, and in 1942 Hornby came back to Britain and joined the Council, which posted him to Iran.\n\nThe sheets reached Humphrey S. Milford, then publisher to the University of Oxford and effectively OUP's managing director. Milford saw immediately that the dictionary could fill a troublesome gap in the Press's lists, since it was compiled for non-English speakers and rested on Hornby's solid experience in teaching the language overseas. Thus it explained spelling, grammar, phonetics, and usage much more extensively than would a dictionary for native English speakers. With the cachet of the Press to promote it, it could take the \"Oxford dictionary\" brand to readerships that might be intimidated or puzzled by the more magisterial OED.\n\nBut the command economy of World War II under which all British publishers were then operating posed a problem: everything was in short supply, and Milford appealed to the British Council for help in getting the paper and cloth. He referred the matter to E.C. Parnwell, who was looking after the Press's overseas projects, Milford being by then too unwell to manage the Press without substantial assistance, as he had been doing since 1904.\n\nHornby had brought with him the world rights to the book excluding Japan and China; Kenneth Sisam, then Secretary to the Delegates of the Press, gave a favourable report to the Delegates on the book. Milford also cleverly used the current state of hostility with Japan to push for a subsidy from the British Council, although all he actually said was that \"the Japanese are very cheap producers\" and were likely to capture the market.\n\nThe book had more than 1,500 pages and for an edition of 10,000 copies would need ten tons of paper. Milford applied for a special release to acquire this paper \"in the direct interest of British culture and overseas trade, particularly in the non-sterling areas\". He had adequate paper stock to begin the edition but this was all earmarked for \"essential reprints\" and he could only use it if replacements were guaranteed. Milford's niece, Eleanor M. Booker, was now working at the India Office, and he lobbied for paper through her.\n\nFinally the book came out between 1943 and 1948 and became an instant success. Today it is one of the most used resources by learners of the English language worldwide.\n\nThe book is useful for all competitive exams.\n\nIn contrast to the Oxford's learner dictionaries, which are designed for learning foreign languages (English in the case of OALD), Oxford Student's Dictionary is designed for learners using English to study other subjects. Oxford Student's Dictionary has smaller vocabulary than the OALD counterpart.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This requirement is normally explicitly stated in the health and safety legislation that applies to each country. There are usually a number of basic criteria that need to be met by employers in order to achieve this goal (such as adequate training, suitable instruction and supervision, the provision of information, provision of emergency response plans and the assessment of risk amongst others). In addition, there is normally a requirement for an organisation to document in writing how it will ensure that it meets the minimum legal health and safety requirements.\n\n"}

It is a continuation of historian-priest John of Fordun's earlier work \"Chronica Gentis Scotorum\" beginning with the founding of Ireland and thereby Scotland by Scota with Goídel Glas. Queen Scota's name means \"blossom\" in Irish & Scottish Gaelic. Scotti was once a synonym for Irish, indicating that they (Irish & Scots) are \"people of the blossom,\" or descendants of Queen Scota. \n\nThe National Library of Scotland has called it \"probably the most important medieval account of early Scottish history\", noting that it provides both a strong expression of national identity and a window into the world view of medieval commentators.\n\nThe text includes a reference to \"the famous murderer, Robin Hood, as well as Little John\", one of the earliest records of Robin Hood and Little John. The reference is found, in Latin, under year 1266.\n\nBower began the work in 1440 at the request of a neighbour, Sir David Stewart of Rosyth. The completed work, in its original form, consists of 16 books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun's—or mainly his, for Bower added to them at places. In the later books, down to the reign of Robert I (1371), he was aided by Fordun's \"Gesta Annalia\", but from that point to the close, the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for James I, with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447.\n\nBower has been described as a less competent chronicler than Fordun, with one commenter calling him \"garrulous, irrelevant and inaccurate\" and noting that he \"makes every important occurrence an excuse for a long-winded moral discourse\".\n\nBower engaged in a reduction or \"abridgment\" of the \"Scotichronicon\" in the last two years of his life, which is known as the \"Book of Cupar\", and which is preserved in the Advocates' library, Edinburgh (MS. 35. 1. 7). Other abridgments, not by Bower, were made about the same time, one about 1450 (perhaps by Patrick Russell, a Carthusian of Perth) preserved in the Advocates' library (MS. 35. 6. 7) and another in 1461 by an unknown writer, also preserved in the same collection (MS. 35. 5. 2).

Their purpose is to provide an alternative disposition for juveniles who have committed a delinquent act, have committed a minor offense, or have been charged with a misdemeanor, and are otherwise eligible for diversion. Depending on their training, community support, and agreements with traditional court systems, most teen or youth courts are recognized as valid, legal venues for the process of hearing cases, sentencing and sentence fulfillment. Teen courts and their verdicts are not authorized by public law.\n\nTeen courts are staffed by youth volunteers who serve in various capacities within the program, trained and acting in the roles of jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks and judges. Teen courts usually function in cooperation with local juvenile courts and youth detention centers, middle and high schools, and/or community organizations such as the YMCA. Most teen courts are sentencing courts in which the offender has already admitted guilt or pleaded no contest.\n\nMany teen courts operate much like a traditional court, holding hearings before a judge and jury with the jury deliberating to determine an appropriate disposition. Other courts employ different structures, such as a judge-panel model which includes a panel of 3 to 6 youth judges who collectively hear, deliberate, and sentence the offender.\n\nOften, sentences will involve the defendant's making restitution to someone harmed or inconvenienced by their actions, or creating an informational awareness project about health, safety, respect, or another topic relevant to the offense. One of the more common sentences is community service. In many jury-based programs it is mandatory that the offender serve on a teen court jury. In some cases, educational workshops are required as part of the sentence, usually in cases involving alcohol or drug charges.\n\nYouth volunteers may be eligible for school or community service credits through their schools, and community awards such as the President's Volunteer Service Award. Adult volunteers serve as trainers, advisors and coordinators of the teen courts; some courts have a small paid staff.\n\nTeen or youth courts provide an alternative court system through which juvenile offenders can be heard and judged by their peers. Most teen courts have strict guidelines for youth volunteers who participate in the sentencing process, which generally includes training, a modified bar exam, peer mentoring and compliance with a code of conduct. Many youth courts establish a youth bar association or ethics body which helps to set guidelines for ethical and fair procedure.\n\nBecause cases heard by teen courts are \"real\" cases, participants in teen court programs are required to sign an oath of confidentiality regarding any information which comes to their knowledge in the course of the teen court case presentation.\n\nState-approved teen courts implement restorative justice and attempt to reintegrate the youth offender to the community while sending appropriate messages to the offender regarding unacceptable behavior. The basic principles of restorative justice are community protection, competency development, and accountability. This system seeks to address the root causes of juvenile offenses and to reduce recidivism. The recidivism rates for standard programs in several states range from 6%-9%, which is less than half of the traditional recidivism rate for juvenile offenders, which hovers around 20%.\n\nRestorative justice principles require the offender to make amends to the victim and/or the community and provide opportunities for victims and community members to participate in the juvenile justice process, providing valued input in decision making. Because of the active role the victim plays, qualitative assessments can be made into victim impact and victim satisfaction.\n\n\n"}

The bluefin averages , and is believed to live up to 50 years.\n\nTuna, opah, and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish – the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to . Found in warm seas, it is extensively fished commercially, and is popular as a game fish. As a result of overfishing, stocks of some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are close to extinction.\n\nThe term \"tuna\" ultimately derives from \"\", the Middle Latin form of the  – which is in turn derived from , \"rush, dart along\".\n\nHowever, the immediate source for the word tuna in English is American Spanish < Spanish \"atún\" < Andalusian Arabic \"at-tūn\", assimilated from \"al-tūn\" التون [Modern Arabic التن] : 'tuna fish' < Greco-Latin \"thunnus\" mentioned above.\n\nThe Thunnini tribe is a monophyletic clade comprising 15 species in five genera:\n\nThe cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa, and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline. The following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family Scombridae. For example, the cladogram illustrates that the skipjack tunas are more closely related to the true tunas than are the slender tunas (the most primitive of the tunas), and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the bonitos of the Sardini tribe.\n\nThe \"true\" tunas are those that belong to the genus \"Thunnus\". Until recently, it was thought that there were seven \"Thunnus\" species, and that Atlantic bluefin tuna and Pacific bluefin tuna were subspecies of a single species. In 1999, Collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations, they are in fact distinct species.\n\nThe genus \"Thunnus\" is further classified into two subgenera: \"Thunnus (Thunnus)\" (the bluefin group), and \"Thunnus (Neothunnus)\" (the yellowfin group).\n\nThe Thunnini tribe also includes seven additional species of tuna across four genera.

Seven to ten yellow finlets run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate – curved like a crescent moon – and tapered to pointy tips. The caudal peduncle, to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal keels on each side. The tuna's dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue, while the ventral side, or underside, is silvery or whitish, for camouflage.\n\n\"Thunnus\" are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters at latitudes ranging between about 45° north and south of the equator. All tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of , in water as cold as . However, unlike \"typical\" endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range.\n\nTunas achieve endothermy by conserving the heat generated through normal metabolism. In all tunas, the heart operates at ambient temperature, as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the gills. The \"rete mirabile\" (\"wonderful net\"), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery, allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from venous blood to be \"re-claimed\" and transferred to the arterial blood via a counter-current exchange system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling. This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-aerobic tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain, which supports faster swimming speeds and reduced energy expenditure, and which enables them to survive in cooler waters over a wider range of ocean environments than those of other fish.\n\nAlso unlike most fish, which have white flesh, the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red. The red myotomal muscles derive their color from myoglobin, an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish. The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles.\n\nFor powerful swimming animals like dolphins and tuna, cavitation may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed. Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed, because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.\n\nTuna is an important commercial fish. The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009, which includes regular updates. According to the ISSF, the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (\"Thunnus albacares\"), bigeye (\"T. obesus\"), bluefin (\"T. thynnus\", \"T. orientalis\", and \"T. macoyii\"), albacore (\"T. alalunga\"), and skipjack (\"Katsuwonus pelamis\").\n\nBased on catches from 2007, the report states:\nThe Australian government alleged in 2006 that Japan had illegally overfished southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2 billion. Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks. According to the WWF, \"Japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial extinction unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas\". Japan's Fisheries Research Agency counters that Australian and New Zealand tuna fishing companies under-report their total catches of southern bluefin tuna and ignore internationally mandated total allowable catch totals.\n\nIn recent years, opening day fish auctions at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market have seen record-setting prices for bluefin tuna, reflecting market demand. In each of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, new record prices have been set for a single fish – the current record is 155.4 million japanese yen (US$1.76 million) for a bluefin, or a unit price of JP¥ 703,167/kg (US$3,603/lb). The opening auction price for 2014 plummeted to less than 5% of the previous year's price, which had drawn complaints for climbing \"way out of line\". A summary of record-setting auctions are shown in the following table (highlighted values indicate new world records):\n\nIn November 2011, a different record was set when a fisherman in Massachusetts caught an tuna. It was captured inadvertently using a dragnet. Due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the United States, federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel. Because of the tuna's deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net, the fish sold for just under $5,000.\n\nBesides for edible purposes, many tuna species are caught frequently as game, often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded based on weight. Larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked, and have been known to injure people who try to catch them, as well as damage their equipment.\n\n\nIn 2005, Nauru, defending its vote from Australian criticism at that year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission, argued that some whale species have the potential to devastate Nauru's tuna stocks, and that Nauru's food security and economy relies heavily on fishing. Despite this, Nauru does not permit whaling in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2010 and 2011 Nauru supported Australian proposals for a western Pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals – a measure which was agreed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission at its eighth meeting in March 2012.\n\nDolphins swim beside several tuna species. These include yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but not albacore. Tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks, which are tuna predators.\n\nCommercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods. Vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath, however the nets were prone to entangling dolphins, injuring or killing them. Public outcry and new government regulations, which are now monitored by NOAA have led to more \"dolphin friendly\" methods, now generally involving lines rather than nets. However, there are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of \"dolphin safeness\", so these protections are not absolute. According to Consumers Union, the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is \"dolphin safe\" should be given little credence.\n\nFishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly, which has caused greater bycatch including sharks, turtles and other oceanic fish. Fishermen no longer follow dolphins, but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as fish aggregation devices, also known as FADs, which attract large populations of other organisms. Measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well.\n\nIncreasing quantities of high-grade tuna are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise southern bluefin tuna, \"Thunnus maccoyii\", and another bluefin species. Farming its close relative, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, \"Thunnus thynnus\", is beginning in the Mediterranean, North America and Japan. Hawaii approved permits for the first U.S. offshore farming of bigeye tuna in water deep in 2009.\n\nJapan is the biggest tuna consuming nation and is also the leader in tuna farming research. Japan first successfully farm-hatched and raised bluefin tuna in 1979. In 2002, it succeeded in completing the reproduction cycle and in 2007, completed a third generation. The farm breed is known as Kindai tuna. Kindai is the contraction of Kinki University in Japanese (Kinki daigaku). In 2009, Clean Seas, an Australian company which has been receiving assistance from Kinki University managed to breed Southern Bluefin Tuna in captivity and was awarded the second place in World's Best Invention of 2009 by \"Time\" magazine.\n\nThe fresh or frozen flesh of tuna is widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where it is shipped, being prepared in a variety of ways for the sake of achieving specific flavors or textures. When served as a steak, the meat of most species is known for its thickness and tough texture.\n\nWhen tuna is canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called tuna fish. Canned tuna was first produced in Australia in 1903, quickly becoming popular. Tuna is canned in edible oils, in brine, in water, and in various sauces. Tuna may be processed and labeled as \"solid\", \"chunked\" or \"flaked\". When canned, the product is often referred to as \"tuna fish\", a calque (loan translation) from the German \"Thunfisch\".\n\nIn the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for sandwiches; 22% for tuna salads; and 15% for tuna casseroles and dried and prepackaged meal kits, such as General Mills's Tuna Helper line. Depending upon the color of the flesh of the tuna species, the can is marked as \"light\" or \"white\" meat, with \"light\" meaning a greyish pink color and \"white\" meaning a light pink color. In the United States, only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as \"white meat tuna\"; in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s canned tuna in Australia was most likely Southern bluefin, it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled \"northern bluefin\" or \"longtail\").\n\nAs tunas are often caught far from where they are processed, poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically gutted by hand, and later pre-cooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and filleted, canned, and sealed, with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food. The sealed can is then heated under pressure (called retort cooking) for 2 to 4 hours. This process kills any bacteria, but retains the histamine that may have been produced by those bacteria. The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had \"off\" flavors.\n\nAustralian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna, but these regulations were dropped in 2003. The remaining weight is usually oil or water. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates canned tuna (see part \"c\").\n\nCanned light tuna in oil is 29% protein, 8% fat, 60% water, and contains no carbohydrates, while providing 200 calories in a 100 gram reference amount (table). It is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of phosphorus (44% DV) and vitamin D (45% DV), and a moderate source of iron (11% DV).\n\nMercury content in tuna can vary widely. Among those calling for improved warnings about mercury in tuna is the American Medical Association, which adopted a policy that physicians should help make their patients more aware of the potential risks. A study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in the meat of farmed tuna is inversely related to the lipid content, suggesting that higher lipid concentration within edible tissues of tuna raised in captivity might, other factors remaining equal, have a diluting effect on mercury content. Due to their high position in the food chain and the subsequent accumulation of heavy metals from their diet, mercury levels can be high in larger species such as bluefin and bigeye. Mackeral tuna is one species of tuna that is lower in mercury concentration than skipjack or yellowfin, but this species is known as \"black meat\" or \"dark meat\" tuna, which is a lower grade for canning because of the color, unfavorable flavor, and poor yield.\n\nIn March 2004, the United States FDA issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children limit their intake of tuna and other predatory fish. The Environmental Protection Agency provides guidelines on how much canned tuna is safe to eat. Roughly speaking, the guidelines recommend one can of light tuna per week for individuals weighing less than , and two cans per week for those who weigh more. In 2007 it was reported that some canned light tuna such as yellowfin tuna is significantly higher in mercury than skipjack, and caused Consumers Union and other activist groups to advise pregnant women to refrain from consuming canned tuna. In 2009, a California appeals court upheld a ruling that canned tuna does not need warning labels as the methylmercury is naturally occurring.\n\nA January 2008 report revealed potentially dangerous levels of mercury in certain varieties of sushi tuna, reporting levels \"so high that the Food and Drug Administration could take legal action to remove the fish from the market.\"\n\nThe main tuna fishery management bodies are the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The five gathered for the first time in Kobe, Japan in January 2007. Environmental organizations made submissions on risks to fisheries and species. The meeting concluded with an action plan drafted by some 60 countries or areas. Concrete steps include issuing certificates of origin to prevent illegal fishing and greater transparency in the setting of regional fishing quotas. The delegates were scheduled to meet at another joint meeting in January or February 2009 in Europe.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the albacore, bigeye tuna, Pacific bluefin tuna, Atlantic bluefin tuna, southern bluefin tuna, and yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list, which are fish \"commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\nBluefin tuna have been widely accepted as being severely overfished, with some stocks at risk of collapse. According to the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (a global, nonprofit partnership between the tuna industry, scientists, and the World Wide Fund for Nature), Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna, Pacific Ocean (eastern and western) bigeye tuna, and North Atlantic albacore tuna are all overfished. In April 2009, no stock of skipjack tuna (which makes up roughly 60% of all tuna fished worldwide) was considered to be overfished.\nHowever, the BBC documentary \"South Pacific\", which first aired in May 2009, stated that, should fishing in the Pacific continue at its current rate, populations of all tuna species could collapse within five years. It highlighted huge Japanese and European tuna fishing vessels, sent to the South Pacific international waters after overfishing their own fish stocks to the point of collapse.\n\nA 2010 tuna fishery assessment report, released in January 2012 by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supported this finding, recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered.\n\nResearch indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the tuna in the Indian Ocean, where rapid warming of the ocean has resulted in a reduction of marine phytoplankton. The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.\n\n\n\n"}

S&P had announced a negative outlook on the AAA rating in April 2011. The downgrade to AA+ occurred four days after the 112th United States Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling of the federal government by means of the Budget Control Act of 2011 on August 2, 2011. Later, the US Government commenced an investigation into S&P's role in the rating of several mortgage backed securities which played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. In order to mend its relationship with the US government, S&P asked its then CEO to step down, a mere 18 days after the US was downgraded. S&P announced on August 23, 2011 that Deven Sharma would step down as a Chief of Standard & Poor's effective September 12, 2011, and would leave the company by end of the year.\n\nThe downgrade was criticized by the U.S. Treasury Department, both Democratic and Republican Party political figures, and many business people and economists.\n\nBoth Fitch Ratings and Moody's, designated like S&P as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), retained the U.S.'s triple-A rating. Moody's, however, changed its outlook to negative on June 2, 2011 and Fitch changed its outlook to negative on November 28, 2011.\n\nA credit rating is issued by a credit rating agency (CRA). A credit rating assigned to U.S. sovereign debt is an expression of how likely the assigning CRA thinks it is that the U.S. will pay back its debts. A credit rating assigned to U.S. sovereign debt also influences the interest rates the U.S. will have to pay on its debt; if its debtholders know the debt will be paid back, they do not have to price the chance of default into the interest rate. However, it should be noted that these ratings sometimes measure different things; for instance Moody's considers the expected value of the debt in the event of a default in addition to the probability of default. Some lenders also have contractual requirements only to hold debt above a certain credit rating.\n\nThe U.S. government enjoys the highest credit rating (\"AAA\"/\"Aaa\") from two of the Big Three CRAs. The U.S. enjoyed the \"gold standard\" of triple-A ratings from all three agencies (Fitch, Moody's and S&P) from the time of their recognition as standards by the SEC until the S&P downgrade in early August 2011.\n\nGovernment agencies such as the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Treasury Department have all reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges. In the short-run, tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe recession and tax-policy choices, while expenditures have expanded for wars, unemployment insurance and other safety net spending. In the long-run, expenditures related to healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are growing considerably faster than the economy overall as the population matures.\n\nOn April 18, 2011, U.S.-based rating agency S&P issued a \"negative\" outlook on the U.S.'s \"AAA\" (highest quality) sovereign-debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there was a one-in-three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. S&P considered the government budget deficit of more than 11 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and net government debt rising to about 80 percent or more of GDP by 2013, to be high relative to other \"AAA\" countries. According to S&P, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a \"stable\" outlook. The S&P press release stated: \"We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policymakers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium– and long-term budgetary challenges by 2013; if an agreement is not reached and meaningful implementation is not begun by then, this would, in our view, render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than that of peer 'AAA' sovereigns.\"\n\nIn June, Moody's followed suit, warning that if Congress did not quickly raise the debt ceiling above $14.3 trillion, the agency might reduce the debt rating. Moody's also commented on the political process, warning that the heightened polarization on both sides increased the risk of a default. On July 14, 2011, S&P issued a research update putting the U.S. debt on a 90-day CreditWatch.\n\nOn July 16, 2011, Egan-Jones Rating Company, a smaller CRA, cut its rating from AAA to AA+, the first NRSRO to do so.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, representatives from S&P announced the company's decision to give its first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to \"AA+\", with a negative outlook.\n\nS&P was direct in its criticism of the governance and policy-making process, which took the U.S. to the brink of default as part of the 2011 U.S. debt-ceiling crisis that same week:\n\n\nS&P revised the revenue assumptions underlying one of their future debt-level projections:\n\n\nThe report specifically refused to take a position on the blend of policy choices necessary to improve or maintain the credit rating:\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican politicians criticized S&P's decision, as well as placing blame with the other party. Few blamed themselves despite bi-partisan Congressional responsibility for passing budget deficits from 2002 onward and significant deficits for the 2012–2021 periods in U.S. President Barack Obama's 2012 federal budget.\n\nAlmost immediately after S&P announced the downgrade, first reported after 8 p.m. on a Friday night, Obama administration officials began to publicly criticize S&P's decision.\n\nRepublican strategists blamed Democratic intransigence for the rating agency's decision, and many Republican presidential candidates blamed the actions of Obama:\n\n\nDemocratic politicians placed the blame for the downgrade on Republicans or elements of the Republican Party.\n\n\nIn addition to the Obama administration's criticism, several liberal commentators, among them billionaire Warren Buffett and Nobel Memorial Prize winner Paul Krugman, also criticized the downgrade. Michael Moore demanded Obama \"show some guts\" and have the head of Standard & Poors arrested.\n\nAccording to Mike Allen's \"Politico Playbook\", \"As a result of an error in constructing discretionary spending levels underlying the analysis, the deficit was $2 trillion higher over 10 years than the Congressional Budget Office would estimate. Treasury flagged the discrepancy to S&P, which admitted a mistake.\"\n\nCommentators pointed out that a downgrade might result in an increase in interest rates required to finance U.S. debt, potentially raising interest costs.\n\nAn August 7, 2011, editorial by Bloomberg mentioned that several other countries downplayed the downgrade.\n\nGlobal stock markets declined on August 8, 2011, following the announcement. All three major U.S. stock indexes declined between five and seven percent in one day. However, U.S. treasury bonds, which had been the subject of the downgrade, actually rose in price and the dollar gained in value against the Euro and the British pound, indicating a general flight to safe assets amid concerns about a European debt crisis.\n\nHowever, based on historical information from Bloomberg, the cost to insure U.S. debts against default had risen from an average of around 25 basis points in 2007 to a range from 55 to 75 basis points in 2011. A higher cost of insurance is typically associated with increased risk of default.\n\nAlthough none of the Big Three took any downgrade action in 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded twice further. After its initial rating cut on July 16, 2011 from AAA to AA+, Egan-Jones cut its rating a second time on April 5, 2012 from AA+ to AA \"because of the lack of any tangible progress on addressing the problems and the continued rise in debt to GDP.\" On September 14, 2012, Egan-Jones cut its rating a third time from AA to AA-, the lowest of what is considered \"high grade\", as a reaction to QE3.\n\nOn October 15, 2013 the credit agency Fitch warned that it may cut the U.S. credit rating, citing the political brinkmanship over raising the federal debt ceiling.\n\nOn October 17, 2013 Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A-, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.\n\nFitch Ratings on March 21, 2014 upgraded its outlook for the U.S. AAA credit rating, removing the nation from a downgrade watch after politicians put off another debt limit battle until next year.\nThe company, one of three major credit rating firms, changed the outlook for the rating to stable from a negative watch put in place in October.\n\nTwo weeks after the August, 2011 S&P downgrade, SEC and Department of Justice announced that S&P was under investigation. Columnist Bob Sullivan of NBC News asked if \"the ratings downgrade from Standard & Poor’s [could] be viewed as a shot back at a government that's been taking plenty of shots at the ratings industry lately.\" And two years later in 2013, S&P \"blasted a $5 billion fraud lawsuit by the U.S. government as retaliation for its 2011 decision to strip the country of its AAA credit rating.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the second downgrade by Egan-Jones in April 2012 to AA, the SEC voted to bring administrative action against that firm regarding years-old activity. Mr. Egan said at the time, \"We are not going to be intimidated by anybody from issuing timely, accurate ratings.\" After Egan-Jones agreed to a settlement in 2013, the SEC director Robert Khuzami said in a press release, \"EJR and Egan's misrepresentation of the firm's actual experience rating issuers of asset-backed and government securities is a serious violation that undercuts the integrity of the SEC's NRSRO [Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization] registration process.\" In response, a Fox Business Network editor raised the question of \"government retaliation\" and an Egan-Jones spokesman issued a non-apology apology stating that the \"SEC settlement lets us focus on what we do best—producing the most accurate and independent ratings in the business.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1546202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546202", "title": "Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water", "text": "Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water\n\nVienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) is a water standard defining the isotopic composition of fresh water. It was promulgated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (based in Vienna) in 1968, and, since 1993, continues to be evaluated and studied by the IAEA along with the European Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements and the American National Institute of Standards and Technology. The standard includes both the established values of stable isotopes found in waters and calibration materials provided for standardization and interlaboratory comparisons of instruments used to measure these values in experimental materials.\n\nThe designation \"ocean water\" refers only to the evaporation of ocean waters in the water cycle as the original source of fresh surface and ground waters and precipitation, but VSMOW is not a standard for seawater. Fresh distilled VSMOW water is also used for making high accuracy measurement of water's physical properties and for defining laboratory standards since it is considered to be representative of average ocean water, in effect representing all water on Earth.\n\nBefore VSMOW was defined, average ocean water and melted snow were used as references. These conventions were refined in the 1960s by the standardized definition of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). The U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) created physical water standards for global use. However, the physical integrity of the U.S. standards came into question. The use of the SMOW standard was discontinued.\n\nVSMOW is a recalibration of the original SMOW definition and was created in 1967 by Harmon Craig and other researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego who mixed distilled ocean waters collected from different spots around the globe. VSMOW remains one of the major isotopic water benchmarks in use today.\n\nThe isotopic composition of VSMOW water is specified as ratios of the molar abundance of the rare isotope in question divided by that of its most common isotope and is expressed as parts per million (ppm). For instance O (the most common isotope of oxygen with eight protons and eight neutrons) is roughly 2632 times more prevalent in sea water than is O (with an additional neutron). The isotopic ratios of VSMOW water are defined as follows:\n\n\nIt should be noted that every molecule of water has 2 hydrogen atoms, so if one considers 3210 (half of 6420) molecules of water and only one of the molecules of the 3210 has one of its two hydrogen atoms with the neutron, this gives the ratio of 1:6420 of deuterium, but there would only be a ratio of 1:3210 for HDO (which is 312 ppm of HDO water molecules). Furthermore, the number of molecules per million of (a molecule in which both hydrogen atoms are deuterium) would only be one molecule in about 10 million molecules. Probability dictates that the vast majority of molecules will have only 1 deuterium atom, not two; only if there were some rule that required water to have either two atoms of deuterium or no atoms of deuterium would the ratio of to to be the same as the ratio of deuterium to light hydrogen. This can be shown by imagining a \"roulette wheel\" with 6420 places and only one of them is red with the others green. The chance that the ball will land on red twice in a row is less than 1 in ten million, so a molecule of is extremely rare in normal water. \n\nIf equal quantities of and were to be mixed together, the ratio of H to D would remain 1:1, but the ratio of to would soon change to 1:2:1 for , HDO and . This because some of the water would \"capture\" deuterium from the and the there would be an equilibrium with twice as much DHO as either or . This exchange also occurs in normal water--an exchange between and HDO (or and HDO) gives a net result of zero, but an exchange between and results in HDO, and this is why the amount of is a somewhat less than the 1 in 6420-squared expected by probability.\n\nVery pure, carefully distilled VSMOW water is important in the manufacture of high-accuracy temperature measurement reference standards. Both the Kelvin and Celsius scales are defined by the triple point of water (273.16 K and 0.01 °C). Due to differences in isotopic composition, water samples from various sources may exhibit slight differences in physical properties, such as density, boiling point, and vapor pressure. Consequently, snow, river water, and rainwater, all of which are recently evaporated ocean water, tend to be enriched in the lighter isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, causing water to evaporate more quickly.\n\nTemperature reference cells filled with water of improper isotopic composition can cause errors of several hundred microkelvin in the measured triple point.\n\nTo address this issue, the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CPIM), also known as the International Committee for Weights and Measures, affirmed in 2005 that for the purposes of specifying the temperature of the triple point of water, the definition of the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water with a composition of the nominal specification of VSMOW. The decision was welcomed in 2007 by Resolution 10 of the 23rd CGPM.\n\nOne effect of defining the triple point of VSMOW as both 0.01 °C and 273.16 K is that neither the melting or boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325 kPa) remain defining points for the Celsius scale. In 1948, when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point was so close to being 0.01 °C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as exactly 0.01 °C. However, current measurements show that the triple and melting points of VSMOW water are only  °C apart. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is  °C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16 K defined the magnitude of each 1 °C increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value \"100 °C\" is hotter than 0 °C, in absolute terms, by a factor of \"exactly\" formula_1 (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering \"strictly\" to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C). When calibrated to ITS-90 (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW water is slightly less, about 99.974 °C.\n\nThis boiling–point difference of 16.1 millikelvins between the Celsius scale's original definition and the current one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in real life because water's boiling point is highly sensitive to variations in barometric pressure. For example, an altitude change of only 28 cm (11 in) causes water's boiling point to change by one millikelvin.\n\n\n"}
