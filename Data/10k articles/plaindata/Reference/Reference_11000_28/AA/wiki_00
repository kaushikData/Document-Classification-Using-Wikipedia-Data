From 1888–1891 Tumansky, then an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, received his Oriental education at the Officers' Courses of Oriental Languages organized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He studied Arabic, Turkish and Persian; in all he spoke eleven languages.\n\nFrom 1891–1895 Tumansky was stationed in Central Asia. In 1894 he was responsible for establishing communications with Persia. Between 1900 and 1905 he served as the Russian vice consul in Van, Turkey. From 1908 to 1909 he was ordered to Persia again to resume his diplomatic duties. In 1911 he was appointed the head of the officers’ Oriental language preparatory school in Tiflis (Tbilisi), which functioned under the Headquarters of the Caucasian Military Command.\n\nIn March 1917, Tumansky retired from the military service with the rank of Major-General. He left Russia after the October Revolution in 1917 and died in Constantinople (Istanbul) on 1 December 1920.\n\nTumansky is one of the first Russian-language scholars to investigate the Bábí movement in Persia in the middle of the 19th century and the first Bahá'ís in the East. He befriended the Bahá'ís in Ashgabat where Mirza Abu'l-Fadl wrote for him the \"Risáliy-i Iskandaríyyh\", a summary of the life of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith. In 1899 he discovered the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" by Bahá'u'lláh and translated it into Russian. Now the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas\" is generally known, but in that time it was an epochal discovery. During his research of the Bábí movement Tumansky corresponded with E.G. Browne through Baron Victor Romanovich Rosen.\n\nAnother of his discoveries was a lost work of Ulugh-Beg, an ancient manuscript entitled “Olus-e-Arba’a”, part of which, \"Hudud ul-'alam\", was published in 1930 and in 1937.\n\nBeing a military man, he wrote a book entitled \"Military Art of the Ancient Arabs\" in 1897.\n\nRussian Orientalist I. U. Krachkovskiy (1883–1951) wrote that Tumansky was one of the rare orientalists by his calling but not by his profession.\n\n1.

The term is German and has no English equivalent, although a door, where there is one, to such a hole is called a trapdoor (German: \"Falltür\"). \n\nAn \"angstloch\" is usually located above the basement of a fighting tower or \"bergfried\". The description of these basement rooms as \"dungeons\" stems from the romanticised castle studies of the 19th century. There is no evidence to indicate that prisoners were really lowered through the \"angstloch\" into the dungeon using a rope or rope ladder as these 19th century accounts suggest. Archaeological finds, by contrast, indicate the use of these basement spaces as store rooms. For example, piles of stones have been found in such rooms that suggest they were used as a store for projectiles to be used in time of siege.\n\n"}
{"id": "1684419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1684419", "title": "Antonino Rocca", "text": "Antonino Rocca\n\nAntonino Rocca (born Antonino Biasetton, 13 April 1921 – 15 March 1977) was an Italian Argentinian professional wrestler. He tag teamed with partner Miguel Pérez. He was posthumously inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 1995 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\nAs a soccer and rugby player when he moved to Argentina before World War II, Rocca was known for his unique, acrobatic, off-the-ground, flying wrestling style. Rocca started his American professional wrestling career in the late 1940s in Texas. He had been trained by former World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion Stanislaus Zbyszko in Argentina. In the early 1950s, he held two regionally recognized World Heavyweight Championships while still headlining nationwide, frequently in territories where other wrestlers were the recognized champions.\n\nIn 1949, Rocca started wrestling in the New York City-area territory for Joseph Raymond \"Toots\" Mondt, and the Johnston family of promoters, which controlled wrestling at Madison Square Garden and Mondt, who owned Rocca's exclusive contract. The territory had been one of the four largest-grossing areas up until the mid-1930s New York, and would later be run by Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC, now WWE).\n\nRocca later formed a tag team with Jose Miguel Pérez in 1957. Together, they captured the NWA Capitol World Tag Team Championship, which was the top tag team title used in the CWC, and like so many other titles, was a regional one. They were never defeated after winning this title, but the appellation was abandoned after about five years. Perez was videotaped with his original championship belt from that title in a 1987 30th anniversary tribute, after Rocca's death.\n\nIn 1963, the CWC left the NWA when it was renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). WWE history lists a tournament final to crown the first WWWF World Heavyweight Champion as Buddy Rogers over Rocca on 29 April 1963 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but this tournament is fictitious. Rogers had legitimately held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but lost that title to Lou Thesz in Toronto earlier in 1963 in a match – and rematch – ignored by the New York City and Chicago promoters.\n\nIn 1959 and into 1960, Rocca worked briefly with Kola Kwariani and under Jack Pfefer, took effective control of the Garden's wrestling office. Kwariani had just broken away from his partnership with Vince McMahon, Sr. Rocca then set the post-World War II record for wrestling-attendance at Madison Square Garden's 49th–50th Street location, drawing 21,950 fans in a singles match against an obscure wrestler named The Amazing Zuma, also known as Argentina Zuma, on 2 January 1960, as reported by \"The New York Times\". This was part of a series of three matches between the two held during a four-month period, when the pair drew, on another night, almost as many fans to the Garden. Rocca had also been provided with new wrestler Bruno Sammartino as a tag team partner. However, when this team failed to sell-out the Garden, the pair was split up to wrestle each other in the hopes that business would pick up, but it did not. Eventually, McMahon Sr. took the New York territory back and built it by first featuring \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers and then, a few years later, the by-then charismatic Sammartino as its champion.\n\nAfter a demotion, and with the arrival of Buddy Rogers as the featured star at the Garden in 1961, within a few years Rocca left the WWWF and briefly set up a competing promotion (supported by Jim Crockett, Sr. and others) based at the Sunnyside arena in Queens, New York. In the mid-1970s, he teamed up with Vince McMahon to handle the color commentary on the WWWF's weekly television show. He provided color commentary on \"WWF Championship Wrestling\" and \"All-Star Wrestling\" from 1972-76.\n\nRocca was involved as a professional wrestler, but also as a referee in Japan during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He refereed a number of matches for the Japan Pro Wrestling Association (JPA), and later followed Antonio Inoki to New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1972.\n\nIn 1973, he joined the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico with partner Miguel Pérez. They captured the defunct WWC North American Tag Team Championship on 11 September 1976 by defeating Los Infernos. They lost the championship to Higo Hamaguchi and Gordon Nelson on 16 October.\n\nRocca was depicted wrestling Superman on the cover of the \"Superman\" No. 155 (August 1962) comic book. The 1976 horror film \"Alice, Sweet Alice\", featuring child actress Brooke Shields, includes Rocca in a bit part.\n\nMaestro Arturo Toscanini, a professional wrestling fan, was good friends with Rocca.\n\nRocca died on 15 March 1977, at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City after complications following a urinary infection. His funeral was attended by thousands and made the front page of New York newspapers.\n\n\n\n"}

It hosts a frequently changing programme of exhibitions and events, with no permanent exhibition. It opened in 2002 in a converted flour mill.\n\nBaltic's director is Sarah Munro who joined in November 2015, the first woman in its history to hold the position. Baltic is a registered charity under English law.\n\nThe founding director, Sune Nordgren was appointed in 1997 and was integral in Baltic's pre-launch period, having overseen the building of the gallery and was there for the first one million visitors. After almost six years, Nordgren left to take up a new post as founding director of the National Museum for Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo, Norway. He was briefly succeeded by Stephen Snoddy who was only with the organisation for one year. Snoddy was succeeded as director by Peter Doroshenko in 2005, intended to increase visitor numbers and resolve the financial situation. Doroshenko organized several exhibitions during his time at the Baltic, including \"Spank the Monkey\". In November 2007, Doroshenko left the gallery to head up the PinchukArtCentre in Kiev, Ukraine. Since 2008, the director was Godfrey Worsdale, founding director of the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. Sarah Munro became director in November 2015.\n\nOn 20 September 2007, Baltic management contacted Northumbria Police for advice regarding whether or not a photograph should be displayed as part of the \"Thanksgiving\" installation, a forthcoming exhibition by American photographer Nan Goldin. The photograph entitled \"Klara and Edda belly-dancing\" (which, along with the rest of the installation, is part of the Sir Elton John Photography Collection) features two naked young girls and had previously been exhibited around the world without objections. The installation, which had been scheduled for a four-month exhibition, opened with the remaining photographs but closed after just nine days at the request of the owner.\n\nIn 2011, Baltic was the venue for the Turner Prize, this was the first time the event had been held outside of a London or Liverpool Tate in its 25 years. The Turner Prize exhibition at BALTIC attracted over 149,000 visitors, more than at any previous Turner Prize exhibition.\n\nThe Baltic Flour Mill was built by Rank Hovis to a late-1930s design by architects Gelder and Kitchen and completed in 1950. It was extended in 1957 by the addition of an animal feed mill. The mill was closed in 1981. It was one of a number of mills located along the banks of the Tyne, all of which, due to their size, were prominent local landmarks. The Spillers mill just downstream from the Baltic on the north bank of the river was demolished in 2011. Another large mill was owned by the CWS and was located just upstream of Dunston Staithes. The site of this mill and the adjacent CWS soap works is now occupied by a residential development.\n\nDominic Williams of Ellis Williams Architects won an architectural design competition, managed by RIBA Competitions, in the mid-1990s to convert the 1950s Baltic Flour Mill into a centre for art. After ten years in the planning and a capital investment of £50m, including £33.4m from the Arts Council Lottery Fund, Baltic opened to the public at midnight on Saturday 13 July 2002. The inaugural exhibition, \"B.OPEN\", had work by Chris Burden, Carsten Holler, Julian Opie, Jaume Plensa and Jane and Louise Wilson and attracted over 35,000 visitors in the first week. An early exhibit of the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara, a Japanese girl, can be seen in the window of the east elevation.\n"}

CONs are issued by a federal or state regulatory agency with authority over an area to affirm that the plan is required to fulfill the needs of a community. The concept of the CON first arose in the field of health care and was passed first in New York in 1964 and then into federal law during the Richard Nixon administration in 1972. Certificates of need are necessary for the construction of medical facilities in 35 states and are issued by state health care agencies:\n\nA number of factors spurred states to require CONs in the health care industry. Chief among these was the concern that the construction of excess hospital capacity would cause competitors in an over-saturated field to cover the costs of a diluted patient pool by over-charging, or by convincing patients to accept hospitalization unnecessarily.\n\nIn some instances where state and federal authorities overlap, federal regulations may defer authority from the federal agency to the state agency with concurrent authority as to the issuance of a certificate of need. However, deferment of this authority is not required. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued the following determination:\n\nCONs are sometimes sold in bankruptcy as an asset and the CON requirement is sometimes used by competitors to block the reopening of existing hospitals.\n\nSince new hospitals cannot be constructed without proving a \"need\", the certificate-of-need system grants monopoly privileges to already existing hospitals. Consequently, Alaska House of Representatives member Bob Lynn has argued that the true motivation behind certificate-of-need legislation is that \"large hospitals are... trying to make money by eliminating competition\" under the pretext of using monopoly profits to provide better patient care.\n\n"}
{"id": "7754560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7754560", "title": "Chronicle of Ireland", "text": "Chronicle of Ireland\n\nThe Chronicle of Ireland is the modern name for a hypothesized collection of ecclesiastical annals recording events in Ireland from 432 to 911 AD.\n\nSeveral surviving annals share events in the same sequence and wording, until 911 when they continue separate narratives. They include the Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of Ulster, the Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of Clonmacnoise, the Annals of Tigernach, the Annals of Roscrea, the Annals of Boyle, and the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland. \"The Chronicle of Ireland\" represents the scholarly consensus solution to this Gaelic synoptic problem.\n\nEvents are listed in separate entries under the heading of a single year. Most entries consist of only one or two sentences, and some years contain only one or two entries. The Viking raid on Iona Abbey in 806, in which the entire population of the abbey was massacred, is recorded with typical brevity: \"The community of Iona was killed by the \"gentiles\", that is sixty-eight (referring to the number of dead).\"\n\nThere is no direct evidence for the identity of the Chronicle's successive authors, but scholars are confident that it was produced by annalists working in churches and monasteries and was intended for an ecclesiastical audience. The version of the Chronicle that annalists and chroniclers were working from was written in different places at different times; the earliest evidence for one of its authors places it in Iona sometime after 563, continuing until about 642. Around 639, another chronicle of uncertain origin was begun elsewhere and merged with the Iona chronicle in the second half of the 7th century. The chronicle was then continued until about 740. From about 740 to 911, the Chronicle's annalist was working in the Irish midlands, probably in the province of Brega (sometimes \"Breagh\") but possibly in the monastery at Clonard. Some scholars believe that work may have moved to Armagh by the beginning of the 9th century, but debate continues on this point.\n\nAfter 911, the Chronicle's descendants break into two main branches: one in Armagh, which was integrated into the Annals of Ulster; and a \"Clonmacnoise group\" including the Annals of Clonmacnoise (an English translation), the Annals of Tigernach (fragmentary), the Chronicum Scotorum (an abbreviation of Tigernach), and the Annals of the Four Masters. Most surviving witnesses to the lost Chronicle's original content are descended from the Clonmacnoise chronicle.\n\nA large number of the Chronicle's entries are obituaries. The cause of death was significant to the annalists as an indicator of the death's \"spiritual quality\"; they felt it indicated whether the deceased would go to Heaven or Hell.\n\nAfter 800, records of Viking raids (as in the example above) also make up a large number of entries. Other entries include observations of astronomical events, such as a solar eclipse that took place on June 29, 512. Some events outside Ireland also appear in the Chronicle; during some parts of the eighth and ninth centuries, its chronology for certain events in England is more accurate than that of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\n\nAs of the middle 7th century, the Chronicle's dating scheme \"consisted of a kalend (Kl) followed, until at least the mid-seventh century, by the ferial of 1 January\". This scheme, and much of the Chronicle's witness to world history prior to 400, was based on the chronicle of Rufinus of Aquileia who wrote in the early 5th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2433279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2433279", "title": "Comparison of Unicode encodings", "text": "Comparison of Unicode encodings\n\nThis article compares Unicode encodings. Two situations are considered: 8-bit-clean environments, and environments that forbid use of byte values that have the high bit set. Originally such prohibitions were to allow for links that used only seven data bits, but they remain in the standards and so software must generate messages that comply with the restrictions. Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode and Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode are excluded from the comparison tables because it is difficult to simply quantify their size.\n\nA UTF-8 file that contains only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file. Legacy programs can generally handle UTF-8 encoded files, even if they contain non-ASCII characters. For instance, the C printf function can print a UTF-8 string, as it only looks for the ASCII '%' character to define a formatting string, and prints all other bytes unchanged, thus non-ASCII characters will be output unchanged.\n\nUTF-16 and UTF-32 are incompatible with ASCII files, and thus require Unicode-aware programs to display, print and manipulate them, even if the file is known to contain only characters in the ASCII subset. Because they contain many zero bytes, the strings cannot be manipulated by normal null-terminated string handling for even simple operations such as copy.\n\nTherefore, even on most UTF-16 systems such as Windows and Java, UTF-16 text files are not common; older 8-bit encodings such as ASCII or ISO-8859-1 are still used, forgoing Unicode support; or UTF-8 is used for Unicode. One rare counter-example is the \"strings\" file used by Mac OS X (10.3 and later) applications for lookup of internationalized versions of messages which defaults to UTF-16, with \"files encoded using UTF-8 ... not guaranteed to work.\"\n\nXML is, by default, encoded as UTF-8, and all XML processors must at least support UTF-8 (including US-ASCII by definition) and UTF-16.\n\nUTF-8 requires 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits (one to four octets (bytes) to encode a Unicode character, UTF-16 requires either 16 or 32 bits to encode a character, and UTF-32 always requires 32 bits to encode a character. The first 128 Unicode code points, U+0000 to U+007F, used for the C0 Controls and Basic Latin characters and which correspond one-to-one to their ASCII-code equivalents, are encoded using 8 bits in UTF-8, 16 bits in UTF-16, and 32 bits in UTF-32. The next 1,920 characters, U+0080 to U+07FF (encompassing the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets, and also Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Tāna and N'Ko), require 16 bits to encode in both UTF-8 and UTF-16, and 32 bits in UTF-32. For U+0800 to U+FFFF, i.e. the remainder of the characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, plane 0, U+0000 to U+FFFF), which encompasses the rest of the characters of most of the world's living languages, UTF-8 needs 24 bits to encode a character, while UTF-16 needs 16 bits and UTF-32 needs 32. Code points U+010000 to U+10FFFF, which represent characters in the supplementary planes (planes 1-16), require 32 bits in UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. All printable characters in UTF-EBCDIC use at least as many bytes as in UTF-8, and most use more, due to a decision made to allow encoding the C1 control codes as single bytes. For seven-bit environments, UTF-7 is more space efficient than the combination of other Unicode encodings with quoted-printable or base64 for almost all types of text (see \"Seven-bit environments\" below).\n\nEach format has its own set of advantages and disadvantages with respect to storage efficiency (and thus also of transmission time) and processing efficiency. Storage efficiency is subject to the location within the Unicode code space in which any given text's characters are predominantly from. Since Unicode code space blocks are organized by character set (i.e. alphabet/script), storage efficiency of any given text effectively depends on the alphabet/script used for that text. So, for example, UTF-8 needs one less byte per character (8 versus 16 bits) than UTF-16 for the 128 code points between U+0000 and U+007F, but needs one more byte per character (24 versus 16 bits) for the 63,488 code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF. Therefore, if there are more characters in the range U+0000 to U+007F than there are in the range U+0800 to U+FFFF then UTF-8 is more efficient, while if there are fewer then UTF-16 is more efficient. If the counts are equal then they are exactly the same size. A surprising result is that real-world documents written in languages that use characters only in the high range are still often shorter in UTF-8, due to the extensive use of spaces, digits, punctuation, newlines, html markup, and embedded words and acronyms written with Latin letters.\n\nAs far as processing time is concerned, text with variable-length encoding such as UTF-8 or UTF-16 is harder to process if there is a need to find the individual code units, as opposed to working with sequences of code units. Searching is unaffected by whether the characters are variable sized, since a search for a sequence of code units does not care about the divisions (it does require that the encoding be self-synchronizing, which both UTF-8 and UTF-16 are). A common misconception is that there is a need to \"find the \"n\"th character\" and that this requires a fixed-length encoding; however, in real use the number \"n\" is only derived from examining the characters, thus sequential access is needed anyway. UTF-16BE and UTF-32BE are big-endian, UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE are little-endian. When character sequences in one endian order are loaded onto a machine with a different endian order, the characters need to be converted before they can be processed efficiently, unless data is processed with a byte granularity (as required for UTF-8). Accordingly, the issue at hand is more pertinent to the protocol and communication than to a computational difficulty.\n\nFor processing, a format should be easy to search, truncate, and generally process safely. All normal Unicode encodings use some form of fixed size code unit. Depending on the format and the code point to be encoded, one or more of these code units will represent a Unicode code point. To allow easy searching and truncation, a sequence must not occur within a longer sequence or across the boundary of two other sequences. UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 and UTF-EBCDIC have these important properties but UTF-7 and GB 18030 do not.\n\nFixed-size characters can be helpful, but even if there is a fixed byte count per code point (as in UTF-32), there is not a fixed byte count per displayed character due to combining characters. Considering these incompatibilities and other quirks among different encoding schemes, handling unicode data with the same (or compatible) protocol throughout and across the interfaces (e.g. using an API/library, handling unicode characters in client/server model, etc) can in general simplify the whole pipeline while eliminating a potential source of bugs at the same time.\n\nUTF-16 is popular because many APIs date to the time when Unicode was 16-bit fixed width. However, using UTF-16 makes characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane a special case which increases the risk of oversights related to their handling. That said, programs that mishandle surrogate pairs probably also have problems with combining sequences, so using UTF-32 is unlikely to solve the more general problem of poor handling of multi-code-unit characters.\n\nIf any stored data is in UTF-8 (such as file contents or names), it is very difficult to write a system that uses UTF-16 or UTF-32 as an API. This is due to the oft-overlooked fact that the byte array used by UTF-8 can physically contain invalid sequences. For instance, it is impossible to fix an invalid UTF-8 filename using a UTF-16 API, as no possible UTF-16 string will translate to that invalid filename. The opposite is not true: it is trivial to translate invalid UTF-16 to a unique (though technically invalid) UTF-8 string, so a UTF-8 API can control both UTF-8 and UTF-16 files and names, making UTF-8 preferred in any such mixed environment. An unfortunate but far more common workaround used by UTF-16 systems is to interpret the UTF-8 as some other encoding such as CP-1252 and ignore the mojibake for any non-ASCII data.\n\nUTF-16 and UTF-32 do not have endianness defined, so a byte order must be selected when receiving them over a byte-oriented network or reading them from a byte-oriented storage. This may be achieved by using a byte-order mark at the start of the text or assuming big-endian (RFC 2781). UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE, UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE are standardised on a single byte order and do not have this problem.\n\nIf the byte stream is subject to corruption then some encodings recover better than others. UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are best in this regard as they can always resynchronize at the start of the next code point; GB 18030 is unable to recover after a corrupt or missing byte until the next ASCII non-number. UTF-16 and UTF-32 will handle corrupt (altered) bytes by resynchronizing on the next good code point, but an odd number of lost or spurious byte (octet)s will garble all following text.\n\nThe tables below list the number of bytes per code point for different Unicode ranges. Any additional comments needed are included in the table. The figures assume that overheads at the start and end of the block of text are negligible.\n\"N.B. The tables below list numbers of bytes per code point, not per user visible \"character\" (or \"grapheme cluster\"). It can take multiple code points to describe a single grapheme cluster, so even in UTF-32, care must be taken when splitting or concatenating strings.\"\nThis table may not cover every special case and so should be used for estimation and comparison only. To accurately determine the size of text in an encoding, see the actual specifications.\n\nEndianness does not affect sizes (UTF-16BE and UTF-32BE have the same size as UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE, respectively).\nThe use of UTF-32 under quoted-printable is highly impractical, but if implemented, will result in 8–12 bytes per code point (about 10 bytes in average), namely for BMP, each code point will occupy exactly 6 bytes more than the same code in quoted-printable/UTF-16. Base64/UTF-32 gets bytes for \"any\" code point.\n\nAn ASCII control character under quoted-printable or UTF-7 may be represented either directly or encoded (escaped). The need to escape a given control character depends on many circumstances, but newlines in text data are usually coded directly.\n\nBOCU-1 and SCSU are two ways to compress Unicode data. Their encoding relies on how frequently the text is used. Most runs of text use the same script; for example, Latin, Cyrillic, Greek and so on. This normal use allows many runs of text to compress down to about 1 byte per code point. These stateful encodings make it more difficult to randomly access text at any position of a string.\n\nThese two compression schemes are not as efficient as other compression schemes, like zip or bzip2. Those general-purpose compression schemes can compress longer runs of bytes to just a few bytes. The SCSU and BOCU-1 compression schemes will not compress more than the theoretical 25% of text encoded as UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. Other general-purpose compression schemes can easily compress to 10% of original text size. The general purpose schemes require more complicated algorithms and longer chunks of text for a good compression ratio.\n\nUnicode Technical Note #14 contains a more detailed comparison of compression schemes.\n\nProposals have been made for a UTF-5 and UTF-6 for the internationalization of domain names (IDN). The UTF-5 proposal used a base 32 encoding, where Punycode is (among other things, and not exactly) a base 36 encoding. The name UTF-5 for a code unit of 5 bits is explained by the equation 2 = 32. The UTF-6 proposal added a running length encoding to UTF-5, here 6 simply stands for \"UTF-5 plus 1\".\nThe IETF IDN WG later adopted the more efficient Punycode for this purpose.\n\nUTF-1 never gained serious acceptance. UTF-8 is much more frequently used.\n\nUTF-9 and UTF-18, despite being functional encodings, were April Fools' Day RFC joke specifications.\n"}

{"id": "17820055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17820055", "title": "David E. Finley Jr.", "text": "David E. Finley Jr.\n\nDavid Edward Finley Jr. (September 1, 1890 – February 1, 1977) was an American cultural leader during the middle third of the 20th century. He was the first director of the National Gallery of Art, the founding chairman of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, a prime mover in the founding of the National Portrait Gallery, and founding chairman of the White House Historical Association. During the Second World War, Finley led the Roberts Commission, which led the rescue of much of the threatened artworks of Europe.\n\nFinley was born at York, South Carolina, the son of Congressman David E. Finley (1862–1917) and Elizabeth Lewis Gist, of a family prominent in South Carolina before and during the American Civil War. He was graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1910 and took a law degree at George Washington University in 1913. He learned the workings of Washington working for his father’s congressional committee from 1910 to 1915, and then practiced law in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. before and after the First World War, in which he served in the U.S. Army Air Service and with the War Department afterwards in soldier reemployment.\n\nAs the eldest of eight siblings, Finley provided financial and moral support to an extended family in South Carolina and elsewhere after his father died in 1917 and throughout his own life. In 1931, he married Margaret Morton Eustis (1903–1977), a Washington heiress, sculptor and architect, at her family’s country home at Oatlands, near Leesburg, Virginia, where the Finleys later established their own country residence. Their Washington home was in Georgetown, at 3318 O Street, NW, where they led an active social life with political and social leaders. During World War II, and for many years afterwards, Margaret Finley was a full-time volunteer for the American Red Cross. The Finleys had no natural children, but in 1935 they took into their home Renee and Joan Beauregard, the two orphaned daughters of friends, whom they raised as their wards.\n\nIn 1921 Finley joined the legal staff of the United States Treasury Department where he came to the attention of Secretary Andrew W. Mellon. In 1924, Finley wrote \"Taxation, the People’s Business\", published in Mellon’s name, which articulated Mellon’s taxation and fiscal policies. By 1927, Finley was writing most of Mellon’s speeches, policy papers and correspondence and had begun to assist Mellon in his art collection.\n\nBy the 1920s Mellon had become a major collector of paintings, principally Dutch, British and American and traveled regularly to England and the Continent, where he became familiar with the great public and private art collections and was a particular admirer of the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery in London. In 1927, he decided to found the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and made Finley his special assistant in that enterprise. Finley was particularly influential in Mellon’s selection of art from the Italian Renaissance, which he began collecting in 1928 with a view to creating a collection worthy to be the nucleus of a great national gallery.\n\nWhen Mellon went to London as ambassador in 1932-1933, Finley went with him on Mellon’s private payroll and continued to work on the planning for the National Gallery. Upon their return in 1933, Mellon was forced to spend most of the next three years defending himself, against politically motivated charges of tax fraud brought by the Roosevelt administration, while Finley continued to work on planning the National Gallery. In late 1936 Finley selected twenty-four Italian Renaissance paintings and eighteen sculptures from Lord Joseph Duveen, which Mellon bought to complete his collection. He offered it to the nation as the nucleus of the National Gallery, together with the gallery building and a large endowment. The total gift was valued at $80 million, which would translate to perhaps $10 billion in current dollars – the richest gift ever from an individual to a government. After Mellon’s death in 1937, Finley spent the next thirty years realizing Mellon’s plans for the National Gallery of Art and his dream of a National Portrait Gallery and went on to many accomplishments of his own.\n\nIn August 1937, both Andrew Mellon and architect John Russell Pope died just as the National Gallery building was begun. It fell to David Finley to oversee the completion of the building and the opening of the Gallery in 1941. After being named director in 1938, Finley persuaded other major art collectors to add their collections to the National Gallery – notably the Samuel Kress Rush Kress, Joseph E. Widener, Chester Dale and Lessing Rosenwald collections. Mellon had the wisdom to insist that it be called the National Gallery and not bear his name, but it was Finley’s inimitable powers of persuasion that brought so many other great collections to the Gallery in so short a time. Upon his retirement as director in 1956, the National Gallery of Art could be favorably compared to the great art museums of London, Paris, Florence and elsewhere in Europe. In 1973, Finley published his memoir of the founding of the National Gallery, A\" Standard of Excellence, Andrew W. Mellon Founds the National Gallery of Art at Washington\". That standard established by Mellon and Finley has been maintained under David Finley’s successor directors, John Walker (1956–1968), J. Carter Brown (1968–1993) and Earl A. Powell III (since 1993).\n\nDuring the Second World War, Finley led a group of American art scholars and administrators who pressed the federal government to take steps to protect the priceless art works and monuments of Europe from destruction. Finley’s skills in dealing with the government had been honed by thirty years in Washington and he got chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone and President Franklin D. Roosevelt to champion their cause. Although wartime Washington had greater priorities than cultural protection in Europe, Finley persuaded the administration to appoint, in August 1943, the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas, a blue ribbon panel of distinguished civilians led by Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts as chairman. Finley was named vice-chairman and actually ran what became known as the Roberts Commission for the rest of the war from the National Gallery. He cut through the military and civilian bureaucracy to elevate the protection of monuments and artworks to a high priority, subject only to military necessity. Acting in close concert with the War Department, which placed over two hundred Monuments and Fine Art Officers in the field, and similar Allied groups, the Roberts Commission oversaw the rescue of most of the threatened artworks of war-torn Europe.\n\nIn 1947, Finley convened 45 national leaders in historic and architectural protection at the National Gallery of Art, and founded a private non-profit group that Congress chartered as the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 1949. As chairman of its trustees, Finley led the National Trust through its critical early years, when the concept of the preservation of old buildings was considered a novel and radical departure from prevailing views. His matchless contacts enabled him to enlist national leaders in the cause and to raise critically needed funds from Paul Mellon and Ailsa Mellon Bruce. By the time he retired as chairman in 1962, the foundations of the historic preservation movement in the United States had been firmly established.\n\nDavid Finley was appointed to the United States Commission of Fine Arts by President Roosevelt in 1943 and served as its chairman from 1950 to 1963. Under his leadership, the Commission took a leading advisory role in many projects in monumental Washington, such as saving of the Old Patent Office Building in 1956, preserving Lafayette Square in 1962 and heading off many ill-advised projects such as the original “tombstone” design of the FDR memorial in 1963. Finley’s dual roles as chairman of the Fine Arts Commission and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave him access to Presidents Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and Finley formed a powerful team for the promotion of good taste in monumental Washington and the White House and they became close personal friends.\n\nAndrew Mellon had acquired a major collection of American portraits that he hoped would form the nucleus of a future National Portrait Gallery, but died before he could take any concrete steps in that direction. David Finley took up the cause and in 1956 when the federal government planned to demolish the Old Patent Office Building, one of Washington’s oldest and most beautiful, for a parking garage, Finley as chairman of both the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Fine Arts Commission, appealed to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who saved it for the National Portrait Gallery. It took until 1968 before the building could house the Portrait Gallery and also the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Finley served on its Commission until his death, recommended its first director and with his wife gave it some of its first gifts of portraits and furniture.\n\nWhen Jacqueline Kennedy began to restore the White House in 1961, she enlisted David Finley in her cause. Together, they created the White House Historical Association which in 1962 published \"The White House, An Historic Guide\", an immediate best-seller and has been republished ever since and has raised millions of dollars for the White House. David and Margaret Finley presented one of the first pieces of fine antique furniture to the White House, an example soon followed by many other prominent Americans. When Finley resigned as chairman on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 1963, Mrs. Kennedy made him promise never to resign from the Association, which he led as chairman until his death in 1977.\n\nIn over 60 years in official Washington, David Finley mastered the Capital’s twin arts of the political process and social life. Quiet and soft-spoken with old fashioned Southern courtesy, he had a core of iron and was brilliantly successful in persuading others for the public good. As J. Carter Brown, one of Finley’s successors at the National Gallery of Art and the Commission of Fine Arts and himself an expert in the field, once put it, “If anyone ever knew how things get done in Washington, it was David Finley.”\n\nFinley was a gifted writer and from 1913 to 1930 kept a series of journals that expressed his views on a wide range of personal matters and public affairs. These journals provide a wealth of insights into his early life and later career. Besides writing \"Taxation, the Peoples’ Business\" for Andrew Mellon in 1924, he wrote virtually all of Mellon’s speeches, policy papers and official correspondence. Late in life, he wrote and published histories of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and of Andrew Mellon’s founding of the National Gallery and his own years as its director. He received honorary degrees from Yale, the University of South Carolina, Georgetown University and George Washington University. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association in 1957 and the Smithsonian’s Joseph Henry Medal in 1968. He just missed the Presidential Medal of Freedom when his nomination for that honor in 1973 died in the aftermath of the Watergate affair.\n\nFinley died on February 1, 1977 at his home in Georgetown. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown. In the narthex of the Washington National Cathedral is a memorial tablet to David Edward Finley and Margaret Eustis Finley, “Servants of God in Art and Charity”.\n\n"}

{"id": "31774639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31774639", "title": "Elizabeth David bibliography", "text": "Elizabeth David bibliography\n\nElizabeth David, the British cookery writer, published eight books in the 34 years between 1950 and 1984; the last was issued eight years before her death. After David's death, her literary executor, Jill Norman, supervised the publication of eight more books, drawing on David's unpublished manuscripts and research and on her published writings for books and magazines.\n\nDavid's first five books, particularly the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation and descriptions of people and places that inspired her. By the time of her third book, \"Italian Food\", David had begun to add sections about the history of the cuisine and the particular dishes that she wrote about. Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.\n\nMany of the recipes in David's early books were revised versions of her articles previously published in magazines and newspapers, and in \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\" (1984) she collected her favourites among her articles and presented them unedited with her afterthoughts appended. A second volume of reprinted articles was published after her death. David's biographer, Artemis Cooper, wrote, \"She was hailed not only as Britain's foremost writer on food and cookery, but as the woman who had transformed the eating habits of middle-class England.\"\n\nDavid's interest in cooking was sparked by a 21st birthday gift from her mother of \"The Gentle Art of Cookery\" by Hilda Leyel, her first cookery book. She later wrote, \"I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes.\"\n\nIn 1938, David and a boyfriend travelled through France to Antibes, where she met and became greatly influenced by the ageing writer Norman Douglas, about whom she later wrote extensively. He inspired her love of the Mediterranean, encouraged her interest in good food, and taught her to \"search out the best, insist on it, and reject all that was bogus and second-rate.\" She continued her exploration of Mediterranean food and the use of fresh, local ingredients in Greece in 1940. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, she fled to Egypt. There, she and her employer engaged a Greek cook who, she wrote, produced magnificent food: \"The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten.\" In 1942, she moved to Cairo, where she was asked to set up and run the Ministry of Information's reference library. The library was open to everyone and was much in demand by journalists and other writers. She employed a Sudanese \"suffragi\" (a cook-housekeeper) of whom she recalled:\nReturning to England after the Second World War and her years of access to superior cooking and a profusion of fresh ingredients, David encountered terrible food: \"There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper; bread and gristle rissoles; dehydrated onions and carrots; corned beef toad in the hole. I need not go on.\" Partly to earn some money, and partly from an \"agonized craving for the sun\", David began writing articles on Mediterranean cookery. Her first efforts were published in 1949 in the British magazine \"Harper's Bazaar\". From the outset, David refused to sell the copyright of her articles, and so she was able to collect and edit them for publication in book form. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called \"A Book of Mediterranean Food\".\n\nThe success of David's books put her in great demand by magazine editors. Among the publications for whom she regularly wrote for some period were \"Vogue\" magazine, \"The Sunday Times\" and \"The Spectator\".\n\nDavid's first book, \"A Book of Mediterranean Food\", frequently referred to by the abbreviated title of \"Mediterranean Food\", was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down by a series of publishers, one of whom told her that it needed something more than just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts from a wide range of authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.\n\nLehmann accepted the work for publication, and gave David an advance of £100. He commissioned a dust-jacket painting and black and white illustrations from the artist John Minton. Writers including Cyril Ray and John Arlott commented that Minton's drawings added to the attractions of the book. David thought good illustration important. Although she did not like Minton's black and white drawings, she described his jacket design (right) as \"stunning\". She was especially taken with \"his beautiful Mediterranean bay, his tables spread with white cloths and bright fruit\" and the way that \"pitchers and jugs and bottles of wine could be seen far down the street.\"\n\nThe book appeared when food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained fully in force in Britain. As David later put it, \"almost every essential ingredient of good cooking was either rationed or unobtainable.\" She therefore adapted some of the recipes she had learned during in the years when she lived in Mediterranean countries, \"to make up for lack of flavour which should have been supplied by meat or stock or butter.\" \"The Times Literary Supplement\" observed, \"while one might hesitate to attempt 'Lobster à la Enfant Prodigue' (with champagne, garlic, basil, lemon, chervil, mushrooms and truffles), the resourceful cook with time to explore London's more individual shops, and money, should not often be nonplussed.\" \"The Observer\" commented that the book deserved \"to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen.\"\n\nThe chapters of \"Mediterranean Food\" dealt with: soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces.\nThe book was reprinted in 1951; an American edition was published by Horizon Press in 1952; and a paperback edition was published by Penguin Books in 1955. In 1956, David revised the work, which was published by Penguin. Translations have been published in Danish and Chinese. In 2009, the Folio Society published an edition with an introduction by Julian Barnes and colour illustrations by Sophie MacCarthy together with Minton's original black and white illustrations.\n\nIn this book, David acknowledged her debt to books published in French, by Edmond Richardin, Austin De Croze, Marthe Daudet (1878-1960) known as Pampille, and J. B. Reboul. \"French Country Cooking\" drew less on David's magazine articles than its predecessor, although one of her best known and most influential chapters, \"Wine in the kitchen\", was reprinted from an article written for a wine merchant.\n\nThe main text of the book begins with \"Batterie de cuisine\", a serious and thorough examination of the equipment that David thought necessary in a good kitchen. Many of the items she mentioned were not widely available in England in the 1950s, such as moulinettes for puréeing, mandolines for slicing vegetables, hâchoires (or mezzalunas) for chopping. The second section of the book is \"Wine in the kitchen\", which opens:\n\nThe remaining chapters of the book follow the pattern of \"Mediterranean Food\": soups; fish; eggs; luncheon, supper and family dishes; meat; poultry; game; vegetables; salads; sweets; sauces; and preserves.\n\n\"The Manchester Guardian\" classified the book as more ornamental than useful, a book to make \"good reading\" rather than \"good cooks\". Its reviewer, Lucie Marion, took issue with many of David's recipes: \"I cannot think that Mrs. David has actually tried to make many of the dishes for which she gives recipes.\" \"The Observer\", by contrast, considered \"French Country Cooking\" \"of outstanding merit. The book is eminently practical … its directions are so lucid that the reader might be receiving a concrete demonstration.\"\n\nAs with \"Mediterranean Food\", a second edition was soon called for. By 1956, the book had been reprinted six times in the UK and published in the US. In 1958, David responded to the improved availability in Britain of good ingredients by revising the work, eliminating sections on specialist suppliers, to whom by 1958 it was no longer necessary to resort. In the second edition David also applied second thoughts, eliminating \"a few of the longer and more elaborate recipes\".\n\nDavid's third book differed from its predecessors in that it drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the typescript. While she was away, the firm of her publisher, John Lehman, was closed down by its principal shareholder, and she found herself under contract to the far less congenial company, Macdonald.\n\nWhile in Venice during her culinary tour of Italy, David met the artist Renato Guttuso. They struck up a friendship, and he agreed to illustrate her book, which he did, despite the very small fee offered by David's publisher. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her own prose. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" said, \"More than a collection of recipes, this is book is in effect a readable and discerning dissertation on Italian food and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen. The text is divided into kinds of food, with chapters on rice, pasta and Italian wines.\" In \"The Observer\", Freya Stark wrote, \"Mrs. David … may be counted among the benefactors of humanity.\" In \"The Sunday Times\", Evelyn Waugh named \"Italian Food\" as one of the two books that had given him the most pleasure in that year. In 2009, Sir Terence Conran called it \"the very best book about Italian food that has ever been published here\".\n\n\"Italian Food\" begins with a chapter on \"The Italian store cupboard\", giving British cooks, who at that time were generally unacquainted with most of Italy's cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, funghi, prosciutto, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s. The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, with the addition of extra subjects relevant to Italian food, pasta asciuta, ravioli and gnocchi, rice, and Italian wine. In a description of the 2009 edition, the publisher wrote:\nThe first American edition was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1958, after much argument between the head of the company, Alfred Knopf, and the author. Knopf wanted to drop the Guttuso illustrations and rewrite the text for an American audience; David refused, and Knopf eventually gave way. David revised the book for its first Penguin edition in 1963, made further minor revisions for reprints in 1969 and 1977 and revised it again, more extensively, for the 1987 edition, published in hardback by Barrie and Jenkins and, in 1989, by Penguin in paperback. In 2009, the Folio Society published an edition with new illustrations by Sophie MacCarthy and an introduction by Sir Terence Conran.\n\nThis, David's fourth book, reverted to some extent to the pattern of the first two, drawing extensively on her articles previously published in magazines. She had severed her ties with the publishers Macdonalds, who had acquired the publishing rights to her first three books when her original publisher was forced out of business. Her new publisher was the Museum Press of London. The illustrations were by Adrian Daintrey.\n\nIn her introduction, David wrote:\n\n\"Summer Cooking\" reflected David's strong belief in eating food in season; she loved \"the pleasure of rediscovering each season's vegetables\" and thought it \"rather dull to eat the same food all year round.\" Unconstrained by the geographical agendas of her first three books, David wrote about dishes from Britain, India, Mauritius, Russia, Spain and Turkey, as well as France, Italy and Greece. Reviewing the first edition, \"The Observer\" said:\n\nIn addition to those subjects like soups, fish and meat common to all her books to date, David included chapters about hors d'oeuvre and salads, preserves, buffet food, and \"Improvised cooking for holidays\". Among her recipes are asparagus with Parmesan cheese, cold roast duck on a bed of fresh mint, paupiettes of sole in lettuce leaves, broad beans with bacon, and aubergines \"à la Provençale\".\n\nDavid revised the book for a second edition, published in the UK and the U.S. by Penguin Books. Translations were published in Italian in 1975 and Danish in 1980. David further revised and enlarged the book for a third edition, published by Penguin in 1987. In 2009 the Folio Society published an edition with new illustrations by Sophie MacCarthy and an introduction by Rose Prince.\n\nThe fifth, and last, of David's volumes consisting primarily of recipes is by far the longest of them. The 1970 paperback edition published by Penguin Books runs to 584 pages. David's biographer Artemis Cooper describes it as \"a book that only needed assembling\", because it was based on previously published articles and her own collection of notes and recipes from the previous two decades. David researched her recipes thoroughly, and whenever several supposedly classic and mutually contradictory recipes existed she \"knew how to reduce a recipe to its bare essentials, and then reconstruct it\". By the 1960s, she was described in the British press as \"the most revered goddess of cooking\", and \"The Observer\" said, \"It is difficult to think of any home that can do without Elizabeth David's \"French Provincial Cooking\".\n\nThe layout of the book follows that of the earlier volumes, with the recipes grouped by subject. Each chapter has its own introductory essay, up to four pages in length, and within each chapter sub-sections also have their own preliminary essays; for instance, the chapter on meat has a two-page opening essay, with individual essays on beef, lamb, pork and veal before the recipes for each.\n\nThe Folio Society, which published a new edition of the book in 2008, wrote,\n\"\"French Provincial Cooking\" is considered to be the crowning achievement of Elizabeth David's career, incorporating exquisite recipes from great chefs alongside those gathered from local cooks and one of the finest bibliographies of good cookery books ever compiled.\" The bibliography runs to 16 pages, and ranges from 18th-century French cookery books beginning with \"Le Ménage des champs et le jardinier français\" (1711) and ending with modern works by Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child, and Jane Grigson.\n\nA typical example of David's approach in this book is her section on \"pot au feu\", which covers six pages, with sub-sections on the choice of meat, the vegetables, the saucepan, quantities, preparation, cooking, serving, using leftovers, and regional variations of the dish.\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" commented, \"\"French Provincial Cooking\" needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as \"La Bourride de Charles Bérot\" and \"Cassoulet Colombié\",\" (respectively, a Provençal dish of fillets of white fish in an aïoli and cream sauce, and a Languedoc casserole of beans with pork, mutton, sausage and goose.) Reviewing the 1977 edition, \"The Times\" called it \"arguably the most influential cookery book of our age, one which brought food writing into the realms of literature.\"\n\nThe first edition, illustrated by Juliet Renny, was published by Michael Joseph, with a simultaneous paperback issue by Penguin Books. The first American edition was published by Harper and Row in 1962. A revised edition was published by Michael Joseph in 1965 and by Penguin in 1967. Further reprints with minor revisions followed in 1969, 1970, 1977, 1981, 1984, 1986 and 1997. A new edition was published by Penguin in 1998 (London) and 1999 (New York). A Portuguese translation \"Cozinha francesa regional\" was published in 2000. The Folio Society issued a new edition in 2008, with illustrations by Sophie MacCarthy in addition to the originals by Renny.\n\nThe book is in two parts. David wrote the first four chapters, \"Spices and Condiments,\" \"Aromatic Herbs, Dried or Fresh,\" \"More Flavourings\" and \"Measurements and Temperatures\" specifically for the book, drawing on an earlier pamphlet, \"Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments\", written in 1967 for sale in her kitchen shop. In these chapters, David writes about the background of the herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" called this part of the book \"as difficult to put down as a good thriller.\" In 2018 the chef Jeremy Lee called it, \"The most incredibly sophisticated compendium of all that is good in British cooking\".\n\nIn the longer second part of the book, David gives recipes for such dishes as spiced beef, smoked fish, cured pork and sweet fruit pickles. Not all use unfamiliar spices: her \"Sussex stewed steak\", adds to the beef only port, stout, vinegar or ketchup, and black pepper. The book contains \"practical notes on how to make an authentic paella, cook vegetables crisp like the Chinese, and, with assistance from notes by long-dead Indian colonels, how to prepare a genuinely Indian curry.\"\n\nAs David remarked in this section, her approach to measuring out ingredients had changed since her early days: \"By temperament a non-measurer, I have myself, first through the wish to communicate recipes and now by force of habit, become the reverse. I find that the discipline of weighing and measuring does one's cooking nothing but good, provided that one does not waste time messing about with quarter-saltspoons and five-eighths of pints, nor, above all, expect that precision will eliminate the necessity to keep one's head or train one's eye and palate.\" The author does not conceal her dislike for some much-used herbs: sage \"deadens the food with its musty dried blood scent\" and rosemary \"acrid taste … the spiky little leaves get stuck between your teeth.\"\n\nThe book was published as the first of a planned series for Penguin Books, \"English Cooking, Ancient and Modern.\" Penguin reprinted the book with revisions in 1973, 1981 and 1987. In 2000 Grub Street publishers issued a new edition.\n\nDavid follows the pattern of \"Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen\", devoting the first part of the book to history and the second to recipes. Reviewing the new book, Jane Grigson wrote: \"Mrs. David gives the history of wheat and milling … She goes into weights and cost from the establishment in 1266 of the Assize of Bread up to present-day regulations, with a separate chapter on costing your own bread vis-à-vis bought loaves.\"\n\nIn the second part, David devotes chapters to recipes for various forms of baking. Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.\n\nIn \"The Observer\", Hilary Spurling called the book \"a scathing indictment of the British bread industry\" and also \"a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns\". Spurling rejoiced in the range of David's recipes: \"It contains directions for baking anything from the common cob and Coburg to Peggy-tub or Flowerpot bread, Sussex Plum Heavies, Scotch bun and Selkirk bannock, not forgetting splits, baps, muffins, crumpets, wiggs and chudleighs.\" \"The Times\" said, \"This is probably Mrs. David's most academic work yet. However, not one ounce of the familiar charm, good sense, asperity (reserved for modern commercial white bread), clarity or warmth is missing.\"\n\nThe book was published by Alan Lane in hardback and Penguin Books in paperback, with reprints in 1978 and 1979. The first American edition was published by Viking Press in 1980, and a rewritten American edition was published by Penguin in 1982. In 1995, Biscuit Books of Newton, Mass. published a new American edition. A new edition was published in London by Grub Street books in 2010.\n\nIn 1980 Jill Norman published a hardback volume containing the complete illustrated text of three existing David books: \"A Book of Mediterranean Food\", \"French Country Cooking\" and \"Summer Cooking\". David's revised texts of, and introductions to, the second editions of the first two books are included. Jane Grigson wrote a preface to the triple volume, summarising David's achievements. The book was reissued by Grub Street publishers in 1999, and (at 2018) has remained in print continuously.\n\nAlthough David had drawn on her many magazine articles for material in her earlier books, \"An Omelette and Glass of Wine\" was the first straightforward anthology of her work. Compiled with the assistance of Jill Norman, it consists of David's selections from her essays and articles published since 1949 in publications \"from the \"Sunday Times\" to \"Nova\", from \"Vogue\" to the \"Spectator\", from the long defunct travel magazine \"Go\" to Cyril Ray's \"Compleat Imbiber\", Peter Dominic's \"Wine Mine\" and a quite a few others.\" Jane Grigson wrote of it, \"\"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\" is different from any other book by Elizabeth David. Yet in a sense it includes them, holds them together. We feel closer to Mrs David herself in this book, and I suppose it is the closest we are likely to get to an autobiography\"\nThe article from which the volume takes its title is an essay on \"the almost primitive and elemental meal evoked by the words: 'Let's just have an omelette and a glass of wine.'\" Among the other subjects are profiles of people including Norman Douglas, Marcel Boulestin, Mrs Beeton, and \"A gourmet in Edwardian London\", Colonel Nathaniel Newnham-Davis. Several sections are devoted to descriptions of the markets at Cavaillon, Yvetot, Montpellier, Martigues and Valence, and unpretentious restaurants and hotels in France. There are articles on lemons, potted meat, mayonnaise, pizza, syllabubs, truffles, and on the cuisines of Spain and Morocco. For most of the articles David provided either an introduction or an afternote, or both.\n\n\"The Times\" described the book as \"this serenely unhurried gathering of essays, book reviews, pamphlets, travellers' tales and cookery articles. The food writer Alan Davidson spoke of David's \"intellectual vitality, her amazing memory for detail, her passionate interest in getting everything right, her feeling for style in the larger sense,\" qualities that the chef Rowley Leigh found demonstrated in \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\".\n\nThe book was published by Robert Hale. In 1985 Dorling Kindersley published an edition, and the first US edition was published by Viking, New York, in the same year. The first paperback edition was published by Penguin Books in 1986. Translations have been published in Danish, Swedish and Dutch. The book was reprinted in 1986, 1996, and 1997. In 2009 a new edition was published by Grub Street, London; in 2010 a new US edition was issued by Lyons Press, Guilford, Conn.\n\nDavid wrote eight short booklets between 9 and 38 pages in length. The first, second and seventh were commissioned by commercial companies; the other five were for sale in the Elizabeth David shop.\n\nDavid had a high regard for many other cooks, past and present, and contributed introductions and other material to several works by other writers. Those listed in the WorldCat and the British Library catalogues are:\nDavid was a contributor to two books about wine:\n\nDavid had worked with the editor Jill Norman since the 1960s, and Norman became intimately familiar with David's writings. The success of David's last book, in collaboration with Norman, and David's express wishes that Norman complete some of her work in progress, led Norman to edit and publish books of David's work after the author's death in 1992.\n\nDavid had been working on this book intermittently for several years before her last illnesses. When she realised that she would not live to complete it, she asked Jill Norman to do so. It was a demanding task; Norman found that \"the book had grown without a structure … it was a collection of essays, really.\" The book traces the history of ice in the cuisines of Europe from mediaeval times, when it had to be brought from the mountains and kept in ice houses (\"anything from a hole in the ground lined with straw to elaborate domes\"). It was noticeably more academic in tone than any of its predecessors, a book for the scholar rather than the cook. Reviewing the work, Candice Rodd wrote:\n\nIn \"The Times\", Nigella Lawson wrote that although the book deserved a place on the shelves of anyone who cared about food, it revealed a waning of the author's energies, and \"lacks her customary, high-spirited, if fierce, readability\".\n\nThe book was published in London by Michael Joseph and in New York by Viking. It was reprinted in 1995 and 1996.\n\nAn 89-page, small-format book (approximately A6), issued as one of a series of 60 such books marking the publisher, Penguin's 60th anniversary. Other books in the series were by authors from Martin Amis to Virginia Woolf. The essay from which the book takes its title is from \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\"; the other eleven chapters are extracts from all the main David books published during her liftetime.\n\nA successor to the above, in a subsequent \"Penguin 60\" series, consisting of 64 small-format pages, with text drawn from \"Italian Food\" and others of David's books. Terence Conran commented shortly after its release that the little book had immediately gone into the British top ten list of best-selling cookery books, alongside Delia Smith's \"Summer Collection\".\n\nAmong the projects of David's later years with which she worked with her editor, Jill Norman, was a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. When David's health deteriorated, the project was shelved. In 1996, Norman revived it, and invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite articles and recipes. Cooks and restaurateurs who contributed included Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson, Prue Leith and Alice Waters; among the writers were Derek Cooper, Paul Levy, Richard Olney and Katharine Whitehorn. Many of them contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients – eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread – interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays.\n\nThe title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\", and is a reference to \"South Wind\", a novel by David's greatly loved friend Norman Douglas.\n\nThe book was published by Michael Joseph. An American edition was published by North Point Press, New York, in 1998. A Chinese translation was published in 2000.\n\nThis book is a successor to \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\", consisting, like its predecessor, of magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings. When selecting the material for the earlier book, David and Jill Norman, who assisted her, found too many articles to fit into a single volume, and many were filed away for a sequel. After David's death, Norman supplemented them with articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of Oxo and Bovril, Alexis Soyer and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include \"Do not Despair over Rice\", \"Making Ice Cream\", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: \"Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless\".\n\nThe book was published in hardback by Michael Joseph, and in paperback by Penguin, in 2001. An American edition was published by Viking in 2001.\n\nDavid and her editor Jill Norman had discussed such a book as early as the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out her papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. Among the papers was an introduction that David had written for the projected volume, in which she said that one of her motives for writing a book about Christmas cooking was to head off the annual last-minute requests for recipes from her friends and relations. Those she had found most frequently asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from \"Mediterranean Food\", \"French Provincial Cooking\", and \"Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen\", and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page book. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks.\n\nThe book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in \"Vogue\" in 1959, and included in \"Is there a Nutmeg in the House\" in 2000: \"If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray in bed in the evening.\" The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.\n\nThe book was published by Michael Joseph. An American edition was published by David R. Godine, Boston, in 2008.\n\nPart of a set of seventy \"Pocket Penguins\", this small-format 64-page book contains articles and recipes reprinted from previously-published books by the author. The sections are headed: Picnics, Eating Out in Provincial France, The Markets of France, Italian Fish Markets. Summer Holidays, À la mariniere, and Improvised Cooking for Holidays and Week-ends.\n\nThe book was published to mark the 60th anniversary of David's first book. With prefatory contributions from several prominent British chefs including Jamie Oliver, Rose Gray, Simon Hopkinson and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, it assembles recipes and essays from David's previously published works. The recipes are divided into twelve sections: Starters and light dishes; Soups; Eggs; Pasta; Vegetables; Rice; Fish, shellfish and crustacea; Meat; Poultry and game birds; Sauces; Sweet dishes and cakes; Bread and yeast baking. These chapters are interspersed with reprinted essays and articles from earlier books: \"Fast and Fresh\"; \"Fresh Herbs\"; \"Confort Anglais, French Fare\"; \"Pasta Asciutta\"; \"The Markets of France: Cavaillon\"; \"My Dream Kitchen\"; \"Italian Fish Markets\"; \"Dishes for Collectors\"; \"Wine in the Kitchen\"; \"Para Navidad\"; \"Banketting Stuffe\"; \"The Baking of an English Loaf\"; and \"The Italian Pizza and the French Pissaladière\". The book contained illustrations by Jon Gray and photographs by David Loftus.It was published in London by Michael Joseph and in New York by Ecco in 2010.\n\nLike \"Of Pageants and Picnics\", though in larger format and with more pages (118), this book is a rejigging of previously-published chapters and articles, drawing from \"French Country Cooking\", \"Of Pageants and Picnics\", \"Italian Food\", \"Is There a Nutmeg in the House?\", \"French Provincial Cooking\", \" English Bread and Yeast Cookery\" and \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\".\n\nA further réchauffé, drawn principally from \"Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking\" and \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\". Sections are headed, Soups, Small dishes, Salads, Pasta, gnocchi & polenta, Rice, beans & lentils, Main dishes, Breads, and Desserts. Recipes range from aillade toulousaine (garlic and walnut sauce) and Angevin salad (lettuce and endive with Gruyère or Emmenthal cheese) to watercress and potato soup and zuppa pavese (bread and egg soup). The book was illustrated with photographs by Kristin Perers, and published by Quadrille in London and Viking Studio in New York.\n\n"}

He is believed to be the creator of the professional wrestling version of the bear hug as well as the person who popularised the hack squat, a deadlift with arms behind the body. He was known for his impressive strength, fitness and flexibility and, later in life, wrote many books on physical culture, training and philosophy.\n\nGeorg Hackenschmidt was born in Dorpat, Governorate of Livonia, on 1 August 1877, where he lived with his parents, Baltic German Georg Friedrich Heinrich Hackenschmidt and Estonian Swede Ida Louise Johansson, and a younger brother and sister. He later admitted that neither of his parents was particularly robust in stature with any unusual physical characteristics, although his maternal grandfather was said to have been a huge and powerful man.\n\nFrom his earliest years, Hackenschmidt devoted himself to physical development, particularly at the Secondary Science School (\"Realschule\" of Dorpat, as Tartu was then known), where he took advantage of the gymnasium. He excelled in cycling, gymnastics, swimming, running, jumping and weightlifting. His feats of strength were astounding for his teachers, as he lifted a small horse off the ground and lifted 276 pounds overhead with one hand. In a wrestler's bridge, he could reach out and grasp a 335-pound barbell, pull it to his chest from off the floor, and bench press it overhead, bridging on his neck. In 1902, he jumped one hundred times over a table with his feet tied together. He set several records in weight lifting and was considered both the strongest and the best-developed man in the world.\n\nGraduating from school in 1895, he entered the Lausmann factory, a large engineering firm in the city of Tallinn (then known as Reval), as a blacksmith's apprentice. He joined the city's Athletic and Cycling Club. He became an ardent cyclist and won prizes, but also developed a keen interest in wrestling and weight lifting. The turning point in his life was in 1896 when Georg Lurich, Hackenschmidt's compatriot Greco-Roman wrestler and strongman, came through the area with a small company, challenging any and all comers. Hackenschmidt took up the challenge and was beaten. German wrestler Fritz Konietzko came to Tallinn in 1897, and Hackenschmidt fared better this time.\n\nHackenschmidt left Tallinn in 1898 for the St. Petersburg Athletic and Cycling Club under the training of Dr. Vladislav von Krajewski, who convinced young Hackenschmidt that he had the potential to become the strongest man in the world. Beginning his professional wrestling career, he defeated the famous French wrestler Paul Pons in April 1898; but in January 1899 he had army duty, being commanded to join the Preobrashensky regiment, the first life guards of the Czar. Released after five months, Hackenschmidt defeated Mr. von Schmelling for the Russian championship of 1899 on 19 May that year.\n\nIn June 1900, Hackenschmidt entered a forty-day wrestling tournament in Moscow and captured the championships of both Moscow and St. Petersburg. His career as a professional wrestler was on the rise, as he won many tournaments and matches, and in 1901 he won the championship of the world tournament in Vienna as well as a championship of the world tournament at the Casino de Paris. He won tournaments everywhere he wrestled, and toured England in 1903 to confront the country's best wrestlers in the new catch-as-catch-can style which was becoming popular. Managed by the flamboyant C. B. Cochran, he would face and defeat up to five men in one evening. They created a music hall boom in professional wrestling, and Hackenschmidt became a major superstar and drawing card. He wrestled in opera halls, music halls and theaters. As the wrestling boom took hold in England and wrestlers came in from all around the world for the grand tournaments that had become the rage, he remained the dominant grappler, rather easily defeating every man he met. Cochran polished his act until Hackenschmidt was a major showstopper. He might take on five wrestlers in the same evening, defeating them all with ease.\n\nHandsome as well as beautifully built, Hackenschmidt was adored by women and admired by men, and became the darling of society. Personally a soft-spoken, cultured and intellectual young man, he could speak seven languages fluently and became a noted author, speaker and philosopher. Hackenschmidt moved well in social circles and was a credit to the sport. United States President Theodore Roosevelt, himself a proponent of physical culture and exercise, proclaimed, \"If I wasn't president of the United States, I would like to be George Hackenschmidt\".\n\nHackenschmidt continued touring England and defeated the local favorites Tom Cannon, Tom Connors, Tom MacInerney and Tom Clayton- However, when he defeated the Italian Antonio Pieri twice, Pieri sought revenge by trying to find a wrestler who could beat him. He thought he had found such a man in Ahmed Madrali, called the \"Terrible Turk\", who tangled with Hackenschmidt at the Olympia in London on 30 January 1904. Because of all the ballyhoo, traffic was jammed from the Olympia back to Piccadilly, and the Olympia was packed. Hackenschmidt picked up Madrali and threw him down onto his arm, dislocating his shoulder. The contest had lasted about two minutes. Madrali recovered, and the two would face each other again, with Hackenschmidt winning just as easily.\n\nOn 2 July at the Royal Albert Hall, Hackenschmidt faced the American heavyweight champion Tom Jenkins, a vastly underrated wrestler who would prove to be Hackenschmidt's toughest opponent to date, under Greco-Roman rules. Nevertheless, he pinned Jenkins in two straight falls. Hackenschmidt left Cochran's management to tour Australia, and then sailed to the United States for an extended tour and a rematch with Jenkins at the Madison Square Garden under catch-as-catch-can rules, which Hackenschmidt by now preferred. Jenkins put up a hard battle, but Hackenschmidt again won in two straight falls, the first in 31 minutes, 14 seconds, and the second in 22 minutes, 4 seconds, and could now claim to be the rightful free-style heavyweight champion of the world. He then wrestled in Canada, did some sightseeing and returned to England for a long list of music hall engagements.\n\nHackenschmidt defeated the Scottish champion Alexander Munro and Madrali in a return bout at the Olympia, and on 6 February 1908, defeated the American wrestler Joe Rogers in straight falls inside of 14 minutes. He then sailed to the United States to fulfill his obligation to meet a new challenger from Iowa by the name of Frank Gotch.\n\nWrestling historian Mike Chapman wrote, \"In all of athletic history, there are a mere handful of rivalries between individual stars that have become almost as large as the sport itself. In boxing, such matchups as Sullivan–Corbett, Dempsey–Tunney, Louis–Conn and Ali–Frazier are a part of boxing folklore. In wrestling, there is only one: Gotch–Hackenschmidt\".\n\nAfter defeating Jenkins in 1905, Hackenschmidt held the world title and remained undefeated until he and Frank Gotch finally squared off on 3 April 1908, at the Dexter Park Pavilion in Chicago. Showing his contempt for Gotch and for American wrestling in general, Hackenschmidt was not in the best condition. Refusing to train publicly at the Chicago Athletic Club in spite of arrangements having been made for him to do so, he was barred from the club and spent his time either in his hotel room or taking long morning and evening walks along Lake Michigan. By neglecting his training, he lost his endurance, which had never been a factor in his previous matches because he ended them so quickly. Against Gotch, who was in peak condition, it would be decisive.\n\nGotch used his speed, defense and rough tactics to wear the champion down and then assume the attack. The wrestlers stood on their feet for two full hours before Gotch was able to get behind Hackenschmidt and take him down. While on their feet, Gotch made sure to lean on Hackenschmidt to wear him down. He bullied him around the ring, and his thumbing and butting left Hackenschmidt covered in blood. At one time, Gotch also punched Hackenschmidt on the nose. Hackenschmidt complained to the referee of Gotch's foul tactics and asked that Gotch be forced to take a hot shower to rid his body of an abundance of oil, but the referee ignored the complaints and told Hackenschmidt he should have noticed the oil before the match began. The match continued until the two-hour mark, when Hackenschmidt was forced against the ropes. Gotch tore him off the ropes, threw him down and rode him hard for three minutes, working for his dreaded toe hold. Hackenschmidt had trained to avoid this hold, which he did, but the effort took his last remaining strength. Hackenschmidt quit the fall. \"I surrender the championship of the world to Mr. Gotch\", he said, and stood up and shook Gotch's hand. The wrestlers then retired to their dressing rooms before coming out for the second fall, but Hackenschmidt refused to return to the ring, telling the referee to declare Gotch the winner, thereby relinquishing his title to him. Although he at first called Gotch \"the greatest man by far I ever met\", and explained how his muscles had become stale and his feet had given out, and that he knew he could not win and therefore conceded the match, Hackenschmidt later reversed his opinion of Gotch and Americans in general, claiming to have been fouled by Gotch and victimized in America, and calling for a rematch in Europe.\n\nHackenschmidt and Gotch met again on 4 September 1911, at the newly opened Comiskey Park in Chicago, which drew a crowd of nearly 30,000 spectators and a record gate of $87,000. The rematch is one of the most controversial and talked about matches in professional wrestling history, as Hackenschmidt claimed to have injured his knee against Roller, his chief training partner. Years later, professional wrestler Ad Santel told Lou Thesz that he was paid $5,000 by Gotch's backers to cripple Hackenschmidt in training, and make it look like an accident. However, according to Hackenschmidt himself, the injury was accidentally inflicted by his sparring partner, Roller, when trying to hold Hackenschmidt down onto his knees in the down position. Roller's right foot struck Hackenschmidt's right knee, which in 1904 had developed \"Housemaid's Knee\", requiring treatment, and had acted up again in 1907. Furthermore, according to Hackenschmidt, his sparring partners for this match were Americus (Gus Schoenlein), Jacobus Koch, Wladek Zbyszko and Dr. Roller. Ad Santel is not mentioned in any account of Hackenschmidt's training by either Hackenschmidt or Roller, both of whom offered their insights and accounts.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Dr. Roller did not consider the injury to be serious, and referee Ed Smith dismissed it as inconsequential. Hackenschmidt himself ignored it completely in declaring, the day before the match, that he was \"fit to wrestle for my life\" and was \"satisfied with my condition and confident of the outcome\". However, Gotch, tearing into Hackenschmidt with a vengeance, discovered the weakness quickly and took advantage of it. Hackenschmidt was easy prey for Gotch, losing in straight falls in only 20 minutes. Gotch clinched the match with his feared toe hold, which forced Hackenschmidt to quit.\n\nFollowing his second defeat at the hands of Gotch, upon returning to England, Hackenschmidt was preparing for a match with Stanislaus Zbyszko to take place the following June, but when he began working out he felt such pain in his right knee that it was painful even to walk. It necessitated surgery, but Hackenschmidt decided at that point to retire and pursue his other interests in philosophy, physical culture and gardening.\n\nHackenschmidt was a pioneer in the field of weightlifting. He invented the exercise known as the hack squat, whose name is a reference to his own. Hackenschmidt also helped to popularize many other types of lifts common within the modern training regimen, such as the bench press. During his career, he established numerous weightlifting records, which were improved upon by others in ensuing decades.\n\nHackenschmidt was an educated and cultured man who spoke seven languages. He went on to write several books, including \"Complete Science of Wrestling\" (1909), \"Fitness and Your Self\" (1937), \"Consciousness and Character: True Definitions of Entity, Individuality, Personality, Nonentity\" (1937), \"The Way to Live in Health and Physical Fitness\" (1941), and \"The Three Memories and Forgetfulness: What They Are and What Their True Significance Is in Human Life\". He also taught physical education to members of the House of Lords and served as a judge at the 1948 Mr. Universe show in London won by John Grimek.\n\nHackenschmidt was already hospitalized at St. Francis Hospital in Dulwich, a suburb of London, when he died on 19 February 1968. He was 90 years old. He was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery, where his memorial plaque records him as George Hackenschmidt.\n\nHackenschmidt became a naturalized French citizen in 1939, and then became a British subject in 1946. He lived with his French wife Rachel in South Norwood, London.\n\nHe was a great friend with famous magician Harry Houdini and playwright George Bernard Shaw. As he aged, Hackenschmidt also expressed a high regard for his old opponent, Tom Jenkins, by then the wrestling coach at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Hack visited Jenkins in 1939 and the two got along splendidly, with Jenkins accommodating Hackenschmidt in his home and giving him a tour of the West Point training facilities. In their mutual admiration society, they never publicly expressed any credit to Frank Gotch, and Hackenschmidt spent the rest of his life complaining about Gotch's foul tactics and his knee injury in explaining his \"inexplicable\" losses.\n\nThroughout his life, Hackenschmidt paid strict attention to his diet. He ate a predominantly vegetarian diet, consisting of fruit, nuts and raw vegetables. He very rarely consumed meat and eggs, and objected to cooked foods, as he said \"the purest natural food for human beings would, therefore, be fresh, uncooked food and nuts\". He also drank 11 pints of milk a day, and avoided alcohol, tobacco and coffee. He also remained physically fit well into old age, and at 56 he could jump over a 4-foot, 6-inch high board ten times. Even through his mid-80s, he would jump fifty times over a chair once a week, bench press 150 pounds and run seven miles in 45 minutes.\n\nIn his entire professional wrestling career, Hackenschmidt engaged in about 3,000 matches, losing only two. Powerfully built, Hackenschmidt's measurements for his 1905 match with Alexander Munro were: age – 28; weight – 204 pounds; height – 5′, 9½″; reach – 75″; biceps – 19″; forearm – 15½″; neck – 22″; chest – 52″; waist – 34″; thigh – 26¾″; calf – 18″. He also rose to prominence when the governing style of wrestling was the slower, more ponderous Greco-Roman style that emphasized muscle power more than speed, agility and ring generalship, and involved holds only above the waist. Being bulkier of build than his sleeker opponents, and slower of movement, Hackenschmidt's style and temperament were not geared as much to the newly popular catch-as-catch-can style. Hackenschmidt was a natural showman, he was honest, straightforward and serious, and he would finish off his opponents quickly. His manager C. B. Cochran had to convince him to extend his matches and put on a show, which in turn ensured more bookings and sold-out shows. This did not mean the matches were fake, as excluding exhibitions, his matches were all on the level, but he might allow a local wrestler to last ten minutes and collect his £25 prize, and set up a highly publicized match for later in the week, where he would defeat his foe handily. Unlike many other professional wrestlers, including Frank Gotch, Hackenschmidt was never mean, vindictive or unnecessarily rough in the ring, \"contrasting his physical prowess and fighting skills with a quietness of spirit\", David Gentle explained. \"George Hackenschmidt was the epitome of calm, self-assurance and inner peace, with full awareness of his own capabilities and thus like all masters of combat found no need for machoism or outward aggression. His tactic to win was skill and speed, born of confidence in his own ability and fighting prowess\". However, he had three weaknesses. Against a first-class opponent, of whom he faced extremely few, he could be slow to adapt. Gotch reported after their first match that \"every move the Russian made he telegraphed me in advance, which shows that he thinks too slowly\".\n\nHackenschmidt was also given to depression and irascibility. When he came to Chicago to train for his first match with Gotch, promoter Jack Curley had arranged for Hackenschmidt to work out every day before a paying public, which Hackenschmidt refused to do. Barred from the athletic club, he spent his time before the match either exercising in his room or taking morning and evening walks along Lake Michigan, but no serious workouts. The more depressed he got, the more difficult he was to work with, and this all worked against him because, for the first time in his professional career, Hackenschmidt faced a foe fully capable of defeating him. Finally, and worst of all, in both matches with Gotch, Hackenschmidt was accused of lack of heart. Referee Ed Smith, following the 1908 match, said that \"deep down in my own mind, I decided that George Hackenschmidt had quit – quit quite cold, as a matter of fact – because there was nothing about Gotch's treatment of him in that first encounter that could by a stretch of the imagination call for a disqualification. There was some face-mauling, just as there always is ... but at no time did the vaunted Hackenschmidt ever make a serious move toward slapping down his opponent, never showed much in the wrestling line during the entire two hours... Again, I say, that as the referee of that match, I thought that the 'Russian Lion' quit\". Following the 1911 rematch, one newspaper described Gotch's easy victory and then added that \"in the parlance of the sporting world, Hackenschmidt is yellow ... He quit when his position became dangerous\". Perhaps the most frustrated was Hackenschmidt's second, Dr. Benjamin Roller, who himself had lost several times to Gotch, but had displayed the utmost gameness and courage. \"Hack did not get started\", Roller explained. \"That's largely a matter of gameness\". Hackenschmidt's injuries had not been serious enough, Roller felt. \"I have tried my best to make a winner out of him and put him into the ring in the best possible condition, but ... gameness is something you can not put into a man\".\n\nThe years spanning Hackenschmidt's professional career are called the Golden Age of professional wrestling. Not only were professional wrestling matches mostly honestly contested, but wrestling was the most popular sport on every continent. However, it was Hackenschmidt who brought professional wrestling its great popularity in the United Kingdom, and it was he and Gotch together who brought it to entirely new heights around the world. \"The Hackenschmidt-Gotch matches were the pinnacle of professional wrestling during the time period and received much attention from media, fans, and celebrities\", Andrew Malnoske observed. \"They were even described in the 1937 book \"Fall Guys – The Barnums of Bounce\" by famed writer Marcus Griffen. To this day, the Chicago Public Library receives requests to view the newspaper accounts and files on the bouts.\" As Mark Palmer pointed out, \"For starters, George Hackenschmidt and Frank Gotch were major sports superstars of the early 20th century. Fans of all ages collected cabinet cards and postcards with their images, read their books, and devoured articles about them in newspapers. Their epic matches were front-page news around the world – akin to today's World Cup in terms of garnering global attention – and helped to launch organized amateur wrestling in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. In fact, a large number of high school and college wrestling programs can trace their roots back to the 1910s and 1920s – the era when Hackenschmidt and Gotch were still household names, and highly respected athletes\".\n\nHaving already made his mark in bodybuilding, Hackenschmidt caused the major surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in England, and he was considered unbeatable. However, Hackenschmidt probably would not be so well remembered today were it not for two things: 1) his enormous standing in the world of physical culture, and 2) his two defeats at the hands of Frank Gotch. Hackenschmidt remained in the public eye because he had become an icon in the world of physical culture, a legendary bodybuilder as well as health addict, and a world champion wrestler central to a movement that was now increasingly popular. He spoke and published widely on a wide range of subjects, but most notably on health and fitness. His most popular book was the classic \"The Way To Live\", the last words of which read, \"Throughout my whole career I have never bothered as to whether I was a champion or not a champion; The only title I have desired to be known by is simply my name – George Hackenschmidt\". However, it was his matches with Gotch that ensured the growing popularity of catch-as-catch-can wrestling over the more laborious Greco-Roman that had previously dominated, and this is the style that enjoys popularity at all scholastic levels, private clubs and the Olympics to this day. Hackenschmidt was a major reason for this.\n\nThe H. J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports at the Todd-McLean Library and Special Collections in Austin, Texas, has a digitized version of a nearly 600-page scrapbook owned for decades by Hackenschmidt and bequeathed by his widow Rachel. The international Georg Hackenschmidt Memorial in Greco-Roman wrestling has been held in Tartu since 1969.\n\n\n\n"}

The defendant called at the office of the claimant in order to negotiate the purchase of some houses. The defendant handed the claimant a note giving him the option to purchase some houses within 14 days. On the next day, the defendant withdrew the offer by post, but his withdrawal did not reach the claimant until 5 P.M. Meanwhile, the claimant responded by post with an unconditional acceptance of the offer, which was delivered to the defendant after its office had closed. The letter was opened by the defendant the next morning.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ordered that the claimant was entitled to specific performance. Lord Herschell argued: \"Where the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, according to ordinary usage of mankind, the post might be used as a means of communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted.\"\n\nThe case is based on a line of decision starting with \"Adams v Lindsell\" (1818), according to which the acceptance was valid at the time of posting. The importance of this decision's ratio is that a postal acceptance will only be valid at the time of posting if it is reasonable for the offeror to expect an acceptance by post. The fact that both parties were living in different towns justifies the inference that both parties had contemplated that a letter sent by post was a mode by which acceptance might be communicated (per Kay L.J. at page 36)\n\n"}

An earlier method had used the lampblack derived from the sooty flame of a candle or lamp. The impression could then be painted over in colour with the certainty that form and size had been accurately fixed. The technique was adapted to circumstance, leading to mounting of dried plant material such as flowers, leaves or fruits, and supplemented by painting or sketching parts too bulky for pressing, so that a reasonable semblance of the complete plant could be formed. \n\nHieronymus Harder produced a \"Herbarium vivum\" in 12 volumes, the earliest dating to 1562. One of the volumes from 1576 is kept at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek and is online here. Henrik Bernard Oldenland, a Cape Colony botanist assembled a \"Herbarium vivum\" of some 13 volumes which found their way into the possession of Johannes Burman, professor of botany in Amsterdam. Kniphof's 1759 \"Herbarium vivum\" comprised some 1200 botanical illustrations. In 1834 the astronomer John Herschel, facing a similar problem of accurate delineating, used a camera lucida to pencil in the outlines of Cape Colony plants while his wife Margaret then painted in the details.\n"}
{"id": "21807758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21807758", "title": "Historical Archive of the City of Cologne", "text": "Historical Archive of the City of Cologne\n\nThe Historical Archive of the City of Cologne (, or for short) is the municipal archive of Cologne, Germany. It ranks among the largest communal archives in Europe.\n\nA municipal archive has existed in Cologne since the Middle Ages. The oldest inventory of charters in the archive is dated 1408/1409. The oldest document kept in the archive is a charter dated AD 922.\n\nThe archive contains official records and private documents from all ages of Cologne history, as well as an extensive library of manuscripts. While the adjective \"historical\" in its name might suggest a closed, complete archive with a focus on older history, the archive is also the official government repository responsible for collecting recent municipal records.\n\nThe six-story archive building collapsed on 3 March 2009, along with two neighboring apartment buildings. Two residents of neighboring buildings were found dead. All archive staff and visiting archive users survived, as they were able to escape following a warning by construction workers. Around 90% of archival records were buried by the collapse, although it subsequently proved possible to rescue and repair many of them.\n\nThe work of communal archives in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is based on the \"Archivgesetz des Landes NRW\" bill of 1989. The municipal archive of Cologne is also governed by the municipal archive ordinance \"Archivsatzung\" (last revised in 2007). The federal \"Bundesarchivgesetz\" bill does not apply.\n\nAn early programme of holding archival records in Cologne was the so-called \"Schreinswesen\" (shrine system), used for documenting citizens' rights. A \"Schrein\" (shrine, from Latin \"scrinium\") was a wooden chest or cabinet where parish administrations stored records and charters. Such shrines were used for records storage throughout the Middle Ages and into early modern times, most notably in the parish of St. Lawrence near the Cologne town hall. The records were for the most part those of real estate transactions: these were recorded on sheets of parchment or in books, which subsequently became known as \"Schreinsbücher\" (shrine books). In Cologne, these books can be traced back to AD 1130. Similar books from the late 12th century are known from the cities of Metz and Andernach. In the 19th century, all records of the old Cologne shrine quarters were transferred to the municipal archives.\n\nA municipal archive has existed since at least the year 1322. In 1326 the city council decided to establish the so-called White Book (\"Weißes Buch\"), a book of copies of charters and privileges. By 1370 the archives were located in the \"Haus zur Stessen\".\n\nIn medieval Cologne, valuable goods and important trade documents were frequently stored in vaulted warehouses specially built in backyards. This method of storage was used by both business owners and the municipal administration. Documents included grants of privileges, contracts, records of lawsuits, maps, seals and documents from the estates of important persons. As the city and its national and international trade thrived and prospered, the municipal administration began to plan further storage to house the growing number of documents in an adequate space.\n\nOn 19 August 1406, the city council resolved to add a tower to the town hall. The tower was built between 1407 and 1414, and served, among other purposes, as a storage room for municipal charters, privileges and securities. Cologne's bursary officer, Roland von Odendorp, was responsible for its construction. The Gothic building with its two tetragonal upper stories and two more octagonal top stories has some similarities to Dutch belfries of the time and rises to 61 m. It contained a wine cellar, an armory, a meeting room for the municipal council, a firefighter guardroom on the very top, and a vaulted room for the municipal archives. Documents were stored in chests or cabinets marked A to X. The \"Kölner Verbundbrief\" charter, a municipal constitution document of 1396, was granted pride of place in a chest decorated with a crown. From 1414, the archive was directed by a \"Gewulvemeister\" (vault master). At a later date, its management was taken over by a committee of municipal jurists, the \"syndici\".\n\nIn 1594, the records of the Brugge offices of the Hanseatic League (then stored in Antwerp) were transferred to the Cologne archives. These records included copies of the protocols of the diets of the Hanseatic League. With the 1594 transfer, the Cologne archive became the most important repository of historical material concerning the Hanseatic League and thus concerning the history of Northern Germany in general, only matched by the municipal archives of Lübeck.\n\nOn 27 February 1602, the city council ordered that books on jurisdiction and administration were to be systematically bought at the regularly held Frankfurt Book Fair. These were subsequently stored in the municipal archive and became the basis of the Cologne municipal library. The \"Ratsbibliothek\" was one of the few Cologne libraries that did not suffer major losses during the French occupation in the early years of the 19th century.\n\nAfter the secularization of abbeys and colleges of canons in Cologne in the early years of the 19th century, the French government ordered their archives to be stored in the state archives in Düsseldorf. It was not until 1949 that a mayor of Cologne succeeded in recovering 19,000 charters and many other records for the Cologne municipal archives.\n\nIn 1818, the city of Cologne was bequeathed Ferdinand Franz Wallraf's major collection of art, books and manuscripts. After Wallraf's death in 1824, his collection of statues and paintings became the basis of the Wallrafianum, now known as the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, one of Cologne's major art museums. The archive and library, at that time still run as a single entity, were chosen to hold all books and manuscripts. When the institutions were administratively separated in the 1880s, all manuscripts were retained by the archive, while all printed books were given to the library. This is why, unlike many other archives, the Cologne archive boasts a major collection of medieval manuscripts. Both archive and library shared a building until 1934, when the library moved to the newly built building of the University of Cologne.\n\nFrom 1815 until he died in 1857, Johann Jakob Peter Fuchs managed the municipal archive as its honorary director. Fuchs was a friend of Wallraf's who also supervised the incorporation and cataloging of the Wallraf collection in 1824. He reorganized the entire archive and made its contents accessible to scholarly research.\n\nIn 1857, Leonhard Ennen became the first full-time municipal archivist. Among other material, he acquired documents from the estate of Hermann von Weinsberg, a 16th-century Cologne jurist famous for his autobiographical writings.\n\nA new purpose-built structure to house the municipal archive and library was erected between 1894 and 1897 to a Gothic revival design by Friedrich Carl Heimann: it was inaugurated in December 1897. The new building was large enough to accommodate the archive at a time of accelerated growth when the city of Cologne was absorbing many previously independent towns and villages.\n\nDuring World War II the building suffered damage from bombing. However, since all records and manuscripts had been moved into secure storage from as early as September 1939, the archive did not suffer any substantial loss.\n\nSince the archive moved to its new location in 1971, the 1897 building has been used as a private library by Gerling, a large insurance company.\n\nIn 1971, a six-story archive building by architect Fritz Haferkamp was built on Severinstraße in the southern part of Cologne's city center.\n\nAn underlying principle of the design was to protect archival records from fluctuations in weather and climate while creating a balanced room climate. In a move away from the contemporary popularity of electromechanical air conditioning, Haferkamp preferred a structural-physical, self-regulating solution that needed only little additional climate technology. As the \"Cologne Model\", the building became a model for many later archive buildings internationally.\n\nFor maximum protection of the stack rooms against atmospheric exposure, an armored concrete frame was encased by a brick wall with a thickness of . A facade was attached at a distance of from the brick wall, made from bright Czech granite. The interior walls were plastered with lime mortar that absorbed air moisture from the inside. The moisture diffused through the brick wall and was drained through the space between the wall and the facade. Only the basement rooms (located under a ceiling with a thickness of ) were artificially air-conditioned. Vertical light slots with a height of and a width of allowed only diffused light to pass to the interior wall, to prevent sunlight from causing any change in temperature. Only the ground floor was equipped with larger windows. The slots were also used for ventilation: opposing slots caused a stream of air that went exactly parallel to the shelf rows. Each story of the stacks building had a linear capacity of of records on of effective surface. Rooms were high, shelves rose to . Each shelf had a carrying capacity of .\n\nThe dominating stacks building was high, wide and deep, while the ground floor and basement of the complex were considerably larger. Towards Severinstraße, the ground floor consisted of the main entrance hall and an exhibition room. Adjacent were the reading room, around 20 office rooms, the restoration workshop and various functional rooms. Four courtyards provided natural light to the rear ground floor rooms. The basement included the charters archive, the archival library and, in its center, a treasure bunker for charters and records walled by armored concrete of thickness. The building was secured by fire detectors, a carbon-dioxide-based fire-extinguishing system, and a burglar alarm device.\n\nAfter the archive had moved from the 1897 building to its new home (April 26 to June 20, 1971), a little under 44% of the total capacity was in use. The building was planned to have sufficient capacity for 30 years growth. The maximum capacity was reached in 1996, which led to the outsourcing of some records.\n\nOn 3 March 2009 at 1:58 p.m. the archive building collapsed. Public prosecutors in 2017 confirmed that the construction of a new underground railway line of the Cologne Stadtbahn system had been the cause. Construction workers building an underground switch facility noticed that water was flooding into the building pit. They rapidly warned staff and visitors of the archive, who were instructed to evacuate the building. Shortly afterwards, an underground landslide into the subway tunnel caused the archive building to collapse. Two adjacent apartment buildings also collapsed, killing two residents.\n\nThe main holdings of the archive were stored in the stacks building, including the medieval manuscripts of the Wallraf collection. Around 90% of archival records were buried by the collapse. Other holdings, mainly those stored in the ground floor extension with the reading room, such as the film and photograph collection and about 40,000 charters were evacuated. Storage of other—albeit less significant—parts of the records had been outsourced, and they were therefore not affected by the collapse. According to the former director Hugo Stehkämper, the collection of 80 \"shrine charters\" from the 12th century, a seals collection and most inventory books were saved and remain intact.\n\nThe years after the collapse were characterized by three main tasks: the recovery and emergency conservation of the scattered archival documents, their step-by-step cleaning, restoration and digitization, and the investigation of the cause for the disaster through a legal process. Additionally, the planning for a new archives building was begun.\n\nA \"disaster recovery building\" was set up at the site of the collapse (a large hole in the ground), where around 95% of all archival items could be held until August 2011, albeit scattered and in many cases badly damaged. Archive repositories all over Germany offered space to store the damaged and only roughly cleaned documents: wet materials were flash-frozen to prevent mold growth. \"Itinerant archivists\" worked in the receiving archives all over the country and began the task of re-identifying and re-cataloging. A newly installed centre for restoration and digitization on the outskirts of Cologne started working in 2011, with a total cost for restoring the archive estimated at 400 million euros. A freeze-drying unit was installed to handle the deep-frozen materials safely before restoration.\n\nAfter recovery at the collapsed site was completed, the legal process required the construction of an \"investigation building\" as part of the public prosecutor's process of determining responsibility for the collapse. Construction began in 2012.\n\nAlso in 2009, following an architectural competition, a decision was taken on a new archive building. It was planned to accommodate not only the archive institution itself but also the \"Kunst- und Museumsbibliothek\", a renowned art and museum library, and the \"Rheinisches Bildarchiv\", a collection of photographs on the history of art, architecture, culture and photography in Cologne and the Rhineland. The plan was to build the “safest and state-of-the-art city archive in Europe“ by 2017. After the decision of the city council, a detailed concept was worked out and approved.\n\nIn 2013, in the context of the city's financial crisis, local political debate began to move towards re-considering this decision, and even to imposing a planning moratorium. Protests by local support groups as well as national archive organizations followed.\n\nIn 2017, the total damage from the collapse was estimated at 1.2 billion euros.\n\nBefore the 2009 collapse, the archival holdings included:\n\nAmong the 700 private deposits are those of writer and Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll, and writers Jakob Ignaz Hittorff, Irmgard Keun, Vilma Sturm, Paul Schallück and Hans Mayer, architects Ernst Friedrich Zwirner and Sulpiz Boisserée, collector Ferdinand Franz Wallraf, composers Jacques Offenbach and Max Bruch, conductor Günter Wand, and philosopher Vilém Flusser. Plans and drawings of architects Hans Schilling, Oswald Mathias Ungers, Wilhelm Riphahn, Karl Band, Gottfried Böhm, and Dominikus Böhm were stored in the building.\n\nAll charters and privileges formerly stored in the town hall tower were catalogued in the first inventory (inv. no. \"Alte Repertorien 6\"). This collection, also known as \"Haupturkundenarchiv\" (main charters archive), is regarded as the core part of the archive and was hence given the inventory number I.\n\nUntil 2009, all registers of births, marriages and deaths were stored at the municipal civil registry offices regardless of their age. Following a reform bill of 13 March 2008, birth registers to 1898, marriage registers to 1928 and death registers to 1978 were transferred to the archives in 2009.\n\nMany of the most important and unique holdings of the Cologne archives have been preserved on microfilm in the central safekeeping archive of Germany, the \"Barbarastollen\" caves in Oberried in the Black Forest region. The Barbarastollen holds around 638 microfilms with one million images in varying grades of quality from the various Cologne collections, including the municipal archive. In addition, the 1400 medieval manuscript books of the Archives were microfilmed by the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library in the 1980s. However, recent acquisitions (including the Heinrich Böll collection) have not yet been microfilmed. According to director Schmidt-Czaia, the archive has digitized only a tiny fraction of its holdings.\n\nThe Marburg photo archive of old charters holds high-quality black and white photographs of 284 charters from the Cologne archive.\n\nDirectors of the Cologne municipal archive:\n\n\n"}

Cognate with Danish and Swedish \"huld\" (\"fair, kindly, gracious\"), Icelandic \"hollur\" (\"faithful, dedicated, loyal\"), Middle English \"hold\", \"holde\", Old English \"hold\" (\"gracious, friendly, kind, favorable, true, faithful, loyal, devout, acceptable, pleasant\"), from Proto-Germanic \"hulþaz\" (\"favourable, gracious, loyal\"), from Proto-Indo-European \"*kel-\" (\"to tend, incline, bend, tip\").\n\nThe name \"Hludana\" is found in five Latin inscriptions: three from the lower Rhine (\"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\" XIII 8611, 8723, 8661), one from Münstereifel () and one from Beetgum, Frisia () all dating from 197 AD-235 AD. Many attempts have been made to interpret this name.\n\nFrau Holda's festival is in the middle of winter, the time when humans retreat indoors from the cold. It may be of significance that the Twelve Days of Christmas were originally the \"Zwölften\" (\"the Twelve\"), which like the same period in the Celtic calendar were an intercalary period during which the dead were thought to roam abroad.\n\nHolda's connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and weaving has associated her with witchcraft in Catholic German folklore. She was considered to ride with witches on distaffs, which closely resemble the brooms that witches are thought to ride. Likewise, Holda was often identified with Diana in old church documents. As early as the beginning of the eleventh century she appears to have been known as the leader of women and female nocturnal spirits, which \"in common parlance are called Hulden from Holda\". These women would leave their houses in spirit, going \"out through closed doors in the silence of the night, leaving their sleeping husbands behind\". They would travel vast distances through the sky, to great feasts, or to battles amongst the clouds.\n\nThe ninth century Canon Episcopi censures women who claim to have ridden with a \"crowd of demons.\" Burchard's later recension of the same text expands on this in a section titled De arte magica:\n\nHave you believed there is some female, whom the stupid vulgar call Holda [or, in some manuscripts, strigam Holdam, the witch Holda], who is able to do a certain thing, such that those deceived by the devil affirm themselves by necessity and by command to be required to do, that is, with a crowd of demons transformed into the likeness of women, on fixed nights to be required to ride upon certain beasts, and to themselves be numbered in their company? If you have performed participation in this unbelief, you are required to do penance for one year on designated fast-days.\n\nLater canonical and church documents make her synonymous with Diana, Herodias, Bertha, Richella and Abundia. Historian Carlo Ginzburg has identified similar beliefs existing throughout Europe for over a thousand years, whereby men and women were thought to leave their bodies in spirit and follow a goddess variously called Holda, Diana, Herodias, Signora Oriente, Richella, Arada and Perchta. He also identifies strong morphological similarities with the earlier goddesses Hecate/Artemis, Artio, the Matres of Engyon, the Matronae and Epona, as well as figures from fairy-tales, such as Cinderella.\n\nA 16th-century fable recorded by Erasmus Alberus speaks of \"an army of women\" with sickles in hand sent by Frau Hulda. Thomas Reinesius in the 17th century speaks of Werra of the Voigtland and her \"crowd of maenads.\"\n\nHolda figures in some pre-Christian Alpine traditions that have survived to modern times. During the Christmas period in the alpine regions of Germany, Austria and northern Switzerland, wild masked processions are still held in a number of towns, impersonating Holda, Perchta or related beings, and the wild hunt. Vivid visual descriptions of her may allude to a popular costumed portrayal, perhaps as part of a seasonal festival or holiday drama. In 1522, in \"The Exposition of the Epistles at Basel\", Martin Luther writes:\n\n\"Here cometh up Dame Hulde with the snout, to wit, nature, and goeth about to gainstay her God and give him the lie, hangeth her old ragfair about her, the straw-harness; then falls to work and scrapes it featly on her fiddle.\"\n\nGrimm based his theory of Holda on what he took to be the earliest references to her: an eleventh-century interpolation to the \"Canon Episcopi\" by Burchard of Worms, and pre-Christian Roman inscriptions to \"Hludana\" that he tentatively linked to the same divinity. There were early challenges to connecting this figure with a pagan goddess, since her earliest definite appearance links her with the Virgin Mary, commonly called \"Queen of Heaven\": an early-13th-century text listing superstitions states that \"In the night of Christ's Nativity they set the table for the Queen of Heaven, whom the people call Frau Holda, that she might help them\". Lotte Motz and Carlo Ginzburg both conclude that she is pre-Christian in origin, based on comparison with other remarkably similar figures and ritual observances spread throughout Europe.\n\nA pagan Holda received wide distribution in catalogs of superstitions and in sermons during the fifteenth century, and in the sixteenth, Martin Luther employed the image to personify the shortcomings of hostile Reason in theological contexts.\n\nThe most famous account of Holda was collected by the Brothers Grimm, the fairy tale \"Mother Hulda\" ().\n\n"}

After about four years he joined the British National Party (BNP), where he later succeeded the BNP founder John Tyndall. Other leading figures in the group on its foundation were Roberto Fiore and Derek Holland. Jason Wilcock would subsequently emerge as the group's leader, although in 2001 he was reported in the \"Daily Mirror\" as having played a leading role in instigating the riots in Oldham.\n\nTroy Southgate, as well as the majority of ITP supporters, split from the organisation in September 1992 after accusing Fiore and Holland of ideological hypocrisy and swindling members out of their life savings to prop up the group's failed rural experiment in northern France. This included the departure of several local ITP publications, including \"The Kent Crusader\", \"Surrey Action\", and \"Eastern Legion\". Southgate then founded the English Nationalist Movement (ENM) and during this time edited magazines like \"The Crusader\" and \"The English Alternative\". The ENM had strong units in the Burnley, Bradford and south-east Kent areas.\n\nThe ITP changed its name to England First in 2001 and has since become a part of the European National Front with the Spanish Falange, Italian Forza Nuova, Romanian Noua Dreaptă, Polish National Revival of Poland and others.\n\nAn ITP/ENF gathering in central London in April 2005 drew 150 supporters. Overall membership is estimated by \"Searchlight\" magazine to be somewhat lower than this, although the ITP maintains a relatively strong publishing presence as well as its network of international contacts. The modern party is much less critical of Islam than the rest of the British far-right, and claims that the campaign against Islam is mostly driven by Jewish interests. The party remains strongly anti-Semitic.\n\nITP ideology is a mix of leftist and rightist ideas—\"e.g.\", environmentalism, wealth redistribution—with a racist agenda identifying the Jews and the immigrants as the prime enemies. Initially the ITP distanced itself from traditional Fascism and Nazism, promoting 'racial separatism' rather than crude racism. The International Third Position operated more as an elite cadre than a mass movement. Promoting a \"back to the land\" ideal of rural traditionalism, the group even purchased Los Pedriches, a remote Spanish village in 1997. This initiative was funded through a charity called Saint Michael the Archangel. Purporting to be an apolitical Roman Catholic charity the group, which had several charity shops in the UK, was exposed as an ITP front in the press in 1999.\n\nPublications supporting the ITP in the UK are \"Final Conflict\", \"The Voice of St George\", \"Heritage and Destiny\" and \"Candour\" (which was previously published by A. K. Chesterton and is the longest running far right publication in Britain).\n\n\n"}

It is 1.75 metres tall (about 5 ft, 9in) by 1.9 metres wide when open (about 6 ft, 3in), and so heavy the British Library reportedly had six people to carry it.\n\n\"Klencke Atlas\" is a singular work, no other copies were created. It is a world atlas made up of 41 copperplate wall maps that remain in exceptionally good condition. The maps were intended to be removed and displayed on the wall. The maps are of the continents and assorted European states and it was said to encompass all the geographical knowledge of the time. Dutch Prince John Maurice of Nassau is credited with its creation, and it contains engravings by artists Blaeu and Hondius and others. It was presented by a consortium of Dutch sugar merchants, represented by Professor Johannes Klencke, to King Charles II of England in 1660 to mark the occasion of his restoration to the throne. The consortium hoped to gain favourable trade agreements with Britain for their sugar plantations in Brazil. Johannes Klencke was the son of a Dutch merchant family. Charles, a map enthusiast, kept it in the 'Cabinet and Closset of rarities' in Whitehall.\n\nIn 1828, King George IV gave it to the British Museum as part of a larger gift of maps and atlases collected by his father George III. In the 1950s it was re-bound and restored. Today it is held by the Antiquarian Mapping division of the British Library in London. Since 1998 it was displayed at the entrance lobby of the maps reading room. In April 2010 it was publicly displayed for the first time in 350 years with pages open, at an exhibition at the British Library.\n\nUp until 2012 the \"Klencke Atlas\" was widely regarded as the world's largest atlas, a record it probably held since the atlas was created 350 years earlier. In February 2012, Australian publisher Gordon Cheers published a new atlas called \"Earth Platinum\" that is bigger by about a foot making it probably the largest atlas in the world; 31 copies were made priced at each.\n\nIn 2017, the British Museum digitized the atlas and made it available online. A video of the digitization process was also made available.\n\n"}
{"id": "19537067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19537067", "title": "Learning Through Art", "text": "Learning Through Art\n\nLearning Through Art is an educational program of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. LTA pairs practicing artists with participating public elementary school classrooms throughout the five buroughs of New York City. These resident artists spend one day a week for a period of 10 or 20 weeks working with classroom instructors to create and execute an art curriculum for the students that ties in with current Guggenheim exhibitions and supports the core curriculum learning inside of the classroom. Participating classrooms visit the Guggenheim multiple times throughout the duration of their program, and student artwork is shown in a culminating exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in their annual \"A Year With Children\" showcase.\n\nIn 1970, in response to the cutting of art and music programs in New York City public schools, Natalie K. Lieberman started a program called Learning to Read Through the Arts. Later becoming a Guggenheim trustee, in 1994 the program was merged with the Guggenheim Foundation. In its first 35 years, LTA has worked with hundreds of resident artists to serve approximately 138,500 New York City schoolchildren in dozens of public schools.\n\nAt the core of the LTA philosophy is the belief that artwork can, and, in today's image-saturated culture, should, be taught to be read much like a traditional text. Teaching students to talk about art the way they would talk about text gives them a forum to practice critical-thinking skills and become active participants in a work, be that work visual or text based. Unlike text, however, works of art provide a highly accessible way for students to practice these necessary reading skills without having to worry about stumbling over a difficult word, flip through pages to find a quote, or struggle with decoding written text.\n\nAdditionally, it may be easier to find visual artworks open to a wide array of interpretation - thus lending themselves to be contoured more easily towards a specific teaching point (es: mood) while at the same time inviting more varied discussion from students. This is because we as a culture have grown familiar with abstract art, abstract expressionism and surrealism for example, whereas we remain extremely uncomfortable with literature that approaches abstraction.\n\nCritical-thinking skills are developed through open-ended questions and conversations between instructor and student. This practice is called Inquiry. Questions such as: \"What do you notice about this painting? What can we guess about this place? Compare this place to your own neighborhood. How is it similar? How is it different?\" are similar to the kinds of conversations that would take place around text in the classroom. Students are asked to back up their interpretations of the artwork with explanations of details in the piece that lead them to their conclusion; multiple interpretations of the work are encouraged by discussion facilitators, such as \"Does everyone agree? Are there any other ideas?\" Through inquiry, students not only develop visual literacy skills that transfer to textual literacies, but an important groundwork is laid in the grammar and value of group discussion.\n\nIn 2006, results of a three-year study confirmed fundamental literacy skills were developed through participation in inquiry with art. The study, \"Teaching Literacy Through Art\", was administered by the LTA program, conducted by Randi Korn & Associates, and funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The study examined groups of third graders at P.S. 148 in Queens, and P.S. 86 in the Bronx. Along with classroom discussion of texts and visual documents, for the purposes of this study students were asked to discuss the painting \"The Artist and His Mother\" by Arshile Gorky (1926), and an excerpt from Cynthia Kabohata's 2004 book \"Kira-Kira\". The study found that the third grade students who participated in the LTA program and had ample practice talking critically about works of art using inquiry, used more words to express themselves and demonstrated higher achievement in six categories of literacy and critical-thinking skills than their peers who had no experience with inquiry and visual documents. Categories of improved literacy skills were: thorough description, extended focus, hypothesizing, evidential reasoning, providing multiple interpretations, and building schema.\n\nThese improvements in critical-thinking skills aid classroom teachers in meeting New York State English Language Arts Learning Standards, and prove that skills learned while creating meaning with a visual document are transferable to students' capabilities in navigating meaning with a written text.\nFor many students who have trouble decoding text, talking critically about a visual text provides a more accessible entryway to developing these important critical-thinking skills necessary in becoming an active reader of written texts.\n\nHowever, while students who participated in LTA demonstrated improved critical-thinking and literacy skills inside the classroom and in interviews with researchers, scores on the New York City English Language Arts exam were not significantly different from the control group. This could perhaps be because the exam was written, whereas inquiry with artwork and data collected for research was done orally, through class discussion and interviews. Oral evaluations were chosen to be used in the study, because researchers wanted to evaluate students' language skills when thinking critically about a work of art or a text, as opposed to students' reading or writing ability.\n\nThe research results of LTA's \"Teaching Literacy Through Art\" study are not only good news for art educators looking to prove what they've instinctually known, that making and looking at artwork widens students' perspectives of the world. The study also strengthens the new trend in the education field of multi-modal texts in classrooms. Multi-modal classrooms acknowledge the fact that we live in a world where students are barraged with many types of \"texts,\" not only traditional print texts such as novels and poems, but other kinds of print media and online texts. Increasingly, these texts reach us visually, through movies and television programs and commercials, billboards, and printed advertisements using photographs, drawings, and graphic design. The Learning Through Art program teaches students to look at these visual texts with critical eye, and, through the creation of their own artwork, empowers students to become not only passive consumers of this visual culture, but also creators and manipulators of it.\n\n\n\n"}

The film was directed by David Leitch from a script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, with Ryan Reynolds starring as Deadpool. In \"No Good Deed\", Wade Wilson tries to save an old man from a mugger, but fails because he takes the time to change into his Deadpool costume first.\n\nShortly before the release of the 2017 film \"Logan\", its theatrical runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before \"Logan\" in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the feature film \"Deadpool 2\", but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to \"Logan\", making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.\n\n\"No Good Deed\" was originally released by 20th Century Fox in front of \"Logan\" on March 3, 2017, and an alternate version of the short was released online by Reynolds the following day. Responses to the short praised it as a tease for \"Deadpool 2\" and for showing that Leitch understands the character ahead of directing that film. Its humor was also highlighted by many critics.\n\nWade Wilson comes across an old man being mugged in an alley, and races to change into his Deadpool costume before he helps the man. As Wilson struggles to get dressed in a nearby phone booth, the man is shot. Wilson emerges, wearing his costume, only to find the man dead.\n\nDavid Leitch directed a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which was believed to be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film \"Logan\". This was meant to tease the film \"Deadpool 2\", which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, \"Logan\" director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After \"Logan\"s runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming \"X-Men\" film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to \"make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There was nothing else to say, because we had said it.\" Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for \"Deadpool 2\" before \"Logan\", confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the \"Deadpool\" films.\n\nAfter the initial release, Reese quickly clarified that the scene was not intended to be an official trailer for \"Deadpool 2\", with none of its footage meant to appear in that film, instead being a standalone short film that serves as a \"tonal tease\" for \"Deadpool 2\". Two slightly different versions of the short were created, with the intention of giving \"theater-goers and internet users slightly different treats.\" For the online release, Reynolds simply titled the short \"No Good Deed\". That version of the short sees Stan Lee make a cameo appearance as himself.\n\nThe short parodies Superman, with John Williams' theme from the 1978 film playing as Wilson changes in the booth. It was noted that Leitch's \"icy blue\" cinematography differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first \"Deadpool\", on which Wernick said \"every director brings their take to the material\" and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted the opening of the short to feel like the opening of \"Logan\", \"so if you were going to see \"Logan\" and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [Jackman] in the hoodie, and then when it turns out to be Deadpool you realize what's going on.\" They described the short as an absurd one-off \"that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there.\" The short makes several references to \"Logan\": it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to \"Logan\" and that film's focus on older characters.\n\n\"No Good Deed\" was shown in front of \"Logan\" in North America theaters beginning March 3, 2017, distributed by 20th Century Fox. The short was only approved for theatrical release in India as intended because the view of Reynolds' buttocks in the short, as Wilson changes into his Deadpool costume, is blurred by the telephone booth windows. Reynolds released the online version of the short on YouTube on March 4, with the video description \"Wade and the other girls from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants plan a trip to Cabot Cove.\" Within 48 hours, the video had been viewed over 12 million times.\n\nChris Cabin at Collider called the short film \"dark, funny, and just a bit punkish\", and compared it to a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit. He thought it was a smart move from Fox to release \"a taste of what [fans] love\" about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and \"a great way to keep the buzz going for\" \"Deadpool 2\" despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first \"Deadpool\" was \"not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company\", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with \"Logan\" as another connection being made by Fox between its \"X-Men\" films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was \"a fun one\", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, \"At the very least, [this shows that] we can expect the same irreverent humor in\" \"Deadpool 2\" as was in the first film.\n\nWriting for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, regardless of the short's connections to \"Logan\" and \"Deadpool 2\", it \"ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun.\" Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short \"a fun little scene\", and said that Leitch \"certainly seems to have a solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well.\" Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a \"fun little surprise\" and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is \"not much to judge quite yet, but [Leitch] does showcase a strong eye for comedy\" in the footage, and particularly noted the \"ridiculously depressing and dilapidated\" setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is \"certainly cool enough to wet the palate for any \"X-Men\" fans\", and particularly noted the \"strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of \"Deadpool\". With a new director stepping behind the camera, perhaps this was a choice that we'll see in\" \"Deadpool 2\".\n\nThere was speculation among fans that the murdered old man in the short could be Ben Parker, the uncle of Marvel character Spider-Man who is killed by a mugger as part of that hero's origin story. The speculation noted the way the old man is killed in the short, and the fact that he is carrying Ben & Jerry's ice cream. In response to this, Leitch \"coyly\" said, \"That's a really interesting question\", adding, \"I think that people should continue to theorize who that old man was.\"\n\n"}

Assange said in a 2010 interview with \"The New Yorker\", \"I want to set up a new standard: 'scientific journalism.' If you publish a paper on DNA, you are required, by all the good biological journals, to submit the data that has informed your research—the idea being that people will replicate it, check it, verify it.

{"id": "3140813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3140813", "title": "Sternberg peer review controversy", "text": "Sternberg peer review controversy\n\nThe Sternberg peer review controversy concerns the conflict arising from the publication of an article supporting the pseudo-scientific concept of intelligent design in a scientific journal, and the subsequent questions of whether proper editorial procedures had been followed and whether it was properly peer reviewed.\n\nOne of the primary criticisms of the intelligent design movement is that there are no research papers supporting their positions in peer reviewed scientific journals. On 4 August 2004, an article by Stephen C. Meyer (Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture) titled \"The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories\", appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, \"Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington\". Meyer's article was a literature review article, and contained no new primary scholarship itself on the topic of intelligent design. The following month, the publisher of the journal, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington, released a statement repudiating the article and stating that their former editor Richard M. Sternberg had, in an unusual manner, handled the entire review process without consultation or review from an associate editor. The position of editor was unpaid and voluntary, and Sternberg had put in his resignation from it six months earlier. Sternberg disputes the Council's statement and asserts that the paper was appropriately peer reviewed by three biologists who \"concluded that [the paper] warranted publication\".\n\nThe same statement from the Council vowed that proper review procedures would be followed in the future and endorsed a resolution published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which states that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting intelligent design. On September 18, the Discovery Institute issued a statement praising the publication of Meyer's paper in a peer-reviewed journal and chastising the National Center for Science Education for stating that the paper should not have been published. The Biological Society of Washington's president, Roy McDiarmid called Sternberg's decision to publish Meyer's article \"a really bad judgment call on the editor's part\" and said it was doubtful whether the three scientists who peer reviewed the article and recommended it for publication were evolutionary biologists.\n\nRichard M. Sternberg is an American evolutionary biologist who has completed a BS degree from University of South Carolina and has two PhDs; the first from 1995 in molecular evolution from Florida International University, and a second in systems science from Binghamton University. He did post-doctoral work between 1999 and 2001 at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) at the Smithsonian Institution, on the phylogeny of brachyuran crabs.\n\nIn February 2001 he began work as an invertebrate taxonomist for the National Institutes of Health at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, later becoming a staff scientist. The position allowed time for research work, and he continued at the NMNH, now as an unpaid research associate. Soon after starting work, he agreed to take on the unpaid position of Managing Editor of the peer-reviewed scientific journal, \"Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington\", a taxonomic journal which usually publishes descriptions of newly identified species. Also in 2001, he joined the editorial board of the Baraminology Study Group, a young earth creationist \"creation science\" attempt to identify and classify the created kinds mentioned in scripture. He has stated that he is an outside critic and remained skeptical of their young earth beliefs. Around this time he was sympathetic to historic ideas of structuralism of patterns in nature, but could not go from that to inferring the existence of a designer. He occasionally met proponents of intelligent design, and in 2002 presented a lecture on formal causation to the ISCID intelligent design group's \"Research And Progress in Intelligent Design\" (RAPID) conference.\n\nIn October 2003 Sternberg resigned from being editor of the \"Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington\", with a commitment to edit issues over the coming year. Early in 2004 intelligent design advocate Stephen C. Meyer contacted Sternberg about a manuscript that he was thinking of submitting to the journal. Sternberg advised him he would have to become a member of the Society, and in a few weeks Meyer sent him copies of the manuscript with evidence of membership. Sternberg went ahead with the review and editing process, and Meyer's article appeared in the journal on 4 August 2004. This was already scheduled to be the second last issue that Sternberg would edit. In a statement issued by 10 October 2004 the journal declared that Sternberg had published the paper at his own discretion without following the usual practice of review by an associate editor. The Council and associate editors would have considered the subject of the paper inappropriate for publication as it was significantly outside \"the nearly purely systematic content\" of the journal, the Council endorses a resolution \"which observes that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting ID as a testable hypothesis\", and the paper therefore \"does not meet the scientific standards of the Proceedings\".\n\nSternberg continued in his job as a staff scientist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information until 2007, and continued hold the unpaid position of Research Associate at the NMNH, which was extended on 15 November 2006 by a further three year appointment as an unpaid 'research collaborator' at the NMNH. After 2007 Sternberg became a research scientist at the intelligent design Biologic Institute, supported by a research fellowship from the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, of which Stephen Meyer is a co-founder and currently director.\n\nSternberg is a Roman Catholic \"who attends Mass.\" He subscribes to the process structuralism school of thought. In 2005 he said he was not a proponent of intelligent design. He has more recently described his position as one that \"can accept all that is empirically valid in evolutionary biology, while not axiomatically dismissing the position that structures as well as their \"real\" instantiations have an intelligent cause\", and asserts that the universe emanates from Nous (mind), so that his thinking \"is compatible with intelligent design broadly defined.\"\nSternberg serves as a fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), an intelligent design group. He is also a signatory to the Discovery Institute's Scientific Dissent from Darwinism petition.\n\nSternberg insists the paper was properly peer reviewed, and rejects the reason given by the journal for disavowing the article, saying: \n\nA series of articles in \"Skeptic\" criticized the decision to publish the article. Michael Shermer disputed Sternberg's qualifications as a peer reviewer, stating that it dealt less with the areas Sternberg was qualified to review (systematics and taxonomy) than it did paleontology, for which many members of the society would have been better qualified to peer review the paper; at that time the Society had three members who were experts on Cambrian invertebrates, the subject discussed in Meyer's paper. A follow-up article by Ed Brayton criticized Sternberg's decision to review the paper, given his ties to a known movement that opposes the theory of evolution:\n\nDoubts were raised whether the reviewers were evolutionary biologists. According to an article by the Society of Academic Authors Meyer said the article grew out of a presentation he made at a conference attended by Richard Sternberg where they discussed the possibility of a paper for society's journal. Observers have pointed to affiliations that in most circumstances would have disqualified Sternberg from reviewing an article on intelligent design. They note that Sternberg is a Fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design, a Discovery Institute-affiliated group dedicated to promoting intelligent design. Sternberg is also a signatory of the Discovery Institute's \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\" statement \"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"\n\nSternberg claims to have also checked with a Council member and to have followed the standard practice for peer review:\n\nOf the four \"well-qualified biologists with five PhDs\" Sternberg identifies, one was Sternberg himself, contributing his double doctorate to the total he cited. Sternberg's claim of following proper peer review procedures directly contradicts the published public statement of his former employer, the publisher of the journal, that the proper procedures were not followed resulting in the article's retraction. In previous years the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington had published yearly lists of all the people who had served as peer reviewers. That list is absent for 2004, the year of the incident. Sternberg has repeatedly refused to identify the three \"well-qualified biologists,\" citing personal concerns over professional repercussions for them.\n\nIn a review of Meyer's article \"The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories\", Alan Gishlick, Nick Matzke, and Wesley R. Elsberry claimed it contained poor scholarship, that it failed to cite and specifically rebut the actual data supporting evolution, and \"constructed a rhetorical edifice out of omission of relevant facts, selective quoting, bad analogies, knocking down straw men, and tendentious interpretations.\" Further examination of the article revealed that it was substantially similar to previously published articles co-authored by Meyer.\n\nCritics of Sternberg believe that he was biased in the matter, arguing that Sternberg's close personal and ideological connections to the paper's author suggest at least the appearance of conflict of interest. They cite as evidence Sternberg's presentation in 2002 of a lecture on intelligent design at the Research And Progress in Intelligent Design (RAPID) conference where Stephen C. Meyer, the author of the paper Sternberg published, also presented a lecture. The explicit purpose of the RAPID conference was to \"form new collaborations among scientists seeking to do research on the interface between science and faith, particularly within the context of ID\". Only intelligent design advocates spoke at it, and at least one intelligent design critic was expressly forbidden to attend it. It was organized and hosted by the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), a group dedicated to promoting intelligent design, of which Sternberg is a Fellow. ISCID is affiliated with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, where Meyer serves as the Program Director of the Center for Science and Culture. Critics also note that Sternberg also sat on the editorial board of the Baraminology Study Group, which studies \"creation biology\" and whose website is hosted by Bryan College, a conservative Christian school named after William Jennings Bryan, who famously opposed Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Trial.\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, in a position statement describing the events around the controversy, said \"Given these associations, Dr. Sternberg would appear to be, at very least, an advocate for 'intelligent design' and critical of standard peer review processes as they bear on the scientific assessment of the 'intelligent design' hypothesis.\" Critics describe Sternberg's explanation of events, that a pro-intelligent design paper just happened to find its way to a publication with a sympathetic editor ultimately responsible for ensuring proper peer review and editing of his last issue, and that he decided it was appropriate to deal with the review process in person on a subject in which he has a personal interest, as improbable and that \"people who want us to believe that the publication process outlined [by Sternberg and his defenders] was transparent and only had to do with science\" are \"disingenuous.\"\n\nJournalist Chris Mooney has compared the Sternberg controversy to that of a paper published by climate change skeptics Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas in \"Climate Change\", where a sympathetic editor Chris de Freitas allowed it to be published, despite its lack of scientific merit.\n\nAfter the peer review controversy became public, Sternberg filed a religious discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, where he had an unpaid appointment as a research associate, while employed by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSternberg claims that he was \"targeted for retaliation and harassment\" and subject to efforts to remove him from the museum in retaliation for his views in support of intelligent design. He continues to cite a letter by the United States Office of Special Counsel as supporting his version of events, despite the fact that the Office of Special Counsel did not proceed beyond its initial investigation. In its initial investigation, Office of Special Counsel concluded that there was a strategy by several managers to force Sternberg out of the Smithsonian Institute and that there was a strong religious and political component to the actions taken after the publication of the Meyer article. One of the email, for example, stated, \"Scientists have been perfectly willing to let these people alone in their churches, but now it looks like these people are coming out and invading our schools, biology classes, museums and now our professional journals. These people to my mind are only a scale up on the fundies of a more destructive kind in other parts of the world. Depressing. Oh, if we only still had Steve Gould to lead the counter-attack\". Pim Van Meurs and other critics observed that the Office of Special Counsel lacked jurisdiction over the matter and so his claim was unlikely to proceed, and that even though it made no official findings or conclusions, the response from the Office of Special Counsel provided Sternberg and the Discovery Institute putative evidence and talking points supporting their claim that the scientific community discriminates against intelligent design proponents. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed article, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow David Klinghoffer portrayed Sternberg as a martyr and victim of discrimination, a tactic used often by design proponents.\n\nIn response, Sternberg's supervisor at the Smithsonian, Jonathan Coddington, responded publicly disputing Sternberg's and Klinghoffer's depiction of events. Coddington states that Sternberg was never dismissed, nor was he a paid employee, and that he was never the target of discrimination, and remained serving at the museum up to that time.\n\nIn August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's religious discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It was determined that as an unpaid research associate at the Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, with George W. Bush appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.\n\nIn a November, 2005 National Public Radio report on the affair Sternberg stated \"I'm not an evangelical, I'm not a fundamentalist, I'm not a young earth creationist, I'm not a theistic evolutionist\". Sternberg said McVay \"related to me, 'the Smithsonian Institution's reaction to your publishing the Meyer article was far worse than you imagined'.\" Barbara Bradley Hagerty, NPR's religion reporter, said Sternberg himself believes intelligent design is \"fatally flawed.\"\n\nIn December 2006 a partisan report was issued by Mark Souder, on the basis of information he and fellow Republican representative and intelligent design advocate Rick Santorum (author of the pro-ID Santorum Amendment) had requested, calling into question the Smithsonian's treatment of Sternberg and repeating many of Sternberg's claims. The report was commissioned by Souder in his capacity as subcommittee chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, written by his subcommittee staff, but published by Souder as an individual representative without it being officially accepted into the Congressional Record. This is contrary to oft-repeated claims by the Discovery Institute and other design proponents that the report represents an official position by the Committee supporting Sternberg's claims of discrimination.\n\nObservers have said that facts of the case simply do not support the conclusions of the report nor is the report an official report of the committee. They say that the Discovery Institute is using the report to portray Sternberg specifically, and design proponents in general, as victims of persecution. They also say the Souder report is a repackaging of the Office of Special Council's previous findings from August 2005 and contains nothing new, consisting of \"the OSC findings restated and used as a form of evidence in and of themselves\" and attacks the Smithsonian for \"not accepting the OSC's findings at face value.\" They cite as evidence of a biased motive behind the report the longstanding connections of the report's instigators, Congressmen Souder and Santorum, to the Discovery Institute, whose Program Director is Stephen C. Meyer, author of the paper Sternberg published. In 2000 Souder co-hosted a congressional briefing on behalf of the Discovery Institute intended to drum up political support for intelligent design and read a defense of intelligent design prepared by the Discovery Institute into the congressional record. Santorum worked with the Discovery Institute's program director Phillip E. Johnson in 2000 and 2001 drafting the pro-intelligent design Santorum Amendment and in March 2006 wrote the foreword for the book, \"Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement\" a collection of essays largely by Discovery Institute fellows honoring Johnson as \"father\" of the intelligent design movement. Contained in the appendix to the Souder report is a letter from the director of the Smithsonian where it is revealed that Sternberg demanded that they give him a $300,000 grant to make up for his allegedly lost research time; he was turned down. Sternberg's appointment as a Smithsonian Institution research associate was from January 2004 through January 2007. Research associates are not employees of the Museum and appointments are typically awarded for up to three years.\n\nAs one of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns, the Institute conducted extensive lobbying and public relations efforts on Sternberg's behalf, including arranging for articles by Institute Fellows to be published in the mainstream press. The April 2008 film featuring Ben Stein promoting intelligent design, \"\", included interviews with Sternberg and claims that his \"life was ruined\". Both \"Scientific American\" and the National Center for Science Education state that the film misrepresents key facts.\n\n"}
{"id": "12783212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12783212", "title": "Teledotcom", "text": "Teledotcom\n\nA teledotcom is a domain name that not only spells a memorable word but also has a matching toll-free telephone number. This means the word that spells something will have a toll-free prefix and a top level domain extension after it. A teledotcom can be accessible by either phone or internet address.\n\nMost owners of a toll-free number that spells something (\"see Phoneword\"), will also try to register the matching domain name and therefore create a teledotcom; a valuable asset should they wish to sell it. It is significantly more difficult for an owner of a valuable domain names, because the matching toll-free numbers are much rarer. As a consequence of the difficulties in obtaining the domain name and the matching toll-free telephone number, the number of teledotcoms is quite low.\n\nAn example teledotcom is 1-800-Flowers.com. Customers can either visit the website or telephone 1-800-FLOWERS (1-800-356-9377). Others examples are 1-800-Mattress.com and 1-800 Contacts.com. To extend their marketing reach, these companies will also advertise on television across the United States.\n\nBuyer Jim McCann stated that 1-800-flowers purchased the toll free number from a flower company that was seven million dollars in debt. The toll-free numbers are considered so valuable to the company that the company now owns the same number under the 888, and 877 prefix. When the 866 toll free prefix was launched, competition for the flowers number was stiff, with 1-800-flowers eventually losing to a rival company.\n\nUnlike domain names where one person can own eLoans, and another can own eLoan and all can be allowed to use the names as they are considered fair use, toll-free numbers that are first to market and part of a brand, are usually protected. For example, when a New York-based business tried to set up 1-718-Mattress, it was forced to relinquish the use of the number as it confused people by too closely copying the brand of 1-800-Mattress.\n\nAll companies do not use their web domain names as their brand. Not every company would name themselves after the domain they acquire as they often take a similar but not exact name.\n\nHowever, when a domain name or telephone number spell a valued term, the company will not only use the Toll free, Domain or combination Teledotcom as a brand, they will sometimes even change a long-standing company name to match it. This has happened with lenders for instance, Refinance.com now has that as their name when previously they were another company prior to acquiring the valuable domain name worth seven figures.\n\nUsing a toll free or teledotcom as a brand is common when they spell a frequently used or understood term.\n\nWhen a company acquires a similar area code to a predecessor\nsuch as 1866flowers, it should not name itself as a company, 1866flowers.com etc. It can however fully utilize and publish the number and its spelling for easy remembering for its customers as long as it makes clear that it is part of separate company. The 1-800-Flowers company cannot prohibit the 1866Flowers phone number from use or marketing of the easily remembered phone number when used in conjunction with a distinguishable brand name.\n\nThe mistake made by 1-718-Mattress is they did not distinguish themselves as a company with another name. Had they been Neighborhood Mattress Inc., with 718-Mattress published alongside, then 1-800 Mattress could not have had a claim that 1-718 was using a confusingly similar name. The use of a phone number and its spelling is a right for any holder of a toll free or other prefix. Telephone numbers are part of a public trust and must be fairly available to anyone on an equal basis. Responsible Organizations (RespOrgs) must honor the rules that distribute phone numbers fairly according to law.\n\nConsumers enjoy the easy access to services and goods that can be found by simply typing in the word on the keyboard such as flowers, or by simply dialing it.\n\n1-800-Mattress is one such example. Consumers can order mattresses by calling or visiting on the web. Even with the 1-800-Mattress.com being a large purchase for the company, the convenience of telephone ordering from a toll free number that also spells the domain generally will increase business.\n\n"}
{"id": "5024233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5024233", "title": "Tempestarii", "text": "Tempestarii\n\nIn medieval lore, Tempestarii were weather making magicians who dwelt amongst the common people and possessed the power to raise or prevent storms at will. For this reason, anyone reputed as a weather-maker was the subject of respect, fear, and hatred in rural areas.\n\nPerhaps the best known work on tempestarii was a 815 AD piece called \"On Hail and Thunder\" by a bishop, Agobard of Lyon.\n\nSome describe it as a complaint of the irreligious beliefs of his flock, as villagers resented paying tithes to the church, but freely paid a form of insurance against storms to village \"tempestarii\"; but, it was also noted, whenever a supposed weather-maker failed to prevent a storm, he or she would generally suffer the wrath of the populace, being victimised or killed.\n\nA closer examination of Agobard's writing shows that he actually argues against the existence of weather-witches, but acquiesces that the saints of God are able to cause these things by praying with faith. He is more concerned with his flock's misunderstanding that these \"witches\" are obtaining power from the devil, and subsequent eagerness to kill or curse anyone able to work miracles. His key argument is that anyone capable of \"raising a gale\" would be one who has faith in God, a Christian, not a witch, because witches are not able to do such things.\n\"Perhaps the ones who attribute the making of hail to men would say that Moses reached his staff up to heaven and in this sense the storm was sent by human agency. Certainly Moses, the servant of God, was good and righteous, but these people do not dare to say that the so-called ‘storm-makers’ are good and righteous, but rather evil and unrighteous, deserving of both temporal and eternal condemnation, nor are they servants of God, except perhaps by circumstance rather than willing service. For if there were men who could cause hail, in imitation of Moses, they would surely be servants of God, not servants of the devil; although the passages cited above show that neither servants of God nor those of the devil cause of hail, but only omnipotent God...\n\n...not like these half-faithful of ours, who, as soon as they hear thunder, or when there is a breath of light wind, say ‘a gale is raised’ and curse, saying, ‘Cursed be the tongue that did these things, and may it be dried up and now be cut off.’ Pray tell, whom are you cursing? A righteous man or a sinner? For a sinner, partly unbelieving like you, cannot raise a gale, as you put it, because he is not able to by his own strength, nor can he command evil angels (nor do evil angels even have power in these matters).\" \nAgobard of Lyons also referenced a related belief amongst his parishioners—a belief that \"tempestarii\" were in league with a mythical race of cloud-dwellers who came from a land named 'Magonia' (\"Land of Magic\", \"Land of Thieves\"). The Magonians were supposed to sail the skies in storm clouds; they would then pay Frankish \"tempestarii\" to summon up storms over farmlands, during which the Magonians could swoop down and steal the corn from the fields. On the particular occasion which prompted Agobard to write, several supposed Magonians had been taken prisoner by irate villagers shortly after a bad storm; the Bishop had been forced to intervene and debate with the villagers in order to save the prisoners' lives.\n\nDuring the witch hunts the belief in witches who could raise storms was not limited to the Tempestarii. Depending on a witch's preference, they were believed to cause tempests, hailstorms, and lightning. Witches struck homes and crops alike, sank ships, killed men and animals, and it was believed they took great delight in the process. Church authorities gave credence to the belief by stating that God permitted the Devil and witches to perform these acts as punishment for the wickedness of the world.\n\nSince ancient times around the world, the ability to control elements—including the raising of storms and causing rain—has been attributed to magicians, shamans, sorcerers, and witches. As early as 700 A.D., the Catholic Church prosecuted sorcerers for causing storms.\n\nThe most famous storm believed to be caused by witches was recorded in 1591 during the North Berwick Witch Trials. John Fian and his alleged coven of witches were accused of raising a sea storm to drown James VI and Queen Anne on their way from Denmark.\n\nOn the Tempestarii and Magonia see Valerie I. J. Flint, \"The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe\", Princeton Univ. Press, 1991, p. 112.\n\nThe Catholic Church prohibited superstitious remedies against witchcraft such as storm raising because the remedies themselves were of pagan origin. Prayer, sacraments, and the invocation of the name of God were prescribed instead with the belief that a person who had strong faith in God, kept the commandments, and revered the rites of the Church would be immune from storms and tempests raised by malicious witches.\n\nBecause many peasants were reluctant to give up their superstitions as being false, the church also sanctioned remedies like the ringing of church bells, believed to drive storm devils away, and placing charms made from flowers consecrated on Palm Sunday in the crop fields. It was believed that if a storm did strike after the charm was placed, the owner's crops would be protected even if the surrounding land and crops were destroyed.\n\n \n"}

It is written in contemporary language and blends elements of everyday life with fantastic characters. It was awarded the Stalin prize in 1942. Bazhov's stories are based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Malachite Box\" was released on 28 January 1939. It consisted of 14 stories and an introduction, which contained some information about the life, industry and culture of the Urals and which the author tried to include into every edition of the collection. Later versions contained more than 40 stories. Not all stories are equally popular nowadays. The most popular tales were written between 1936 and 1939: \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\" and its continuation \"The Malachite Casket\", \"The Stone Flower\" and its continuation \"The Master Craftsman\", \"Silver Hoof\", \"Cat's Ears\", \"Sinyushka's Well\", \"The Manager's Boot-Soles\". Among the later stories, \"A Fragile Twig\" (1940), \"The Fire-Fairy\" (1940), \"Tayutka's Mirror\" (1941), \"Ivanko Krylatko\" (1943), \"That Spark of Life\" (1943) are popular. The characters of the Ural Mountains folklore such as the Mistress of the Copper Mountain became very well known after their appearance in Pavel Bazhov's \"The Malachite Box\".\n\nIn the 1930s the Communist Party of the Soviet Union greatly encouraged the interest in the past of the country and the people. The Party paid a lot of attention to the development of the historical science. Maxim Gorky initiated the publication of such books as \"The History of Factories and Plants\" (). The initiative was supported by the Communist Party. History books and various historical fiction titles were published one after another. General interest in the history of the country transformed into the interest in folk art and folklore. The famous folklore expert Nikolay Andreyev later wrote about that period that the folklore collections \"have never been published before in such quantities, not even in the \"Golden Age\" of the folkloristics in the 60s\". Journalists, students, and members of Komsomol started collecting folklore. At the First Сongress of the Soviet Writers Maxim Gorky reminded the writers that \"the art of words begins with folklore\" and encouraged them to collect and study it. It was supposed to be used as a model example of the literature.\n\nPavel Bazhov was born at the Urals. He knew its geography, topography, natural resources, and was very proud of both the beauty of the Urals and its people. He stated that his main reason for writing was to suppress the pain after the loss of his only son Alexey in 1935. Mark Lipovetsky believed the tense situation in the author's life could partially explain the depth and the sombre tone of his early tales, which made them so popular among the adult readers. He suggested that the tales carried the sign of deep terror and trauma, which Bazhov endured between January 1937 and 1938, and noted that \"The Malachite Box\" \"is filled with unprecedented for Soviet (and especially children's) literature horror\". At that time Bazhov was fired from Sverdlovsk Publishing House, where he had worked since 1931, and expelled from the Communist Party for \"glorification of people's enemies\" in his recent book. His past as a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and a seminary teacher was also questionable. He was once summoned for interrogation by NKVD, but luckily his investigator was arrested the day before the meeting. The author was reinstated in the Communist Party in 1938. Nevertheless, a lot of the stories were written between January 1937 and 1938. Bazhov later said: \"It happened to be such a black stripe that I was at loose ends. So I started to work on some old ideas.\" During the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) Bazhov switched to the patriotic tales, the task that he considered his duty as the patriot. The distinctive feature of the later stories is the strengthening of the social motive, such as confrontation based on social class, and the decrease in poetic and supernatural scenarios.\n\nThe tales are told from the point of view of the imaginary Grandpa Slyshko (; lit. \"Old Man Listenhere\"). Slyshko is the old miner from a factory who rememberes the Serfdom era. In the stories written at the end of the Great Patriotic War and in the post-war years, Bazhov introduced the new narrator. His new stories were told by a different type of the miner: the patriotic participant of the Russian Civil War who fought for the Red Army and later helped to build the new socialist society.\n\nThe tales can be divided into several groups: the series about craftsmen (the most famous tales are \"The Stone Flower\", \"The Master Craftsman\", \"A Fragile Twig\"); the tales about some mysterious forces, which contain surreal plots and mythical creatures (\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\", \"The Malachite Casket\", \"Sinyushka's Well\", \"Cat's Ears\"); the satirical tales about gold prospectors or greedy bailiffs (\"The Manager's Boot-Soles\", \"Sochen and His Stones\"); the tales about mine explorers (\"Sinyushka's Well\"). During the Great Patriotic War and in the post-war years, Bazhov started writing about Soviet armourers, steel-makers, and teemers, emphasizing the patriotic pride of the Russian workers. He also penned some stories about the Russian communist leaders, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Furthermore, Pavel Bazhov indicated that his stories can be divided into two groups based on tone: \"child-toned\" (e.g. \"The Fire-Fairy\", \"Silver Hoof\"), and \"adult-toned\" (\"The Stone Flower\", \"Marko's Hill\"). Denis Zherdev divided the stories into \"gold\" and \"malachite\" series, which begin with \"Beloved Name\" and \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\" respectively.\n\nIn the mid-1930s Sverdlovsk Publishing House decided to publish the collection \"Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals\" (). In the summer of 1934 the folklorist Vladimir Biryukov was offered to make such a collection. The historian Andrey Ladeyshchikov became its chief editor. From August to December 1935 Biryukov collected folklore at the Ural Mountains. He was supposed to finish the book by January 1935, however, it was not completed on February. Biryukov wrote in the diary that \"the classification, introduction, and the bibliography\" were needed. Several sections of the collection were not yet ready as well. Biryukov mostly worked on songs, folk riddles, and fairy tales.\n\nOn 25 February 1395 Biryukov met with Yelizaveta Blinova, the new chief editor of \"Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals\" appointed instead of Andrey Ladeyshchikov. She insisted on including the folklore of the working class, although Biryukov claimed that it would be impossible to find. Blinova consulted with journalists, ethnographers, and writers (including Pavel Bazhov) and asked them to write down some workers' folklore. She added their stories to the collection. Blinova's initiative inspired Bazhov to start working on his stories. Bazhov, who was an employee of the same publishing house since 1931, suggested that she include some stories that he had heard at the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant from the miners' storyteller Vasily Hmelinin (), nicknamed \"Grandpa Slyshko\" by children (\"slysh-ka\" literally means \"Listen here!\"). Bazhov later wrote about Blinova:\nShe raised a question: why were there no workers' folklore? Vladimir Pavlovich [Biryukov] replied that he had not been able to find it anywhere. I was dismayed: how can that be true? I've heard this workers' folklore in abundance, I've heard the whole \"skazy\". And I brought to her \"Beloved Name\" as an example.\nPavel Bazhov had heard the \"skaz\" from Vasily Hmelinin in 1892-1895, and wrote it down from memory, trying to use the miners' natural language where possible, as he was always fascinated with miners' colloquialisms. His prerevolutionary records, which consisted of six notebooks, were lost during the Russian Civil War. Bazhov introduced Vasily Hmelinin in the stories as the narrator Grandpa Slyshko.\n\nIn July 1936 Blinova left Sverdlovsk Publishing House. Bazhov became the chief editor, only to be replaced by Ladeyshchikov again. The collection was eventually published under Ladeyshchikov's name on December 1936. There were three of Bazhov's stories in it: \"Beloved Name\", \"The Great Snake\", and \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\". Prior to the publication, the Detgiz employee Vladimir Lebedev saw his manuscript. He was very impressed by it, and published four stories (\"Beloved Name\", \"The Great Snake\", \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\", and \"The Manager's Boot-Soles\") in the 11th issue of the \"Krasnaya Nov\" literary magazine (1936).\n\nInspired by the success of the tales, Bazhov continued working on them. The tales \"Sinyushka's Well\", \"Silver Hoof\", and \"The Demidov Caftans\" were finished even before the publication of the first \"The Malachite Box\" edition. By 1938 the author finished 14 stories. Because of Bazhov's tense relationship with the Communist Party, they were published under two different pen names, either under the name \"P. Bragin\" or simply under his initials \"P. B.\". The name of Vasily Hmelinin was usually in the title as well.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Malachite Box\" was released in several versions. The first copy was presented to the author for his 60th birthday on 28 January 1939. Several test copies were published in January. A special deluxe edition, decorated with malachite, was sent to the 1939 New York World's Fair. The mass market edition published in autumn of the same year. The book was an instant success. It has been republished many times. Overall, twenty three editions of the stories were released from 1941 to 1945. The second edition of the collection was released by the Moscow publishing house Sovetsky Pisatel in 1942. The book was awarded the Stalin prize. The third edition of \"The Malachite Box\" was released by Goslitizdat in 1944; the fourth by Sverdlovsk Publishing House in 1944; the fifth edition by Sovetsky Pisatel in 1947; the sixth by Goslitizdat in 1948; the seventh by Sverdlovsk Publishing House in 1949. The eighth was the last edition of \"The Malachite Box\" to be published during Bazhov's lifetime in 1950. In 1950 his decaying eyesight made the writing difficult. The last story \"Zhabrei's Path\" was published after his death. According to the All-Union Book Chamber's data as of 1 January 1981, the books in the Soviet Union were republished 253 times with a total circulation of about 37 million copies. \"The Malachite Box\" has been republished many times since then.\n\nThe tales were translated into 64 languages, more than 250 editions in foreign languages were released. The list of languages include English, Hungarian, Italian, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, Mongolian, Chinese, Japanese, Assamese, Kannada. Four stories from \"The Malachite Box\" were published in the 1943 Moscow magazine \"Internatsionalnaya Literatura\" in English and French. In 1944 the book was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson. Bazhov did not know about this translation and found out about it accidentally. In the early 1940s \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\" and \"The Stone Flower\" were translated into Italian. Bazhov mentioned that he had heard about it from \"either folklorist or translator Lesnaya\". In the letter as of 25 February 1945 he wrote:\n\nShortly before the war she told me about the Italian \" di Pietra\" (\"The Stone Flower\") and something like \"Madonna of the Mountains\" (\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\"). It was rather amusing. She promised to give me the book. But did not keep the promise.\nBazhov never saw this book, and even museum workers were unable to locate it. \"The Malachite Box\" in Italian was republished in 1978 by La Scuola as \"Racconti russi, a cura di R. Molteni Grieco\" (lit. \"Russian fairy tales, edited by R. Molteni Grieco\").\n\nIn 1946 the book was translated into Bokmål and released in Norway by Falken Forlag (as \"Steinblomsten\"). Several stories were translated into Chinese and published in the Shanghai literary magazine in 1946. In 1947 it was released in French as \"La Fleur de pierre\", published by Editions du Bateau Ivre. Another English translation was made in the 1950s by Eve Manning. In all, the stories have been published in English at least four times.\n\nBazhov was very interested in the translations. He called them \"the walks in alien places\". He was also concerned about the ideological aspects of his work and the possible changes that could happen in translation. He helped translators when he could, explaining the meaning of some Ural colloquialisms.\n\nThe first edition of the collection was illustrated by Alexander Kudrin. Bazhov favored the second edition, released by Sovetsky Pisatel in 1942, because of the illustrations created by Konstantin Kuznetsov. However he criticized Kuznetsov for depicting Silver Hoof as a domestic goat, and was generally extremely demanding when it came to details. On another occasion he was disappointed with the picture of Danilo the Craftsman in bast shoes, because miners did not wear them. Among the other illustrators he liked Oleg Korovin, Yekaterina Gilyova and Vasiliy Bayuskin.\n\nIn \"Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals\" Bazhov was noted as the one who collected the texts, yet in the \"Krasnaya Nov\" magazine he was listed as their original author. The question of authorship arose soon after the publication. Some critics considered the stories pure folklore, others thought of it was a literary work penned by Bazhov. Unfortunately the Soviet folkloristics was underdeveloped, at that time there were no specific criteria of distinguishing literature from folklore.\n\nThe question of authorship arose every time a new story was released, and is still discussed nowadays. Before the stories were released as a single volume on 28 January 1939, the issue became urgent. The publisher was concerned with the title of the book and the author's name. It was suggested to release the book as \"The Tales from Grandpa Slyshko\" (), as if Vasily Hmelinin was the author. It was eventually published as \"The Malachite Box\".\n\nBazhov was not certain of the authorship himself. He tried to avoid the question, joking that \"questions such as these should be left to scholars\". He admitted that he was writing the tales from memory, and could not possibly recall and write down all the details. Bazhov said he only remembered the main plot elements and some particularly memorable details. The author even claimed that his \"reconstruction\" eradicated from the stories any possible value for the folklorists. However this position was disputed by the scholars, such as Lyudmila Skorino, Alexander Barmin and others.\n\nNowadays Bazhov's tales are generally accepted as his own \"literary work based on the Urals folklore\" or call them \"transitional\" between folklore and fairy tales. There are several reasons for that. Firstly, although the plots of the folk tales remain unchanged, the book conveys certain ideological concepts common for that time period, while folklore normally has no philosophy. Secondly, the manuscripts demonstrate that a huge amount of professional work were done on the composition, imagery, and language. Bazhov had worked on some stories, such as \"The Blue Snake\", for years before publication. In some cases he created the storylines from scratch, e. g. with \"Silver Hoof\" he only heard about the mythical creature itself. Later studies showed that he used vague folkloric beliefs and molded then into an original mythology. When asked whether his early stories were closer to folklore sources, Bazhov agreed. As time went by, he became less depended on the folklore and more independent as a writer. The current consensus among the folklore specialists is that he used the fragments of legends and bound them together by his own creative imagination.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Malachite Box\" was released on 28 January 1939. It consisted of an introduction titled \"The Watchhouse on Dumna Mountain\" and 14 stories, based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors. After the initial publication, the author continuously added new stories to the collection, such as the so-called \"mountain fairy tales\" in 1942, \"Stories of Germans\" () in 1943, a series of stories about Russian steel-makers and coiners in 1944–1945, \"Stories of Lenin\" () in 1944–1945, and others. Every edition of the collection ended with the dictionary of unusual words and concepts.\n\n\"The Watchhouse on Dumna Mountain\" () was Bazhov's essay which served as an introduction to the first edition of \"The Malachite Box\". It contained some information about the life, industry and culture at the Urals. The first short version of the essay, included in the 1939 book, was titled \"The Watchhouse on Dumna Mountain\". In 1940 the author expanded it and renamed to \"By the Old Mine\" (). This version was first published in the 3rd volume of the \"Uralsky Sovremennik\" almanac (1940). Starting with the 3rd edition of \"The Malachite Box\", this essay was published in all subsequent editions. The author included the essay in every \"The Malachite Box\" edition for the purpose of familiarizing the reader with the unique culture of the Ural region.\n\n\"Beloved Name\" (alternative translation: That Dear Name) describes how the first Cossacks came to the Ural Mountains and were faced a tribe of the \"Old People\" who didn't know the value of gold. The Cossacks decide to take away the lands of the Old People.\n\nIn this \"skaz\", the old miner's sons meet the Great Serpent (alternative translation: Poloz the Great Snake), the master of gold. He appears before them as a man in gold tunic. \"His cap was yellow with red flaps on both sides, and his boots were gold too... The earth sank under him where he stood.\" He shows them how to find gold nuggets. The story of the brothers is continued in \"The Snake Trail\" (alternative translation: \"The Serpent's Trail\"), published in 1939.\n\nIn this \"skaz\", a young the factory worker Stepan meets the legendary Mistress of the Copper Mountain. He passes her tests and is rewarded by a malachite casket filled with jewellery for his betrothed, Nastyona.\n\nStepan dies, leaving the Malachite Casket to his widow Nastyona. Their daughter Tanyushka likes to play with it. With black hair and green eyes, Tanyushka does not look like her mother at all, as if she was born to different parents. When she grows up, she catches the eye of a young noble man. She promises to marry him if he shows her the Tsarina herself at the Malachite Room of the Palace.\n\nDanilo the Craftsman hears about a most beautiful Stone Flower grows in the domain of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. He goes to the mine and begs the Mistress to show him the Flower. The Mistress warns Danilo that he would never want to go back to his people, but he insists. She then shows him the Malachite Flower. Danilo disappears from the village, leaving his fiancée Katyenka behind.\n\nDanilo's story continued in \"The Master Craftsman\" (alternative translations: \"The Mountain Craftsman\", \"The Mountain Master\"), published a year later in \"Na Smenu!\". \"A Fragile Twig\", published in 1940, focuses on Katyenka and Danilo's son. Bazhov had plans for the fourth story, but it was never written.\n\n\"Golden Hair\" is based on the Bashkirs folklore. It tell the story of a Bashkir hunter Ailyp who meets the daughter of Poloz the Great Snake.\n\nIn addition to the stories mentioned above, the first edition of \"The Malachite Box\" contained the following 8 stories: \"The Manager's Boot-Soles\", \"Sochen and His Stones\", \"Marko's Hill\", \"The Twisted Roll\", \"The Two Lizards\", \"The Cat's Ears\", \"The Master Craftsman\", and \"The Snake Trail\". The first publication's structure was determined by Bazhov. He preferred to start with the stories about gold and gold prospectors, because the believed this legends to be of more ancient origin. Later versions of \"The Malachite Box\" contained more than 40 stories.\n\nAlthough the tales are based on folkloric tradition, many are somewhat different from their mythological and folkloric roots. Studies show that in many cases Pavel Bazhov used popular beliefs and molded them into his own original mythology. Bazhov said that his early tales, such as \"Beloved Name\", followed the oral tradition more closely than the later ones. He believed that the stories about the Gumyoshevsky mine were the closest to the original folklore. He said: \"In my opinion, they represent the attempt to reconstruct the folklore of this mine\". As time went by, Bazhov became less depended on the folklore and more independent as a writer. Some characters did not no exist at all in the original Ural folk tradition, although the author constructed them according to the mythological \"canon\".\n\nPavel Bazhov theorized that most of the existing mythical creatures were created by the populace to explain various unexplained natural phenomena, as they are related to some aspects of miners' life. Giving as example, the Earth Cat from \"Cat's Ears\" is described as \"two blue flames that look like cat's ears\" above the ground and represents sulfur dioxide gas. The antlered \"goat\" Silver Hoof from the story of the same name explained the occurrence of chrysolite: \"... people often found stones in the glade where the goat had run about. Most of them were green ones, chrysolites, folks call them.\" The blue snake from the story of the same name represents a gold nugget. Although speaking about the blue snake was a bad omen among the local miners, to see one was a good sign, and it meant that a person would find a gold nugget. The crone Sinyushka from the tale \"Sinyushka's Well\" represents marsh gas, which was actually called \"sinyushka\" at the Urals. The author noted that supernatural played a bigger part in the miners' lore than in the lore of charcoal burners or blast furnace workers. Mining and mine exploration in particular were always connected with some supernatural forces which presumably helped the workers. Even as late as the 19th century, people used to say about the lucky workers that they \"knew the words\" and had certain helpers. The geography is well known because it is specified in the stories. Bazhov mentions real locations such as Sysert, the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant, the Gumyoshevsky mine, the villages Kosoy Brod and Krasnogorka, the Ryabinovka river.\n\nMythical creatures in \"The Malachite Box\" are either anthropomorphous (primarily female) or zoomorphic. The animals that appear in the stories and have zoomorphic attributes are lizards, snakes (\"The Great Snake\"), cranes (\"Dikes of Gold\"), ants (\"Zhabrei's Path\"), swans (\"Yermak's Swans\"), cats, the deer. All these creatures, with the exception of the cats, were depicted on the Permian bronze casts (the 5-15 centuries). Archaeologies had found the casts next to Mount Azov and along the Chusovaya River in Perm Krai, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast of Russia. As for the cats, Alexei Ivanov noted that they are unlikely to come from the folk tales, and were probably added into the stories by the author. The anthropomorphous creatures are primarily female—Azovka from \"Beloved Name\", Golden Hair, the blue snake, the Mistress of the Copper Mountain, Poskakushka from \"The Fire-Fairy\", Sinyushka, Veselukha from \"Veselukha's Meadow\". They belong to different age groups: Poskakushka is a little girl, Golden Hair and the Mistress are maidens, Veselukha is a young woman, the blue snake is a woman, Sinyushka is an old woman. They mostly contact men, e.g. Poskakushka helps Fedyunka to find gold; the blue snake appears before boys; the Mistress traditionally helps single men only. Bazhov believed that miners missed women, because their work allowed for little contact with them, and therefore so many of their stories had female creatures.\n\nThe recurring characters that appear in folkloric tradition are the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and Poloz the Great Snake. Both of them are keepers of hidden underground riches. The Mistress, described as either a beautiful green-eyed woman in malachite gown or a lizard with the crown on her head, is the keeper of gemstones. Poloz is the master of every existing piece of gold. The miners believed that if a gold-bearing lode disappeared, it meant that the Great Snake moved it to a different place. Bazhov introduced numerous daughters of Poloz, including Golden Hair from the tale of the same name. The relationship between Poloz and the Mistress is unclear. Bazhov commented that he asked some story-tellers about it, but they could not answer the question. Bazhov believed that the Mistress was one of the latest characters to appear in legends, because of the complexity of the character. The origin of the characters such as those might also be Finno-Ugric. The Finno-Ugric peoples, who lived in that area, migrated to the Baltic Sea or assimilated into the new Russian culture, adding to it their folklore. Alexander Vernikov noted:\n\nThis lore included mining and metallurgic techniques unknown to Russians. [...] Finno-Ugrians’ beliefs and legends... featured the underground riches and powers, mostly moral and spiritual, impersonated in chthonic deities.\nPoloz the Great Snake, the blue snake, Sinyushka, the Mistress of the Copper Mountain all act like magical helpers and present a threat to mortals at the same time. The help of such mythical creatures would explain why some miners were luckier than others. They were connected with mountains because of people's the perception of the mountains as \"magical space\"—the mountain was the source of life, it protected from hostile forces and was the residence of divine patrons. Yet the creatures such as Sinyushka and the blue snake do not hesitate to kill those who did not pass their tests. Even those who had been rewarded by them rarely live happily ever after. These characters usually die soon. Snakes live underground (according to the legends, in the underworld) and are traditionally associated with the Chthonic deities.\n\nMany scholars highlighted the potently ideological nature of \"The Malachite Box\", especially regarding the stories created at the end of the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) and in the post-war years. Bazhov's work was supported by the Party. It was in high demand from the very beginning due to the shortage of the \"workers' folklore\", which should have represented the so-called class consciousness of the proletariat. The book conveys certain ideological concepts common for that time period, such as emphasis on the hard life of the working class before the Russian Revolution. Workers are depicted as the victims of class exploitation, while the mountain spirits are typically presented as magical helpers to the underprivileged. The mythical characters such as Poloz the Great Snake or the Mistress of the Copper Mountain act according to the principles of social justice, e. g. in \"The Manager's Boot-Soles\" it's said that the Mistress \"didn't like it when folks were treated ill underground\". Bazhov defines important values, such as love, family, masculinity, respect for the elders and workers, skill, sceptical attitude toward religion and clergy, diligence, camaraderie, harmony in the house and friendly relationship with neighbours, hospitality, modesty, honesty. An ideal man is a \"simple soul\", who is brave, patient, and hard-working. An ideal woman is beautiful, hard-working, loyal, thrifty, she takes care of household and children, gets on well with her husband. The plots often dramatize class conflicts. Some revolutionary propaganda is present in the dialogues. The narrator constantly refers to the fact that life before the Revolution was harder for working people. Mariya Litovskaya compared Pavel Bazhov to Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrei Platonov, and Dmitri Kedrin in such a way that the characters represent two concepts: the person who puts spiritual above the material, who looks for the truth, but loses a fight with nature in the end; and the new Soviet idea of protagonist as a professional who is ready for change and is capable of remaking the world. Foreigners are shown as uninspired people without creative spark, e.g. the German from \"Ivanko Krylatko\". In the stories penned during and after the Great Patriotic War, Bazhov wrote about great positive changes that happened in the life of the Ural workers after the October Revolution. A series of stories was devoted to the Russian communist leaders, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.\n\nBazhov shared popular in the Soviet historiography anti-capitalist attitude. The owners of the Ural plants were depicted as worthless, idle, greedy and cruel. He criticized or parodied the Ural businessmen Alexei Turchaninov, Pavel Solomirsky and Dmitry Solomirsky.\n\nCritics didn't originally consider the texts suitable for children's reading because of their difficult multilayered language, but the ideological pressure caused them to be actively used for children's education at the Urals. Children were to \"listen to the deeply rooted folk tales told by wise men and to follow the examples of the protagonists that these wise men presented\". Mariya Litovskaya commented that the so-called \"child-toned\" stories were simplified and shortened so that even the unskilled reader could easily read each of them in one go. In such stories the children are the main characters and the mythical creatures do not threaten them, but instead help them, which compensated \"for the inadequacy of the social and family help\" and helped to create \"favourable living conditions\" for the children, therefore promoting a positive attitude in the young readers. The narrator often reminds the reader that even such magical help is no longer necessary, because the Soviet society has righted all the wrongs of a fairy-tale reality.\n\nTatiana Kruglova comments that there is a clear split of characters based on their social class: there are working men, most often depicted as positive characters, and their masters, shown critically or ironically. But in the pre-war stories the class criteria existed as the background only. The conflict between the characters came from the collision between poetic and pragmatical, grand and common, irrational and rational.\n\n\"The Malachite Box\" and its author became enormously popular. It was met with significant praise by critics and enthusiastically received by readers, including the general populace and the more sophisticated Soviet intelligentsia. Bazhov turned into one of the most famous writers in the Soviet Union. Strangers would greet him on the streets. The critics agreed that \"never has the labour of miners, stone-cutters, teemers been celebrate in such a way, neither in verses, nor in prose\", and that Bazhov managed to show the essence of the professional skill of the miners. Mikhail Batin complimented its uniqueness, and novelty in the contents and in the form. Favourable reviews on \"The Malachite Box\" appeared in \"Uralsky Rabochy\" (18 January 1939), \"Izvestia\" (4 April), \"Pravda\" and \"Industria Sotsialisma\" (July). However the critics disagreed on the question of authorship. Some considered \"The Malachite Box\" pure folklore, others thought of it was a literary work penned by Bazhov. The author himself tried to avoid the issue, joking that \"questions such as these should be left to scholars\". At present Bazhov's tales are generally accepted as his own literary work based on the Urals folklore.\n\nThe editor of \"Izvestia\" called \"The Malachite Box\" \"a valuable contribution to the Soviet fiction\" and noted that \"the vividness of expression and poetic richness turn the wonderful stories of P. P. Bazhov into the truly artistic, poetic works of art\". David Zaslavsky in \"Pravda\" called the book \"remarkable\", the imagery \"sharp\", and commented that the \"skazy\" are \"excellent short stories that uncover the Urals history\". Demyan Bedny wrote about it: \"The richness of the \"skazy\" plots, the variety and beauty of their imagery are stunning. How many wonderful sources are there for woodcutters and artists, for drama, opera and ballet, not to mention cinema!\" Marina Balina wrote that Bazhov had \"managed to present the prerevolutionary Urals as a mythological world with mountain spirits and dark forces controlling the hidden riches\". The stories, characters, style, the combination of fantasy and realism, and the language were praised. Bazhov was congratulated as a great storyteller, his stories were praised as having \"huge ethic, aesthetic, and educational potential\". Anna Karavayeva mentioned that \"such books enrich not just our folklore, but the Soviet literature as a whole\". Elena Givental wrote that the author \"created the most poetic and identifiable set of Urals stories\", which \"has left a strong imprint in the minds of the Russian people\". The article in \"Pravda\" as of 20 March 1943 stated that \"Our [Soviet] people have fallen in love with the Ural's old storyteller P. Bazhov\".\nSelected stories have been a part of school core curriculum since the Soviet Union, and are still used for education purposes nowadays. The Ministry of Education and Science of Russia included the tales in their 2013 list of \"100 Recommended Books\" for schoolchildren. Their effective pedagogical influence have been noted. \"The Malachite Box\" became a classic of Soviet children's literature, yet the stories continued to be popular among adults as well. Mark Lipovetsky believed the situation in the author's life added to the depth of the tales and made them so popular among the adult readers. They were exceptionally popular during the Great Patriotic War. The paperbacks were sent to the front line. The author received fan mail from the soldiers who asked to send them the book. The publication attracted a large number of folklorists, who collected tales near Sysert since 1940s and long after Pavel Bazhov's death. The characters of the Ural Mountains folklore such as the Mistress of the Copper Mountain became very well known after their appearance in Bazhov's \"The Malachite Box\". Sysert's old coat of arms (1982–2002) featured the Mistress as a lizard with a crown, as did Yekaterinburg's coat of arms from 1973 to 1991. The early design of Polevskoy's coat of arms (1981) had an image of the Stone Flower. The current version, as well as the flag of the town, features the Mistress depicted as the golden lizard. The Malachite Casket became the symbol of the Urals.\n\n\"The Malachite Box\" is constantly republished, commented and illustrated. Not all stories are equally popular nowadays. The most popular tales were written between 1936 and 1939. Among the later stories, \"A Fragile Twig\" (1940), \"The Fire-Fairy\" (1940), \"Tayutka's Mirror\" (1941), \"Ivanko Krylatko\" (1943), \"That Spark of Life\" (1943) were popular. As for the skazy about Vladimir Lenin, such as \"The Bogatyr's Glove\" (1944) and \"The Sunstone\", they were called excessively didactic, and \"remain known to avid Bazhov experts only\". Some Bazhov's stories on the present day topics were unsuccessful even among his contemporaries. Mariya Litovskaya criticized the author for \"yielding to social pressure\" and adapting the folk tales of the Ural region for children.\n\nThe tales have been a popular subject for analysis. During Soviet times, every edition of \"The Malachite Box\" had a foreword written by a famous writer or scholar, commenting on the creativity of the Ural miners, cruel landlords, social oppression and the \"great workers unbroken by the centuries of slavery\". The critics claimed that the author's purpose was to \"glorify\" the working class. Sergey Narovchatov in the 1979 article said that \"the Ural worker in Bazhov's stories, who represents Russian proletariat, rises up in all his giant stature. It is mighty, talented, creatively gifted\". After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, with the change of the public's ideology, the stories were regarded as Bazhov's way to run away from the \"harsh reality of Soviet period\". The scholars changed their focus to other issues, such as beauty and ugliness, life and death, order and chaos, eroticism, the relationship of people with nature and the Mountain, the mysterious in general, the place of the person in the world. Lidiya Slobozhaninova summarizes that some parts of \"The Malachite Box\" \"become outdated, but others gain new meaning\".\n\nThe stories from the collection inspired numerous adaptations, including films, radio and stage adaptations.\n\nThe Soviet poet Demyan Bedny was so impressed with the tales that he decided to adapt them into poetry. He began the work on 27 June 1939 and adapted the 14 original stories by 1 October 1939. He titled the manuscript \"Gornaya poroda\" (, lit. \"Rock\"). Bedny made some changes to the length of some scenes, changed the character names, the endings, the dialogues, and the titles of several stories, e.g. \"The Great Snake\" was called \"Brothers\", \"The Manager's Boot-Soles\" was called \"As Deserved\". He started to prepare it for publication, but his plans were hindered when he saw Bazhov's new stories. Bedny was not happy with them and abandoned the book. It was published after his death in 1959, and is not well known now.\n\nOn 10 May 1939 the art committee under the Council of People's Commissars decided to organize a parade of all children's theatres, and Bazhov was asked to write a play based on \"The Malachite Box\". They play was finished on 11 August and was performed at the Sverdlovsk Youth Theatre the same year. Following the success of the play, the Sverdlovsk Youth Theatre staged children's plays \"Yermak's Swans\" in 1942 and \"Silver Hoof\" in 1947, both written by the Soviet playwright Evgeny Permyak. The Moscow Puppet Theater staged a 1947 play \"Tales from the Urals\" () by Klavdiya Filippova, based on \"Sinyushka's Well\" and \"Golden Hair\". Filippova then combined \"The Great Snake\" and \"The Snake Trail\" to create \"Poloz's Daughter\" () and \"The Stone Flower\" with \"The Master Craftsman\" to create the children's play \"The Stone Flower\". All these plays were published in the 1949 collection \"Plays for Children's Theatre Based on Bazhov's Stories\" was published in Sverdlovsk. The storied that were considered difficult for a young reader were even more simplified as their stage adaptations, e.g. the sad ending of \"Sinyushka's Well\" was changed to a happy one, and Pavel Bazhov was not opposed to the changes.\n\nIn 1941 Alexander Fridlender composed the ballet \"The Mountain Fairy Tale\" (), based on \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\". Based on \"Marko's Hill\", Klara Katsman created the operetta \"Mark Beregovik\" (), which premiered in Sverdlovsk in 1955. Lyubov Nikolskaya composed the children's opera \"Silver Hoof\" based on the story of the same name in 1959. Vladimir Goryachikh composed the ballet \"The Living Stone\" () based on \"Sinyushka's Well\", which premiered in Nizhny Tagil in 1965. The 1973 opera \"The Fire Maid\" (based on \"The Fire-Fairy\") for schools was composed by Robert Long, with story adapted and lyrics by Dorothy Gulliver The 2012 opera \"The Malachite Casket\", based on \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\" and \"The Malachite Casket\", was created by Dmitry Batin.\n\nTwo filmstrips were released, \"The Fire-Fairy\" (1956) and \"The Malachite Box\" (1972).\n\n\"The Stone Flower\" was adapted for stage many times. The first ballet of the same name was created by Alexander Fridlender in 1944. The opera in four acts \"The Stone Flower\" by Kirill Molchanov premiered on 10 December 1950 in Moscow at the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre. Sergey Severtsev wrote the Russian language libretto. It was the first opera of Molchanov. The role of Danila (tenor) was sung by Mechislav Shchavinsky, Larisa Adveyeva sung the Mistress of the Copper Mountain (mezzo-soprano), Dina Potapovskaya sung Katya (coloratura soprano).\n\nThe 1954 ballet \"The Tale of the Stone Flower\" was created by Sergei Prokofiev. \"Skazy\", also called \"The Stone Flower\", was the 1987 play of the Maly Theatre.\n\nA lot of Soviet and Russian composers drew inspiration from \"The Malachite Box\". The suite \"Skazy\" was created by Grigory Frid in 1948. Alexey Muravlev based his symphonic poem \"Mount Azov\" (1949) on the tale \"Beloved Name\". In 1979 Margarita Kesareva created a series of piano pieces \"Ural Book\" (Уральская тетрадь), which included the movement \"The Bear Stone\" () inspired by \"Yermak's Swans\". In 2006 \"Sinyushka's Well\" was adapted into the musical for Russian folk instruments orchestra by Svetlana Nesterova.\n\n\nA docufiction feature film \"Tales of the Ural Mountains\" (), released by Sverdlovsk Film Studio in 1968, combined information about Bazhov's works with acted scenes from \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\", \"The Stone Flower\", \"The Master Craftsman\", \"The Fire-Fairy\", \"The Twisted Roll\", \"That Spark of Life\".\n\nThe animated film series based on the stories from \"The Malachite Box\" was made at Sverdlovsk Film Studio from the early 1970s to early 1980s, on time for the 100th anniversary since the birth of Pavel Bazhov. The series included the following films: \"Sinyushka's Well\" (1973), \"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\" (1975), \"The Malachite Casket\" (1976), \"The Stone Flower\" (1977), \"Podaryonka\" (based on \"Silver Hoof\", 1978), \"Golden Hair\" (1979), and \"The Grass Hideaway\" (1982).\n\nThree hand-drawn animated films were released by Soyuzmultfilm in the 1970s: \"Silver Hoof\" in 1977 directed by Gennady Sokolsky and written by Genrikh Sapgir, \"The Master Craftsman\" in 1978 directed by Inessa Kovalevskaya, was based on \"The Stone Flower\" and \"The Master Craftsman\"; \"The Fire-Fairy\" in 1979 directed by Natalia Golovanova.\n\n"}

Commissioned by the Champlain Transportation Company, \"Ticonderoga\" was built in 1906 at the Shelburne Shipyard in Shelburne, Vermont on Lake Champlain.\n\nThe other is the \"Eureka\", built as the \"Ukiah\" for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in California, renamed after a post-World War I reconstruction, and passed on to NWP owner Southern Pacific in 1942. The \"Eureka\" remained in service until SP's ferries were discontinued in 1958, and it was donated for museum display, where it remains to this day at the Hyde St. Pier in San Francisco. Unlike the \"Ticonderoga\" however, the \"Eureka\" is still afloat.\n\n\"Ticonderoga\" measures 220 feet in length and 59 feet in beam, with a displacement of 892 tons. Her steam engine, handmade by the Fletcher Engine Company of Hoboken, New Jersey, was powered by two coal-fired boilers and could achieve a maximum speed of (14.77 knots).\n\nThe ship's crew numbered twenty-eight, including the captain, pilots, mate, deckhands, engineers, and firemen to operate the boat. The purser, stewardess, freight clerk, bartender, hall boys, cook, waiters, scullion, and mess boys attended to passengers and freight arrangements.\n\nInitially, \"Ticonderoga\" served a north-south route on Lake Champlain. Daily, she docked at Westport, New York, where she met the New York City evening train. The next morning she carried travelers and freight northward to St. Albans, Vermont. In addition to passengers, \"Ticonderoga\" transported local farm produce, livestock, and dry goods on a regular basis, and during both world wars ferried U.S. troops between Plattsburgh, New York and Burlington, Vermont. Over the years she also operated on the east-west run from Burlington to Port Kent, New York and had a brief career as a floating casino.\n\nWhen more modern ferries made her obsolete, \"Ticonderoga\" managed to persist in operation as an excursion boat for several years; however, by 1950 the steady decline in business threatened her future. Ralph Nading Hill saved \"Ticonderoga\" from the scrap heap when he persuaded Electra Havemeyer Webb to buy her for her growing museum. While the Shelburne Museum attempted to keep her in operation, the steamboat era had passed making it difficult to find qualified personnel to operate and maintain the aging vessel.\n\nIn 1954 the Shelburne Museum decided to move \"Ticonderoga\" overland to the museum grounds. At the end of the summer season the boat paddled into a newly dug, water-filled basin off Shelburne Bay and floated over a railroad carriage resting on specially laid tracks. The water was then pumped out of the basin, and \"Ticonderoga\" settled onto the railroad carriage. During the winter of 1955 \"Ticonderoga\" was hauled across highways, over a swamp, through woods and fields, and across the tracks of the Rutland Railway to reach her permanent mooring on the Shelburne Museum grounds.\n\nMuch of her interior was restored to its original grandeur. The dining room and stateroom halls retain their butternut and cherry paneling and ceilings their gold stenciling. The barbershop, captain's quarters, dining room, and promenade deck contain furniture and accessories used in the \"Ticonderoga\" and other Lake Champlain steamboats.\n\n\"Ticonderoga\" was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 under the name \"Ticonderoga\" (Side-paddle-wheel Lakeboat).\n\n\n\n"}

Its publication was begun by the Federal Topographic Bureau under Hermann Siegfried, and continued from 1870 to 1922. During this period the individual maps were drawn by different lithographers, including Walter Hauenstein, Georg Christian von Hoven and Rudolf Leuzinger. Since it is, in today's parlance, not strictly an atlas but a map series, map historians now describe it only by the expression \"Siegfried Map\".\n\nThe Siegfried Map was based on the original records that had already been created for the earlier Dufour Map. However, the Siegfried Map offered greater precision than the Dufour Map, by using a scale of 1:25,000 for the Swiss plateau, the French Prealps, the Jura Mountains and southern Ticino, and a scale of 1:50,000 for other mountain regions and the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe area covered by the former scale was initially divided into 462 pages, and the other area into 142 pages, with the two areas overlapping in places. A format of x for each page was common to both scales.\n\nAnother significant departure from the Dufour Map was the presence of contours to symbolize the relief (a granularity of for the 1:25 000 pages, and for the 1:50 000 pages). In addition, three colors were used directly for printing, whereas the Dufour Map was initially monochrome. On the Siegfried Map, the colours used were brown for the contour lines on vegetated terrain, blue for water and contour lines on glaciers, and black for the rest.\n\nThe Siegfried Map projection was a cone equivalent, as for the Dufour Map.\n\nThe print mode used for the 1:25,000 pages was initially intaglio, and from 1905 a printing plate. The 1:50,000 pages were printed via a lithography process, and from 1910 by intaglio.\n\nUntil 1949, there were occasional revised editions of Siegfried Map pages. From 1952, the Siegfried and Dufour Maps were replaced by the new National Map of Switzerland.\n\n"}
{"id": "42586013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42586013", "title": "Women in positions of power", "text": "Women in positions of power\n\nWomen in positions of power are women who hold an occupation that gives them great authority, influence, and/or responsibility. Historically, power has been distributed among the sexes disparately. Power and powerful positions have most often been associated with men as opposed to women. As gender equality increases, women hold more and more powerful positions, due to policy and social reform.\n\nAccurate and proportional representation of women in social systems has been shown to be important to long-lasting success of the system. Additionally, a study shows that “absence is not merely a sign of disadvantage and disenfranchisement, but the exclusion of women from positions of power also compounds gender stereotypes and retards the pace of equalization\".\n\nOccupational power refers to power over coworkers in the field. Positions of power can exist in almost any setting, from small scale, unofficial groups or clubs, all the way to the obvious leaders of nations or CEOs of companies. These more official situations are found in many areas, such as government, industry and business, science and academia, the media, and many other sectors.\n\nPositions of power and gender are very intertwined. As one study pointed out, “Power differences frequently underlie what appear to be gender differences in behavior; as society is currently configured, power and gender are never independent\". As such, gender relates to power in the different ways power is acquired, used, and manifested. A 1988 journal article summarizes this relation between gender and power: \"the idea that women and men differ in power motivation is reinforced by history and culture. In the history of the west, certainly, women have had less access to most forms of power than have men. Many people believe that men are interested in power and getting power while women are not. Others hold that men and women differ in the ways that they establish, maintain and express power\". Additionally, studies have shown that increasing women’s participation in leadership positions decreases corruption, as “women are less involved in bribery, and are less likely to condone bribe taking”. A study on gender and corruption from 2000 also found that “cross-country data show that corruption is less severe where women hold a larger share of parliamentary seats and senior positions in the government bureaucracy, and comprise a larger share of the labor force”.\n\nIn addition to the male-female split in the distribution of positions of power, many other factors play a role in who has power. Race, class, sexuality, age, and other factors all play a significant part in who is in control. These factors play in especially when coupled with the gender difference: research from the Journal of the National Association of Social Workers has found that the “double burden of racism and sexism exacts a toll on their mental health and restricts their opportunities”. Additionally, according to another study, \"the degree to which a system successfully includes women can indicate a propensity for the system to include other disenfranchised minorities\".\n\nTraditional roles for men and women in most cultures have relegated women to working in the home primarily. This traditional role of fostering and nurturing others ensued from various sources, but the results are a decrease in the value of work done by women and a decreased ability to work outside the home. This is paired with the societal expectation of the woman to take care of the home and family, and with that the lack of male support in the caretaking of the home. This all leads to the expectation that women have responsibilities in the home and often plays a part in occupational sexism.\n\nOther traditional views of women relegate them to certain occupations. The view of women as caretakers of the family extends beyond the familial unit to others. Women have traditionally been seen as caretakers, of both people and other beings and things However, this caretaker occupation has most often been a subordinate one, under the direction of a superior, usually a man. The example of the vastly female-dominated nurse occupation, 95% women as of the 2000s, reflects this, as it is the doctors that ultimately are in charge and have the power in the nurse-doctor relationship.\n\nTraditional stereotypes of women make them out to be much more emotional and irrational than men, and thus less suited for many important jobs. However, it has been found that while there is some basis to the stereotype, it does not hold true universally under statistical scrutiny. One survey based in South Africa found that \"over 30 per cent ... are of the opinion that women are too emotional to be able to handle high level leadership positions\"; evidently, stereotypes persist and still take effect.\n\nStudies show that \"it is common for stereotypical ideas about women's abilities to perform well in leadership positions to inform people's perceptions about women leaders\".\n\nFor many years and in most regions of the globe, politics had not allowed women to play a significant role in government. Even in the early 1900s, politics were viewed almost exclusively as the domain of men. However, women’s movements and culture-changing events such as World War II gradually increased women’s rights and roles in politics. Many factors go into the degree of female participation in governments across the world. One 1999 study found: \"[the] electoral system structure, left party government, the timing of women's suffrage, the share of women in professional occupations, and cultural attitudes toward the role of women in politics each play a role in accounting for variation in the degree of gender inequality in political representation around the world”. Even still, there are many other factors that play a serious role in female participation in government. There is a significant “perceived liability” to a party of having a female candidate for office, according to a 2005 study. Even today, no country in the world has 50% or higher female participation in a national legislature, and 73% of countries have less than 20% female participation.\n\nThere are multiple levels of power positions in the government from the local level to the national level. Accordingly, there are different degrees to which women partake in these different levels. For example, studies have found in India that \"large scale membership of women in local councils\" can be more effective in exerting influence, such as over crime rates, than \"their presence in higher level leadership positions\". However, it is important to have women at all levels of government to ensure the representation as well as enacting of women's interests.\n\nWomen were deprived of exercising political power in every country until granted the right to vote. After earning the right to vote, it often took decades for women to turn out to the polls in numbers proportional to their male counterparts. In the U.S. today, women are statistically more likely to vote than men, a pattern that occurs in certain countries, such as Scandinavian countries, while the opposite occurs in others, such as India. Scandinavian countries are also some of the countries with greatest female representation in government positions. Exercising the right to vote is a reflection of the power women feel they have in their political systems.\n\nToday, women are enfranchised in all countries with a legislature other than Saudi Arabia. A 2006 study demonstrated that “although women have the legal right to vote and stand for elections in almost every country of the world, cultural barriers to women’s use of their political rights, including family resistance and illiteracy, remain”.\n\nMany countries have instituted quotas dictating a minimum number of women to be given elected positions in governments. In general, the quota system has acted as a fast-track to incorporating greater female representation into the governing systems. Several countries, such as Rwanda, which have established quota systems successfully have even recently surpassed traditionally highly gender representative countries based on the quota requirements. However, there are still flaws to quota systems and there is some controversy over the effectiveness of representation, as some studies have found actual policy change to be limited.\n\nInternational bodies such as the UN have established goals for female representation in governing bodies. Thirty percent of elected position seats was recommended as the critical mass necessary to gain effective policy from female representation. However, even these international bodies that promote female empowerment on many scales themselves lack proportional gender representation. On Wikipedia’s List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations, of the 192 representatives, only 32 are women, which is only 16.67% female, barely over half of what they recommend for governing bodies. Additionally, of these 32 countries represented by women, only three, the United States, Singapore, and Luxembourg, are considered core countries, making women-represented core countries only an even smaller percentage.\n\nMost top and high-power positions in businesses and companies are held by men. Women currently hold 4.4 percent of Fortune 500 CEO roles and 4.4 percent of Fortune 1000 CEO roles. Research has shown “a consistent difference favoring men in accessibility to, and utility of, resources for power”. Thus, business and industry worldwide still sees a harsh split between the genders in terms of who has control.\n\nHowever, having women in leadership positions can be in the company’s best interests. Studies have found that gender diversity in top-level boards means broader perspectives and opinions, which result in more comprehensive outcomes. A study on firms in Denmark found that “the proportion of women in top management jobs tends to have positive effects on firm performance, even after controlling for numerous characteristics of the firm and direction of causality”. Additionally, a 2004 study from Bottom Line found that: “Companies with the highest representation of women on their top management teams experienced better financial performance than companies with the lowest women’s representation”.\n\nIn order to try to achieve greater gender equality in workplace leadership positions, the European Union established a goal to have 40% women in non-executive board-member positions in publicly listed companies by 2020.\n\nDuring the 1980s, many pushed for pay equality for women. Unfortunately, this did not lead to greater employment of women in higher roles. New tactics need to be enacted in order to give employers incentives to hire more women, specifically for management and executive roles. “Women make up less than 5% of CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, hold less than 25% of management roles, and just less than 19% of board roles globally.” While CEOs of companies are working toward creating more female employees as leaders, the root of the problem is often not addressed. Discrepancies often occur between qualities of leaders and qualities of women as leaders. Once women are respected and given credibility in the workplace, they will have the ability to occupy higher positions. “A significant body of research shows that for women, the subtle gender bias that persists in organizations and in society disrupts the learning cycle at the heart of becoming a leader.” Once this bias is rectified, women will be able to gain leadership positions in their companies and/or organizations.\n\nIn the workplace, both in the public and private sector, the opportunities available to women are trumped by a glass ceiling. The glass ceiling is a phenomenon in which women in the workplace, climb the corporate ladder through with qualifications equal to those of their male counterparts only to find that they cannot proceed past a certain point due to gender stereotypes and their implications. These gender stereotypes create barriers for women trying to reach positions of power which is responsible for creating and influencing the glass ceiling effect. The glass ceiling most directly affects those women who spend many years working in an industry to build up achievements and a status of credibility in order to be considered for positions of power within the company or industry. Yet despite their competence, women are not offered top CEO positions because of their sex and existing stereotypes that say that women are not cut out to head such big responsibilities. However, when these women's achievements are ignored and their success halted because of ignorant stereotypes, they are not the only ones affected. Many young women entering the workforce often look up to these driven women and aspire to achieve many of the same dreams. Yet when these young women witness their mentors and idols failing to achieve their dreams because of gender inequality, a culture begins to develop amongst women where they do not feel worthy of power and struggle with self empowerment. This is an immense reason why a lot of women do not chase after positions of power because of a lack of self-worth brought on by gender stereotypes and inequalities.\n\nThe glass ceiling is continuing to effect women today, but with forced attention on gender equality, women will be able to break through this invisible ceiling and effect change in the corporate world. While companies are shifting toward greater gender diversity in the workplace, it is still necessary to identify and rectify why women are not gaining leadership positions, even though equal pay for equal work exists. Evidence shows that organizations who play an active management role in diversity in the workplace have positive results. Active management in diversity has led to pay equity, more flexible schedules, and equal access to advancement opportunity. Using innovation in the workplace and installing unconventional programs has landed success in employing more women.\n\nIn academia as well, much remains to be accomplished in terms of gender equality. Many departments, especially those in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, are heavily male-dominated.\n\nWomen achieve disproportionately less prestige and success in academia than their male counterparts. They are less likely to be tenured and to receive promotions to more influential or powerful positions. Women in academia also earn a lower income, on average, than their male counterparts, even when adjusted. While hiring of women in academic fields has been on a slight rise, it is mainly in entry-level occupations and not for high-level positions where women are most lacking. Integrating women more thoroughly into academia may be important to developing future gender equality as well as greater research outcomes. Highly disproportionate prestige and success outcomes in fields that are seen as being male-dominated may be a consequence of gender socialization that funnel women into specific fields, otherwise known as \"care\" fields, such as teaching. Other possible explanations include \"overt and subtle sex discrimination, differential interests and preferences for teaching rather than research, lack of sponsorship and collegial networks, and others suggesting accumulative disadvantage in the structure of the occupational career.\"\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, after extensive research, the key barrier for why women either are not advancing in their careers or are not being viewed as competitors for top positions in companies is because there are “many interruptions related to motherhood that may make it harder for women”. Forbes provides scenarios that even if women have full-time jobs, they are still the one responsible for any family dilemmas rather than men. David White argues that men during the 1960s, as implemented in his study, “being the sole provider for the family gave men a significant amount of power in their homes and contributed to feelings of male superiority”. Economics research states that culture can “transmit values and norms that last for centuries and even millennia” and they have “nothing to substantiate them except handed-down beliefs”. This research indicates that one reason women are not advancing in top positions in businesses is because of gender norms that have perpetuated into the 20th century.\n\nMost countries in Africa leave women without easy avenues to powerful positions in any area. However, there are some exceptions, such as Rwanda. Rwanda, with their new constitution after the conclusion of the Rwandan Civil War, it was written in that 30% of policy-making positions must be allocated to women. In 2003 with the first election of the new constitution, Rwanda surpassed Sweden to be the country with the highest percentage of women in its parliament with 48.8%.\n\nNorway, Sweden, Finland, and other countries in Scandinavia have had long-established parliaments and have gone through a long, slow process of integrating women into power positions. As a result, Sweden is the country with the second highest rate of female participation in government, behind Rwanda.\n\nThe Middle East is home to some of the most female-oppressive countries, such as Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed to vote. However, some countries, especially more liberal ones such as the United Arab Emirates, many women are making progress toward greater power.\n\nIn terms of leadership ratios, Latin America is one of the most progressive regions in the world when it comes to electing women. One fourth of the legislators in Latin America are women; a higher ratio can only be found in Scandinavia. Latin America also has “more female heads of state than any other area of the world.\" The prime example of integration of women into powerful positions in Latin America is Argentina, the first country in the world to adopt a quota system, requiring 15% female participation in the electoral system in 1990.[17]\n\nThe presence of women in Argentine government can also be attributed to the Peronist Feminist Party, instituted by Juan Perón and led by his wife Eva. Following the campaigns of this party, 90% of Argentine woman participated in the 1951 election, and seven women won positions in office. \n\nHowever, women have not only been elected to small positions. The previous president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, is one example. She served as president from 2006 to 2010, and was re-elected in 2013. During that three-year intermission, she became the first executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. During her presidency, she has championed women’s health and other rights and instituted several reforms to address these issues. Her presidency marked a change in the politics of Chile, as well as Latin America as a whole. \n\nOther historical examples of female heads of state include Isabel Perón (Argentina, 1974-6), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua, 1990-7), Mireya Moscoso de Arias (Panama, 1999-2004), Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Argentina, 2007-2015), Laura Chinchilla (Costa Rica, 2010-14), and Dilma Rousseff (Brazil, 2011-2016). Despite the high numbers of female politicians, little progress has been made on issues such as gender-based income inequality. \n\nOne of the highly significant things and provisions introduced by the new Companies Act of India, is the mandatory inclusion of at least one woman director to the Board of every prescribed class of companies in India. This provision can be considered as revolutionary initiation by the Government of India, for the purposes of empowerment of the women in the Indian Corporate world thereby strengthening and promoting contributions of women to the economic progress of the country.\n\n"}
