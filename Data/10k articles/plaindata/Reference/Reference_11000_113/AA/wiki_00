It is located on the northwestern side of the island, near Tower No. 3, beyond the Morgue and Recreation Yard. The water tank is situated on six cross-braced steel legs submerged in concrete foundations.\n\nAs Alcatraz had no water supply of its own, it had to import it from the mainland, brought by tug and barge. During the island's military years, it was stored in ground tanks and cisterns situated on the roof of the citadel. The water tower was built in 1940–41 by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, after the island received a government renovations grant to supply the majority of the island's fresh water.\n\nIt is the tallest building on the island, at a height of with a volume of of fresh water. It was used to store potable water for drinking, water for firefighting, and water for the island's service laundry facility. During the Occupation of Alcatraz, the water tower was subject to heavy graffiti by the Native Americans and has since become a cultural landmark. Graffiti included \"free Indian land -- Indians welcome.\"\n\nThe tower has been empty since 1963 and has deteriorated, eroded by the salt air and wind. From November 2011 through April 2012, the tower was given a US$1.1 million restoration to prevent \"irreparable damage and loss of important historic resources\". Steel components were replaced and the tower was seismically upgraded. The lead paint was sanded and the tower repainted with marine paint.\n"}

It serves as a valuable handbook on oceanography and meteorology, and contains useful tables and a maritime glossary. In 1867 the copyright and plates were bought by the Hydrographic Office of the United States Navy, and as a U.S. Government publication, it is now available free online. It is considered one of America's nautical institutions.\n\nThe most popular navigational text of the late 18th century was \"The New Practical Navigator\" by John Hamilton Moore of the Royal Navy, first published in 1772. To have exact tables to work from, Bowditch recomputed all of Moore's tables, and rearranged and expanded the work. He contacted the US publisher of the work, Edmund March Blunt, who asked him to correct and revise the third edition on his fifth voyage. The task was so extensive that Bowditch decided to write his own book, and to \"put down in the book nothing I can't teach the crew.\" On that trip, it is said that every man of the crew of 12, including the ship's cook, became competent to take and calculate lunar observations and to plot the correct position of the ship. \"The New Practical Navigator\" was published in 1799, followed by a second edition in 1800.\n\nBy 1802, when Blunt was ready to publish a third edition, Nathaniel Bowditch and others had corrected so many errors in Moore's work that Blunt decided to publish it as the first edition of a new work, \"The New American Practical Navigator\". The current edition of the \"American Practical Navigator\" traces its pedigree to that 1802 edition. Edmund M. Blunt continued to publish the book until 1833; upon his retirement, his sons, Edmund and George, assumed publication. The elder Blunt died in 1862; his son Edmund followed in 1866. The next year, 1867, George Blunt sold the copyright to the government for $25,000. The government has published \"Bowditch\" ever since. George Blunt died in 1878.\n\nNathaniel Bowditch continued to correct and revise the book until his death in 1838. Upon his death, the editorial responsibility for \"The New American Practical Navigator\" passed to his son, J. Ingersoll Bowditch. Very few significant changes were made under him. Editions from 1837 through 1880 are nearly identical in content. Ingersoll Bowditch continued editing the \"Navigator\" until George Blunt sold the copyright to the government. He outlived all of the principals involved in publishing and editing the \"Navigator\", dying in 1889.\n\nThe U.S. government has published some 52 editions since acquiring the copyright to the book that has come to be known simply by its original author’s name, \"Bowditch\". Since the government began production, the book has been known by its year of publishing, instead of by the edition number. After the first major revision, a total overhaul of the book's content completed in 1880 under the direction of Commander Philip H. Cooper, USN, the name was changed to \"American Practical Navigator\". Much of Bowditch’s original content, including his methods for clearing lunar distance observations, were dropped in 1880 (though a new method for clearing lunars remained in an appendix until the early 20th century). After numerous incremental revisions and printings in the period from 1914 to 1944, \"Bowditch\" was extensively revised between 1946 and 1958.\nThe present volume, while retaining the basic format of the 1958 version, reorganizes the subjects, deletes obsolete text, and adds new material to keep pace with the extensive changes in navigation that have taken place in the electronic age.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the \"American Practical Navigator\" incorporates extensive changes in organization, content, and format. Recent advances in navigational electronics, communications, positioning, and other technologies have transformed the way navigation is practiced at sea, and it is clear that even more changes are forthcoming. The changes to this edition of \"Bowditch\" are intended to ensure that this publication remains the premier reference work for practical marine navigation. Concerted efforts were made to return to Nathaniel Bowditch’s original intention \"to put down in the book nothing I can’t teach the crew.\" To this end, many complex formulas and equations have been eliminated, and emphasis placed on the capabilities and limitations of various navigation systems and how to use them, instead of explaining complex technical and theoretical details. This edition replaces but does not cancel former editions, which may be retained and consulted as to navigation methods not discussed herein.\nCurrent edition (as of June 2017) is Edition 53, a two-volume, all-digital version released by NGA in 2017.\n\nThe Bicentennial Edition (2002) incorporated Volume 1 and Volume 2 into a single printed volume, with the goal of putting as much useful information before the navigator as possible in the most understandable and readable format, a single, hard-bound volume. While that edition saw widespread use in civilian, military and commercial fleets, it sacrificed some data on classical celestial navigation and on advances in satellite and electronic navigation to meet the compressed requirements of the physical form factor. Twenty years later, with a resurgence in interest on celestial navigation and the large-scale adoption of electronic navigation, NGA returned Pub No. 9 to a two-volume format to encompass the expanded material. To eliminate printing costs, NGA does not intend to produce a physical version of the 2017 edition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortions of this article originated from the preface of \"The American Practical Navigator\", a document produced by the government of the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Today, it houses the \"musée d'Archéologie nationale\" (National Museum of Archaeology).\n\nThe first castle, named the \"Grand Châtelet\", was built on the site by Louis VI in around 1122. The castle was expanded by Louis IX in the 1230s.\n\nLouis IX's chapelle Saint Louis at the castle belongs to the Rayonnant phase of French Gothic architecture. A 1238 charter of Louis IX instituting a regular religious service at the chapel is the first mention of a chapel having been built at the royal castle. This was a \"Sainte Chapelle\", to house a relic of the Crown of Thorns or the True Cross. Its plan and architecture prefigure the major Sainte-Chapelle which Saint Louis built within the Palais de la Cité at Paris between 1240 and 1248. Both buildings were built by Louis's favourite architect Pierre de Montreuil, who adapted the architectural formulae invented at Saint Germain for use in Paris. A single nave ends in a chevet, with almost all the wall areas filled by tall thin glass windows, between which are large exterior buttresses. The ogives of the vault rest on columns between the bays and the column bases are placed behind a low isolated arcade. The building can thus be open and empty of all internal supports. This large number of windows is also enabled by the \"pierre armée\" technique, with metal elements built into the structure of the walls to ensure the stones' stability. The west wall is adorned by a large Gothic rose window in the \"rayonnant\" Gothic style. It was in this chapel in 1238 that Baldwin II of Constantinople presented Louis with the relic of the crown of thorns and, though they were intended for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, they were housed here until the Paris chapel was consecrated in April 1248.\n\nThe castle was burned by the Black Prince in 1346; of it, only the Gothic chapel remains from the site's medieval phase. This \"Château Vieux\" was rebuilt by Charles V in the 1360s on the old foundations.\n\nThe oldest parts of the current château were reconstructed by Francis I in 1539, and have subsequently been expanded several times. On 10 July 1547 a political rivalry came to a head in a bloody game here. Against the odds, Guy Chabot, 7th baron de Jarnac triumphed over François de Vivonne, seigneur de la Chasteigneraie, giving rise to the coup de Jarnac.\n\nHenry II built a separate new château (\"le Château Neuf\") nearby, to designs by Philibert de l'Orme. It stood at the crest of a slope, which was shaped, under the direction of Étienne du Pérac into three massive descending terraces and narrower subsidiary mediating terraces, which were linked by divided symmetrical stairs and ramps and extended a single axis that finished at the edge of the Seine; the design took many cues from the Villa Lante at Bagnaia. \"Étienne du Pérac had spent a long time in Italy, and one manifestation of his interest in gardens of this type is his well-known view of the Villa d'Este, engraved in 1573.\"\n\nThe gardens laid out at Saint-Germain-en-Laye were among a half-dozen gardens introducing the Italian garden style to France that laid the groundwork for the French formal garden. Unlike the parterres that were laid out in casual relation to existing châteaux, often on difficult sites originally selected for defensive reasons,\nthese new gardens extended the central axis of a symmetrical building façade in rigorously symmetrical axial designs of patterned parterres, gravel walks, fountains and basins, and formally planted bosquets; they began the tradition that reached its apex after 1650 in the gardens of André Le Nôtre. According to Claude Mollet's \"Théâtre des plans et jardinage\" the parterres were laid out in 1595 for Henry IV by Mollet, trained at Anet and the progenitor of a dynasty of royal gardeners. One of the parterre designs by Mollet at Saint-Germain-en-Laye was illustrated in Olivier de Serres' \"Le théâtre d'agriculture et mesnage des champs\" (1600), but the \"Château Neuf\" and the whole of its spectacular series of terraces can be fully seen in an engraving after Alexandre Francini, 1614.\nLouis XIV was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1638. One of du Pérac's retaining walls collapsed in 1660, and Louis undertook a renovation of the gardens in 1662. At his majority he established his court here in 1666, but he preferred the \"Château Vieux\": the \"Château Neuf\" was abandoned in the 1660s and demolished. From 1663 until 1682, when the king removed definitively to Versailles, the team that he inherited from the unfortunate Fouquet — Louis Le Vau, Jules Hardouin-Mansart and André Le Nôtre laboured to give the ancient pile a more suitable aspect.\n\nThe gardens were remade by André Le Nôtre from 1669 to 1673, and include a 2.4 kilometre long stone terrace which provides a view over the valley of the Seine and, in the distance, Paris.\n\nLouis XIV turned the château over to King James II of England after his exile from Britain in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. King James lived in the château for thirteen years, and his daughter Louise-Marie Stuart was born in exile here in 1692. King James lies buried in the nearby Church of Saint-Germain; his wife Mary Beatrice remained at the château until her death in 1718. Their son James left the château in 1716, ultimately settling in Rome. Many Jacobites - supporters of the exiled Stuarts - remained at the château until the French Revolution, leaving in 1793. The Jacobites often consisted of former members of the Jacobite court, and the apartments left empty in the chateau by the Jacobite court pensioners upon their death, were often passed down to their widows and children by the caretaker of the chateau, Adrien Maurice, the Duke de Noailles. The Jacobite colony at Saint-Germain was still dominant in the 1750s, when they were however treated with increasing hostility. After the death of the Duke de Noailles in 1766, who had been responsible for the continuing Jacobite dominance because of his preference to give rooms to Jacobites, the British dominance quickly decreased and more French inhabitants were given lodgings in the chateau: the last member of the Stuart court was Theresa O'Connel, who died in 1778. The last descendants of the British Jacobites, by then mostly bearing French names, were evicted when the building was confiscated by the government during the French revolution in 1793.\n\nIn the 19th century, Napoleon I established his cavalry officers' training school here. Napoleon III initiated restoration of the castle by Eugène Millet, starting in 1862.\nIt became the \"Musée des Antiquités Nationales\" (National Museum of Antiquities) in 1867, displaying the archeological objects of France.\nAuguste Lafollye took over responsibility for the restoration on Millet's death in 1879, continuing until 1889.\nHis goal, and that of his successor Honoré Daumet, was to restore the French Renaissance style of Francis I.\n\nOn September 10, 1919 the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, ending hostilities between the Allies of World War I and Austria, was signed at the château.\n\nDuring the German occupation (1940–44), the château served as the headquarters of the German Army in France.\n\nThe museum was renamed the \"Musée d'Archéologie Nationale\" in 2005. Its collections include finds from Paleolithic to Merovingian times.\n\n"}

{"id": "21719883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21719883", "title": "Dispute board", "text": "Dispute board\n\nA dispute board or dispute review board (DRB) or dispute adjudication board (DAB) is a 'job-site' dispute adjudication process, typically comprising three independent and impartial persons selected by the contracting parties. The significant difference between Dispute Review Boards and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or Dispute Review Boards have had such success in recent years) is that the Dispute Review Board is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).\n\nA Dispute Board becomes a part of the project administration and thereby can influence, during the contract period, the performance of the contracting parties. It has 'real-time' value. The idea behind a standing Dispute Resolution Board is that it may be called upon early in the evolution of any dispute which cannot be resolved by the parties and be asked to publish decisions or recommendations on how the matters in issue should be settled. It is usual (but not compulsory) that an opportunity remains for the matter to be referred to arbitration or to the courts if the Dispute Review Board's decision does not find acceptance by the parties. Thus a Dispute Resolution Board may be likened to the United Kingdom's adjudication process, either under statutory-compliant contracts or under the regime established by statute itself . What a Dispute Review Board does that United Kingdom statutory adjudication does not do is to provide a regular and continuing forum for discussion of difficult or contentious matters, to identify ways forward by acting in an informal capacity and to create valuable opportunities for the parties to avoid disputes by keeping proactive communication alive. Another aspect, which is less often discussed, is that by establishing a Dispute Board from the inception of the project the Dispute Board members become part of the project team and are thought of in a different fashion and because of their \"hands on\" approach can be trusted to be fair and impartial and their advise respected and taken more readily than would a third party or stranger to the project.\n\nThe terms Dispute Board or Dispute Review Board are generic terms and include (a) the Dispute Review Board (DRB) which is a device that originated in the USA and provides non-binding recommendations); (b) the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) which is a device emerging from the earlier USA model, but which provides a decision that has interim-binding force); and (c) the Combined Dispute Board (CDB), which is a hybrid of Dispute Review Boards and Dispute Adjudication Boards which was created by the International Chamber of Commerce in 2004. Various other terms have been used such as Dispute Settlement Panel, Dispute Mediation Board, Dispute Avoidance Panel and Dispute Conciliation Panel. Fundamentally these different varieties of Dispute Review devices are the same, each providing early adjudication based on the contractual bargain between the parties.\n\nA Dispute Review Board is a creature of contract; the parties establish and empower a Dispute Review Board with jurisdiction to hear and advise on the resolution of disputes. Within the United Kingdom it is entirely possible for the contracting parties to establish a Dispute Review Board to adjudicate construction contract disputes within the statutory requirement for adjudication . As yet, there are no statutory requirements for Dispute Review Boards to be established to adjudicate disputes under construction contracts.\n\nWhile the origins of Dispute Review Boards are found in the construction industry, their ambit is far wider than construction and Dispute Review Boards are now found in the financial services industry, the Maritime Industry, long-term concession projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for Dispute Review Boards is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of Dispute Boards, as well as the Dispute Board Federation and the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation, makes it highly probable that dispute boards will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the cost of a Dispute Board will result in even the most strenuous dispute being resolved and with an almost 99% success rate of dispute resolution without the need for either costly litigation or arbitration the savings are enormous. The reason this is significant is because the construction industry has a reputation for disputes and conflict. Anecdotal evidence from Australia, as just one example, indicates that 50% of all legal cost associated with construction is expended in connection with disputes. In almost 10% of projects, between 8% and 10% of the total project cost was legal cost. Not surprisingly, these projects have a high incidence of disputes. This expenditure, which globally represents an enormous sum each year, does not begin to take into account the hidden costs of disputes; the damage to reputations and commercial relationships, the cost of time spent by executive personnel, and the cost of lost opportunities. The situation is aggravated by the increased use of joint ventures both in consulting and in contracting. Such organisations are less autonomous and perhaps less able to negotiate settlements of their contractual problems.\n"}

This can include information such as how to get a license, license renewal, road laws, driving restrictions, etc. “In the U.S. there is no central organization that is responsible for the creation of Driver’s Manuals.” (Idaho Driver’s Manual). As a result there is no set of rules for the states to create the manuals, so all driver’s manuals vary by state. However, every state does still follow general guidelines when creating the manuals.\n\nThe beginning of every manual starts with how to get a driver’s license. It informs us about what types of identification is needed, and who is eligible to apply for a license. In most states, you “must provide documentary proof of their full legal name, age, Social Security number, citizenship, or legal presence and address.” (Ohio Driver’s Manual). In all states there is a minimum age requirement for getting a driver’s permit, which later leads into receiving a full driver’s license. This age limit varies by state. “The person must also be in good general health, and can have good vision with or without glasses or contacts.”(New Jersey Driver's Manual). There is also usually a payment fee in order to receive your license. Along with getting a license, all states also offer voter registration and becoming an organ donor when applying for your license. Every state requires taking a written test to receive your driver’s permit. Every state also requires a driver’s test that you must past in order to get your license. However, only a few of the states’ manuals actually go into detail about what exactly they will test you on for the driving test. All manuals proceed to talk about the specifics of how to drive and the rules of the road. \n\nEvery manual includes a section that goes into detail about car and driver safety. All states require vehicle inspection, but only some require annual inspection. Driving while intoxicated is illegal in the United States. Almost all states have a “minimum blood alcohol level while driving of .08%” (Kentucky Driver’s Manual). For seat belts, 49 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws requiring seat belt use by at least all occupants of the front seat. New Hampshire is the only state with no such requirement for adults. However, in all states anyone under the age of 18 is required to wear a seat belt. Vehicles must always make way for emergency vehicles.\n"}

The Manifesto was authored by national syndicalist Alceste De Ambris and the futurist poet Filippo Marinetti.\n\nThe Manifesto (published in \"Il Popolo d'Italia\" on June 6, 1919) is divided into four sections, describing the movement's objectives in political, social, military and financial fields.\n\nPolitically, the Manifesto calls for:\n\nIn labor and social policy, the Manifesto calls for:\n\nIn military affairs, the Manifesto advocates:\n\nIn finance, the Manifesto advocates:\n\nThese early positions reflected in the Manifesto would later be characterized by Mussolini in the Doctrine of Fascism as \"a series of pointers, forecasts, hints which, when freed from the inevitable matrix of contingencies, were to develop in a few years time into a series of doctrinal positions entitling Fascism to rank as a political doctrine differing from all others, past or present.\"\n\nOf the Manifesto's proposals, the commitment to corporative organisation of economic interests was to be the longest lasting. Far from becoming a medium of extended democracy, parliament became by law an exclusively Fascist-picked body in 1929; being replaced by the \"chamber of corporations\" a decade later.\n\nFascism's pacifist foreign policy ceased during its first year of Italian government. In September 1923, the Corfu crisis demonstrated the regime’s willingness to use force internationally. Perhaps the greatest success of Fascist diplomacy was the Lateran Treaty of February 1929: which accepted the principle of non-interference in the affairs of the Church. This ended the 59-year-old dispute between Italy and the Papacy.\n\n"}
{"id": "294139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294139", "title": "Fish (cryptography)", "text": "Fish (cryptography)\n\nFish (sometimes FISH) was the UK's GC&CS Bletchley Park codename for any of several German teleprinter stream ciphers used during World War II. Enciphered teleprinter traffic was used between German High Command and Army Group commanders in the field, so its intelligence value (Ultra) was of the highest strategic value to the Allies. This traffic normally passed over landlines, but as German forces extended their geographic reach beyond western Europe, they had to resort to wireless transmission.\n\nBletchley Park decrypts of messages enciphered with the Enigma machines revealed that the Germans called one of their wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"Sägefisch\" (sawfish) which led British cryptographers to refer to encrypted German radiotelegraphic traffic as Fish. The code Tunny (tunafish) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic enciphered by them.\n\nIn June 1941, the British \"Y\" wireless intercept stations, as well as receiving Enigma-enciphered Morse code traffic, started to receive non-Morse traffic which was initially called NoMo. NoMo1 was a German army link between Berlin and Athens, and NoMo2 a temporary air force link between Berlin and Königsberg. The parallel Enigma-enciphered link to NoMo2, which was being read by Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"Sägefisch\" (sawfish). This led the British to use the code Fish dubbing the machine and its traffic Tunny.\n\nThe enciphering/deciphering equipment was called a \"Geheimschreiber\" (secret writer) which, like Enigma, used a symmetrical substitution alphabet. The teleprinter code used was the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2)—Murray's modification of the 5-bit Baudot code.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded Russia, during World War II, the Germans began to use a new type of enciphered transmission between central headquarters and headquarters in the field. The transmissions were known as Fish at Bletchley Park. (See Lorenz cipher, Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.) The German army used Fish for communications between the highest authorities in Berlin and the high-ranking officials of the German Army on the field. The Fish traffic which the personnel at Bletchley Park intercepted, contained discussions, orders, situation reports and many more details about the intentions of the German Army. However, these transmissions were so challenging to decrypt that even with the assistance of the high speed Colossus computer, the messages could not be read until several days later. “Vital intelligence was obtained about Hitler’s intentions in the run up to D-Day 1944.”\n\nThe NoMo1 link was initially named Tunny (for tunafish), a name which went on to be used both for the Lorenz SZ40/42 machines and for the Bletchley Park analogues of them. The NoMo1 link was subsequently renamed Codfish. A large number of Tunny links were monitored by the Y-station at Knockholt and given names of fish. Most of these were between the \"Oberkommando der Wehrmacht\" (German High Command, OKW) in Berlin and German army commands throughout occupied Europe. Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher at Bletchley Park, assisted initially by a machine called Heath Robinson and later by the Colossus computers yielded a great deal of valuable high-level intelligence.\n\nTunny decrypts provided high-grade intelligence in an unprecedented quality. Walter Jacobs, a US Army codebreaker who worked at Bletchley Park, wrote in an official report on the operation to break Tunny that in March 1945 alone 'upward of five million letters of current transmission, containing intelligence of the highest order, were deciphered'.\n\nThis was the name given to traffic encoded with the Siemens and Halske T52 \"Geheimschreiber\". In May 1940, after the German invasion of Norway, the Swedish mathematician and cryptographer Arne Beurling used traffic intercepted from telegraph lines that passed through Sweden to break this cipher. Although Bletchley Park eventually diagnosed and broke Sturgeon, the relatively low value of the intelligence gained, compared to the effort involved, meant that they did not read much of its traffic.\n\nThis was the name used for traffic enciphered on a \"Geheimschreiber\" that was probably the Siemens T43 one-time tape machine. This was used only on a few circuits, in the later stages of the war and was diagnosed at Bletchley Park, but considered to be unbreakable.\n\nIncluding both executives and cryptographers on FISH (Tunny) in the Testery.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the Head Gardener and Curator of the Plantations at the New York Botanical Garden, for whom he did field work in the Bahamas, South Florida and Haiti.\n\nGeorge Valentine Nash was born in Brooklyn, New York on May 6, 1864. He was the son of Scotto Clark Nash (1841-1920) and Alice Valentine, who were married in Brooklyn, NY on February 2, 1863. Scotto was the son of Rev. John Adams and Mary Moody (Clark) Nash, whose ancestry is traced back to Pilgrim William Brewster, who came from England on the Mayflower in 1620. Scotto and Alice also had a daughter, Mary Clark Nash.\n\nScotto, after many years as a businessman in various capacities, pursued an interest in nature by building greenhouses and growing roses. In particular, he grew the American Beauty Rose, imported from England in 1882. Assisted by George, Scotto was listed in a local Clifton, NJ directory as a \"florist\". Scotto also had an exhibit of cut roses at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago.\n\nNash added in many ways to the initial botanical training provided by his father. Starting about 1888, he made the acquaintance of botanist and collector Dr. George Thurber, editor of the \"American Agriculturalist\", who specialized in grasses. Nash picked up this same interest and eventually received a large part of Thurber's grass herbarium. Nash also studied the wild plants of New Jersey and joined the Torrey Botanical Club in 1891, where he met botanist Nathanial Lord Britton, who co-founded the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). In 1894-96 Nash helped collect botanical specimens in central Florida and studied them at Columbia College. In addition, he studied botany with Britton.\n\nNash first became employed by the New York Botanical Garden in 1896, during its preliminary organizational phase. Beginning in 1900, he was promoted to Curator of the Plantations; then in 1901 he became Head Gardener. That same year, the NYBG was invited by Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England, to visit and acquire plant species to transplant for their initial collections. Nash went on the trip. The accession he selected included over 1000 species.\n\nNash went on several other collecting and plant-exchanging trips. In late 1901, he and Dr. John K. Small connected over 1200 specimens of living plants in Florida. In 1902, Nash made a second European trip for further study and to exchange plants with several other institutions, including a return visit to Kew, and others in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Brussels, Paris, and Utrecht. Between 1903 and 1905, Nash made collecting expeditions to many islands in the Caribbean.\n\nStarting in 1906, Nash remained at the NYBG, supervising the creation and maintenance of the gardens, developing and cataloging the institution's plant collections, giving public lectures and demonstrations, and replying to inquiries about plants.\n\nStarting in 1909, Nash was Secretary of the Horticultural Society of New York. He edited its journal for a while, and helped with exhibitions.\n\nNash is the author of over 180 publications on the topic of botany and horticulture, including his annual reports, published yearly in the NYBG Bulletin. His works on diverse botanical topics include: \"Costa Rican Orchids\" (1906), \"North American Flora\" (1909), \"A revision of the family Fouquieriaceae\" (1906?), and \"A preliminary enumeration of the grasses of Porto Rico\" (1903).\n\nIn 1916, he became one of the two founding editors of the Garden's new botanical journal \"Addisonia\", along with John Hendley Barnhart.\n\n"}
{"id": "8228688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8228688", "title": "Guide to Reference", "text": "Guide to Reference\n\nGuide to Reference, published in 2008 as the online successor to \"Guide to Reference Books\", was a selective guide to the best print and online reference sources. An editorial team of reference librarians and subject experts selected and annotated some 16,000 entries, which were organized by subject. It was a subscription database, published by the American Library Association, and was updated on an ongoing basis. It was intended as a resource for libraries when answering reference questions, planning library instruction, identifying items to purchase, and training staff.\n\nThe print edition was published regularly since 1902 by the American Library Association, and had been a staple of academic reference libraries throughout the United States. However, its popularity of use had dropped in recent years with the continued rise of electronic databases.\n\nThe online product was closed down on March 31, 2016.\n\nThe Guide was written in the first decade of the twentieth century by Alice Bertha Kroeger, head of the library school at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. She developed a 104 page volume meant to educate students and professionals within the library community. Filled with short articles and indexes to other publications for further reading, Kroeger used her book to “codify both the principles of education for reference librarianship and reference librarianship’s province of expertise” (Kieft, 331). It also included a series of indexes describing and evaluating reference publications on a variety of topics and was meant to help the aspiring librarian learn about the most useful and reliable reference sources available on the market. The American Library Association published her book as \"Guide to the Study and Use of Reference Books: A Manual for Librarians, Teachers and Students\". Kroeger produced two editions, one in 1902 and a second in 1907.\nAfter Kroeger’s death in 1909 the American Library Association asked Isadore Gilbert Mudge, head of the reference department for the library at Columbia University, to take over the project. Mudge started a trend at Columbia that would last for several decades, pushing their reference staff to essentially “lead four lives-as editors, administrators, collection builders, and front-line reference specialists” (Plotnik, 130). Much of the work for the Guide was accomplished alongside the normal reference work duties of collection development and assisting students and professors with their research requests. During this time the indexes on reference materials expanded and the book went through two title changes: \"New Guide to Reference Books\" in 1923 and \"Guide to Reference Books\" in 1929.\nAfter taking the volume through three decades and four new editions, Mudge retired and passed the responsibility on to her successor at Columbia University, Constance Mabel Winchell. Winchell reorganized the book, classifying the indexes into different disciplines similar to the academic departments of a university. The indexes were greatly expanded under Winchell; when the eighth edition was published in 1967 it was quite a tome, including entries on some 7500 individual publications. \n\nWhen Eugene P. Sheehy took over as head of reference at Columbia in 1967 he took on the Guide. Having worked as Winchell’s assistant for several years Sheehy adopted her style, process of selection and organization as his own. He began issuing supplements to the Guide, with versions in 1968, 1970, and 1972. The supplements expanded on the entries of Winchell’s eighth edition, adding indexes of material newly published or newly discovered. A new ninth edition, which required Sheehy and his two assistants to update and correct entries from Winchell’s edition and add in material from their three supplements, was finally published in 1976. This ninth edition was the first version to include listings of early electronic databases. Sheehy continued editing and publishing supplements until he retired in 1986. \n\nThe editorship passed for the 10th edition supplement and the 11th edition to Robert Balay of the Association of College and Research Libraries' Choice magazine. No longer the vision of a lone individual, the Guide became an increasingly cooperative project as reference literature grew and as contributors were drawn from libraries around the country.\n\nUse of the Guide became less and less frequent as research had turned more towards electronic databases such as EBSCOhost and JSTOR. The project to develop a 12th edition of the Guide as an online database was announced in 2000 under the editorship of Robert H. Kieft, then librarian at Haverford College (now college librarian at Occidental College). This online edition was published in 2009 and continually undated. It was the first to include listings of websites and was the first to be issued in electronic form. The online Guide's last general editor was Denise Beaubien Bennett, engineering librarian at the University of Florida’s Marston Science Library.\n\nALA Publishing, in collaboration with the Guide to Reference Editorial Review Board, announced that, due to the \"current business climate\", the Guide to Reference online product had ceased taking further subscriptions and would be closed down on March 31, 2016.\n\n"}

Some provisions are applied on a personal basis, such that it applies to Israeli residents rather than territory. Application of the laws has created \"enclaves\" of Israeli law in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and the term \"Enclave law\" or \"enclave-based justice\", is used to describe the resulting legal system.\n\nIn parallel, other portions of Israeli law, including Israeli criminal law, are applied extraterritorially on a personal basis to Israelis in the West Bank.\n\nSince January 2018, all laws proposed in the Knesset are actively considered vis a vis their its application to the settlements.\n\nTerritorial aspects of \"enclave law\" are implemented via a method called \"pipelining\". Under this method, Israeli Military Orders, which constitute the primary laws in the West Bank, apply Israeli laws specifically to the jurisdictions of the Israeli settlement local councils. This method is used to give Israeli ministries, such as the Israeli Ministry of Education and Israeli Health Ministry, jurisdiction over public facilities such as schools and hospitals in the territories.\n\nAs a consequence \"enclave law\", Israeli settlers are subject to large portions of Israeli law whereas Palestinians are subject to a combination of Israeli military law and some local laws based on Jordanian law. In 1989 Eyal Benvenisti described how \"through extensive military legislation, exterritorial application of Israeli legislation and Israeli court rulings\" the border between Israel and the West Bank was no longer relevant for \"almost all legal purposes that reflect Israeli interests\", but the same was not true for the Palestinian population, especially with respect to civil rights.\n\nThe Israeli laws are applicable to Israeli citizens living in the West Bank are often administrative in nature, and include taxation, product supervision, national insurance, education, welfare, health, work, personal status, but excludes laws relating directly to the territory itself such as land and planning laws. The Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that labour laws applied in this way also apply to those Palestinian workers in Israeli settlements due to the \"significant linkages\" test and the principle of equality within the settlements.\n\nIn November 2014, a bill to require all new Israeli laws to consider their application to Israeli settlements was approved by the cabinet but opposed by Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein. In May 2016, the initiative was relaunched by Ayelet Shaked.\n\nIn December 2017, over 1,000 central committee members of Likud voted unanimously for “free construction and application of Israeli law and sovereignty in all liberated areas of settlement in Judea and Samaria”.\n\nIn January 2018, the Knesset House Committee agreed to instruct legal advisors to discuss every new Knesset bill's application to West Bank settlements during the legislative process. This was followed, a few weeks later, by the first ever Knesset deliberation of the application of proposed laws to the West Bank settlements.\n\nThe term \"Enclave Law\" was coined in 1988 by Amnon Rubinstein, an Israeli scholar of constitutional law. Rubinstein noted regarding the legal system for the West Bank, that: \nonce perceived as an 'escrow' under the rules of international law – that is as a trust – they have become a 'legal mongrel' and have gradually been incorporated in practice into the realm of Israel's rule.\n\nIn a 2009 report authored by Virginia Tilley, the South African Human Sciences Research Council wrote that \"The outcome of the extraterritorial application of Israeli legislation on a personal basis, combined with the enclave law as described above, is that a settler lives within the framework of the West Bank law only in a very partial way\". The report then quoted Rubinstein's 1986 Hebrew work:\nA resident of Ma’ale Adumim, for instance, is supposedly subject to the Military Government and to the local Jordanian law, but in fact he lives according to the laws of Israel both with respect to his personal law and with respect to the local municipality wherein he lives. The Military Government is nothing more than a symbol, through which Israeli law and governance operate.\n\nThe term has been reported by \"Haaretz\" legal analyst Moshe Gorali to be an alternative to the term \"apartheid\".\n\nThe concept and application of Israeli law in the West Bank settlements has been described numerous times in Israeli courts. Examples include a 2004 case, Yinon Food Manufacturing and Marketing Ltd v. Qaraan, with respect to a dispute between a Palestinian and their Israeli-settlement-based employer, a 2006 Supreme Court case, Peace Now S.A.L. Educational Enterprises v. Supervisor of the Jewish Settlements in Judea and Samaria, summarized by Elyakim Rubinstein, and a 2007 Supreme Court case, Kav LaOved v. Jerusalem Labor Court, summarized by Eliezer Rivlin.\n\n\n"}

A searchable database of updated archival holdings listed in the book is available in the Archive Database on the Routes to Roots Foundation website.\n\nIn 1997, in official cooperation with the Polish State Archives (Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych in Warsaw, Poland), Weiner authored and published the book, \"Jewish Roots in Poland.\" The book includes archival holdings of the Polish State Archives, the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, local town hall documents throughout Poland, Holocaust documents found in the archives of the death camps located in Auschwitz near Krakow and Majdanek near Lublin. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs. There are individual town listings for localities with more than 10,000 Jews in 1939.\n\n\"Jewish Roots in Poland\" took over ten years to complete. The book includes an inventory of 1,250 towns and over 5,000 record entries for these towns. Sources of the material were the Polish State Archives (which included 75 archives throughout Poland), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (which included 434 offices throughout Poland), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. Holocaust documents came from Majdanek Museum Archives and Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum Archives. There are over 300 color photos and over 200 black and white photos of 127 towns, 52 document examples, and 14 color maps.\n\n\"Jewish Roots in Poland\" was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Poland and the former Soviet Union that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. It is a combination of genealogical resources and Holocaust references as well as a coffee table book. The book serves the function of a scholarly reference book as a repository of gathered information, but with the many photos and postcards, it also serves as a travel book.\n\nWarren Blatt from the JewishGen Kielce-Radom Special Interest Group (SIG) described the work as a tour de force and ground-breaking, a unique and timely masterpiece. In a detailed analysis, Blatt found the book provided information that was not previously available to genealogists. Marilyn Silverman of the \"Jewish Post of New York\" said \"Jewish Roots in Poland\" is the first Polish government-sanctioned book to document the holdings of the Polish State Archives that are of interest to Jewish genealogists. She sees the experience of discovering these documents as being both painful as well as inspiring a feeling of exhilaration, tied to survival.\nIn the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, \"DOROT,\" their review called \"Jewish Roots in Poland\" Weiner's magnum opus, noting the genealogical holdings as well as the capsule town descriptions of 28 towns with large Jewish populations pre-WWII. \"The New York Times\" highlighted the book's importance as an information resource as well as the feelings of poignancy and nostalgia captured in the many images throughout the work.\n\n\"The Forward\" described how Weiner was able to organize the original archival material – which lacked a town-by-town inventory and was uncatalogued and inaccessible to genealogical purposes – into a user-friendly format, with the data becoming accessible and organized.\n\n\nNote: \"Jewish Roots in Poland\" is out of print. Miriam Weiner's non-profit Routes to Roots Foundation has made excerpts from the book available on the organization's website\n\n\n"}

The main function of Mail is sending and receiving email. It is a successor to Outlook Express, which was either included with, or released for, the Windows 9x family and older versions of the Windows NT family.\n\nWindows Mail was announced by Microsoft as the successor to Outlook Express on October 10, 2005, via its community website Channel 9. This initial version featured fundamental changes and a new user interface, but not as much in the way of new features.\n\nThe origins of Windows Mail can be traced back to a pre-release version of Outlook Express 7 included in early builds of Windows Vista, then known by its codename, \"Longhorn.\" This version of Outlook Express introduced various changes to the user interface and relied on WinFS for the management and storage of contacts and other data. While retaining support for Post Office Protocol (POP) and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) email protocols, Outlook Express 7 dropped support for HTTP, an omission inherited by Windows Mail.\n\nWindows Mail's user interface is changed to match the look and feel of Windows Vista. Some interface features were imported from Microsoft Outlook 2003, including the right-hand \"reading pane\". \"Microsoft Help Groups\" has been added, which is a preconfigured link to Microsoft's newsgroups. Some additional functionality has been layered on top of the standard newsgroup functionality to have individual threads be marked as a \"question\" or an \"answered question\". Postings may be rated as well.\n\nWindows Mail uses IPv6 if the domain name for the servers resolves to IPv6.\n\nMail messages are now stored in individual files instead of in a single database file. A transactional index database based on the Extensible Storage Engine enables real-time searching and improves the stability and the reliability of the stored data. In case of corruption, the indices can be rebuilt from the mail files. Account setup information is no longer stored in Windows Registry. It is instead stored alongside the mail itself, making it possible to copy an entire Windows Mail configuration and mail store to another machine in a single step.\n\nBayesian junk-mail filtering and top-level domain blocking and encoding blocking have been added. A phishing filter has been incorporated as well, protecting users from web sites that have been identified as being malicious.\n\nRemoved features from Windows Mail include:\n\n\nWindows Mail has a documented application programming interface (API) based on Component Object Model (COM). While its predecessor, Outlook Express, also featured an API, it was undocumented, except for Simple MAPI messaging functionality.\n\nWindows Vista only supports American English, French, German and Spanish (International Sort).\n\nWindows Mail was absent from Windows 7. During this time, Microsoft intended to spin off several Windows components into independently developed apps introduced as part of the Windows Essentials software suite. Thus, Windows Mail was omitted in favor of Windows Live Mail, which was made available for Windows XP, Vista and 7. This policy was eventually reverted and the successors of the Windows Essentials apps were gradually reintegrated into Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 components. Windows Live Mail was succeeded by Mail.\n\nMail was added to Windows 8 as one of many apps written to run full-screen or snapped, per Microsoft's Metro design language philosophy. Being a Windows Store app, Mail is included in the same app container as Calendar and People. These three cannot be uninstalled or reinstalled separately. Mail in Windows 8 comes with preset server configurations for popular email services Outlook.com, Exchange, Gmail, AOL Mail, and Yahoo! Mail. Other IMAP accounts can be configured, but it does not directly support POP. Even though this app does not run on the Windows desktop, it has multi-window support. Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features are hidden in the charms or an initially hidden toolbar at the bottom of the screen that is revealed by right-clicking. Users who have subscribed to a Microsoft account can sync all configurations of Mail across different computers.\n\nMail has preset server configurations for Outlook.com, Exchange, Gmail, iCloud, and Yahoo! Mail. AOL Mail and custom IMAP accounts can still be added, and POP support is added back. Mail and Calendar are still Windows Store apps and are in the same app container; as such they are updated together. But their third sibling, People, is moved out of this container and is a standalone app by itself. \n\nUsers can set Windows 10 Mail to use the system theme or choose a custom accent color, background image, and light/dark preference. It has multi-window support and can open email messages in a new window. Emails are listed in Mail's jumplist. Mail uses a settings panel, email sorting tools in the second pane, and a toolbar in the viewing pane. Like the Vista version of Mail, this version's important controls are readily visible. Accounts can be grouped and relabeled, and folders can be created from within the app. Most existing folders can be edited or deleted in Mail, but default folders cannot be. It is possible to use Outlook.com aliases and @mentions with Mail.\n\nLike Microsoft Outlook, Mail allows users to set up Quick Actions, such as Delete, Set Flag, and Archive, to respond to messages from system notifications and swipe gestures.\n\nMail does not have an RSS reader and the ability to customize the default type and font. Microsoft has not announced plans to add these features.\n\nLike in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, Mail uses to invoke search, contrary to all other Microsoft products that use .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52232", "title": "Mauritshuis", "text": "Mauritshuis\n\nThe Mauritshuis (; ) is an art museum in The Hague, Netherlands. The museum houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings which consists of 841 objects, mostly Dutch Golden Age paintings. The collections contains works by Johannes Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Paulus Potter, Frans Hals, Jacob van Ruisdael, Hans Holbein the Younger, and others. Originally, the 17th century building was the residence of count John Maurice of Nassau. It is now the property of the government of the Netherlands and is listed in the top 100 Dutch heritage sites.\n\nIn 1631, John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, a cousin of stadtholder Frederick Henry, bought a plot bordering the Binnenhof and the adjacent Hofvijver pond in The Hague, at that time the political centre of the Dutch Republic. On the plot, the Mauritshuis was built as a home between 1636 and 1641, during John Maurice's governorship of Dutch Brazil. The Dutch Classicist building was designed by the Dutch architects Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post. The two-storey building is strictly symmetrical and contained four apartments and a great hall. Each apartment was designed with an antechamber, a chamber, a cabinet, and a cloakroom. Originally, the building had a cupola, which was destroyed in a fire in 1704.\n\nAfter the death of Prince John Maurice in 1679, the house was owned by the Maes family, who leased the house to the Dutch government. In 1704, most of the interior of the Mauritshuis was destroyed by fire. The building was restored between 1708 and 1718.\n\nIn 1774, an art gallery open to the public was formed in what is now the Prince William V Gallery. That collection was seized by the French in 1794 and only partially recovered in 1808. The small gallery space soon proved to be too small, however, and in 1820, the Mauritshuis was bought by the Dutch state for the purpose of housing the Royal Cabinet of Paintings. In 1822, the Mauritshuis was opened to the public and housed the Royal Cabinet of Paintings and the Royal Cabinet of Rarities. In 1875, the entire museum became available for paintings.\n\nThe Mauritshuis was privatised in 1995. The foundation set up at that time took charge of both the building and the collection, which it was given on long-term loan. This building, which is the property of the state, is rented by the museum. In 2007, the museum announced its desire to expand. In 2010, the definitive design was presented. The museum would occupy a part of the nearby Sociëteit de Witte building. The two buildings would be connected via an underground tunnel, running underneath the Korte Vijverberg. The renovation started in 2012 and finished in 2014. During the renovation, about 100 of the museum's paintings were displayed in the Gemeentemuseum in the \"Highlights Mauritshuis\" exhibition. About 50 other paintings, including the \"Girl With the Pearl Earring\", were on loan to exhibitions in the United States and Japan. The museum was reopened on 27 June 2014 by King Willem-Alexander.\n\nThe collection of paintings of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange was presented to the Dutch state by his son, King William I. This collection formed the basis of the Royal Cabinet of Paintings of around 200 paintings. The collection is currently called the Royal Picture Gallery. The current collection consists of almost 800 paintings and focusses on Dutch and Flemish artists, such as Pieter Brueghel, Paulus Potter, Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jacob van Ruisdael, Johannes Vermeer, and Rogier van der Weyden. There are also works of Hans Holbein in the collection in the Mauritshuis.\n\nThe Mauritshuis was a state museum until 1995, when it became independent. The Prince William V Gallery is also managed by the organization.\n\nThe museum has a staff of around 50 people. Emilie E. S. Gordenker has been the museum director since 2008, and Victor Moussault has been the deputy director since 2007.\n\nIn the period 2005–2011, the Mauritshuis had between 205,000 and 262,000 visitors per year. In 2011, the museum was the 13th most visited museum in the Netherlands. In 2012, when the museum closed for renovation on 1 April, it received 45,981 visitors. The museum was closed all of 2013 and was reopened on 27 June 2014.\n\n"}

After six months in captivity, he attempted suicide and was subsequently relabeled as \"non-compliant\" by his captors.\n\nHe was released in 2008 after six years imprisonment, and returned to Pakistan. His government said that he would not face any criminal charges, and that he was returning to his life. On 19 August 2009, the UK arm of the legal charity Reprieve commenced legal action on behalf of Madni, seeking information from the UK government about whether Madni had been rendered through Diego Garcia.\n\nMuhammad Saad Iqbal was among the 60% of prisoners who participated in the tribunal hearings. A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee. The memo accused him of the following:\n\nThe Department of Defense published a 13 summarized transcript from his 2004 CSR Tribunal.\n\nMadni told his Tribunal that he was wearing the orange jumpsuit that non-compliant captives were made to wear because of a suicide attempt he had made on the 191st day of his detention.\nIn September 2007 the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives.\nA habeas corpus petition was filed on behalf of \" Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni\" on December 13, 2005.\nBut his dossier was not one of those the DoD published.\n\nDetainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \"enemy combatants\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention.\n\nA Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni's first\nannual Administrative Review Board on October 19, 2005.\nThe two page memo listed nine\n\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\" and zero\n\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\".\nThose factors included denunciations from unnamed informants that he claimed to be a member of al Qaida, that he plotted assassinations, that he was related to a female member of the extremist Ak Ikhwan Al Muslimoon Group in Indonesia, and that he had stated: \n\nMadni chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.\n\nMadni's preliminary meeting with his Assisting Military Officer took place on November 29, 2005. Madni said he would attend. His Assisting Military Officer described him as responsive, polite and attentive, during this meeting, but highly skeptical, based on his experience Combatant Status Review Tribunal.\n\nA Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's second\nannual Administrative Review Board on October 19, 2005.\nThe two page memo listed nine\n\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\" and two\n\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\".\n\nIn addition to the allegations listed on the earlier memos the 2006 memo stated he had visited with members of al Qaida in Jakarta, Indonesia,\nthat he met the Secretary General of the Islamic Defenders Front,\nthat he had seen weapons at the house of his new militant acquaintances, and he had been told about two failed terrorist attacks in which they had participated—an attempt to use a car bomb against the US embassy, and an attempt to attack an airliner. One factor offered as a justification for his further detention stated:\n\nA Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's\nannual Administrative Review Board on December 27, 2007.\nThe two page memo listed just four\n\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\" and two\n\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\".\n\nAll four of the factors favoring his continued detention concerned a leadership role he played in a student group, the Sipah-e-Islam Pakistan, which was an adjunct to a violent anti-Shi'a group, the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. The factors stated these two groups followed the Deobandi School, and were created in reaction to the Iranian revolution, and that the SSP group was behind the assassination of the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan in the early 1990s. More recently the groups organized political rallies.\n\nThe factors favoring his release or transfer stated that he feared being returned to Pakistan, and that:\n\nEarlier allegations that he personally was involved in hostile acts were all dropped in this memo.\n\nOne January 9, 2009, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to Gordon R. England, the Designated Civilian Official.\nThe Board's recommendation was unanimous\nThe Board's recommendation was redacted.\nEngland authorized his continued detention on March 17, 2008.\n\nA writ of habeas corpus was filed on Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni's behalf.\n\nThe Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.\n\nOn June 12, 2008 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.\nThe judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of \"enemy combatant\".\n\nOn 15 July 2008 Kristine A. Huskey filed a \"NOTICE OF PETITIONERS' REQUEST FOR 30-DAYS NOTICE OF TRANSFER\" on behalf of several dozen captives including Iqbal.\n\nA former Guantanamo captive named as \"Qari Saad Madni\" was repatriated on September 8, 2008.\nPakistani officials stated he would soon be released without charge, following a debriefing.\nThe \"Associated Press\" reported that Madni claimed he had tried to commit suicide during his first year in detention.\n\nOn September 19, 2008 Richard L. Cys, James P. Walsh filed \"Petitioner Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni's response to court order to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed as moot\", as part of 05-CV-2385, on behalf of Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni.\nMadni's lawyers argued his habeas petition should not be dismissed because he was entitled to continue to seek relief if his original detention was not legally justified. Further, his lawyer had not been advised of the conditions agreed upon by the US Government and the Pakistani Government:\n\nOn 5 January 2009 the \"New York Times\" published a profile of Mohammed Saad Iqbal.\nThe profile chronicled serious health problems during and after his repatriation, and was illustrated with a picture of him standing in a walker. The New York Times reported that senior US officials were prepared to confirm aspects of his account of himself—off the record.\nThey informed the New York Times that, shortly after he had apprehended in Jakarta, during his first two days of interrogation analysts had decided he was a braggart and \"wannabe\" and should be immediately released:\n\nHe was first transferred for four months to a brutal interrogation center in Egypt, where he was housed in a 4 x cell he said \"like a grave\", and subjected to electric shocks during his interrogation.\nHe was then transferred, for a year to the Bagram Theater Internment Facility.\n\nHe described harassment from other captives because he had never trained in Afghanistan.\n\nRichard L. Cys of Davis Wright Tremaine is seeking relief for his long detention without charge, and for the release of his medical records, which may document his torture claims.\n\nCIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano denied Madni had been subjected to illegal treatment:\n\nOn January 19, 2009, the \"Daily Times\" reported that Iqbal had held a press conference in Islamabad where he demanded compensation for the treatment he received.\n\nSa'd Iqbal Madani offered an affidavit in support of Ahmed Zaid Salem Zuhair's habeas corpus petition.\n\nHe declared that he and Mamdouh Habib had been sent to Egypt for interrogation. His interrogators were all Egyptians, but Americans were always present, and passed notes to the Egyptian interrogators.\nHis interrogations include electric shock, beatings, being interrogated while drugged, and being locked in a cell so small he could not sit up, or lie down.\nHe and Habib were transferred to the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, where he reported Koran desecration and brutal beatings.\nIn Bagram he was held in the same cell as Moazzam Begg and Ahmed Zaid Salem Zuhair.\nthree months of torture\n\nHe declared that as a consequence of his electric shocks to his head in Egypt he developed a life-threatening bone infection, but medical treatment was withheld because his interrogators characterized him as being uncooperative. He declared he was confined the Psychiatric wing for six months—as punishment.\n\nOn August 19, 2009, the UK arm of the legal charity Reprieve commenced legal action on behalf of Mr Madni against the UK Foreign Secretary. The litigation seeks\n\ndisclosure of material held by the Secretary of State or within his control that evidences his extraordinary rendition through Diego Garcia and that would assist him in identifying and bringing proceedings against those US (and, if applicable, UK) personnel involved in his detention, unlawful\nrendition and torture\n\n\n"}

Nowadays, they are very common in musical websites, since they offer useful statistics suitable for many applications, such as musical recommendations. There are hundreds of methods to measure the popularity of an artist, and most websites have their own measurement system. The leading systems are as follows:\n\nLast.fm is Internet's reference to musical social networks. It has a huge database, based on all the information provided by their users when they listen to music in different ways, storing all the information in their profiles.\n\nEvery week, Last.fm updates its music charts, based on all the information stored last week by the millions of users through the Audioscrobbler plug-in or the Last.fm radio. The website has many different charts, including Top Artists, Top Tracks, Top Albums, Weekly Top Artists and Weekly Top Tracks. The Top Tracks and the Top Albums of an artist are also available. In a user's profile we have his/her Top Tracks and Top Artists. All these information can be classified in different time periods, such as last week, last month, last 3 months, last 6 months, last year or overall.\n\nSince the generated music charts depend on what the users register and on the tags from their music files, Last.fm made up a system based on the listens of the users which corrects a song's tag if it differs from what most people registered. On the other hand, the system has errors, like not noticing the difference between two artists with the same name or not taking track length into consideration. Artists with many short tracks will have many more listens than artists with a few but very long ones.\n\nThe website ReverbNation also has joined the great amount of uprising musical social networks, contributing with their particular version. They developed a system to measure artists' popularity called Band Equity.\n\nBand Equity measures popularity taking into account the interaction between the artist and the fans or listeners. Any artist registered in ReverbNation is measured automatically and the score is tracked over time. Band Equity compares artists with similar styles, so their progress can be benchmarked.\n\n\nThis was in beta testing during mid-2008, but closed down in July of that year. As of 2011 the website still shows the beta trial as closed.\n\nThe BBC created its own system called Sound Index, which measured the popularity of the top 1000 artists, based on discussions taken from: Bebo, Last.fm, Google Groups, iTunes, Myspace and YouTube. The index updated every 6 hours, so it was easy to appreciate fluctuations in popularity. The more blog mentions, comments, listens, downloads or profile views an artist or track had the higher up in the Sound Index they were. The system also allowed the information to be filtered by sources, allowing an index only based on information coming from Last.fm, for example.\n\n"}

Under the Telephone Transfer Act 1911 it was taken over by the General Post Office (GPO) in 1912.\n\nThree years after the first telephone company, \"The Telephone Company (Bells Patents) Ltd.\", appeared in London (in fact it was the first in Europe), NTC was formed on 10 March 1881, as a provincial subsidiary of the United Telephone Company Limited (UTC). The NTC was initially formed to develop and operate telephone services in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Ulster and parts of Scotland, taking over UTC operations in those places.\n\nThe UTC developed other similar provincial companies throughout the British Isles between 1881 and 1885. The UTC then wished to create a new company for the amalgamation of all their associated companies. However, the government declined to issue the proposed new company with a licence to operate or to allow the transfer of an existing licence. The UTC then decided to use one of its provincial companies as a vehicle for their policy of amalgamation, starting in 1889 with the merger of the UTC with the Lancashire and Cheshire Telephone Company and the NTC. The 'National Telephone Company Limited' name being retained.\n\nIn 1886 it built an ornate red brick and terracotta building 19, Newhall Street, now grade I listed, for its Birmingham \"Central\" exchange, opened in 1887.\n\nIn 1899 it commissioned Telephone House in London's Temple Lane. The building still bears the company's NT logo and some cherubs holding what appear to be old style telephone handsets.\n\nThe amalgamation policy continued; in 1890 the NTC absorbed the Northern District Telephone Company and the South of England Telephone Company, in 1892 the Western Counties and South Wales Company and the Sheffield Telephone Exchange and Electric Light Company and in 1893 the Telephone Company of Ireland Limited. Throughout this period the NTC also took over smaller telephone companies.\n\nWith the policy of amalgamation, the NTC, under the direction of William E L Gaine as general manager and Dane Sinclair as engineer in chief, set about creating a uniform organisation over eight districts; Metropolitan, Southern, Western, Midland, North-Western, Northern, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nFollowing the Telegraph Acts of 1892 and 1896, NTC trunk lines were acquired and transferred to the Post Office between 1896-97. In 1901, the Postmaster General and the NTC signed an agreement to prevent unnecessary duplication of plant and wasteful competition in London.\n\nIn 1905, the Postmaster General and the NTC signed a further agreement for the purchase of the NTC's system on the expiry of its licence on 31 December 1911, an option for the Post Office that formed a part of the original licence agreement of 1881. On 31 December 1911 the NTC ceased to formally trade. The Postmaster General took over the NTC and its telephone systems and the NTC passed into liquidation.\nThe National Telephone Company also issued stamps in various values to enable the public to pre pay for telephone calls made from company premises.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book is one of many books on the same subject attributed to the author, such as Shaqāʾiq al-utrunj fī raqāʾiq al-ghunj.\n\nMost of the chapters of the book deal with sex education as showing various sex positions and giving advice that told by whom were considered as experts on these subjects. The other chapters contain poetry (usually happens to be short) and urban tales, mostly using explicit and vulgar words and some are attributed to well-known figures such as Abu Nuuwas, Ibn al-Rumi, Al-Asmaay and Al-Ṣafadī. Some old Arab scholars classified these kind of books as 'Ilm al-Bah (The Art of Coition). The book also has some chapters where there're tales about homosexuals and eunuchs, but in most occasions the author tries to go on the mainstream preferences of adult men at the time.\n\nRegarding the sensitive and explicit subjects mentioned in the book, most modern Islamic scholars condemn and believe it is impossible to accredit the manuscript to Al-Suyuti, who is considered one of the most important figures in Sunni Islam literature. Some claim the attribution of the book is forged, and it was a scheme made by an anonymous writer to give the book authenticity to sell more copies. Other opinions say he may had this book written but at least he must have renounced it before he died. Though, there are some scholars who agreed to credit the book to Al-Suyuti.\n\nThe title is not mentioned in the author's own bibliography list.

Such documents are described as \"quad\" charts because they are divided into four quadrants laid out on a landscape perspective. They are typically one-page only; their succinctness facilitates rapid decision-making. Though shorter, quad charts often serve in a similar capacity to white papers and the two documents are often requested alongside one another.\n\nQuad charts as a genre were developed by the United States Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an attempt to improve budgeting and planning systems, and became widely used in the Administration's National Weather Service. The genre's development was parallel to that of display boards, also an early tool used by the NWS for staff communication.\n\nIn the early 2000s, software was developed to allow automated creation of quad charts as a means of saving time for technical writers who would otherwise spend long periods of time drafting them.\n\nBoth government agencies and large businesses often require submission of a quad chart on the part of potential contractors as part of the contract bidding process. NASA, for example, uses quad charts to document the process of all Small Business Innovation Research projects. Because decision makers often review a large volume of both solicited and unsolicited proposals, the quad chart may be the only submission from a potential contractor which the decision maker actually reads.\n\nDue to the nature of quad charts as relatively short documents, there are opportunities for misuse. While quad charts are intended for brief overviews of a topic, they can also be misconstrued to influence public policy and budgeting decisions, as was the case with the politicization of the National Defense Strategy's 2005 edition.\n\nWhile there are no industry-wide standards for quad charts, there are a number of common elements. In addition to the title of the invention or idea and the name of the developer, the technical approach and the need which the invention or idea addresses are often included. Decision makers often look to operational needs first, though including the cost and projected schedule are also often required elements.\n\n"}
{"id": "12720638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12720638", "title": "Ram Khamhaeng Inscription", "text": "Ram Khamhaeng Inscription\n\nThe Ram Khamhaeng Inscription, formally known as Sukhothai Inscription No. 1, is a stone stele bearing inscriptions which have traditionally been regarded as the earliest example of the Thai script. Discovered in 1833 by King Mongkut (Rama IV), it was eventually deciphered and dated to 1292. The text gives, among other things, a description of the Sukhothai Kingdom during the time of King Ram Khamhaeng, to whom it is usually attributed. The inscription had immense influence over the development of Thai historiography from the early 20th century, which came to regard Sukhothai as the first Thai kingdom.\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 1990s, assertions that the stele was a forgery from a later date led to intense scholarly debate, which has not been definitely settled, though the majority of academics today regard it as at least partly authentic. The inscription is widely regarded as the single most important document in Thai history, and was inscribed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2003.\n\nThe stele is in the shape of a four-sided pillar, mostly square and wide on each side, with a rounded pyramidal top. It is made of siltstone; the upper section which bears the inscriptions is polished, while the lower part, which probably fitted into a base, remains rough. It is in total height.\n\nThe stele was discovered in 1833 by Prince Mongkut, who would later become King in 1851 and was at the time ordained as a monk. Mongkut had made a pilgrimage to the ancient town of Sukhothai, where among the ruins of the old palace he discovered the stele, as well as a carved stone slab believed to be the throne of the Sukhothai ruler. He had his retinue bring the objects back to Bangkok, and they were placed in Wat Samo Rai (now named Wat Rachathiwat) where he was residing. The inscription followed Mongkut to Wat Bowonniwet in 1836, and was later moved to the Grand Palace's Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall in 1911. It was again moved to the Vajirayana Library in 1924, and was finally acquired by the Bangkok National Museum in 1968, where it is currently on permanent exhibition.\n\nMongkut made initial studies of the inscription, and in 1836 established a commission, headed by monk-Prince Roek (who would later become Supreme Patriarch and hold the title Pavares Variyalongkorn), to handle its deciphering. In 1855, Mongkut (now king) presented a lithographic copy of the inscription, with annotations giving partial translations and a letter explaining its significance, to the British envoy John Bowring, and another copy was presented to the French envoy Charles de Montigny in 1856.\n\nThe first attempted translation of the text into a Western language was published by the German polymath Adolf Bastian in 1864. French missionary Père Schmitt published his translation in 1884 and 1885, with further revisions in 1895 and 1898. Also in 1898, the first Thai-language work on the inscription was published in the Vajirayana Magazine. A transliteration of the entire inscription into the modern Thai script was printed as a pamphlet for Crown Prince Vajiravudh's tour of the old Sukhothai Kingdom in 1908.\n\nIn 1909, Cornelius Beach Bradley, Professor of Rhetoric at the University of California and an expert on the Siamese language, published an English-language translation of the inscription, which was later described as \"the first reasonably satisfactory translation\" of the inscription into a Western language. An authoritative transcription and translation (into French) was later made by George Cœdès, and published in 1924. Revisions published by A.B. Griswold and Prasert na Nagara in 1971 and the National Library in 1977 improved upon Cœdès's version, and Winai Pongsripian published the most recent Thai transliteration in 2009.\n\nThe inscription contains 35 lines of text on its first and second sides, and 27 on the third and fourth. The script used is an early form of the Thai script (also known as Siamese), which differs vastly from modern Thai and bears some resemblance to ancient Khmer, from which it is considered to have been adapted. Most significantly, the script contains no above- or below-line vowel marks, a feature seen in later Sukhothai inscriptions and modern Thai, as well as earlier Indic scripts.\n\nThe text consists of three sections written continuously without distinct breaks. The first (lines 1–18 of the first side), which is written in the first person, tells the personal history of Ram Khamhaeng's early life up until his becoming ruler. The second (line 18 of the first side to line 11 of the fourth side) describes various aspects of the city of Sukhothai and its customs, including its abundance, people's freedoms, the ruler's justice, religious practices, and physical and geographical features. It ends by telling of Ram Khamhaeng's installation of a stone throne in the year 1214 of the Saka era (MS; corresponding to 1292 CE), enshrinement of relics at Si Satchanalai in MS 1207 (1285 CE) and his invention of the script in MS 1205 (1283 CE). The section refers to Ram Khamhaeng by name throughout. The third section (lines 11–27 of the fourth side) contains praise of the king and describes the reach of his kingdom. This final epilogue, which may have served as a eulogy, is written in a different hand, with some differences in spelling, indicating that it was most likely a later addition.\n\nAccording to Cœdès, the inscription was probably made to commemorate Ram Khamhaeng's installation of the stone throne in 1292, and this is the year to which it is generally dated. The inscription, which paints a picture of a plentiful kingdom ruled paternally by a benevolent king, was extremely influential in the development of Thai history. Based on works by Prince Damrong Rajanubhab during the 1910s–1920s, Sukhothai came to be regarded as the first Thai capital, a golden age during which Thai values flourished (as opposed to later Khmer-influenced Ayutthaya). This official view is taught in schools and formed the core of mainstream Thai history-writing throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn July 1987, historian Michael Vickery presented a paper titled \"The Ram Khamhaeng Inscription: A Piltdown Skull of Southeast Asian History?\" at the International Conference on Thai Studies at the Australian National University, in which he questioned the authenticity of the inscription. He made several points supporting his claim that the inscription was created at a much later date than 1292, including the script's differences from other inscriptions. His position was supported, most notably, by art historian Piriya Krairiksh, who published, in Thai in August 1988, further arguments that the stele was a forgery by Mongkut himself. The claims—shocking for the implication that most of Thai history would have to be rewritten—led to intense, often heated, scholarly debate, joined by dozens of academics both making rebuttals as well as giving support. Numerous seminars were held, and the debate continued through several publications, including a special volume (in Thai) published by \"Art & Culture (Silpa Wattanatham)\" magazine in 1988 and a compilation of English-language articles published in 1991 by the Siam Society.\n\nAlthough counter-arguments were made to address the claims, and a 1990 analysis using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy found the Ram Khamhaeng stele to be the same age (700–500 years) as four other Sukhothai inscriptions, several proponents remain convinced of the forgery theory, and the debate has not been definitely settled. Nevertheless, the inscription was successfully submitted to the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme, and was inscribed on its register in 2003.\n\nThe intense scrutiny and analysis also led to a much richer body of scholarship on the inscription, and several new theories have been proposed regarding its purpose and the exact circumstances of its creation. However, while it has been observed that \"the Thai academic world showed a refreshing open-mindedness\" in its response to the claims, the public has sometimes responded with hostility. A 2004 publication in a Thai newspaper by Piriya and British expatriate author Michael Wright (also a proponent of the forgery theory) led to angry protests in Sukhothai and threats by a politician to have them prosecuted for defaming the kings and harming national security.\n\n"}

The system was introduced in January 2008 by Thomson Reuters.\n\nThis unique identifier aims at solving the problem of author identification. In scientific literature it is common to cite name, surname, and initials of the authors of an article. Sometimes, however, there are authors with the same name, with the same initials, or the journal misspells names, resulting in several spellings for the same authors, and different authors with the same spelling.\n\nOn the ResearcherID website, authors are asked to link their ResearcherID to their own articles. In this way, they can also keep their publication list up to date and online. A comprehensive view of an author's total output can thus be given, since not all publications are indexed by Web of Science. This is particularly important for researchers in fields that predominantly use peer-reviewed conference articles (computer science) or in fields that focus on publishing books and chapters in books (humanities and disciplines in the social sciences).\n\nThe combined use of the Digital Object Identifier with the ResearcherID allows a unique association of authors and scientific articles. It can be used to link researchers with registered trials or identify colleagues and collaborators in the same field of research.\n\nResearcherID has been criticized for being commercial and proprietary, but also praised as \"an initiative addressing the common problem of author misidentification\".\n\nResearcherID enables data exchange between its database and ORCID, and vice versa.\n\n\n"}

A characteristic of reverse-DNS strings is that they are based on registered domain names, and are only reversed for sorting purposes. For example, if a company making a product called \"MyProduct\" has the registered domain name \"example.com\", they could use the reverse-DNS string \"com.example.MyProduct\" to describe it. Reverse-DNS names are a simple way of reducing name-space collisions, since any domain name is registered by only one party at a time.\n\nMost of the world follows the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting with the name of the computer and ending up with the name of the country. In the U.K. the Joint Academic Networking Team (JANET) had decided to do it the other way round before the Internet domain standard was established. Most gateway sites have ad-hockery in their mailers to handle this, but can still be confused. In particular, the address me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as could be interpreted in JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain uk) or in the standard little-endian way as one in the domain as (American Samoa) on the opposite side of the world.\nReverse-DNS first became widely used with the Java platform, and has since been used for other systems, for example, ActionScript 3 packages and Android applications.\n\nExamples of systems that use reverse-DNS are Sun Microsystems' Java platform and Apple's Uniform Type Identifier or UTI.

Extensions Directory until all extensions for Joomla! 1.5 were removed in 2013.\nThe listing still can be found in the Web Archive.\n\nAs a component for Joomla! (up to version 1.5), Sobi2 made it possible to run and manage a directory in a Joomla! website. Sobi2 has features that made it stand out from other directory components at that time. It could be used as a web directory or as a directory to physical locations, like golf courses. It has a built-in integration with Google Maps (API key from Google is required).\n\nSobi2 was built with a modular concept, where additional functionality was added via plug-ins. The Joomla extensions directory listed over 80 plug-ins for Sobi2 at that time.\n\nSobi2 is an open source directory component for Joomla! (up to version 1.5), an open-source content management system. Using Sobi2 a Joomla user can have a directory of contacts, members, distributors, manufacturers, locations, products, or whatever very quickly with little or no \"coding\" - most or all of the set-up may be done using only the configuration interface. Add data, to produce a working directory on the Joomla web site.\n\nIn 2006 Sigsiu.NET developed a Content Construction Kit for Joomla. Designed as a business directory (online business index), Sobi2 could be used for every kind of directory.\n\nSobi2 has been designed as the follower of the SOBI component but it is not based on SOBI. It has been built up new from the bottom because the table structure of SOBI was not suited for the new features implemented in Sobi2. Sobi2 is built up almost object oriented.

This is decided when setting up and managing the component.\nThe administrator of the directory site is able to create, edit or delete listings within the Sobi2 administration panel.\n\nListings within a Sobi2 directory are assigned to one or more categories. A category manager allows to create, edit and delete categories within the directory with an unlimited nesting depth.\n\nAs a complex Joomla! component, Sobi2 has different views to present its data. In an overview all directory listings are shown with their smaller description, linked to a detailed description. Other views are available (e.g. alpha, search, user listings).\n\nEspecially for directories with paid listings, but also to keep the directory up to date, Sobi2 has the possibility to associate the listings with an expiration date. Once expired, listings can be renewed.\n\nSobi2 can be used \"out of the box\" or adapted individually to the site. It provides a style sheet file (CSS) which can be edited in the administration panel, using an editor with syntax highlighting.\n\nFor advanced adaptations there are separate templates available for the different views.\n\nSobi2 sends out emails on different events (add, edit, renew, approval). Sending out an email can be set up separately for each event. The content of the emails can be defined using placeholders, separately for each event.\n\nSobi2 has integrated diagnosis systems to log occurring problems. A template parser is helpful in finding syntactical errors while developing own templates. A built-in system check detects if a server does not meet the requirements for Sobi2. A version checker checks for newer versions.\n\nAdditional Features\n\nTo enhance the functionality of Sobi2, there were more than 80 different plug-ins available and listed in the Joomla!

Census Austral. Pl., is a survey of the vascular flora of Australia prepared by Government botanist for the state of Victoria Ferdinand von Mueller and published in 1882.\n\nVon Mueller describes the development of the census in the preface of the volume as an extension of the seven volumes of the \"Flora Australiensis\" written by George Bentham. A new flora was necessary since as more areas of Australia were explored and settled, the flora of the island-continent became better collected and described. The first census increased the number of described species from the 8125 in \"Flora Australiensis\" to 8646. The book records all the known species indigenous to Australia and Norfolk Island; with records of species distribution. \n\nVon Mueller noted that by 1882 it had become difficult to distinguish some introduced species from native ones:\nThe lines of demarkation between truly indigenous and more recently immigrated plants can no longer in all cases be drawn with precision; but whereas \"Alchemilla vulgaris\" and \"Veronica serpyllifolia\" were found along with several European Carices in untrodden parts of the Australian Alps during the author's earliest explorations, \"Alchemilla arvensis\" and \"Veronica peregrina\" were at first only noticed near settlements. The occurrence of \"Arabis glabra\", \"Geum urbanum\", \"Agiimonia eupatoria\", \"Eupatorium cannabinum\", \"Cavpesium cernuum\" and some others may therefore readily be disputed as indigenous, and some questions concerning the nativity of various of our plants will probably remain for ever involved in doubts.\n\nIn 1889 an updated edition of the census was published, the \"Second Systematic Census\" increased the number of described species to 8839. Von Mueller dedicated both works to Joseph Dalton Hooker and A. P. de Candolle.\n\nThe work is of historic significance as the first Australian flora written in Australia. Following its publication, research and writing on the flora of Australia has largely been carried out in Australia. \n\n\n"}

However, what distinguishes this thesaurus from all conventional thesauri is the inclusion of what the author calls rhetorically related words, or \"powernyms\"—as opposed to merely synonymous words. According to Heehler, these powernyms allow users to more readily transform rough drafts into more eloquent improvements.\n\nIn \"Rhetorical Form and Design,\" Heehler serves up 17 lessons from such writers and speakers as T.S.

{"id": "46913718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46913718", "title": "The Wrestlers (Etty)", "text": "The Wrestlers (Etty)\n\nThe Wrestlers is an oil painting on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and currently in the York Art Gallery, in York, England. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, it is likely that it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.\n\nThe Royal Academy had moved to new premises in Trafalgar Square in 1837, and the studio used by the life class was cramped and hot, a fact thought to account for the sweatiness of the central figures. Etty was best known for his painting of nude or near-nude women in historical and mythological settings but had also painted men involved in various forms of combat.\n\nIn the period in which \"The Wrestlers\" was painted, sports were becoming increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is not clear whether he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.\n\nAlthough \"The Wrestlers\" was probably exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30 guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.\n\nWilliam Etty (1787–1849), the seventh son of a York baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship in 1805 moved to London to become an artist. In January 1807 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer, and in July of that year became a student of renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, studying under him for a year.\n\nStrongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. He became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections in England, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice.\n\nEtty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his recurrent depictions of female nudity as indecent.\n\n\"The Wrestlers\" is an oil study from life, depicting a black and a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, as it was a common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.\n\nThe identity of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 \"Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest\". The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates that this is not simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.\n\"The Wrestlers\" is thought to have been painted in around 1840. It is likely that it was executed at the Royal Academy's life class; despite his senior status, Etty continued to attend there throughout his life. While students at the class usually worked from a single model, Etty would occasionally arrange for \"a Treat\", in which a group of models would be used to create an entire composition for the students to sketch (often arranged in poses derived from Old Master paintings). Painted on millboard, \"The Wrestlers\" was probably executed over the course of three evenings. On the first evening Etty would have drawn the models in chalk or charcoal and inked the outline; on the second evening the figures would have been painted in oil paint, and on the third evening a thin glaze would have been applied to the painting to which colour would then have been added.\n\nAlthough best known for his paintings of women, Etty had also produced paintings of nude or semi-nude men engaged in combat, such as 1829's \"Benaiah\". There was a tendency among British artists in this period to attempt to illustrate the physiques of strong and well-proportioned living men, as an indication that the best of British manhood had reached or surpassed the Hellenistic ideal which at that time was considered the model of perfection. Almost all artists, as part of their training, would be expected to draw from reproductions of classical statues in British museums, or to visit Italy and Greece to view the originals \"in situ\". Etty, and other British artists of the day, would have been familiar with the technical issues of drawing men wrestling, as the \"Uffizi Wrestlers\" (the \"Pancrastinae\") was one of the subjects new entrants to the Royal Academy Schools were required to draw. Etty had also made lengthy visits to France and Italy in 1816, 1822–24 and 1830 to view and sketch the paintings and statuary of those countries, with additional visits to Belgium in 1840 and 1841 to view the works of Rubens, whom he greatly admired. \n\nMoreover, as the industrial revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one kind or another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.\n\nThe motivation behind Etty's choice to pair a black and a white wrestler is not clear. Etty had painted black and Indian subjects in the past, and it was not unusual in that period for artists to use non-white models, but it was rare to show a black and a white figure embracing. It is possible that he was simply interested in the contrast between the flesh tones; it is documented that he would sometimes arrange models of different skin colours for that reason. It is also possible that he saw \"primitive\" black men as closer in spirit or physique to the wrestlers of the classical civilisations. Sarah Victoria Turner argues that combat was the only subject in which it would have been felt appropriate at the time to depict naked black and white figures in intimate closeness.\n\n1840, the year in which \"The Wrestlers\" is likely to have been painted, saw the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London and the London exhibition of \"The Slave Ship\" and \"\", and race relations had become a major social and political issue. While black wrestlers and boxers—often former slaves from the United States or their descendants—were not unusual in England in the period, and the former slave Tom Molineaux had twice challenged for the boxing world championship in 1811, they were still treated with suspicion by many members of the public.\n\nVirtually no contemporary records or reviews of \"The Wrestlers\" exist, and it was probably sold to a private collector either on its completion or in the sale of over 800 works found in Etty's studio following his death; Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty lists the painting exhibited in 1849 as \"lent by C. W. Wass\". \"The Wrestlers\" was probably exhibited at the June 1849 Royal Society of Arts retrospective of over 130 works by Etty, shortly before his death on 13 November of that year. (Etty produced three paintings entitled \"The Wrestlers\", and it is not certain which was the one exhibited in 1849, although it is thought likely to be this one.)\n\nEtty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels. Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.\n\"The Wrestlers\" was sold by a private collector on 31 October 1947. Owing to its subject matter there was little interest from commercial galleries, and it was bought by York Civic Trust for the bargain price of 30 guineas (£31.50; about £ in 2018 terms). It was immediately presented to the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting was one of five works by Etty exhibited in Tate Britain's 2002 exhibition \"Exposed: The Victorian Nude\", and was a central component of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.\n\n"}

Ninety-nine of the rooms are believed still to be in existence; the majority (68) are on display at the Art Institute of Chicago, while 20 are at the Phoenix Art Museum, nine at the Knoxville Museum of Art, and one each at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles. The Art Institute's rooms document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. Constructed on a , the rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms, and some even include original works of art.\n\nThe model rooms were the brainchild of Narcissa Niblack Thorne, who was born in 1882 in Vincennes, Indiana. During her childhood, her uncle Albert Parker Niblack, a United States Navy vice admiral, sent her many antique dollhouse miniatures from around the world. The idea for the model rooms also developed from Thorne's collection of miniature furniture and household accessories, which she began assembling around 1900, and her desire to house and display these items. A further inspiration may have been a miniature shadow box that she encountered at a bazaar in Istanbul during the 1920s.\n\nWhen she was 19, Thorne married Montgomery Ward department store heir James Ward Thorne, whose fortune would help finance her hobby. They lived together in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1930, Thorne was researching period architecture, interior design, and decorative arts to create sketches and blueprints for miniature rooms to house her dollhouse miniatures and other miniature furniture.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Thorne had access to some of the top architects, interior designers, and craftsmen in the United States, who between 1932 and 1940 created approximately 100 \"period rooms\" under her direction. In total, 99 of the rooms are believed still to be in existence. The original 30 were placed on display at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, and in 1940 they were the subject of a \"LIFE\" magazine article. Twenty of these original rooms were donated to the Phoenix Art Museum, where they remain on display.\n\nThe majority of the rooms, 68 in all, are on display at the Art Institute of Chicago, where they document European and American interiors from the late 13th century to the 1930s and the 17th century to the 1930s, respectively. The Art Institute's rooms were created by Thorne and her craftsmen between 1932 and 1940 at her studio on Oak Street on the city's Near North Side; the 31 European rooms were finished by 1937, while the 37 American rooms were completed by 1940. The rooms were gifted to the museum in 1941, and put on permanent display in 1954. The Art Institute of Chicago's rooms are among the museum's most popular permanent collections.\n\nThe Knoxville Museum of Art is home to 9 of the remaining rooms, while The Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Kaye Miniature Museum in Los Angeles have one each.\n\nSome of the Thorne rooms are miniature replicas of actual rooms. They were constructed on a , or in other words a scale of to . The rooms are largely made of the same materials as full-sized rooms; for example, they include bowls made of silver, chandeliers made of crystal, and even original works of art, both miniature paintings (by Fernand Léger, Hildreth Meière, Amédée Ozenfant, and Léopold Survage) and sculptures (by John Storrs).\n\nIn 2010, the Art Institute of Chicago began decorating a few of its rooms for Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year's, using period-appropriate decorations for each of the involved rooms. Lindsey Mican Morgan, who is responsible for the rooms at the Art Institute, began the practice of decorating the rooms for the holidays after discovering Thorne's great affection for Christmas while researching.\n\n"}

Originally the ticket was issued in Britain and later adapted by the United States, Canada, and Ireland.\n\nThe ticket of leave system was first introduced by Governor Philip Gidley King in 1801. Its principal aim was to reduce the burden on the fledgling colonial government of providing food from the government's limited stores to the convicts who were being transported from the United Kingdom to New South Wales. Convicts who seemed able to support themselves were awarded a ticket of leave. Before too long, tickets began to be given as a reward for good behaviour, which permitted the holders to seek employment within a specified district, but not leave it without the permission of the government or the district's resident magistrate. Each change of employer or district was recorded on the ticket.\n\nOriginally the ticket of leave was given without any relation to the period of the sentence a convict had already served. Some \"gentlemen convicts\" were issued with tickets on their arrival in the colony. Starting in 1811, the need to first officiate some time in servitude was established, and in 1821 Governor Brisbane introduced regulations specifying the lengths of sentences that had to be served before a convict could be considered for a ticket: four years for a seven-year sentence, six to eight years for a 14-year sentence, and 10 to 12 years for those with a life sentence. Once the full original sentence had been served, a \"certificate of freedom\" would be issued upon application.\n\nTicket-of-leave holders were permitted to marry, or to bring their families from Britain, and to acquire property, but they were not permitted to carry firearms or board a ship. Convicts who observed the conditions of the ticket of leave until the completion of one half of their sentence were entitled to a conditional pardon, which removed all restrictions except a ban on leaving the colony. Convicts who did not observe the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warrant, tried without recourse to the Supreme Court, and would forfeit their property. The ticket of leave had to be renewed annually, and those with one had to attend muster and church services.\n\nThe ticket itself was a highly detailed document, listing the place and year the convict was tried, the name of the ship in which he or she was transported, and the length of the sentence. There was also a complete physical description of the convict, along with year of birth, former occupation and \"native place\".\n\nA ticket had two components: The \"ticket proper\" was issued to the person named, and it was mandatory for the person to carry that document on their person at all times. The second component was the \"butt\", which was the official copy and was kept on file by the Government. Tickets proper are now quite rare as they were in constant use by the holder. The butts are still retained in archival records and are available for researchers.\n\nAccording to Alexander Maconochie, tickets of leave could be suspended in summary fashion for the most \"trifling irregularities,\" and a \"very large proportion\" of ticket-of-leave holders were returned to government work as a result.\n\nIn the Second World War, the \"ticket of leave\" was a colloquial name given to the papers allowing a soldier to take leave from active service.\nOn August 11, 1899, An Act to Provide for the Conditional Liberation of Convicts - the Ticket of Leave Act - was enacted by the Canadian Parliament. \n\nThe Canadian Ticket of Leave Act was based almost word for word on the British legislation. There was no reference in the text to the purpose of conditional release, though ticket of leave was generally understood to be a form of pardon.\n\nIn the beginning, the Governor General granted paroles on the advice of Cabinet as a whole. The act was later amended so that the power to advise the Governor General was limited to the Minister of Justice. This was a significant departure from traditional practice in the use of executive clemency; it was an attempt to separate parole decisions from politics. Even so, because conditional release was still in the hands of an elected minister, public opinion would still have a strong, and sometimes questionable, influence on policy.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Canada was sparsely settled. Keeping track of men on tickets of leave was difficult and the authorities relied on parolees to report every month to the police. This had its drawbacks, and when the Salvation Army offered to take over parole supervision in some places, the Department of Justice was glad to accept. Salvation Army officers acted as Dominion Parole Officers until the position was abolished in 1931.\n\nOn March 7, 1939, Bill C-34 was passed, revising the Penitentiary Act and creating an administrative board of three.\n\nWalter Crofton administered the Irish ticket of leave system.\n\n"}

It is an annual international wildlife photography competition owned by the Natural History Museum. It was known as BG Wildlife Photographer of the Year from 1990 to 2003, and briefly as Shell Wildlife Photographer of the Year, Kodak Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Prudential Wildlife Photographer of the Year. The first competition was held in 1964, with three categories and around 600 entries. In 2008 the competition received over 32,000 entries from 3100 photographers in 82 countries. There is an exhibition of the winning and commended images each year at the Natural History Museum, which later tours around the world. It is often cited as being one of the most prestigious photography competitions in the world.\n\nA book of winning entries and runners-up has been published each year since 1992, with two books being published in 1994 (the first three volumes were published the year after the corresponding competitions were held). Early volumes have become quite collectable. These portfolios are the sources of the ranking.\n\nA maximum of 25 images ranging from intimate animal portraits to atmospheric landscapes, ground-breaking photojournalism to innovative technique can be submitted once a year, in 12-17 permanent and alternate categories. Since 2003 the grand prize has been selected from among the winning images of the categories and has been awarded to a single image in adult and young competition too. The photographer aged 17 and under submitting the best image receives the title “The Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year”, while the author of the best image over 17 years of age becomes “The Wildlife Photographer of the Year”. (This award has never been won in adult category more than once.) The deadline of submission of the images is around late February, and the results become public in mid-October.\n\nThe winning images are selected from among approximately 50,000 entries received from almost 100 countries around the globe, in three rounds by a prestigious and professional jury. \nThe awards ceremony takes place in the Natural History Museum in London. On this date the latest Wildlife Photographer of the Year portfolio, introducing the winning images, comes out. \nFollowing the awards ceremony, the extremely high-quality and major Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition opens its gates in London and after that touring worldwide throughout the year, attracting more than 5 million visitors.\n\nPhotographers can enter their images into a range of categories, whose criteria are mostly based on the subject matter of the images. There are also 3 categories for under 18's, and 3 special awards. The number and name of categories changes nearly every year. In each category a winning, runner-up and several highly commended images are usually chosen, although sometimes the judges will not choose a winner or runner up in a particular category if they deem the standard of entries not to be high enough. The categories in the 2016 competition were as follows: \n0524+1524\n\n\nAll images published in the Wildlife Photographer of The Year portfolio book ever\nFirst prize winners in any category and overall winnings\nOverall winner, winner, runner-up, specially commended, highly commended, and other prizes\nTotal number of years when an author received awards\nThe period between the first and last award\n\n96 countries, 1459 photographers, 3144 published images in BBC Wildlife Photographer of The Year Portfolio books since 1991.\n\nFull available database from 1984 on\n\nThe overall 2009 competition winner, José Luis Rodriguez, was stripped of his award and his £10,000 prize following allegations that his picture of a wolf leaping a gate had been staged, using a captive animal to do so. He was also prohibited from entering the competition for life. It was, however, too late to remove the image from the accompanying book.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11781016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11781016", "title": "Zero-marking language", "text": "Zero-marking language\n\nA zero-marking language is one with no grammatical marks on the dependents or the modifiers or the heads or nuclei that show the relationship between different constituents of a phrase.\n\nPervasive zero marking is very rare, but instances of zero marking in various forms occur in quite a number of languages. Vietnamese and Indonesian are two national languages listed in the World Atlas of Language Structures as having zero-marking. Pirahã is another language having zero-marking among its other very rare features.\n\nIn many East and Southeast Asian languages, such as Thai and Chinese, the head verb and its dependents are not marked for any arguments or for the nouns' roles in the sentence. On the other hand, possession is marked in such languages by the use of clitic particles between possessor and possessed.\n\nSome languages, such as Arabic, use a similar process, called juxtaposition, to indicate possessive relationships. In Arabic, two nouns next to each other could indicate a possessed-possessor construction: \"\" \"Maryam's books\" (literally \"books Maryam\"). The rarity of pervasive zero marking is due to languages with juxtaposition having more of inflection than languages with zero marking in noun phrases so the two almost never overlap.\n\nZero-marking, when it occurs, tends to show a strong relationship with word order. Languages in which zero-marking is widespread are almost all subject–verb–object, perhaps because verb-medial order allows two or more nouns to be recognised as such much more easily than subject–object–verb, object–subject–verb, verb–subject–object, or verb-object-subject order, for which two nouns might be adjacent and their role in a sentence possibly thus confused. It has been suggested that verb-final languages may be likely to develop verb-medial order if marking on nouns is lost.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48328701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48328701", "title": "Zondag met Lubach", "text": "Zondag met Lubach\n\nArjen Lubach is a strong opponent of the monarchy of the Netherlands. Out of protest against the monarchy, he came up with a citizens initiative, in which he crowned himself \"Pharaoh of the Netherlands\", which, like 'King' is also a\nhereditary title. At the time of the airing of the show in which he introduced his initiative, it was 200 years since William I proclaimed himself a King of the Netherlands. For the citizens initiative Lubach needed a minimum of 40.000 endorsements, which he obtained while he was a guest at the Dutch talk show \"De Wereld Draait Door\". With the minimum of 40.000 endorsements, the House of Representatives was obliged to talk about the initiative.\n\n\"Zondag met Lubach\" inspired the global video contest Every Second Counts after it broadcast the parody video \"The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words\" on 22 January 2017. In the video, Donald Trump's speeches and actions –mostly from his election campaign– are imitated and mocked by voice actor Greg Shapiro, who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some self-mockery as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'. A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced \"America First\" policy signifies isolationism, including withdrawing U.S. support for NATO: \"If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems great again.\" The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February. On 2 February during \"Neo Magazin Royale\", Jan Böhmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all European countries to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America. Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for Belgium (by \"De Ideale Wereld\"), Switzerland (by \"Deville Late Night\"), Denmark (by \"Natholdet\"), Portugal (by \"5 Para A Meia-Noite\") and Lithuania (by \"Laikykitės ten\") had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu.\n\nIn late August 2017, a YouTube channel named \"Westeros The Series\" uploaded a \"trailer\" for \"Westeros\", a new 'television series' that would be set in a modern-day Westeros after the events of \"Game of Thrones\", and would premiere in 2019. After getting attention from media, including \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Vice\", the channel uploaded another video on YouTube in early September 2017, instead revealing that \"Zondag met Lubach\" would return on 10 September 2017. \"Zondag met Lubach\"s official YouTube channel also uploaded a combined version of the 'trailer'.\n\nOn 8 October 2017, one week after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, \"Zondag met Lubach\" aired a spoof advertisement called \"Nonsensical Rifle Addiction\", which highlighted the issue with gun violence and mass shootings in the United States, and also lampooned the United States's inability to introduce any binding form of gun control. The title is a play on the influential American gun rights organisation National Rifle Association (NRA). The video was retweeted by American actor Samuel L. Jackson after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018.\n\nOn 10 June 2016 \"Zondag met Lubach\" won the Zilveren Nipkowschijf. The winner of the price is chosen by a jury consisting out of newspapers and magazines television critici. The year before, Zondag met Lubach received an honorable mention by the jury \n\nOn 11 October 2017 during the Televizier-Ring Gala, \"Zondag met Lubach\" was awarded the Gouden Televizier-Ring (Golden television ring) for \"Best television program\". Zondag met Lubach got a plurality of the vote with 47%. During the airing of the award-show people could vote on one of the three nominees for \"Best television program\". The two other nominees for the price were, Beste Zangers and Expeditie Robinson. Arjen Lubach started off his reception speech with saying \"Wat ontzettend terecht\" meaning \"How very much deserved\" (meant as a joke). Furthermore, he praised the rest of his team and expressed their importance. This was the first time that a vpro-program won the prize. To get people to vote on Zml during the award-show, Arjen Lubach had an advert placed on the Ziggo Dome. In this advert the presenter of \"Beste zangers\" and presenters of \"Expeditie Robinson\" were seen giving the advice to vote on Zondag met Lubach and later thanked by Lubach. This initially angered a few people, because they thought that the advert was paid with tax money. However, Lubach later said that this was not the case and that he knew a few people who could get this done.\n\nTo gain the attention of his viewers about the nomination for best actor, Lubach talked about it on his show, however he didn't talk about his own nomination. Instead, he talked about Erik de Vogel, who got nominated in the category for best actor. He requested people to vote for De Vogel, together with a catchphrase \"Ludo verdient een kudo\" meaning Ludo (name of the actor's role in Goede tijden, slechte tijden) deserves kudos. De Vogel did however not win the award, as it was given to Jeroen van Koningsbrugge instead.\n"}
