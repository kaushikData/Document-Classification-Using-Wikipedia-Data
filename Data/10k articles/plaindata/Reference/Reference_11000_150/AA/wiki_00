The GUI definition is completely defined in binary Definition Files (DF).\n\nThe CDS software is constituted of a kernel which is able to create the GUI hierarchy specified in the DF during initialization, thus not needing to be recompiled if the GUI definition changes.\n\nThe first version of the standard was adopted in 2001. Its first use was for Airbus A380 CDS development.\nThe first supplement was adopted in 2003, and added new widgets.\nThe second supplement was adopted in June 2005, and added supplementary widgets. Third supplement has been adopted in 2007. Supplement 4 was adopted in 2010.\n\nThe standard is known today to be used for Airbus A380 and A400M CDS development, and also Boeing 787 CDS development. AgustaWestland company use ARINC 661 for the development of a new Touchscreen unit in the upgraded Merlin helicopter for the Royal Navy. In March 2011, Embraer announced that it selected SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661, a COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) tool for ARINC 661 development, for its future developments.\n\nAn ARINC 661 Part 2 is currently in development, allowing to define custom widgets.\n\nThe standard normalizes :\n\nIn order to be compliant with the standard, a CDS must have a kernel that can create the widgets tree during CDS initialization, using the Definition File, and communicate with UA in both ways using the runtime protocol.\n\nARINC 661 does not imply the use of a particular Data bus structure to perform the low-level communication between CDS and UA. For example, an ARINC 429 or ethernet protocol can be used, but it is not mandatory.\n\nEach DF binary file specifies the GUI definition for one User Application (UA) User interface. Several UA user interface trees can be combined to constitute the CDS display definition.\n\nA DF is composed of two parts : an optional symbol definition, and a widgets definition. The widget library is similar to Widgets used in computing. There are Containers, Lists, ScrollPanes, Buttons, Menus, Labels, EditBoxes, etc...\n\nAlthough the DF File is binary, the standard has also defined an associated XML definition, which is easier to manipulate in tools.\n\nThe concepts used by ARINC 661 are close to those used in User interface markup languages, except that the UI language is binary and not XML based.\n\nMain similarities from other User interface markup languages:\n\nMain differences from other User interface markup languages :\n\nThe following example presents the XML Definition File for a Layer containing a panel enclosing a label, which shows the text \"Hello World!\". Note that contrary to most widget toolkits, ARINC 661 widgets origins are relative to the lower left-hand corner of their parent container, and screen units are not in pixel but in 1/100 of millimeters.\n\nARINC 661 GUI development includes tools for the specification of definition files and the kernel that use these files:\n\nCOTS specification tools for DF specification currently include SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 Compliant Systems, DiSTI's GL Studio ARINC 661 Toolkit and Presagis VAPS XT 661 Toolkit.\n\nEsterel Technologies announced on October 13, 2010, the availability of SCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 in 2011.\nSCADE Solutions for ARINC 661 allow creating both ARINC 661-compliant CDS and UA. For CDS developers, the toolchain features a complete customizable ARINC 661 compliant model-based widgets library and the automated generation of a portable ARINC 661 server, compliant with the DO-178B/C safety objectives up to level A. For UA developers, the toolchain features the model-based design and generation of DFs and the automatic generation of communication code between SCADE Suite UA models and the ARINC 661 Server.\n\nThe GL Studio ARINC 661 Toolkit is a plug-in to GL Studio HMI Toolkit that delivers a set of pre-existing customizable widgets, a DF Generator, CDS, Communication Libraries, and a User Application Generator.\n\nPresagis introduced the first COTS ARINC 661 development tool which allows creation of Widgets, Layers, DF Generation and embeddable real-time COTS CDS kernel with DO-178B/C certification artifacts It must also be noted that because of the burden of Avionics software certification, the kernel must be embedded in a DO-178B-compliant environment.\n\nFlexible Software Solutions introduced COTS Testing and analysis tools for ARINC 661 protocol at the beginning of 2012. The UAM tool can be used to test and debug UA and CDS ARINC 661 messaging. This technology and related products has since been acquired by Presagis \n\n\n"}
{"id": "41157359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41157359", "title": "Approaches to prejudice reduction", "text": "Approaches to prejudice reduction\n\nThere is a great deal of research on the factors that lead to the formation of prejudiced attitudes and beliefs. There is also a lot of research on the consequences of holding prejudiced beliefs and being the target of such beliefs. It is true that advances have been made in understanding the nature of prejudice. A consensus on how to end prejudice has yet to be established, but there are a number of scientifically examined strategies that have been developed in attempt to solve this social issue.\n\nIntergroup interaction approaches to prejudice reduction refer to strategies in which members of one group are put in situations where they have to interact with members of another group that they may hold prejudiced beliefs about. For example, if people from Group X are prejudiced towards people from Group Y or vice versa, an intergroup approach would require at least one person from Group X to interact with at least one person from Group Y. The expectation is that prejudice will decrease following a specified type of interaction. Intergroup approaches to prejudice reduction have been studied a great deal in laboratory settings, as well as outside of the laboratory, particularly in schools. A lot of intergroup prejudice reduction approaches are grounded in one of 3 main theoretical perspectives: interdependence, intergroup contact, and social identity.\n\nInterdependence approaches to prejudice reduction are based on psychologist, Mark Deutsch’s, theory of interdependence. According to this theory, when two groups realize that they have a common issue that can only be solved by pooling their resources together, they are more likely to engage in cooperative behaviors. Cooperation then results in friendliness during discussion and positive evaluations of the individuals from the opposite group.\n\nCooperative learning is an interdependence approach originally developed for the purpose of reducing racial prejudice in schools. It is most frequently examined in school settings, and studies testing this approach often occur across weeks. \n\nThis approach is most frequently associated with the “jigsaw method” created by social psychologist, Elliot Aronson. With this method, students are put into diverse teams of 5 or 6 people and assigned to complete a task. Each person is given a unique part of the total material necessary for solving the task. Thus, in order to complete the task, team members have to work together, each sharing their unique information with the others. The jigsaw method has been shown to actually reduce prejudice toward members of the stigmatized group. A stigmatized group is a group that “has an attribute that marks them as different and leads them to be devalued in the eyes of others”. The stigmatized group in the context of the jigsaw method is typically a racial minority group. Getting members of the non-stigmatized group to engage in cooperative behaviors with members of the stigmatized group results in increased liking, increased perspective taking, and increased helping behaviors between the different group members.\n\nAnother variation of cooperative learning is the competitive-cooperation method. With this method, the learning environment is set up such that students are assigned to diverse groups of 4-5 people and the diverse groups compete with each other in a weekly learning game tournament. Thus, group members are dependent on one another and cooperation is necessary in order for them to do well and outperform the other groups in the tournament. The same outcomes of liking, perspective taking and helping behavior are expected with this type of cooperative learning strategy.\n\nOverall, cooperative learning strategies have been quite effective in reducing prejudice. However, as cooperative learning is generally studied with children in school settings, it is not clear what its impact is on adults. Also, there is little research on whether or not the reduction of prejudice that students experience as a result of cooperative learning extends to their perceptions of the stigmatized group as a whole or just to those members that are part of their assigned cooperative learning group.\n\nContact approaches to prejudice reduction are based on prominent social psychologist, Gordon Allport’s, contact hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, prejudice is best reduced under optimal conditions of contact between those who hold prejudiced beliefs and those who are the targets of prejudiced beliefs. The optimal conditions include equal status between groups in the context of the given situation, shared goals, authority support, and cooperation as opposed to competition. (This does overlap with the cooperative learning strategy discussed above.) Stuart Cook’s “railroad studies” are classic examples of the contact hypothesis put into practice. These railroad studies took place in the American South during the 1960s, an especially challenging time and place with respect to interracial relations. In these studies, racially prejudiced white adults were hired to perform a railroad management task with two coworkers under the guise that they were employed at a real part-time job. Unbeknownst to them, the two coworkers – one White and one Black – were research assistants. After working with the two coworkers for over a month under optimal conditions, the initially prejudiced white participants rated their coworkers highly in attractiveness, likeability, and competence. Moreover, several months later, participants still expressed lower prejudice than prejudiced whites that did not have the intergroup contact experience.\n\nAccording to social identity theory, people are biased to favor their ingroup – the group that they identify as belonging to – at the expense of the outgroup – the group that they do not identify with. Social identity-based approaches to prejudice reduction attempt to make a particular group-based identity, such as race or gender, less salient to individuals from different groups by emphasizing alternative ways of categorizing people.\n\nOne way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through decategorization. Decategorization involves teaching people from different social groups to focus on a person’s unique individual characteristics. This is known as individuation, and helps to draw attention away from group differences and toward individual differences. Decategorization often causes ingroup members to perceive fewer similarities among themselves.\n\nAnother way of making a particular group-based identity less salient is through recategorization. Here, individuals with different group-based identities are made aware of the fact that the groups to which they belong are part of an overarching group. The salience of their membership in the overarching group is emphasized over their exclusive group based identities. For example, membership in the group “student” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major”.\n\nSimilar to recategorization, crossed categorization is when individuals from opposing groups are made aware of the fact that they both simultaneously belong to a third separate group, and membership in this third group is emphasized. For example, membership the group “military veteran” would be emphasized over membership in the group “humanities major” or “sciences major ”.\n\nIntegrative models acknowledge the coexistence of separate group-based identities within a common group identity. This is in alignment with multicultural ideologies that emphasize appreciation for racial and ethnic diversity while still emphasizing a common national identity.\n\nBecause divisive group membership is deemphasized in these categorization strategies, people from opposing groups express less ingroup favoritism. However, they do not necessarily show a reduction of bias against the outgroup. This approach has primarily been studied in laboratory settings and often with arbitrarily assigned group categories. It is not entirely clear how these results translate when considering existing social groups in real-world settings.\n\nDisclosure approaches rely on self-disclosure of personal information. Here, two individuals from different social groups would each reveal a piece of personal information about themselves. The act of disclosure signals vulnerability. This increases trust and liking, and that then results in a decrease of prejudiced beliefs. It is not clear if the decrease in prejudice extends beyond the disclosing individual to the social group to which that person belongs.\n\nIndividual approaches to prejudice reduction are not dependent on intergroup interaction. These approaches only require that an individual be exposed to some relevant information and/or engage in an activity intended to reduce prejudice. There are two main types of individual approaches to prejudice reduction: affective strategies that target what and how you feel, and cognitive strategies that target what and how you think. A lot of the evidence on the effectiveness of affective and cognitive strategies is based on laboratory findings. As most of these studies consist of one-time sessions, it is unclear how long the positive effects of the strategies last. Also, there is not much knowledge about the extent to which these strategies are effective in situations outside of the laboratory.\n\nPerspective taking.\nTaking the perspective of an individual from a stigmatized group has been shown to be effective in reducing prejudice because it evokes feelings of similarity and affinity toward the other person. Evidence from laboratory studies suggests that perspective taking specifically leads to a decrease in the use of stereotypes when categorizing or evaluating a member of a stigmatized group.\n\nEmpathy.\nEncouraging individuals to be empathetic towards stigmatized groups is another feeling-based strategy. Being instructed to be empathetic after reading about or watching videos of discrimination, against a stigmatized group, such as African Americans, results in decreased expressions of prejudice, and a stronger willingness to engage in contact with members of the stigmatized group.\n\nThought awareness and suppression.\nIncreasing a person’s awareness of his or her prejudiced thoughts and instructing that person to actively suppress those thoughts is a form of prejudice reduction that has been frequently studied in laboratory settings. However, suppression does not always reduce prejudice and sometimes has the opposite effect of increasing it.\n\nAttitude reconditioning.\nThere are several strategies that attempt to recondition or retrain implicit prejudiced attitudes – attitudes that exist outside of a person’s conscious awareness. One way of reconditioning implicit attitudes is through classical conditioning, whereby you pair a representation of a stigmatized group with positive images or positive words. While this is helpful in reducing implicit prejudice, it is not necessarily successful at changing conscious attitudes. Another method of reconditioning is known as Situational Attribution Training. This training, based on the ultimate attribution error, reduces implicit prejudice by getting people to focus on situational explanations for negative behaviors displayed by members of stigmatized groups. Again, it is unclear if this leads to a decrease in conscious prejudiced attitudes.\n\nThought process reconditioning.\nSome research suggests that teaching people how to engage in more complex thinking elicits less biased evaluations of outgroup members. For example, instructing people on how to apply statistical reasoning to everyday judgments leads people to make more accurate assessments of outgroup members. \n\nExperts and norms.\nWhen people are told that experts believe personality traits are changeable and learned, they decrease in their stereotyping of stigmatized groups. Also, stereotyping decreases when people are told that stereotyping of a particular stigmatized group is not the norm for their peers.\n\nAccountability and value consistency.\nSome prejudice reduction strategies rely on creating a sense of internal conflict. One such strategy involves holding people accountable for their prejudice. Prejudice has been shown to decrease when people are asked to provide concrete reasons for prejudiced beliefs. The process of generating these reasons gets people to consider the irrational nature of their prejudiced beliefs. Another strategy is to get people to view prejudice as being inconsistent with their behaviors or valued attitudes. This creates cognitive dissonance, and people attempt to resolve this tension by reducing expressions of prejudice. For example, after agreeing to write a public statement advocating a policy that is beneficial to racial minorities but costly to whites, whites report more personal support for this policy than before being asked to write the public statement.\n\nSelf-affirmation.\nPeople are also less likely to endorse prejudiced beliefs when their own self-worth is affirmed. After being made to feel good about themselves, people are more likely to positively rate job candidates from stigmatized groups and less likely to negatively stereotype people from stigmatized groups.\n\nIntegrated approaches to prejudice reduction include both intergroup and individual components, such as vicarious intergroup contact, perspective taking, and empathy. Many of these integrated approaches involve some form of entertainment. After cooperative learning, entertainment-based interventions are the second most popular prejudice reduction strategy tested in non-laboratory settings. Reading interventions are particularly popular.\n\nReading interventions.\nReading interventions typically take place in schools and last an average of 5 weeks. They attempt to influence prejudiced beliefs through the use of engaging stories. Often these stories highlight positive interactions between children who are similar to those receiving the intervention and children who differ from them based on their membership in a stigmatized group. Furthermore, when an emphasis is placed on individual characteristics as opposed to group membership, an experience of vicarious intergroup friendship occurs, and this leads to more positive attitudes toward children from stigmatized groups. There is little knowledge, however, of how such interventions influence children’s behavior in actual intergroup interactions.\n\nDespite the fact that billions of dollars are spent on diversity training a year, workplace diversity training is not necessarily informed by prejudice reduction research, and its effectiveness in reducing prejudice has rarely been examined.\n"}

Snyder led international seminars and workshops for writers in various disciplines, as well as consultation sessions for some of Hollywood's largest studios.\n\nSnyder died unexpectedly August 4, 2009, of what was characterized as either a pulmonary embolism or cardiac arrest. A public memorial was held at the Writers Guild of America, West on September 29, 2009.\n\nSnyder's father, Kenneth C. T. Snyder, was an Emmy-winning TV producer of many children's shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Among them were \"The Funny Company\", \"Hot Wheels\", animated segments on \"Sesame Street\", \"Big Blue Marble\" and the cult classic \"Roger Ramjet\".\n\nAt the age of eight, Snyder was hired by his father as a voice talent for an animated special starring Sterling Holloway. Snyder continued doing children's voices alongside Gary Owens, June Foray and others until his voice changed and he was fired by his producer father.\n\nSnyder went on to earn a B.A. degree in English from Georgetown University, and returned to Los Angeles where he began his career writing for the Disney TV series \"Kids Incorporated\". Snyder began writing full-time as a screenwriter in 1987. He was a member of the Writers Guild of America for over 20 years.\n\nSnyder's first spec screenplay sale was in 1989 for the script \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\", which sold for $500,000 in a bidding war. He went on to sell 12 more original screenplays and was named \"one of Hollywood's most successful spec screenwriters\". Million dollar script sales include \"Blank Check\", co-written with Colby Carr for Walt Disney Pictures, and \"Nuclear Family\", co-written with James Haggin for Steven Spielberg/Amblin Entertainment.\n\nSnyder's nonfiction book \"Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need\" was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on Amazon and in 2018 is on its 34th printing. The book describes in detail the structure of the monomyth or \"hero's journey\", providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting.\n\nThe title \"Save The Cat!\" was coined by Snyder to describe a decisive moment when the protagonist does something nice—like, literally, saving a cat. Snyder writes that, \"it's the scene where we [first] meet the hero,\" in order to gain audience favor and support for the main character right from the start. In the opening scene of the movie, \"Frequency\", for example, Frank Sullivan, played by Dennis Quaid, is the veteran firefighter that jumps into a manhole to save two workers from a gas explosion. Prior to his death-defying rescue, his chief warns, \"Frank, you're not going to make it. There's not enough time.\" Frank, a true hero, doesn't seem overly alarmed. This is what he does. His concern is primarily for the men below as he confidently jokes, \"What, miss the World Series? Not a chance.\" From this moment on, the audience is fully invested in Frank's wellbeing and rooting for him to succeed.\n\nAccording to Snyder, this crucial element is missing from many of today's movies. He referenced \"Lara Croft Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle of Life\" (2003) - as being a film that focused on making the character Lara Croft \"cool\" and sexy (via a \"new latex body suit for Angelina Jolie\") instead of likable. An estimated $95 million was spent on this film, and it only grossed $156.5 worldwide ($65.6 million in the U.S.). This sequel did not lose money, but it earned considerably less than the original \"Lara Croft Tomb Raider\" (2001), which grossed $274.7 million worldwide ($131.1 million in the U.S.).\n\nHis inspiration for this was the movie \"Alien\", where Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley saves a cat named Jones.\n\nIn his book, Snyder gave greatest emphasis on the importance of structure through his Blake Snyder Beat Sheet or the \"BS2\" which includes the 15 essential \"beats\" or plot points that all stories should contain.\n\nSnyder's method expanded the 15 beats further into 40 beats, which are laid out on \"The Board.\" The Board is divided into 4 rows, with each row representing a quarter of the story, namely the 1st Act, the 1st half of the 2nd Act, the 2nd half of the 2nd Act, and the 3rd Act.\n\nSnyder also introduced 10 genres in his book that distinguished how stories are structured. According to Snyder, standard genre types such as Romantic Comedy, Epic or Biography did not say much about the story, only the type of movie it is. Snyder's system explored genre more fully, with categories such as \"Monster in the House\", \"Golden Fleece\", \"Buddy Love\" and others.\n\nIn 2007, Snyder wrote \"Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies\". The second book took 50 landmark movies, identified their specific genres, and broke them down into the 15 beats of the BS2.\n\nThe third book of Snyder's series, \"Save the Cat! Strikes Back: More Trouble For Screenwriters To Get Into… and Out Of\", was published in November, 2009. This was the last book in the series to be authored by Snyder himself.\n\nThe fourth book was a compliation of Blake's blogs and other writings on the subject of screenwriting, titled \"Save the Cat! Blake's Blogs: More Information and Inspiration for Writers\", (published in 2016).\n\nThe fifth book was written by his student, Spanish screenwriter and novelist Salva Rubio. It is titled \"Save the Cat! Goes to the Indies\" and features the analysis of 50 independent, European, auteur and cult films (published in April, 2017).\n\nThe sixth is the first non-screenwriting book, \"Save the Cat! Writes a Novel: The Last Book On Novel Writing That You'll Ever Need\", written by student and YA novelist Jessica Brody, (published on October 9, 2018).\n\nAs a companion to his books, Snyder developed a story structure software product called \"Save the Cat! The Last Story Structure Software You'll Ever Need\". The software places Snyder's \"Beat Sheet and Board\" on an end user's desktop, phone, or tablet. In 2008, Snyder and software company Final Draft, Inc. specializing in script formatting, became partners in building import/export functions between the two programs. Snyder's company, Blake Snyder Enterprises, LLC, released an iPhone app of the software in November, 2009 and an Android app in 2016. Version 4 of the software and apps, which includes new templates for novelists and tv writers, will be released in the 4th quarter of 2018.\n\nSnyder developed two weekend workshops for writers, filmmakers and executives. The introductory class, \"The Beat Sheet Workshop\", helped participants come up with the solid structure of the 15 beats, before they embark on the actual writing of the script. In addition, The Beat Sheet Workshop was expanded to be led internationally.\n\nThe second workshop, a continuation of the first, called \"The Board Workshop\", had participants take their 15 beats and expand them into 40 cards for a more detailed story structure. Snyder held his workshops all over the United States, Europe and Asia. The workshops were run year round. Snyder also taught his method in such universities as UCLA, Chapman University, Vanderbilt University and the Beijing Film Academy.\n\nThe in-person Beat Sheet Workshops continue, taught by \"Master Cats\" who were mentored by Snyder. The Beat Sheet Workshops expanded with online courses in 2017.\n\nFollowing the release of his first book, Snyder provided script analysis to studios such as Disney, DreamWorks, Laika and Nelvana.\n\n\"How to Train Your Dragon\" (DreamWorks, 2010) was dedicated to Snyder. \"Whispers Under Ground\" (Gollancz, 2012) by Ben Aaronovitch was dedicated to him as well.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a compilation of quotes from founders of the United States of America and select government documents, including information on the rights of a jury to \"nullify bad law\" and acquit people on trial. The author of the \"Rule Book\" says that jurors have the right to nullify a trial if the law is unconstitutional or is being used in an unconstitutional manner. Originally published anonymously, the \"Citizens Rule Book\" is now known to have been written by Charles R. Olsen, a World War II Marine veteran and printer from Boston. It is distributed by the Fully Informed Jury Association, among other groups.\n\nThe \"Citizens Rule Book\" is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the rights of juries, the second section discusses the views of American founders regarding jury trials, and the third section summarizes important founding documents of the United States.\n\nThe \"Citizens Rule Book\" claims that citizens are \"above the law\" and may nullify any law which is unconstitutional. It says that a citizen's power comes directly from God, therefore jurors are not beholden to decisions made by judges or other government agents. According to the book, \"each JUROR has MORE POWER than the President, all of Congress, and all of the judges combined!\"\n\nBy issuing a verdict of \"not guilty\", even against the wishes of all other jurors, a single juror may \"hang\" a trial, resulting in a mistrial. The \"Rule Book\" advocates the use of this tactic to overturn cases in which a person is guilty of a crime, but the law in question is unconstitutional.\n\nThis section also says that the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights are based on the Biblical Ten Commandments. In contrast, \"many of the planks of the Communist Manifesto are now represented by law in the U.S.\"\n\nIn this section, the \"Citizens Rule Book\" says that the founders of the United States believed all juries should be composed of people who personally know the accused. It quotes Patrick Henry, Representative John Holmes, and Declaration of Independence signatory James Wilson to the effect that jurors should be familiar with the \"character\" of the defendant on trial.\n\nIn this section, the \"Citizens Rule Book\" provides summaries and commentaries on three important founding documents of the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe printers claim that over three million copies of the \"Citizens Rule Book\" have been published. Family-owned and operated Whitten Printers continues to print and distribute this booklet. The \"Citizens Rule Book\" is available in single or bulk quantities direct from the publisher and online through Homeschool Patriot. The book is given away free through such sources as radio-host and filmmaker Alex Jones with every order from his Infowars Shop, he also offers bulk-order options. Creationist Kent Hovind sold the book online through his website.\n\nIt would appear that the \"Citizens Rule Book\" was prepared after 1971 but not revised since then, because every edition found includes the 26th Amendment (voting age of 18 years), adopted in July 1971, but not the 27th Amendment (limiting Congressional pay increases) which was adopted in May 1992.\n\nThe \"Citizens Rule Book\" had a significant role in the 1997 Idaho trials of three Christian Identity militants and members of the Idaho Militia, who identified themselves as \"Phinehas Priests\". The three - Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Verne Jay Merrell - were charged with bombing a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, the Spokane Valley office of \"The Spokesman-Review\", and with twice robbing a U.S. Bank branch (April 1 and July 12, 1996).\n\nThe book was mentioned in the opening statement for the defense in the trial of Timothy McVeigh as being possessed by one of the alternative suspects proposed by the defense.\n\n"}

{"id": "31332189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31332189", "title": "Digital Scriptorium", "text": "Digital Scriptorium\n\nDigital Scriptorium (DS) is a non-profit, tax-exempt consortium of American libraries with collections of pre-modern manuscripts, or manuscripts made in the tradition of books before printing. The DS database represents these manuscript collections in a web-based union catalog for teaching and scholarly research in medieval and Renaissance studies. It provides access to illuminated and textual manuscripts through online cataloging records, supported by high resolution digital images, retrievable by various topic searches. The DS database is an open access resource that enables users to study rare and valuable materials of academic, research, and public libraries. It makes available collections that are often restricted from public access and includes not only famous masterpieces of book illumination but also understudied manuscripts that have been previously overlooked for publication or study.\n\nFunded by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, DS at its inception in 1997 was a joint project of the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley (under Prof. Charles Faulhaber) and the Rare Book & Manuscript Library of Columbia University (under Dr. Consuelo W. Dutschke). The plan was to digitize and make available on the World Wide Web catalog records and selected images from the two universities' medieval and early Renaissance manuscript collections. The decision in favor of sample images rather than the complete imaging of manuscripts was originally practical, but today DS includes some records with sample and some with complete imaging. Records with sample images offer various pathways of entrance to the growing corpus of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts now available online. Because of patterns of collecting in the 19th and early 20th century, moreover, many manuscripts in American collections comprise partial texts or detached single leaves. Cataloging as many of these fragmentary works as possible increases the chance that some manuscripts could be reconstituted, if only virtually. Thus as a philosophical principle, DS includes large and small collections, complete bound books and single leaves.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002, additional holdings from Huntington Library, the University of Texas, Austin, and the New York Public Library were incorporated, along with those of a number of smaller collections. The database has continued to grow and represents the collections of over thirty member institutions, including not only those with substantial repositories, such as Harvard University's Houghton Library, Yale University's Beinecke Library, and the University of Pennsylvania, but also libraries with few but rare works such as the Providence Public Library, which owns an unusual 15th century Bible (Wetmore Ms 1) in rebus format. As of September 2015, DS counts catalog records for 8,390 manuscripts and 47,624 digitized images.\n\nThe Digital Scriptorium database enables public viewing of non-circulating materials normally available only to specialists with restricted access. As a visual catalog, DS allows scholars to verify cataloguing information about places and dates of origin, scripts, artists, and quality. Special emphasis is placed on touchstone materials such as manuscripts signed and dated by scribes, thus beginning the American contribution to the goal established in 1953 by the \"Comité international de paléographie latine\" (International Committee of Latin Paleography): to document photographically the proportionately small number of codices of certain origin that will serve stylistically to localize and date the vast quantities of unsigned manuscripts. DS publishes not only manuscripts of firm attribution but also ones that need the attention of further scholarship that traditionally would have been unlikely candidates for reproduction. Because it is web-based, it also allows for updates and corrections, and as a matter of form individual records in DS acknowledge contributions from outside scholars. Because the DS consortium consists of academic, public, and rare book libraries, it encourages a broad audience that benefits from a reciprocally beneficial body of knowledge. While attending to the needs of community of specialists: medievalists, classicists, musicologists, paleographers, diplomatists, literary scholars and art historians, DS also recognizes a public user community that values rare and unique works of historical, literary and artistic significance.\n\nWorking together the DS consortium has expanded the resources of libraries to manage collections of rare materials by providing a digital cataloging standard for pre-modern manuscripts. A DS record includes extensive and granular descriptive metadata supported by high resolution digital images. Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts are best served by format-specific cataloging that is sensitive to their complexity as hand-made books and historical artifacts. They differ from modern manuscripts, such as letters or personal records, because although they are unique objects, they are usually not unique texts. They may be written, bound, and decorated by hand but most pre-modern manuscripts are books. The text of a fourteenth-century missal, for example, can be identified using an early twentieth-century printed version of the same text. Or several collections may own more than one manuscript of St. Augustine’s De Civitate Dei (The City of God). A DS search by title in fact retrieves fourteen copies of this work, all unique manuscripts dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries, owned by eight different libraries. The potential for relationships among manuscripts means that item-level, bibliographic cataloging rather than collection-based, archival cataloging best identifies and describes the content of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. But these works also have historical and artifactual significance, so catalog records for medieval and Renaissance manuscripts need to describe not only their contents but also the complete provenance (chain of ownership), binding (which may be from a later period than the rest of the book), marks of ownership (such as coats-of-arms), physical condition, material support (usually parchment), foliation and construction of the book, layout of the text, attribution of script, date (often estimated), style and localization of decoration and painted illustration, and names, not just of authors, but craftsmen, scribes, artists and owners.\n\nSome scholars of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts are less interested in the text of the manuscript than in some other aspect of its production. The field of art history offers the most striking example; a scholar studying the art of the illuminator Mariano del Buono will care equally for the Harvard manuscript (a copy of Plato) and for the manuscript held by New York Public Library (a copy of Livy). DS records factor for such interests and allow for searching on physical features only, whether by artist name (such as in the above example) or by place and date of origin (\"Italy,\" and \"1450-1499\" would produce the same result).\n\nBefore digitization, most records of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts were excluded from library public access catalogs but instead were published in printed books written by scholar-specialists for a similarly trained audience. Compared to these DS records are similar to library cataloging records in that they are simplified, standardized and concise. Specialists may notice that a DS record omits some information (such as collation) available in scholarly catalogs, in order to avoid descriptions that would take too much time and discourage library catalogers from attempting the task. In agreement with Green and Meisner, the goal has been \"more product, less process,\" or as the Spanish proverb goes, \"lo mejor es enemigo de lo bueno.\" A DS record is thus not intended to serve as the ideal and thorough description of a manuscript, but rather a practical surrogate that still provides a better representation of it than a typical content-based OPAC (online public access catalog) record.\n\nCompared to MARC (MARC standards are the bibliographic standards used by most American libraries), DS is better designed to describe not only the content but also the historical context and physical characteristics, while using sample images to support these descriptions. The sample images contain inherently descriptive information, and most DS records include digital images, although there are some exceptions. Although DS records can be adapted to MARC formats, DS better captures the complexity of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts than MARC. For example, DS nests the sections of descriptive metadata in order to catalog a manuscript with multiple texts of multiple origins all in one binding, while MARC provides a flat file that can only deal with a coterminous text + physical unit. DS also indexes specific information pertinent to this format, with a separate field for \"Artist,\" for example, rather than one for \"personal names.\" DS also creates more focused records compared to archival cataloging based on EAD (Encoded Archival Description), because the latter is collections-based and not designed to be descriptive and searched at the item level. Thus the DS cataloging method has become the unofficial library standard for the online cataloging of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in the United States.\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley provided the first home to the DS database, both in terms of managing the project and devising its initial technology. For an interim period of time (2003–2011) DS was hosted at Columbia University but is now returned to its original home at Berkeley. The technical innovations produced by the teams of both originating universities created a digital product based on a progressive, standards-based digitization policy. Originally using Microsoft Access to serve as a cross-institutional data collection tool, the DS database used SGML and later XML to aggregate and query the combined information. The present platform managed by U.C. Berkeley depends upon software known as WebGenDB. WebGenDB is a non-proprietary, web-based interface for the underlying control database GenDB.\n\nGenDB houses the descriptive, structural and administrative metadata for the materials being digitized for web presentation, and outputs the metadata using the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) format. METS provides an XML schema-based specification for encoding \"hub\" documents for materials whose content is digital. A \"hub\" document draws together potentially dispersed but related files and data. METS uses XML to provide a flexible vocabulary and syntax for identifying the digital components that together comprise a digital object, for specifying the location of these components, and for expressing their structural relationships. The digital components comprising a digital object could include the content files, the descriptive metadata, and the administrative metadata. METS can be used for the transfer, dissemination and/or archiving of digital objects, all in compliance with the OAIS (Open Archival Information System) reference model developed at OCLC. The DS reliance on OAIS (ISO 14721: 2003) promises secure digital preservation policy, supported by the California Digital Library digital curation services and the CDL \"Merritt\" digital archive.\n\n\n"}

It soon became the guidebook for thousands of guerrilla fighters in various countries around the world.\n\nAfter his success in the Cuban Revolution, Che Guevara gained a global reputation as a rising revolutionary figure, which eventually led him to write \"Guerilla Warfare.\" In the manual, Guevara espouses three reasons for revolution: a lack of legitimacy by the incumbent elite to govern the country, the existence of tensions that cannot be addressed by regular channels, and all legal avenues to change the situation are perceived as closed. Although providing enough evidence and support for his ideas and tactics, Guevara on multiple occasions states that, while these tactics were effective for him and his men in Cuba, they will not necessarily be successful in other regions.\n\n\"Guerrilla Warfare\" is a manual for the left-wing insurgency that draws on Guevara's experience as a participant in the Cuban revolution. It elaborates the foco theory (\"foquismo\"), for which the guerrilla operates as a vanguard even before the development of the \"objective\" conditions for a popular uprising.\n\nWhile many draw parallels with Mao Zedong's \"On Guerrilla Warfare\", Guevara claimed he had not read Mao's book. Instead it draws on the lessons of fighting during the Cuban Revolutionary War, which in turn were informed by two books from the Spanish Civil War, \"Nuevas guerras\" and \"Medicina contra invasión\", stressing the need for an underpinning political motivation to guerrilla methods, organisation and supply.\n\nGuevara divides the book into three different Chapters, each entailing their own perspectives on the roles of those who belong to a revolutionary cause. The first chapter labeled “General Principles of Guerrilla Warfare”, discusses the basics of what it means to be part of a Guerrilla War; the topics range from the essences of Guerrilla Warfare to tactics, strategies, and suburban warfare. Chapter two, labeled “The Guerrilla Band”, talks about the roles that a Guerrilla fighter must take on while being part of a revolution, things ranging from being a social reformer to being a combatant, to even the organization and development of the band before and after the war. Chapter three, labeled “Organization of Guerilla Front”, focuses more on the logistics of a Guerrilla War, ranging from supplies to training. It is an all aspects sort of chapter which goes into further detail than the previous two chapters.\nMuch of the manual is devoted to matters of a practical nature, such as the type of armaments best suited to guerrilla forces, and the optimum size of a given guerrilla band.\n\nGuevara emphasizes that guerrilla warfare is a favorable method only against totalitarian regimes, (such as the revolutionary war against the Batista dictatorship in Cuba), where political opposition and legal civil struggle is impossible to conduct. South African revolutionaries read the work in the early 1960s; former Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils notes that the Apartheid regime's police questioned his late wife about an order of \"Che Guevara's book on guerrilla warfare.\"\n\nGuevara dedicated the book to his recently deceased comrade Camilo Cienfuegos, \"who should have read and corrected it, but whose fate prevented him from carrying out the task.\"\n\nGuevara states that the \"three fundamental lessons\" of the Cuban revolutions are:\n\n\"1) Popular forces can win a war against the army. 2) It is not necessary to wait until all conditions for making revolution exist; the insurrection can create them. 3) In underdeveloped America, the countryside is the basic area for armed fighting.\"\n\nThis book can be seen as an example of how to continue the Guerrilla front in a struggling revolution. By providing tactics and strategies to other fighters this book serves as a guidebook for future revolutionaries.\n\nEven though the role of a guerrilla fighter is to fight any life with their life on the line, it is seen as though the fighter is the core strength of the revolution. Without any fighter willing to lay their life on the line for the concept of the revolution, a revolution can not occur. The vanguard of the fighters is seen as the driving force of not only the bands power but also the driving force in the reform of society and the spreading of revolutionary ideologies.\n\nIn the book, Guevara talks about how in addition to being a Guerrilla fighter, they must also be social reformists. They must live through example, they must live an ascetic life with impeccable morality with strict self-control, so that they may always stay on the right path. With the vanguard of the Guerrilla front being a central focal point for social reform, through their lives and examples society as a whole will reform to revolutionary ideals.\n\nGuevara also talks about the need to protect civilians, \"a peasant must always be helped technically, economically, morally, and culturally, the guerrilla fighter will be a sort of guardian angel\" by saving and helping the peasants the process of social reform will increase.\n\nGuevara discusses different combat themes throughout the book, each one focusing mostly on combat between organized military groups versus Guerrilla fronts. Strategies ranged from extremely organized strikes against fortified military strongholds, sabotage, to hit and run tactics. Most of these strategies were focused on fighting on uneven grounds since it can be assumed that the Guerrilla front will be undermanned and under supplied.\n\nEven though tactics and combat are discussed throughout the book, these tactics should be taken as mere examples of effective ways to combat an opposing force. Tactics should be taken and applied to an appropriate situation, but if a fighter finds that the tactic does not serve its intended function they must be able to adapt and find ways to continue. Even though all fighters are expected to lay down their life for the cause of the revolution, it is made clear that human life is the most precious of resources and that if possible a fighter must aim to preserve their life as much as possible.\n\nWhile the book was intended for other revolutionary movements in Latin America, Africa and Asia, it was also studied by counter-revolutionary military schools.\n\nWith the success of Che's military campaign in Cuba and the spreading of the communism in Latin America, the rise of US military involvement increased throughout the region following their success. US military even went to the extent of adopting some of Che's tactics in order to better combat guerilla fighters in the jungle. This gave rise to US military training throughout Latin America in order to counteract the spreading of guerrilla movements throughout the region, for example, the legacy and role of the Good Neighbor Policy. Eventually, something that Che himself faced in Bolivia during his Guerrilla Campaign.\n\nAlthough the book received an overwhelmingly positive acceptance by Left-wing individuals, the Right-wing did not agree with the publishing of the book. Even though it was accepted by the Left, even they think that Che depicts the process of a Guerrilla war as overly simple and somewhat based on chance. For instance \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20819040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20819040", "title": "Hashtag", "text": "Hashtag\n\nA hashtag is a type of metadata tag used on social networks such as Twitter and other microblogging services, allowing users to apply dynamic, user-generated tagging which makes it possible for others to easily find messages with a specific theme or content. Users create and use hashtags by placing the number sign or pound sign codice_1 usually in front of a word or unspaced phrase in a message. The hashtag may contain letters, digits, and underscores. Searching for that hashtag will yield each message that has been tagged with it. A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under the same hashtag. For example, on the photo-sharing service Instagram, the hashtag \"#bluesky\" allows users to find all the posts that have been tagged using that hashtag. \n\nThe use of hashtags was first proposed by Chris Messina in a 2007 tweet that, although initially decried by Twitter as a \"thing for nerds\", eventually led to their use spreading like wild-fire through the platform. Messina, who made no attempt to copyright the use because he felt \"they were born of the internet, and owned by no one\", has subsequently been credited as the godfather of the hashtag. By the end of the decade hashtags could be seen in most emerging as well as established social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. So much so that Instagram had to officially place a \"30 hashtags\" limit on its posts to prevent people from abusing their use, a limit which Instagrammers eventually circumvented by posting hashtags in the comments section of their posts. As of 2018 more than 85% of the top 50 websites by traffic on the Internet use hashtags and their use is highly common with millennials, Gen Z, politicians, influencers, and celebrities worldwide. Because of its widespread use, \"hashtag\" was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in June 2014. The term \"hashtag\" is also sometimes erroneously used to refer to the hash symbol itself when used in the context of a hashtag. Formal taxonomies can be developed from the folk taxonomy rendered machine-readable by the markup that hashtags provide; this process is called folksonomy.\nThe US pound sign, number sign or hash symbol \"#\" is often used in information technology to highlight a special meaning. (\"Pound sign\" in the UK means \"£\"; \"#\" is called hash, gate, and occasionally octothorpe.) In 1970, for example, the number sign was used to denote \"immediate\" address mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used \"#\" in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor. In the 1986 SGML standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals, --e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union approved in November 1988 recommendation E.161 that put the hash sign on the right side of the 0 in the 4 x 3 button arrangement for push buttons on telephones. This same arrangement is still used today in most software phones (see Android dialer for example). The ITU recommendation had 2 design options for the hash: a European version where the hash sign was built with a 90-degree angle and a North-American version with an 80-degree angle. The North-American version seems to have prevailed as most hash signs in Europe now follow the 80-degree inclination.\n\nThe pound sign was adopted for use within IRC networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics. Channels or topics that are available across an entire IRC network are prefixed with a hash symbol # (as opposed to those local to a server, which use an ampersand '&').\n\nThe use of the pound sign in IRC inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network. He posted the first hashtag on Twitter:\n\nMessina’s suggestion to use the hashtag was not adopted by Twitter, but the practice took off after hashtags were widely used in tweets relating to the 2007 San Diego forest fires in Southern California.\n\nAccording to Messina, he suggested use of the hashtag to make it easy for \"lay\" users to search for content and find specific relevant updates; they were for people who do not have the technological knowledge to navigate the site. Therefore, the hashtag \"was created organically by Twitter users as a way to categorize messages.\" Today they are for anyone, either with or without technical knowledge, to easily impose enough annotation to be useful without needing a more formal system or adhering to many technical details.\n\nInternationally, the hashtag became a practice of writing style for Twitter posts during the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests; Twitter users inside and outside Iran used both English- and Persian-language hashtags in communications during the events.\n\nThe first published use of the term \"hash tag\" was in a blog post by Stowe Boyd, \"Hash Tags = Twitter Groupings,\" on August 26, 2007, according to lexicographer Ben Zimmer, chair of the American Dialect Society's New Words Committee.\n\nBeginning July 2, 2009, Twitter began to hyperlink all hashtags in tweets to Twitter search results for the hashtagged word (and for the standard spelling of commonly misspelled words). In 2010, Twitter introduced \"Trending Topics\" on the Twitter front page, displaying hashtags that are rapidly becoming popular. Twitter has an algorithm to tackle attempts to spam the trending list and ensure that hashtags trend naturally.\n\nAlthough the hashtag started out most popularly on Twitter as the main social media platform for this use, the use has extended to other social media sites including Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Tumblr, and Google+.\n\nA hashtag must begin with a hash character followed by other characters, and is terminated by a space, or end of message. It is always safe to precede the “#” with a space, and to include letters without diacritics, digits, and underscores. In many cases other characters are also allowed, in particular accented characters used in many languages, but handling may vary from one client to another, and from time to time as standards evolve. A discussion of hashtag standards suggests that if #Romeo&Juliet is used, different Twitter clients might link to #Romeo, #Romeo&, or #Romeo&Juliet. Hashtags are not case sensitive; a search for “#hashtag” will find “#HashTag”. The use of embedded capitals (CamelCase) increases readability and avoids confusion; a (real) pen shop would be advised to use #PenIsland rather than all lower-case. On microblogging and social networking sites hashtags can be inserted anywhere within a text, often at the beginning or the end, but also within the text, usually as a word (e.g. “It is #sunny today”).\n\nLanguages which do not use letters are handled slightly differently. In China, microblogs Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo use a double-hashtag-delimited #HashName# format, since the lack of spacing between Chinese characters necessitates a closing tag. Twitter uses a different syntax for Chinese characters and orthographies with similar spacing conventions: the hashtag contains unspaced characters, separated from preceding and following text by spaces (e.g. '我 #爱 你' instead of '我#爱你') or by zero-width non-joiner characters before and after the hashtagged element, to retain a linguistically natural appearance (displaying as unspaced '我‌#爱‌你', but with invisible non-joiners delimiting the hashtag).\n\nIt is considered acceptable to tag a post once when contributing to a specific conversation. Two hashtags are considered acceptable when adding a location to the conversation. Three hashtags are seen by some as the \"absolute maximum\", and any contribution exceeding this risks \"raising the ire of the community.\"\n\nAs well as frustrating other users, the misuse of hashtags can lead to account suspensions. Twitter warns that adding hashtags to unrelated tweets, or repeated use of the same hashtag without adding to a conversation, could cause an account to be filtered from search, or suspended.\n\nJimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake performed a sketch parodying the often incorrect and misunderstood use of hashtags on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" in September 2013.\n\nHashtags are mostly used in unmoderated, ad hoc discussion forums; any combination of characters led by a hash symbol is a hashtag, and any hashtag, if promoted by enough individuals, can \"trend\" and attract more individual users to discussion. On Twitter, when a hashtag becomes extremely popular, it will appear in the \"Trending Topics\" area of a user's homepage. The trending topics can be organized by geographic area or by all of Twitter. Hashtags are neither registered nor controlled by any one user or group of users. They cannot be \"retired\" from public usage, meaning that any given hashtag can theoretically be used in perpetuity. They do not contain any set definitions, meaning that a single hashtag can be used for any number of purposes, as chosen by the creators of them.\n\nHashtags intended for discussion of a particular event tend to use an obscure wording to avoid being caught up with generic conversations on similar subjects, such as a cake festival using #cakefestival rather than simply #cake. However, this can also make it difficult for topics to become \"trending topics\" because people often use different spelling or words to refer to the same topic. For topics to trend, there has to be a consensus, whether silent or stated, that the hashtag refers to that specific topic.\n\nHashtags also function as beacons in order for users to find and \"follow\" (subscribe) or \"list\" (organize into public contact lists) other users of similar interest.\n\nTelevision broadcasters such as Channel 4 have employed the hashtag during the transmission of programmes such as First Dates and The Undateables. Research has shown that audience numbers go up when individuals can be interactive by tweeting while viewing a programme.\n\nHashtags can be used on the social network Instagram, by posting a picture and hashtagging it with its subject. As an example, a photo of oneself and a friend posted to the social network can be hashtagged #bffl or #friends. Instagram has banned certain hashtags, some because they are too generic, such as #photography #iPhone #iphoneography, and therefore do not fulfill a purpose. They have also blocked hashtags that can be linked to illegal activities, such as drug use. The ban against certain hashtags has a consequential role in the way that particular subaltern communities are built and maintained on Instagram. Despite Instagram's content policies, users are finding creative ways of maintaining their practices and ultimately circumventing censorship.\n\nFamous Youtube bloggers often use hashtags to promote their videos to a wide audience. Thus, by leaving various hashtags under the video, they are trying to increase their views and gain as many likes as possible. Usually, hashtags are left under the video itself in a special line. By clicking on the hashtag you go directly to the link to the video, which are similar in topic.\n\nHashtags are also used informally to express context around a given message, with no intent to categorize the message for later searching, sharing, or other reasons. One of the functions of the hashtag is to serve as a reflexive meta-commentary, which contributes to the idea of how written communication in new media can be paralleled to how pragmatic methodology is applied to speech.\n\nThis can help express contextual cues or offer more depth to the information or message that appears with the hashtag. \"My arms are getting darker by the minute. #toomuchfaketan\". Another function of the hashtag can be used to express personal feelings and emotions. For example, with \"It's Monday!! #excited #sarcasm\" in which the adjectives are directly indicating the emotions of the speaker. It can also be used as a disclaimer of the information that the hashtag accompanies, as in, \"BREAKING: US GDP growth is back! #kidding\". In this case, the hashtag provides an essential piece of information in which the meaning of the utterance is changed entirely by the disclaimer hashtag. This may also be conveyed with #sarcasm, as in the previous example. Self-mockery is another informal function of the hashtag used by writers, as in this tweet: \"Feeling great about myself till I met an old friend who now races at the Master's level. Yup, there's today's #lessoninhumility,\" where the informality of the hashtag provides commentary on the tweet itself.\n\nThe feature has been added to other, non-short-message-oriented services, such as the user comment systems on YouTube and Gawker Media. In the case of the latter, hashtags for blog comments and directly submitted comments were used to maintain a more constant rate of user activity even when paid employees were not logged into the website. Real-time search aggregators such as the former Google Real-Time Search also support hashtags in syndicated posts, meaning that hashtags inserted into Twitter posts can be hyperlinked to incoming posts falling under that same hashtag; this has further enabled a view of the \"river\" of Twitter posts that can result from search terms or hashtags.\n\nThe use of hashtags has extended to televisiona concept that began rising in prominence in the early 2010s. Broadcasters may display a hashtag as an on-screen bug, encouraging viewers to participate in a backchannel of discussion via social media prior to, during, or after the program. Television commercials have sometimes contained hashtags for similar purposes. Hashtag bugs appear on either corner of the screen, or they may appear at the end of an advertisement.\n\nWhile personalities associated with broadcasts, such as hosts and correspondents, also promote their corporate or personal Twitter usernames to receive mentions and replies to posts, usage of related or \"branded\" hashtags alongside Twitter usernames (e.g., #edshow as well as @edshow) is increasingly encouraged as a microblogging style to \"trend\" the hashtag (and, hence, the discussion topic) in Twitter and other search engines. Broadcasters also make use of such a style to index select posts for live broadcast. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's director of media partnerships, identified two types of television-formatted usage of hashtags: hashtags which identify a series being broadcast (i.e. #SunnyFX) and instantaneous, \"temporary\" hashtags issued by television personalities to gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts. Some have speculated that hashtags might take the place of (or co-exist with) the Nielsen television ratings system.\n\nAn example of trending \"temporary\" hashtags garnering viewers during broadcasts is observed on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon, a variety talk show on NBC. Every Wednesday, Fallon hosts a segment on his show called \"Tonight Show Hashtags,\" which engages viewers by inviting them via Twitter to post humorous stories based on a specific hashtag topic, such as #WhydidIsaythat, #Worstfirstdate, to #Onetimeinclass, reflecting on funny experiences in daily life. By using hashtags, Fallon creates a sense of community and solidarity among his viewers and draws a wider range of viewers through an online platform while they watch a classic, non-interactive television program. Because of its popularity, the \"Tonight Show Hashtags\" are usually the 'most tweeted hashtag' on Twitter, which promotes the show. By engaging viewers with a lighthearted subject and simple hashtags, Fallon can gauge topical responses from viewers during broadcasts and also use the hashtags to brand his show.\n\nThe increased usage of hashtags as brand promotion devices has been compared to the promotion of branded \"keywords\" by AOL in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as such keywords were also promoted at the end of television commercials and series episodes.\n\nThe late-night television comedy game show @midnight with Chris Hardwick on Comedy Central features a daily game entitled \"Hashtag Wars,\" in which three comedians compete against one another to come up with phrases based on a given hashtag theme.\n\nSome hashtags have become famous worldwide. For instance the slogan \"Je suis Charlie,\" which was first used on Twitter as the hashtag #jesuischarlie and #iamcharlie to indicate solidarity with \"Charlie Hebdo\" offices attacked in Paris, spread to the internet at large.\n\nSince February 2013 Twitter and American Express have collaborated to enable users to pay for discounted goods online by tweeting a special hashtag. American Express members can sync their card with Twitter and pay for offers by tweeting; American Express tweets a response to the member that confirms the purchase.\n\nOrganized real-world events have used hashtags and ad hoc lists for discussion and promotion among participants. Hashtags are used as beacons by event participants to find each other, both on Twitter and, in many cases, during actual physical events.\n\nCompanies and advocacy organizations have taken advantage of hashtag-based discussions for promotion of their products, services or campaigns.\n\nPolitical protests and campaigns in the early 2010s, such as #OccupyWallStreet and #LibyaFeb17, have been organized around hashtags or have made extensive usage of hashtags for the promotion of discussion. Hashtags have also been used to promote official events; the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially titled the 2018 Russia–United States summit as the \"#HELSINKI2018 Meeting\".\n\nHashtags are often used by consumers on social media platforms to complain about the customer service experience with large companies. The term \"bashtag\" has been created to describe situations in which a user refers to a corporate social media hashtag to criticise the company or to tell others about poor customer service. For example, in January 2012, McDonald's created the #McDStories hashtag so that customers could share positive experiences about the restaurant chain. But, the marketing effort was cancelled after two hours when McDonald's received numerous complaint tweets rather than the positive stories they were anticipating.\n\nThe use of hashtags also reveals what feelings or sentiment an author attaches to a statement. This can range from the obvious, where a hashtag directly describes the state of mind, to the less obvious. For example, words in hashtags are the strongest predictor of whether or not a statement is sarcastic—a difficult AI problem.\n\nThe YouTuber Spencer FC used the hashtag for the name and crest of his YouTube-based association football team, Hashtag United F.C..\n\nSince the 2012–13 season, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has allowed fans to vote players in as All-Star Game starters on Twitter and Facebook using #NBAVOTE. The tweets and Facebook posts must include #NBAVOTE along with the player's first and last name or Twitter handle.\n\nDuring the April 2011 Canadian party leader debate, Jack Layton, then-leader of the New Democratic Party, referred to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's crime policies as \"a hashtag fail\" (presumably #fail).\n\nThe term \"hashtag rap\", coined by Kanye West, was developed in the 2010s to describe a style of rapping which, according to Rizoh of the \"Houston Press,\" uses \"three main ingredients: a metaphor, a pause, and a one-word punch line, often placed at the end of a rhyme\". Rappers Nicki Minaj, Big Sean, Drake, and Lil Wayne are credited with the popularization of hashtag rap, while the style has been criticized by Ludacris, The Lonely Island, and various music writers.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, a hashtag, #TwitterIPO, appeared in the headline of a \"New York Times\" front-page article regarding Twitter's initial public offering.\n\nBird's Eye foods released in 2014 a shaped mashed potato food that included forms of @-symbols and hashtags, called \"Mashtags\".\n\nHashtags have been used verbally to make a humorous point in informal conversations, such as \"I’m hashtag confused!\" In August 2012, British journalist Tom Meltzer reported in \"The Guardian\" about a new hand gesture that mimicked the hashtag, sometimes called the \"finger hashtag\", in which both hands form a peace sign, and then the fingers are crossed to form the symbol of a hashtag. The emerging gesture was reported about in \"Wired\" by Nimrod Kamer, and during 2013, it was seen on TV as used by Jimmy Fallon, and on \"The Colbert Report,\" among other programs. Writing in 2015, Paola Maria Caleff considered this usage a fad, but noted that people talking the way that they write was a consequence of computer-mediated communication.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "312168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312168", "title": "John Stainer", "text": "John Stainer\n\nSir John Stainer (6 June 1840 – 31 March 1901) was an English composer and organist whose music, though not generally much performed today (except for \"The Crucifixion\", still heard at Passiontide in many churches of the Anglican Communion), was very popular during his lifetime. His work as choir trainer and organist set standards for Anglican church music that are still influential. He was also active as an academic, becoming Heather Professor of Music at Oxford.\n\nStainer was born in Southwark, London, in 1840, the son of a cabinet maker. He became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral when aged ten and was appointed to the position of organist at St Michael's College, Tenbury at the age of sixteen. He later became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, and subsequently organist at St Paul's Cathedral. When he retired due to his poor eyesight and deteriorating health, he returned to Oxford to become Professor of Music at the university. He died unexpectedly while on holiday in Italy in 1901.\n\nJohn Stainer was the eighth of nine children born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where his father was a cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.\n\nIn 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer became a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an accomplished player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch and a fine treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 he was invited to sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.\nAt the age of sixteen, he was appointed by Sir Frederick Ouseley to the post of organist at the newly founded St. Michael's College, Tenbury. At that time Ouseley was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University and had recently become vicar of St Michael's College on the outskirts of Tenbury Wells, a choir school with a church that he had founded and endowed and which was intended to serve as a model for Anglican church music. Although not much older than they were, Stainer was in charge of the choir and choristers, and one of his duties was to give piano lessons to the boys for two hours a day. Ouseley was an antiquarian and had an extensive library. He was much interested in the history of music and acted as Stainer's mentor. Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree at Oxford. For this, Stainer wrote a cantata, \"\"Praise the Lord, O my soul\", with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works. About this time he wrote several anthems, the most successful of which was \"I saw the Lord\"\", a bolder and more original work in a more contemporary style.\n\nIn 1860 he became organist at Magdalen College, Oxford, initially for a period of six months, at a salary of £120 per year. His duties included playing for services, training the choir and leading them on Fridays, a day on which the organ was not used. A new organ had been installed five years earlier that was ideal for developing his talent. He proved satisfactory in the post, and his contract was made permanent. He was permitted to study for a degree as long as it did not interfere with his duties, and he chose to do so in the expectation that it would raise his social status. He gained his BA in 1864 and his MA two years later and was keen to proceed to his Mus Doc, which would raise his standing within the university.\nUnfailingly conscientious as a choirmaster, Stainer introduced new anthems and service music, bringing the choir to a higher level of attainment than it had previously seen. It had been the custom for the adult choir members, the lay clerks, not to attend practice at all; but Stainer had a magnetic personality and persuaded them to come. Their more regular attendance enabled the repertoire to be enlarged. Stainer's skill on the organ was much respected, and he was regarded as \"the finest organist Oxford had seen in many generations\". The vice chancellor, Dr Francis Jeune, was an admirer and in 1861 appointed Stainer to the prestigious post of University Organist at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin. Here he was expected to play for a service every Sunday (at a later time in the morning than the Magdalen service).\n\nAt this time he was composing liturgical music and developing his musical style. There were several anthems and two more technically assured multi-sectioned verse anthems, \"Drop down, ye heavens from above\" and \"They were lovely and pleasant in their lives\". His routine included two services daily, rehearsals, lectures, tutorials, attendance at Ouseley's lectures, and visits home to Southwark in the vacations. He must have performed his duties with diligence as his salary was raised by £10 a year and after 1862 he received an allowance towards his rent.\n\nStainer was also conductor of the Magdalen Madrigal Society, which gave concerts in the College Hall, and the Magdalen Vagabonds, which performed during vacations. The latter gave concerts in various towns and cities and raised money for church restoration. He wrote some madrigals himself, which were published by Novello, a company with which he was to do much future business. He also wrote an oratorio, \"Gideon\", as the exercise for his doctorate and it was performed in November 1865. It was well received on the day and was sufficient to gain him his doctorate but has not been performed since.\n\nAfter Stainer had obtained his doctorate, Ouseley enrolled him as an examiner for Oxford musical degrees. In this capacity Stainer met and later became friends with Hubert Parry. Attending at evensong at Magdalen College in 1866, Parry wrote in his diary \"Stainer played the last 3 movements of the Sonata in B-flat (Mendelssohn) afterwards most gloriously\". He examined William Pole and Frederick Bridge and became involved in organ and music tuition and wider musical activities. He had considerable influence on sacred music in Oxford and his reputation spread beyond the confines of the city. He was employed to play solo organ works at weekly concerts at Crystal Palace and took part regularly in the Three Choirs Festival.\n\nStainer was interested in the history of music and traditional folk songs. There was a revived interest in carols at the time, and he rediscovered old carols, provided new settings for others and introduced contemporary works. Many of his harmonisations are still in use today. He published a volume \"Christmas Carols New and Old\" which was a considerable success, with thousands of copies sold. He followed this up with another edition the following year to which he persuaded Arthur Sullivan to contribute. He also composed several hymn tunes, and some of these are still to be found in Anglican hymnals, with \"Love divine, all loves excelling\" being popular at wedding services. Other parish music followed with a congregational \"Te Deum in C\" which was regularly sung at Magdalen on Sundays and a verse anthem \"Sing a song of praise\". Two more substantial anthems, intended for use in cathedrals, were \"Lead kindly light\" composed in 1868, followed by \"Awake, awake, put on thy strength\" in 1871. He also produced two evening canticles and a comprehensive set of music for morning, communion and evening services. He had also been working for a long time on his first theoretical work, \"A Theory of Harmony Founded on the Tempered Scale\", published by Novello in 1871.\n\nIn 1871, Goss resigned as organist of St Paul's Cathedral and Stainer was appointed to the position early in 1872 at a salary of £400 per annum. By this time he had been married for seven years and had five children with another due shortly. The organ was in the process of being rebuilt, by the organ builder Henry Willis to Stainer's design, with portions on either side of the entrance to the choir stalls. Around this time he was asked to help revise \"Hymns Ancient and Modern\", a task he did with enthusiasm. At St Paul's, he soon set about reinvigorating the choir. The appointment of vicars choral was for life, and the tenor and bass voices saw no need for rehearsal, meaning that the repertoire was static. Stainer was able to change their attitude, and new anthems and liturgies were introduced, a choir school built, and the number of choristers increased from twelve to thirty-five. When William Sparrow Simpson was appointed Succentor, the raising of standards continued, and St Paul's Cathedral became the focus of religious ceremony in the capital, including state occasions, ceremonial events, memorial services and the funerals of the great and famous. A peal of twelve bells was installed in 1878.\n\nFurther appointments followed. Stainer became an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner for the Doctor of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured to be asked to be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.\n\nIn 1882, Stainer was offered the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a position he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio \"Mary Magdalen\". This was followed in 1887 by \"The Crucifixion\", the work for which he is most remembered.\n\nIn 1885, he was awarded an honorary degree by Durham University, and he became Heather Professor at Oxford in 1889 following the death of Ouseley. He conducted pioneering research into early music, notably the output of Netherlandish Renaissance composer Guillaume Dufay, then scarcely known even among experts. He also contributed a small treatise, \"Harmony\", and another, \"Composition\", to the famous series of Novello musical primers. For budding organists he wrote a primer called, simply, \"The Organ\", which continues to have a following. In recognition of his services to British music, he received a knighthood from Queen Victoria in 1888.\n\nFollowing a childhood accident, Stainer had lost the use of one eye. There is some confusion about this and he may merely have had a lazy eye, but for a brief period in 1875 he feared he was losing the sight of the other eye. This proved not to be the case, but he suffered from eye strain and impairment to his vision for much of his life. This was a major reason for his decision to retire from St Paul's Cathedral in 1888, while still in his forties. As Bumpus was to write, \"Such honours as are at the disposal of his fellow musicians have been freely showered upon him, for he is universally beloved and esteemed, but his many onerous duties, his organistship of this, his presidency of that, and his incessant hard work as an examiner, have all involved responsibility and constant application, and the result is that his sight and general health have given way under the severe strain of sheer hard work.\"\n\nIn later life, he and his wife took to travelling to the Riviera, Florence or Mentone each year for him to relax and recuperate. It was on such a visit to Verona, Italy that on Palm Sunday, 31 March 1901 he felt unwell and retired to his room. Later that afternoon he died of a heart attack. He was sixty. His body was taken back to England, and his funeral service was held on 6 April at St Cross Church, Oxford with a large number of friends and colleagues present, followed by burial in adjacent Holywell Cemetery.\n\nLady Stainer was devastated by his death and went into mourning for a year, but as she confided to a friend, the pianist Francesco Berger, \"I am thankful he has been spared long illness and the weariness of old age, which he always dreaded\". She gave a memorial stained glass window to St Cross Church and arranged for a monument to be erected at Magdalen College. Her husband's valuable library of antiquarian music books passed to his elder son, J F R Stainer, who allowed its use for study and research purposes. The collection was sold to an American collector in 1932 who, on his death in 1973, had it bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, where it remains. Lady Stainer died in 1916 leaving six children. She is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford beside her husband.\n\nStainer's output of sacred music was extensive, including the Passion cantata or oratorio \"The Crucifixion\" (1887), the \"Sevenfold Amen\" (this latter piece was especially admired by the lexicographer Sir George Grove), and numerous hymn tunes, including \"Cross of Jesus\", \"All for Jesus\" (both from \"The Crucifixion\"), and \"Love Divine\". His settings for the \"Gloria\" and \"Sanctus\" were sung at the coronation of Edward VII in 1902.\n\nHis work as a composer was much esteemed during his lifetime but is not well known today. \"The Crucifixion\" is one of the few major works of his that is still regularly performed. It is often given in Anglican churches during Holy Week and forms part of the repertoire of numerous choirs. He also made a lasting contribution to the music of Christmas in his \"Christmas Carols New and Old\" (1871), produced in collaboration with the Revd. H. R. Bramley, which marked an important stage in the revival of the Christmas carol. The book includes Stainer's arrangements of what were to become the standard versions of \"What Child Is This\", \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\", \"Good King Wenceslas\", \"The First Nowell\", and \"I Saw Three Ships\", among others. He was a skilled musician and accompanist and Walter Galpin Alcock, who was taught composition by Arthur Sullivan at the National Training School for Music, recalls Sullivan saying \"I was at St Paul's yesterday, listening to Dr Stainer extemporising. My dear young friends, he is a genius, and I hope you will miss no chance of hearing him.\" John Stainer was also a close friend of Edmund Hart Turpin, the later Hon. Secr. of the Royal College of Organists for more than fifty years.\n\nA list of Stainer's more prominent works is provided below.\n\n\n\n\nStainer wrote four oratorios:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This ascription is now in doubt, and the historian Thomas Owen Clancy has suggested that \"Lebor Bretnach\" was instead only intended to be dedicated to Gilla Cóemáin. Traditionally there had been an assumption that the translation had been an Irish work, but Clancy has argued for a Scottish provenance, suggesting an origin at Abernethy, though probably intended for an Irish readership that had perhaps become interested in Scottish literature and history as a result of the military success and prestige of the Kingdom of Alba. It is generally agreed that \"Lebor Bretnach\" dates to the mid or late 11th century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39239624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39239624", "title": "Melancholie der Engel", "text": "Melancholie der Engel\n\nMelancholie der Engel (English: The Angels' Melancholia) is a 2009 German independent experimental art film directed, shot, and edited by Marian Dora and cowritten by Dora and Carsten Frank (under the pseudonym Frank Oliver, used due to artistic disagreements).\n\nIt was planned since 2003 though the shooting was delayed due to monetary issues. It premiered at Weekend of Fear Festival in Erlangen and Nuremberg, Middle Franconia, Franconia, Bavaria, Germany, on 1 May 2009. It was also screened at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in New York City on 27 October 2009, where it won Best International Feature Film – Arthouse Genre. It was later screened at BUT (B-Movies, Underground, and Trash) Film Festival in the Netherlands on 7 June 2013. The DVD was released on 30 July 2010 in Austria.\n\nThe film received largely negative reviews. While some commended the cinematography, it was seen to be an exploitive hardcore film with repetitive and meaningless depravity communicating its nihilistic message.\n\nThe film opens with a woman named Katja giving birth to an infant which is immediately beheaded by two mysterious figures. Depressed, feeling his mortality, and fearing he is reaching the end of his life, Katze decides to meet his old friend Brauth, who has a Christ-like appearance, at an old house in which they used to delve into dark pleasures. They meet two sixteen-year-old girls, Melanie and Bianca. Together they enter a bar where a woman, Anja, joins the group. Katze also finds two other old acquaintances of his are attending: Heinrich, an elderly artist who claims to be a dead man, accompanied by a young woman named Clarissa who is tied to a wheelchair. Clarissa can only excrete through a urine bag or artificial bowel outlet.\n\nThe group decide to allow Katze to go out in style as their fun turns increasingly more depraved and horrific. The film contains explicit representations of coprophilic and urophilic actions: one scene involves a man defecating on a woman while taking her panties off, wiping himself, and shoving the pair in her mouth, all the while gesturing harshly to put her finger in his soiled anus.\n\nDuring the same evening, the protagonists begin to consume alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine, and to think about different philosophical approaches. Katze, Brauth, and Anja reveal their nihilistic nature to the two girls, claiming they do not believe in heaven, and they will not be missed after dying. Then Katze, using a scalpel, deals cuts on Anja's breast as she vomits semen while cutting herself under the enthusiastic look of Brauth and the perplexed look of Melanie and Bianca.\n\nThe following morning the group travels to a pond near a factory: here Brauth reveals that Katze does not have much time to live. Melanie and Katze move away from the others. Near a farm, he meets a nun (Martina Adora) who leads him to a neighboring church. The nun begins to pray and then undresses and masturbates while Katze enters the crypts, watching the tombs with morbid curiosity; at the same time Melanie assists hunting and slaughtering a pig and Brauth rapes Anja. Several newts, frogs, rats, cats, and snails are also killed throughout the film.\n\nThat night Katze has an illness whose cause is attributed by Heinrich to the indifference of God towards him. Brauth becomes tired of Clarissa's laments, slams her into a basement and tortures her by ripping her colostomy device off and jabs his fingers into the hole, then throws her down from her wheelchair and abandons her. During the night Bianca awakens and says she \"heard the voice of the dead.\" Katze checks and finds nothing but a rabbit hanged by Heinrich, beheaded and thrown by Katze himself.\n\nThe next day Brauth connects with Melanie and Blanca and locks them in a stable before sending Heinrich to abuse them. However, the two girls succeed in escaping from him: Heinrich later abuses Clarissa. The girl commits suicide the next morning, throwing herself off a cliff; at the same time Anja finds the remains of the pig discarded by the butchers and is sexually excited by touching them while having a goat lick between her legs.\n\nYoung Bianca, derisively called Snow White, is also murdered by the group. After her womb has been removed with a knife, her skull is thrown. Heinrich is murdered by Katze and Brauth by having his entrails stabbed out of him. Afterward, an orgy takes place in which the four remaining members of the group burn Heinrich, still alive, at a pyre while the participants engage in sexual acts and urinate into the fire.\n\nAnja finds Katze in a confused state, bruised and pained. Bianca comes crawling from the old house, while Melanie looks at a tiny skull inside a pendulum clock and finds a tape containing the scene shown at the beginning of the film; the figures who killed the infant are shown to be Katze and Brauth, and the skull found in the clock is that of the infant itself. Melanie crushes the cassette and uses the tape to masturbate while Bianca is reached and beaten by Anja, Heinrich, Katze, and Brauth. The latter then knocks her with a knife and abandons her to death. From the flames there is a flash that hits Katze's face, blinding him permanently. There are only a few hours left to live and the following afternoon Anja accompanies him to his tomb where he speaks. Anja honors Katze by ornamenting his tomb before reuniting with the nun and walking away silently.\n\nTwo direct-to-video films were released as a diptych, intended as commentary on \"Melancholie der Engel\". The first, \"Reise nach Agatis\" (), is a 74-minute film produced by Engelfilm. It was shot between 27 and 29 May 2008 in Croatia, on a budget of €10,000. It premiered at Weekend of Fear on 2 December 2010, and was released on DVD on 16 April 2014 in the United States. It was nominated for the BUT Award at BUT (B-Movies, Underground, and Trash) Film Festival in Breda, Breda, North Brabant, Netherlands, on 8 September 2011.\n\nThe second, \"Debris documentar\", is a 75-minute film released on 28 September 2012 in Germany, produced by Buna Films and distributed by \"Werkmann Filmverlag\". This film deals with the everyday life of a man, Carsten (Carsten Frank), who works on the set of the 2004 film \"Zombie Nation\" for Ulli Lommel, and was filmed at the time Dora worked there as assistant, producer, actor, and technician. David Hess composed most of this film's score (the rest is by Sebastian Veelbehr).\n\nThe film opens with a scene of a woman tortured and killed on a beach. This is followed by a seemingly innocent and pleasant yachting cruise under the sun: an attractive couple, Rafael (Thomas Goersch) and Isabell (Tatjana Lommel), entice young prostitute Lisa (Janna Lisa Dombrowsky) to a dreamy vacation. Before the end of the day, she is running for her life as they reveal their psychopathic and violent nature, hoping to wake up from a demented nightmare. Charles Berlitz's 1974 book \"The Bermuda Triangle\", René Cardona Jr.'s 1978 film \"The Bermuda Triangle\", Tonino Ricci's 1978 film \"\", and David D. Osborn's 1974 novel \"Open Season\" are mentioned and the film ends with Lisa being stabbed multiple times in extremely graphic detail. Blood splatters onto Rafael, killing her. He then proceeds to ram a knife into her vagina, followed by disemboweling.\n\nThe man working on the set of a zombie film is planning to realize his own film, a task he finds extremely difficult. First, the man tries to place casting ads in a supermarket. During his daily work on the film set, the man seems frustrated. Also, he is isolated in his private life, and spends his time by watching and masturbating to his opulent VHS film collection of homosexual rape pornography and films such as Cesare Canevari's 1977 \"Last Orgy of the Third Reich\", Dennis Donnelly's 1978 \"The Toolbox Murders\", Peter Schamoni's 1976 \"Potato Fritz\", and Rino Di Silvestro's 1976 \"Werewolf Woman\", and tinkering with props for his own planned film.\n\nIn his spare time, he shoots photos of animal cadavers while playing with them. He also collects them as he seems to have a sexual attraction to them. He rapes a woman (Carina Palmer) in the woods while she urinates. He indulges in several disturbing sexual fetishes including defecating, urinating, necrophilia, bestiality, anal fisting, rape and murder. He has regular contact with a prostitute, Patrizia (Patrizia Johann), who puts an enema into her anus, and defecates into a bucket while placing the man onto a table, and shoving her fist into his anus, pulling out feces while he is putting the bucket to his face. He also engages by telephone with Jesús Franco, Katja Bienert, Peter Martell, and David Hess, playing fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nAfter a while he contacts a woman, Franziska (Alexandra Dumas), who read his advertisement in the supermarket, and meets him at his house. When he tells her what he is supposed to do in his film, the woman becomes scared. The man overwhelms the woman and kills her by strangling her with a telephone cord and beating her head. Afterwards he films himself as he is sexually aroused by her corpse. He cuts her nipples off in graphic detail and uses his scalpel to cut the dead woman's clitoris off. He then takes the scalpel and peels the skin off one of her fingers and eats the pieces of dismembered skin. Astrid Proll's 1998 book \"Baader-Meinhof: Pictures on the Run, 67–77\" about Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof and Eduard Mörike are mentioned, and the film ends with the fact that the man burns the same woman's body and goes jogging as in the first shot of this film. Other cast members include Martina Adora and Stefanie Müller.\n\nTo maximize the authenticity, the director was the only one with access to the script during the shooting. The film was shot for a period of three weeks around Eselsburg Valley, near Herbrechtingen, Heidenheim, Ostwürttemberg, and Dornhaldenfriedhof, Degerloch, Filder, Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, and Bogenhausener Friedhof, St. George, Bogenhausen, Bogenhausen, Munich, Upper Bavaria, and Nördlinger Ries, near Nördlingen, Donau-Ries, Swabia, Bavaria, Germany, and Auschwitz, Oświęcim, Gmina Oświęcim, Oświęcim County, Lesser Poland, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland. Dora described the shoot as nightmarish due to drug abuse and violence on set. The dialogue was mainly spoken in poetic verses.\n\nAt the center of the film is Katze, whose thoughts and feelings are revealed to the audience \"via\" voiceover. Often, different philosophers and poets are quoted \"e.g.\" Rainer Maria Rilke, Lord Byron's 1816 poem \"Darkness\", Marquis de Sade's 1791 novel \"Justine\" and 1782 short story \"Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man\", Eduard Mörike's 1838 poem \"Am Walde\" and 1832 poem \"Verborgenheit\", Georg Büchner's 1828 poem \"\" and 1836 short story \"Lenz\", Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1832 poem \"Faust, Part Two\", Friedrich Nietzsche's 1883 novel \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1975 film \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\", the 1600 song \"Sorrow, Sorrow, Stay, Lend True Repentant Tears\" by John Dowland, Wolfgang Koeppen's 1954 novel \"Death in Rome\" (the book Katze is shown reading and being buried with, itself referencing Thomas Mann's 1912 novel \"Death in Venice\" and Dante Alighieri's 1321 poem \"Inferno\"), or Rainer Werner Fassbinder, in addition to \"Psalms\" 23 and \"1 Chronicles\" 22:1, while Frederick Eckstein's 1936 book \"Alte, unnennbare Tage: Erinnerungen aus siebzig Lehr- und Wanderjahren\" about Empedocles, Ray Hoekstra's and Tex Watson's 1978 book \"Will You Die For Me? The Man Who Killed For Charles Manson Tells His Own Story\", and Elly-Leonore Henkel-Michel's paintings of Gudrun Ensslin, Jan-Carl Raspe, and Andreas Baader are also mentioned. Dora received several death threats as a result of making this film.\n\nThe Worldwide Celluloid Massacre panned the film, writing:\n\n\"Melancholie der Engel\" was referred to as \"the most notorious, undeniably hardcore German release to date\" by Severed Cinema, which said that while it could be annoying and suffered from dullness and repetition due to its length, the film was beautifully shot, possessing haunting and nightmarish cinematography with lyrical quality to it. The website concluded its review by stating: \"Filled with unspeakable atrocities, \"Melancholie der Engel\" is completely devoid of morality. It is a depraved, perverse and nihilistic endurance test.\"\n\nHorror News similarly commended the cinematography and acting, however, it also said of the film, \"There is talk of spirits and demons and ghosts, there is talk of a mysterious event from the past, there is talk of a change for the future, but the story itself is lost amongst everything else and we find ourselves watching disgusting and/or horrifying scenes but not sure what it all means.\"\n\nThe film won the Best International Feature Film – Arthouse Genre Award at New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in 2009.\n\n"}

It supports ISC BIND DNS and is distributed as open source software under the GNU General Public License.\n\nmysqlBind/unxsBind has been in use since the late 1990s. It initially was designed to replace perl/bash based sets of maintenance scripts that made deployment and upkeep of large DNS systems time consuming and prone to human error.\n\nmysqlBind (now unxsBind) centralizes all data in a replicated SQL database and limits any DNS configuration errors to one software package failure point. unxsBind is a BIND9+ server management system only, not a DNS server, and generates DNS server specific configuration files so that the DNS server does not have to rely on a live SQL database. The unxsBind used SQL server is only needed to be operational for administration and deployment of new zones, new resource records, resource records changes and zone SOA changes. This non-reliance on a live SQL database has been a major point for reliable deployment of large scale DNS services. \n\nunxsBind is based on a \"Company/Organization-Contact-Role\" login and permissions model, such that end user organization contacts can manage their own DNS data from a shared infrastructure. This unxsBind shared infrastructure supports an unlimited number of organizations that can then administrate their own DNS resources, such as IP blocks, zones and resource records. unxsBind provides for the centralized management of multiple independent name servers across data center boundaries. \n\nThe unxsBind system consists of a back end (unxsBind/iDNS) interface, and several example end user interfaces: The idnsAdmin admin interface, and the end user idnsOrg and vdnsOrg interfaces. All provided interfaces run on SQL originated HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates organized in types and sets for on the fly interface \"skin\" changes and new interfaces. This along with the backend/DNS-configuration-engine and front-end interface model used in unxsBind is meant to provide the DNS service provider with a simple path to provision their own custom interfaces with advanced functionality. For example, a DNS service provider branded AJAX based interface with punycode hostname conversion for IDNA support.\n\nSecondary and master zones, secondary-only zones, forward zones, hidden masters and hidden external master zones are all supported. Recent versions allow unlimited split horizon configurations (multiple BIND 9.3+ views). NAPTR, AAAA, and many other complex resource records are supported with input validation and contextual glossary based help. Wizards are provided for error prone complex DNS configuration management operations, e.g. in-addr.arpa reverse dns NS delegation using CIDR and $GENERATE directives. LDAP login support is provided for the vdnsOrg interface.\n\nA CentOS 5.2+ yum installable version is available. Advanced features such as HA and LDAP single sign-on require that the system be configured and installed from source.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2287212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2287212", "title": "National Museum (Rio de Janeiro)", "text": "National Museum (Rio de Janeiro)\n\nThe National Museum () is Brazil's oldest scientific institution, which was installed in the Paço de São Cristóvão (Saint Christopher's Palace), inside the Quinta da Boa Vista, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The main building was originally the residence of the Portuguese Royal Family between 1808 and 1821 and was later used to house the Brazilian Imperial Family between 1822 and 1889. After the monarchy was deposed, it hosted the Republican Constituent Assembly from 1889 to 1891 before being assigned to the use of the museum in 1892. The building was listed as Brazilian National Heritage in 1938.\n\nFounded by King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves on 6 June 1818, under the name of \"Royal Museum\", the institution was initially housed at the Campo de Santana park, where it exhibited the collections incorporated from the former House of Natural History, popularly known as \"Casa dos Pássaros\" (\"House of the Birds\"), created in 1784 by the Viceroy of Brazil, , as well as collections of mineralogy and zoology. The museum foundation was intended to address the interests of promoting the socioeconomic development of the country by the diffusion of education, culture, and science. In the 19th century, the institution was already established as the most important South American museum of its type. In 1946, it was incorporated into the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe National Museum held a vast collection with more than 20 million objects, one of the largest collections of natural history and anthropological artifacts in the world, encompassing some of the most important material records regarding natural science and anthropology in Brazil, as well as numerous items that came from other regions of the world and were produced by several cultures and ancient civilizations. Formed along more than two centuries through expeditions, excavations, acquisitions, donations and exchanges, the collection was subdivided into seven main nuclei: geology, paleontology, botany, zoology, biological anthropology, archaeology, and ethnology. The collection was the principal basis for the research conducted by the academic departments of the museumwhich are responsible for carrying out activities in all the regions of the Brazilian territory and several places of the world, including the Antarctic continent. The museum held one of the largest scientific libraries of Brazil, with over 470,000 volumes and 2,400 rare works.\n\nIn the area of education, the museum offers specializations, extension and post-graduation courses in several fields of the knowledge, in addition to hosting temporary and permanent exhibitions and educational activities open to the general public. The museum manages the \"Horto Botânico\" (Botanical Garden), adjacent to the \"Paço de São Cristóvão\", as well as an advanced campus in the city of Santa Teresa, in Espírito Santothe Santa Lúcia Biological Station, jointly managed with the Museum of Biology Prof. Mello Leitão. A third site, located in the city of Saquarema, is used as a support and logistics center for field activities. Finally, the museum is also dedicated to editorial production, outstanding in that field the \"Archivos do Museu Nacional\", the oldest scientific journal of Brazil, continuously published since 1876.\n\nThe palace, which housed a large part of the collection, was destroyed in a fire on the night of 2 September 2018. The building had been called a \"firetrap\" by critics, who argued the fire was predictable and could have been prevented. In the wake of the fire, the ruined edifice is undergoing reconstruction efforts, with a metallic roof covering 5,000 m² area including debris, being treated as an \"archaeological site\".\n\nThe National Museum was officially established by His Majesty King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1769–1826) in 1818 with the name of \"Royal Museum\", in an initiative to stimulate scientific research in the Kingdom of Brazil, then a constituent part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Initially the Museum sheltered botanical and animal specimens, especially birds, what caused the old building where it was located in center of Rio de Janeiro, to be known by the population as the \"House of the Birds\".\n\nAfter that, with the marriage of King João VI's eldest son and Brazil's first Emperor, Dom Pedro I (1798–1834), with H.I. & R.H. Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria (1797-1826), the Museum started to attract the greatest European naturalists of the 19th century, such as Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (1782–1867), Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826) and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868). Other European researchers who explored the country, such as Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1799–1853) and the Baron von Langsdorff (1774–1891), contributed to the collections of the Royal Museum.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, reflecting the personal preferences of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Pedro II (1825–1891), the National Museum started to invest in the areas of the anthropology, paleontology and archaeology. The Emperor himself, who was an avid amateur scientist and enthusiastic supporter of all branches of science, contributed with several of the collections of the art of Ancient Egypt, botanical fossils, etc., which he acquired during many of his trips abroad. In this way, the National Museum was modernized and became the most important museum of Natural History and Human Sciences of South America. Edmund Roberts visited the museum in 1832, noting that the museum only had three open rooms at that time, and that the closed rooms were \"sadly plundered of its contents by Don Pedro.\"\n\nD. Pedro II was well aware of the shortage of true scientists and naturalists in Brazil. He fixed this problem by inviting foreign scientists to come to work at the Museum. The first to come was Ludwig Riedel (1761–1861), a German botanist who had participated in Baron von Langsdorff's famed expedition to Mato Grosso from 1826 to 1828. Other scientists to come were: German chemist Theodor Peckolt and American geologist and paleontologist Charles Frederick Hartt (1840–1878). In the following years the Museum gradually became known so it continued to attract several foreign scientists who wished to achieve scientific stature with their work in Brazil, such as Fritz Müller (1821–1897), Hermann von Ihering (1850–1930), Carl August Wilhelm Schwacke (1848–1894), Orville Adalbert Derby (1851–1915), Émil August Goeldi (1859–1917), Louis Couty (1854–1884) and others, all fired by museum director Ladislau Netto when the Emperor was deposed.\n\nThe Emperor was still a very popular figure when he was deposed by a military coup in 1889, so the republicans tried to erase the symbols of the Empire. One of these symbols, the Paço de São Cristóvão, the official residence of the emperors in the Quinta da Boa Vista, became vacant; therefore, in 1892, the National Museum, with all its collections, valuables and researchers, was transferred to this palace, where it stays until today.\n\nIn 1946, the Museum’s management was passed to the University of Brazil, currently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The researchers and their offices and laboratories occupy a good part of the Palace and other buildings erected at Botanical Gardens (Horto Florestal), in the Quinta da Boa Vista park. There, one can find one of the largest scientific libraries of Rio. Currently, the National Museum offers graduate courses in the following areas: Anthropology and Sociology, Botany, Geology and Paleontology, and Zoology.\n\nThe Museum sheltered one of the largest exhibits of the Americas, prior the fire, consisting of animals, insects, minerals, aboriginal collections of utensils, Egyptian mummies and South American archaeological artifacts, meteorites, fossils and many other findings.\n\nOne of the meteorites that was on display is the Bendegó meteorite, which weighs over and was discovered in 1784.\n\nThe collection of archaeology of the National Museum comprised more than 100,000 objects, covering distinct several civilizations that lived in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Middle East, since the Paleolithic Age until the 19th century. The collection is subdivided into four main segments: Ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Pre-Columbian archaeology, and Pre-Columbian Brazil last nucleus, systematically gathered since 1867, is the largest segment of the archaeological collection, as well as the most important collection of its typology in the world, covering the history of Pre-Cabraline Brazil in a very comprehensive manner and sheltering some of the most important material records related to Brazilian archaeology. It was, therefore, a collection of considerable scientific value, and object of several works of basic research, theses, dissertations, and monographs.\n\nWith more than 700 items, the collection of Egyptian archaeology of the National Museum was one of the largest of Latin America and one of the oldest in the Americas. Most part of the objects entered the museum collection in 1826, when the tradesman Nicolau Fiengo brought from Marseille an assemblage of Egyptian antiquities that belonged to the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni, who had been in charge of excavating the Theban Necropolis (modern-day Luxor) and the Temple of Karnak.\n\nThis collection had Argentina as initial destination, and had probably been ordered by the president of that country, Bernardino Rivadavia, creator of the University of Buenos Aires and a noted enthusiast of museums. However, a naval blockade at the La Plata River would impede Fiengo of completing his journey, forcing him to return from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro, where the pieces were offered at an auction. Emperor Pedro I bought the entire collection for five million \"réis\", and subsequently donated it to the National Museum. It has been suggested that the action of Pedro I would have been influenced by José Bonifácio de Andrada, a relevant early member of Freemasonry in Brazil, perhaps driven by the interest that the organization had for the Egyptian iconography.\nThe collection started by Pedro I would be expanded by his son, emperor Pedro II, amateur Egyptologist and notable collector of archaeological and ethnographic artifacts. One of the most important additions to the Egyptian collection of the National Museum made by Pedro II is the polychromed wood sarcophagus of the singer of Amun, Sha-Amun-en-su, from the Late Period, offered to the emperor as a gift during his second trip to Egypt, in 1876, by the Khedive Isma'il Pasha. The sarcophagus is distinguished for its rarity, since it is one of few examples that have never been opened, still preserving the mummy of the singer in its interior. The collection would be enriched through other acquisitions and donations, becoming, at the beginning of the 20th-century, sufficiently relevant to draw the attention of international researchers and egyptologysts, such as Alberto Childe, who served as conservator of the Department of Archaeology of the museum between 1912 and 1938, and was also responsible for publishing the \"Guide of the Collections of Classical Archaeology of the National Museum\", in 1919.\n\nBesides the forementioned coffin of Sha-Amun-en-su, the museum possesses other three sarcophagi, from the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Era, belonging to three priests of Amun: Hori, Pestjef, and Harsiese. The museum also conserves six human mummies (four adults and two children), as well as a number of mummies and sarcophagi of animals (cats, ibises, fishes, and crocodiles). Among the human examples, the highlight is a mummy of a woman from the Roman Period, which is considered extremely rare for the preparatory technique used, of which there are only eight similar examples worldwide. Called \"princess of the Sun\" or \"princess Kherima\", the mummy has her members and fingers of the hands and feet individually swaddled and is richly adorned, with painted strips. \"Princess Kherima\" is one of the most popular items of the National Museum collection, being even related to accounts of parapsychological experiences and collective trances, that supposedly occurred in the 1960s. \"Kherima\" also inspired the romance \"The Secret of the Mummy\" by Everton Ralph, member of the Rosicrucian society.\n\nThe collection of votive and funerary steles is composed of dozens of pieces dated, in their majority, from the Intermediate Period and the Late Era. The steles of Raia and Haunefer, which are graved with titles of Semitic origins present in the Bible and in the tablets of Mari, stand out, as well as an unfinished stele, attributed to the emperor Tiberius, of the Roman Period. The museum also had a vast collection of \"shabtis\", \"i.e.\" statuettes representing funerary servers, including a group of pieces that belonged to pharaoh Seti I, excavated from his tomb at the Valley of the Kings. The rare artifacts included a limestone statue of a young woman, dated of the New Kingdom, carrying a conic ointment vessel on the top of her headan iconography that is almost exclusively found among paintings and reliefs. The collection also includes fragments of reliefs, masks, statues of deities in bronze, stone and wood (such as representations of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris), canopic jars, alabaster bowls, funerary cones, jewels, amulets, etc.\n\nThe collection of classical archaeology of the National Museum added up to around 750 pieces and consists mostly of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Italiote objects, being the largest collection of its kind in Latin America. Most of the pieces previously belonged to the Greco-Roman collection of empress Teresa Cristina, who had been interested in archaeology since her youth. When the empress disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in 1843, right after her proxy wedding to emperor Pedro II, she brought an assemblage of antiquities found during the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, the Ancient Roman cities destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Part of this collection had also belonged to Carolina Murat, sister of Napoleon Bonaparte and queen consort of the king of Naples, Joachim Murat.\n\nIn turn, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of empress Teresa Cristina, had ordered the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, initiated in the 18th century, be resumed. The recovered pieces were sent to the Royal Bourbon Museum of Naples. Aiming to increase the number of classical artifacts in Brazil with a view to the future creation of a museum of Greco-Roman archaeology in the country, the empress established formal exchanges with the Kingdom of Naples. She requested the shipment of Greco-Roman objects to Rio de Janeiro, while sending artifacts of indigenous origins to Italy. The empress also personally financed excavations in Veios, an Etruscan archeological site located fifteen kilometers north of Rome, thus enabling a large part of the objects found there to be brought to Brazil. A greater part of those had been gathered between 1853 and 1859, but Teresa Cristina continued to enrich the collection until the fall of the Brazilian empire in 1889, when the Republic was proclaimed and the empress left the country with all the royal family.\n\nAmong the highlights of the collection were a set of four frescos from Pompeii, made around the 1st century AD. Two of those are decorated with marine motifs, respectively depicting a sea dragon and a seahorse as the central figure surrounded by dolphins, and had adorned the lower walls of the room of the devotees at the Temple of Isis. The other two frescos are decorated with representations of plants, birds, and landscapes, stylistically close to the paintings of Herculaneum and Stabiae. The museum also housed a large number of objects from Pompeii portraying the daily life of Ancient Roman citizens: \"fibulae\", jewels, mirrors, and other pieces of the Roman female \"toilette\", glass and bronze vessels, phallic amulets, oil lamps molded in terracotta, etc.\n\nThe collection of Mediterranean pottery comprised more than dozens of objects and is noted for the diversity of origins, shapes, decorations and utilitarian purposes. Several of the most important styles and schools of classical antiquity are represented, from the Corinthian geometric style of the 7th century BC to the Roman terracotta amphoras of the Early Christian era. The museum houses examples of \"kraters\", \"oenochoai\", \"kantharos\", chalices, \"kyathos\", cups, \"hydriai\", \"lekythoi\", \"askoi\", and \"lekanides\". The groups of Etruscan \"Bucchero\" pottery (7th–4th centuries BC), Greek black-figure vases (7th–5th centuries BC), Gnathian vessels (4th century BC), and the vast set of Italian red-figure vases, with ceramics from Apulia, Campania, Lucania and Magna Graecia, which also stand out.\n\nThe collection of sculptures comprised a large number of Tanagra figurines, small terracotta sculptures of Greek origin that were widely appreciated in the Ancient world, as well as a group of Etruscan bronze statuettes representing warriors and female figures. The collection of military artifacts included entire pieces or fragments of helmets, maces, scabbards, bronze blades, brooches and \"phalleras\".\n\nThe National Museum housed an important group of about 1,800 artifacts produced by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas during the Pre-Columbian era, as well as Andean mummies. Gathered throughout the 19th century, the collection was based on holdings of the Brazilian royal family, with several objects coming from the private collection of Emperor Pedro II. It was later enlarged through acquisitions, donations, exchanges, and excavations. By the end of the 19th-century, the collection already had considerable prestige, being cited, on the occasion of opening the 1889 Anthropological Exposition, as one of the largest collections of South American archaeology.<ref name=\"Projeto Exposição MN/UFRJ\"></ref>\n\nThe collection comprised mostly objects related to the textile manufacturing, featherwork, ceramic production, and stonecraft of the Andean cultures (groups of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina) and, to a lesser extent, of the Amazonian natives (including a rare assemblage of artifacts from the area of present-day Venezuela) and Mesoamerican cultures (mainly from present-day Mexico and Nicaragua). Several aspects of the daily routine, social organization, religiosity, and imagery of the Pre-Columbian civilizations are addressed in the collection, which has items from common daily use (clothing, body ornaments, weapons) to more refined artifacts, imbued with notable artistic sense (measurement and musical instruments, ritual objects, figurative ceramic sculptures and vessels distinguished for their aesthetic features). Other aspects of Pre-Columbian life, such as the dynamics of trade, ideological diffusion, and cultural influences among the groups, are also represented in the collection. Items are evaluated in terms of the similarity of decorative patterns and artistic techniques, as well as in the subjects portrayed. Common to nearly all distinct groups are such subjects as plants, nocturnal animals (bats, serpents, owls), and fantastic creatures associated to natural elements and phenomena.<ref name=\"Visitação Escolar MN/UFRJ\"></ref>\n\nThe best represented groups, in the context of Andean cultures, include:\n\nThe collection of Andean mummies of the National Museum allows a glimpse at the funerary practices of the cultures of the region. The mummies of the collection were preserved either naturally (as a result of the favorable geo-climatic conditions of the Andean Mountains) or artificially, in the context of religious and ritualistic practices. Originating from Chiu Chiu, at the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, there is a mummy of a man with an estimated age of 3,400 to 4,700 years, preserved in a seated position, with the head resting on the knees and covered by a wool cap. This was the position which the Atacaman cultures used to sleep, due to the cold climate of the desert. It was also the position in which they were buried, together with their belongings. A second mummy in the collectionan Aymara man, found in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca, between Peru and Boliviais preserved in the same position, but involved in a funerary bundle. The collection of mummies also include a boy, donated by the Chilean government, and, illustrating the techniques of artificial mummification of Pre-Columbian cultures, an example of a shrunken head, coming from the Jivaroan peoples of equatorial Amazon, of ritualistic purposes.\n\nThe collection of Brazilian archaeology of the National Museum brought together a vast set of artifacts produced by the cultures that flourished in the Brazilian territory during the pre-colonial era, with more than 90,000 objects. It was considered the largest collection in its typology worldwide. Gradually assembled since the early 19th century, the collection started being systematically gathered since 1867 and has been continually expanded until the present day, through excavations, acquisitions and donations, also serving as basis for a large number of research projects conducted by the academics of the museum, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and other institutions. It was composed of objects coming from all regions of Brazil, establishing a timeline spanning more than 10,000 years.\n\nFrom the oldest inhabitants of the Brazilian territory (horticulturists and hunter-gatherer groups), the museum preserved several artifacts made of stone (flint, quartz and other minerals) and bones, such as projectile points used for hunting, axe blades of polished stone and other tools used for carving, scraping, cleaving, triturating, and piercing, in addition to artifacts of ceremonial use and adornments. Although objects made of wood, fiber, and resin were also produced, the majority of them didn't stand the test of time and are almost absent in the collection, except for some individual piecesnamely a woven straw basket covered by resin, only partially preserved, found in the southern coast of Brazil.\n\nIn the segment regarding the Sambaqui people, \"i.e.\" the fishing and gathering communities which lived in the south-central coast of Brazil between 8,000 years before present and the early Christian era, the National Museum holds a large number of vestiges originating from deposits constituted of agglomerated lime and organic materialthe so-called Sambaquis, or middens. Two fragments of Sambaquis are preserved in the collection, in addition to a group of human skeletal remains found in these archaeological sites, as well as several cultural testimonies of the Sambaqui people, encompassing utilitarian objects used in routine tasks (vessels, bowls, pestles and mortars carved in stone), ceremonies and rituals (such as votive statuettes). Among the highlights of the Sambaqui collection, there is a large set of zoolites (stone sculptures of votive use, with representation of animals, such as fish and birds, and human figures).\n\nThe collection included several examples of funerary urns, rattles, dishes, bowls, clothing, dresses, idols, and amulets, with emphasis being placed on ceramic objects, produced by numerous cultures of precolonial Brazil. Best represented groups in the collection include:\n\n\n\nThe National Museum held the oldest known examples of indigenous mummies found in the Brazilian territory. The collection consisted of the body of an adult woman of approximately 25 years of age, and two children, one located at her feet, with an estimated age of twelve months, involved in a bundle, and a new-born, also covered by a mantle, positioned behind the head of the woman. This mummified set is composed of individuals that probably belonged to the group of the Botocudos (or Aimoré) people, of the Macro-Jê branch. They were found at the \"Caverna da Babilônia\", a cavern located in the city of Rio Novo, interior of the state of Minas Gerais, in a farm that belonged to Maria José de Santana, who donated the mummies to emperor Pedro II. As an act of gratitude for this favor, Pedro II awarded Maria José with the title of Baroness of Santana.\n\nFrom 2014 the museum faced budget cuts that dropped its maintenance to less than R$520,000 annually. The budget was so low, there was $0.01 to spend on each of the artifacts. The building fell into disrepair, evidenced by peeling wall material, exposed electrical wiring, and termite problem. By June 2018, the museum's 200th anniversary, it had reached a state of near-complete abandonment. There was an offer from The World Bank to purchase the museum for $80m, which was turned down because the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro would have to give up ownership.\n\nThe building was heavily damaged by a large fire which began about 19:30 local time (23:30 UTC) on September 2, 2018.\n\nAlthough some items were saved, it is believed that 92.5 % of its archive of 20 million items was destroyed in the fire, though circa 1.5 million items are stored in a separate building, which were not damaged. \n\nFirst responders fighting the fire were hindered by a lack of water. Rio's fire chief claimed that two nearby fire hydrants had insufficient water, leaving firefighters to resort to pumping water from a nearby lake. According to a CEDAE () employee, although the hydrants did have water, the water pressure was very low, due to the fact that the building is on top of a hill. Brazil President Michel Temer claimed the loss due to the fire to be too great to have been predicted.\n\nMuseum Deputy Director Luiz Fernando Dias Daniel pointed to neglect by successive governments as a cause of the fire, saying that curators \"fought with different governments to get adequate resources to preserve what is now completely destroyed\" and that he felt \"total dismay and immense anger.\" The museum lacked a fire sprinkler system, although there were smoke detectors and a few fire extinguishers. The museum did not receive the R$ 520,000 per year necessary for its maintenance since 2014, and it closed temporarily in 2015 when cleaning and security staff could no longer be paid. Repairs to a popular exhibit hall had to be crowd-funded, and the museum's maintenance budget had been cut by 90 per cent by 2018. There were visible signs of decay before the fire, such as peeling walls and exposed wiring. The museum celebrated its 200th anniversary in June 2018 in a situation of partial abandonment; no state ministers attended the occasion.\n\nA large fire broke out shortly after the museum closed on 2 September 2018, reaching all three floors of the National Museum building. Firefighters were called at 19:30 local time (22:30 UTC) and arrived quickly at the scene. However, the fire chief reported that the two fire hydrants closest to the museum had no water, and trucks had to be sent to a nearby lake. According to the spokesman for the fire department, the fire crews went inside the burning building to rescue artifacts, despite there being no people inside, and they were able to remove items with the help of museum staff.\n\nThe fire was out of control by 21:00 (00:00 UTC 3 September), with great flames and occasional explosions, being fought by firefighters from four sectors. Dozens of people went to Quinta da Boa Vista to see the fire. A specialized team of firefighters entered the building at 21:15 to block areas still not hit by the flames and to evaluate the extent of the damage. However, by 21:30, the whole building had been engulfed by the fire, including exhibitions of Imperial rooms that were in the two areas at the front of the main building. The four security guards who were on duty at the museum managed to escape; first reports stated that there were no casualties, although a firefighter suffered burns to the fingers while trying to rescue the Luzia’s fossil.\n\nTwo fire engines were used with turntable ladders, with two water trucks taking turns to supply water. The Brazilian Marine Corps also provided fire engines, water trucks, and a decontamination unit from a nearby base. Pictures on social media showed artifacts being rescued from the burning building by firefighters and civilians.\n\nAt 22:00 (01:00 UTC 3 September), dozens of museum employees joined the fight against the flames. Two floors of the building were already destroyed by this time, and the roof had collapsed. Brazilian Culture Minister Sérgio Sá Leitão suggested that it was probably caused by either an electric fault or by a sky lantern accidentally landing on the building.\n\nA building area of 13600 m² with 122 rooms were destroyed. The building was started on 1803 with luso-lebanese \"Elie Antun Lubbus\". According to museum officials, approximately 92.5 percent of the collection has been destroyed. The building was uninsured.\n\nA spokesman for the fire department reported that pieces had been recovered from the blaze, due to efforts from firefighters and workers from the museum. Information about the condition of pieces that had been displayed started being reported as early as late 2 September, when the images of items had been shared. One of these was a Roman fresco from Pompeii that had survived the eruption of Vesuvius, but was lost in the fire.\n\nPreservation director of the museum João Carlos Nara told reporters that \"very little will be left\" and that they would \"have to wait until the firefighters have completed their work here in order to really assess the scale of it all.\" The next day, firefighters began more salvage work inside the museum, trying to rescue what they could from beneath the charred remains of the collapsed roof.\n\nThe collection relating to indigenous languages is believed to have been completely destroyed, including the recordings since 1958, the chants in all the extinct languages, the Curt Nimuendajú archives (papers, photos, negatives, the original ethnic-historic-linguistic map localizing all the ethnic groups in Brazil, the only extant record from 1945), and the ethnological and archeological references of all ethnic groups in Brazil since the 16th century. One of the linguistic researchers, Bruna Franchetto, who returned only to see her office as a pile of ash, criticised the fact that a project to back up the collection digitally had only just received funding and barely started, asking for any student who had ever come to the museum to scan or photocopy things for projects to send a copy back.\n\nThe fire destroyed the museum's collection of thousands of indigenous artifacts from the country's pre-Columbian Indo-American culture. The items include many indigenous peoples' remains as well as relics amassed in the personal collection of Pedro II. This collection also featured items from present native tribes, including \"striking feather art by the Karajá people\". There are only about 3,000 Karajá people left.\nIndigenous peoples expressed anger that there was no money given to a museum with indigenous history but \"the city had recently managed to find a huge budget to build a brand new museum of tomorrow\". Cira Gonda also confirmed shortly after the fire that the Indigenous linguistics collected had been completely destroyed, and so that original recordings of spoken word and song in dead languages have been lost, as well as other artifacts including those detailing the land and language distribution of tribes in Brazil.\n\nSome items survived the fire. The Bendegó meteorite from the museum's collection of meteorites, which is the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Brazil, was unscathed. According to the National Geographic Society, being a \"large, metallic rock\" is what saved it from damage, as these qualities make it fire-resistant. From images and video of salvage after the fire, at least three other meteorites also survived undamaged. However another meteorite called \"Angra dos Reis\" is rediscovered among the debris. The meteorite is worth R$ 3 million and was lost in the rubble of the National Museum. With a mass 76 thousand times smaller than that of Bendegó, with mere 65 grams and 4 cm long, Angra dos Reis rock is the most valuable of the collection and was already the object of meteorite hunters. The Angra dos Reis takes its name because it was sighted by the doctor \"Joaquim Carlos Travassos\", who passed in a boat in front of \"Praia Grande\", in Angra and recovered it in the city of the coast of Rio de Janeiro in 1869. It was the first of a class of space travelers until very rare today. The object in smoke fell in the sea in front of the Church of Bonfim. Travassos ordered the slaves accompanying him to dive. Two pieces were rescued. One of them, with half a kilo, was entrusted to the Judge of Law of Angra dos Reis and, later, donated to the National Museum. In more than a century of research, this fragment was divided into small portions. The biggest one is buried in the rubble of the museum. Some Meteorites were found on October 19, 2018, inclusive the \"Angra dos Reais\", however cooked.\n\nOther fractions were lost in the experiments, but much smaller fractions of the Angra are still known, with a maximum of 2.5 grams, scattered in collections and owned by researchers. From the existing reports, Travassos presented the father-in-law with the second fragment rescued from the sea, which would have about 1 kg. Since then, the trail of this rock has been lost, but could be in the Catholic Church possession. Researchers suspect, due to the characteristics of the original stone fittings, that there is a third, possibly still submerged in the Angra sea. For more than a century, it was the only copy of which one had science. Until, in the late 1990s, other rocks were discovered or reclassified as \"angrito\", a nomenclature given in reference to Angra dos Reis. According to The Meteoritical Society, there are only 28 known in the world. They are composed of minerals forged only at the very high temperatures of the planet's nucleus. They are the oldest magmatic rocks we know, formed when the solar system was still a cloud of gas and dust. It is estimated that the National Museum meteorite is 4.56 billion years old. For geologists and astronomers, the little rock is a book full of clues about the origin of the sun and the planets. It was in a box in a closet.\n\nIn the days following the fire, firefighters recovered several portraits from the upper floor of the museum, which had been burnt, smoke and water damaged but not destroyed. Cristiana Serejo, deputy director of the museum, also said that \"part of the zoological collection, the library and some ceramics\" had survived. Images were shared of research microscopes, freezers, and specimen jars being collected outside of the building by museum staff during the fire, next to a rusted hydrant. During the fire, part of the Zoology department pulled out mollusks and other marine specimens, and only stopped due to the imminent danger the fire posed. The fire did not reach an annex of the site where vertebrate specimens were kept, but due to a loss of electricity parts of the collection could become damaged.\n\nDuring the salvage an intact skull that appeared to be that of Luzia Woman was found, and sent to a nearby scientific laboratory for analysis. Due to other skulls and fragments of bones were discovered in the remains of the building prompting a need for lab testing on the found items. On October 19, 2018 it was anounced that the Luzia skull indeed was found however as many fragments, which 80 % were identified as being part of the frontal (forehead and nose), side, bones that are more resistant and the fragment of a femur that also belonged to the fossil and was stored. A part of the box where Luiza's skull was, was also recovered. Though the assembly of them was postponed. The bones became white, because the earth along them were burned.\n\nA portion of the museum's collection, specifically the herbarium, and fish and reptile species, was housed elsewhere and has not been affected. There was also a large scientific library within the museum, containing thousands of rare works. People on social media were reported to have found burnt pages from the library in the nearby streets; it was later confirmed that the library proper is housed in an adjacent building and was mostly undamaged. Some burnt pages, of unknown origin, were recovered by security guards. Nine Torah scrolls from the 15th century had previously been on display but were in the library at the time and survived.\n\nBrazil's president, Michel Temer, said that \"the loss of the National Museum is incalculable for Brazil. Today is a tragic day for our country's museology. Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost. The value of our history cannot be measured now, due to the damage to the building that housed the Royal Family during the Empire. It is a sad day for all Brazilians.\" His statement was echoed by Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella, who called for rebuilding stating: \"It's a national obligation to reconstruct it from the ashes, recompose every detail of the paintings and photos. Even if they are not original, they will continue to be a reminder of the royal family that gave us independence, the empire and the first constitution and national unity\".\n\nThe archaeologist Zahi Hawass says that the tragedy legitimizes the movement for the repatriation of Egyptian objects in museums around the world and that if museums are not able to guarantee the safety and conservation of the objects, the archaeologist argues that to be returned to the native land. Although the collection of the National Museum was not targeted by Egyptian archaeologists, Hawass says that the destruction of the collection strengthens the movement for the repatriation of objects and that UNESCO observes countries with overseas collections and overseas museums to control them, to ensure that objects are properly protected and restored.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron expressed his condolences on Twitter at the event. He offered to send experts to help rebuild the museum.\n\nBrazilian environmentalist and politician Marina Silva called the fire \"a lobotomy of the Brazilian memory\".\n\nNews of the fire quickly spread through the city of Rio de Janeiro, and protesters turned up at the gates in the early hours of Monday morning. Initial reports suggested that there were 500 people, forming a chain around the still-smoking building. Some of the protesters tried to climb over fencing into the museum grounds; the police who were called to attend, in full riot gear, threw tear gas bombs into the crowds. The public were later allowed to enter the grounds.\n\nA group of museum studies students from the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro called for the public to send in any photographs or videos of the destroyed collections. Their appeal received 14,000 videos, photos, and drawings of the museum's exhibitions within hours.\n\nThe president of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, \"Kátia Bogéa\", said that \"It's a national and worldwide tragedy. Everybody can see that this is not a loss for the Brazilian people, but for the whole humanity\" and commented that it was \"a predictable tragedy, because we've known for a long time that Brazilian cultural heritage has no budget\".\n\nMuseums around the world sent their condolences. In the UK, the British Library said \"our hearts go out to the staff and users of [the National Museum] of Brazil\" and called the fire \"a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of our shared global heritage\"; London's Natural History Museum, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Institution were among other institutions expressing their sorrow. The head of the Australian Museum said that she was \"shocked\", \"devastated\", and \"distraught\". Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities expressed both solidarity with the museum and concern over the status of more than 700 ancient Egyptian artifacts that were housed in the building. It offered to send experts, if requested by the Brazilian government, to assist the National Museum in restoring the damaged pieces.\n\nOn 12 September 2018, people began implementing a plan to temporarily shelter and work with what is currently the ruins of the Museum:\n\n\nThis plan cost R$ 9 million, offered by Brazilian Government as an emergency budget and received since then by Museum. The contracted company to reinstall the walls of building is \"Concrejato\" at a value of R$ 8.998.057,66 and Unesco says that the reconstruction would take 10 years to get ready. Researchers are recreating 300 parts of the collection of the National Museum, including the skull of Luzia, with 3D printers. The studies are being resumed in a laboratory of the National Institute of Technology (INT), by master's and doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe museum is still alive doing some Festivals called \"Museu Nacional Vive\" or \"Museum lives\" to public in tents mounted in front of current under construction improvements to the burned headquarters, with exposition of fossils, living snakes and taxidermied animals like Pterosaurs and Armadillo among others. Museum would do a permanent exposition outside. Some opinions say it would take R$100 millions to rebuild the main dependencies. With the exception of a few metal cabinets intact, there are only charred fragments. Around 80% of the roof and 60% of the floors have been affected. The one million euro aid announced by Germany would allow the installation of laboratories for analysis of archaeological finds. Museum director said there is a collective effort to rebuild the collection, pursue research, and plan the reconstruction of the institution housing six major graduate programs. He reported that classes, thesis defenses and dissertations were resumed and knowledge production did not stop. \"The National Museum has lost part of its collection but has not lost the ability to create knowledge and do science,\" said the director. The social anthropology library, one of the most important in Latin America and totally destroyed by the fire, has received a considerable amount of donations, including the personal library of Rio de Janeiro researcher \"Gilberto Velho\" (1945-2012), who was dean of the Department of Anthropology of the museum until his death. Museum zoologists have already gone to the field to collect new specimens in an attempt to repopulate the invertebrate collection, one of the richest (with 5 million copies only in the case of insects) and harder hit by the fire. Before a revamped headquarters is available, Kellner said the museum's intention is to re-display its collection - still considerable - to the public. There is a collective funding campaign to allow the institution's loan back to schools and the plan to revitalize the museum's botanical garden so that it houses a small exhibition that would receive visitors again. \"It would be an illusion, even a frivolous thing, to say that the old collection will be reconstituted, but we will continue to fulfill our role,\" said the director. It was also informed they plan to keep part of ruins as historical exposition with a high modern structure of equipment inside.\n\nThe Facade and the exterior of the National Museum will be preserved in the reconstruction works, but the building will be another, said the UFRJ's dean, \"Roberto Leher\". The recovery of the building will take into account a new concept of architecture. The cost will still depend on the concept of the museum. Technicians focus are on 3D modeling and a term of reference. New materials with low-carbon, energy-less, environmentally friendly will be used because is a science museum. It has Iphan's endorsement (since the property is overturned) to do the reconstruction taking this model into account. The new project could be with high roof space or with more slabs, depending the approval of R$ 100 million or € 22.610.000,00 in the budget of 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe director of the National Museum, Alexander W. A. Kellner, issued an open letter addressed to presidential candidates Jair Messias Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad on October 15, 2018 Monday evening, which, along two pages, reinforces the historical importance of the institution, and recalls that his survival is tied to the responsibility of those who hold \"power in the hands.\"\n\nThe document is also destined for the National Congress, where he had regularly gone to ask for a public hearing, during which he will ask for the inclusion of resources for the museum, and for the next budget. Without these resources, he says the institution will end up for years, harming decades of research.\n\nIn the letter, the director says that many reflect on what could have been done differently to avoid a disaster that led to the loss of an invaluable patrimony, involving millions of cultural and scientific pieces. And he adds that \"others should (or should) be deeply reflecting on why, being in a position of decision, they did not act firmly in triggering actions that would have avoided the absurdity of that loss.\"\n\nOn October 17, 2018 the Director of Museum had a meeting with federal deputies to solve first R$ 50 million to reinstall the front part of Palace.\n\nOn final of October 2018, the Museum's Director atended an audience in Brasília at Chamber of Deputies in order to guarantee R$ 56 millions for basic reconstruction of front part of main building, #1, including the facade, roof and its structure. He negotiated the money before the President elected Jair Bolsonaro be sworn in, afraid the building would remain destroyed for years in abandoned situation. Also the containers laboratories were not received. On October 31, 2018 the House of Representatives in Brasilia approved an amendment of R$ 55 millions to the budget of 2019. This should have to be further approved by a \"Joint Committee\" and also by the \"Congress Plenary\". The Director travelled to China to guarantee pieces of collection to the museum.\n\nA proposal by Senator \"Maria do Carmo Alves (DEM-SE)\" under analysis in the Commission of Education, Culture and Sport includes in the official Brazilian calendar the National Day of the Museum, to be celebrated on May 18.\n\nUntil December 2018, the concern was the change of Brazilian Government, because none of the transition teams of the future governor of Rio de Janeiro, neither president of the Republic Jair Messias Bolsonaro have sought the direction of the museum to talk about the disaster that hit the House of the Imperial Family. Even then, the Containers to store restored objects, until the reconstruction work is completed, had not yet been delivered by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which did not express its opinion on the delay.\n\nSince then, years, months and days have passed since the fire.\n\n\n"}

Newspaper production is an act that actually starts from the gathering of news stories, articles, opinions, advertorials and advertisements to printing and folding of the so called “Hard Copy”. Usually the news are printed onto newsprint. The whole production process can be divided into four parts, they are: Content gathering, Pre Press, Press and Post Press.\n\nTypical newspaper content can be dived in two parts: News/Information and Advertisement. \n\nNews production starts with the reporters going out to their respective beat to gather stories and cover events and also the marketing department getting advertisement into the newspaper on daily basis. It starts with reporters getting their stories ready daily and sending their stories in electronically through their mails to the editor. Each reporter works with a particular desk in the newsroom, some of these desks are: Metro desk, Sport desk, Business desk, Political desk, Education desk and others. News gathering and dissemination is paramount to every newspaper as this is the responsibility of the newspaper house to the people and this can determine their level of advertiser’s patronage.\nAfter stories are gathered, the Sub Editors are saddled with the responsibility of editing copies submitted by the reporter using a red pen or red font color, the Chief Sub Editor uses blue while the Editor uses green. This tells that each of the editing done on a particular story is still subjected to the final editing done by either the Chief Sub Editor or the Editor. Some newsrooms have started to automate parts of the news gathering on digital and social platforms.\n\nPre press is where photos are edited, advertisements are created and composed and the whole pages of the newspapers are laid-out and designed. \n\nAfter stories have been edited, the editor and other sub editors will sit in an editorial conference to determine what goes inside the paper for the day. Then, each sub editor is expected to plan their pages if possible. The marketing department also will forward the advertisements that have been paid for with specification of the pages allotted to the advert, all these will be forwarded to editorial department so as to add these pages in their planning process. The newspaper planning is done on a dummy sheet to give a prototype of the final outlook of each pages, this is called page planning. \nAfter the planning, the editorial department forwards the already planned pages to the graphic section where the dummy sheets are transformed the a meaningful digital form. At the pre press, text, pictures, cutline, graphics, and graphical illustrations as well as color are put together to form the newspaper pages. Smaller newspapers sometimes still use desktop publishing programs (DTP) such as Corel Draw, Adobe PageMaker, Adobe InDesign, Quark XPress and other graphic design software. This software enables the graphic designer to easily compose pages and output them on a hardcopy proof-printer for proofreading and sending the corrected and finished pages to a RIP (Raster Image Processor). The RIP transformes PostScript (PS/EPS) or PDF pages into rasterized TIFF G4 data. The TIFF data is usually imaged in a CTP-device using a Laser directly onto the offset printing plates. Earlier – and even sometimes nowadays – data imaging was done using a film-workflow. So the data was imaged at first onto a film and then the film was copied with UV-light onto UV-sensitive offset printing plates. The final stage in the newspaper pre-press phase is preparing the imaged offset printing plates for mounting onto the plate cylinder inside of the offset press. The plates have to be bent and often also punched so that they can be mounted easily and proper on the plate cylinder. \n\nIn order to produce good color quality newspaper follow WAN-IFRA and ISO standards namely ISO 12647-3 (2013) and Ifra Special Report 1-2008. \n\nThe printing process is the main process step during newspaper production. Quickness and reliability with at the same time reasonable producing are the cornerstones in the production and processing of print products. Newspaper presses produce not just goods in process (sheets, signatures or reels of printout) as it is the case with typical printing presses. Instead newspaper rotary presses can produce copies which are finished goods. \n\nThe typical newspaper press is divided into two parts: printing and folding.\n\nThe first functions of a newspaper press are loading and unwinding of newsprint reels. These functions are provided by the \"paster\". Pasters unwind paper reels and automatically change paper reels at full production speed (e.g. 100.000 copies per hour). Often pasters are place below the printing towers. The towers often consist of four printing units to print Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black ink onto the newsprint. The newsprint web travels upwards in the printing tower during the color is applied to it on both sides of the reel. Usually for every page there is one individual printing plate per color. This printing plate is mounted onto the plate cylinder within the printing unit which again is part of the printing tower. Modern presses can print full color on every page. Four color printing units are used for printing on one side of the paper web and another four printing units apply the backside print onto the paper web. Printing front and backside can happen simultaneously (blanket-to-blanket-configuration) or after another (satellite configuration) The printing units cannot just print one page like in digital printing, instead printing towers in newspaper presses can print up to 24 broadsheet pages in full color. If the press consists of several towers much more pages can be printed at once. \n\nThe folder starts were the printed webs come together. The Folder can produce ribbons and combine these ribbons in such a way that the pages are sorted ontop of each other. The folding process starts in the so called super structure and ends in the main foling units at the end of the press process. The ribbons are cut in such a way that the pages of the newspaper are separated from each other and the folder lays down the newspaper copies onto the delivery belt. \n\nThe first real newspaper presses was produced by Koenig & Bauer. The Times in London was printed at first on a rotary/flat machine press instead of a hand press in the night from 28 to 29 November 1819. Today also other manufacturers such as Goss, Manroland Web Systems, TKS, Mitsubishi and TPH are in the press market. \n\nThe copies are collected on the delivery belt and usually transported to the mailroom using a gripper conveyor system. The post press area is also often called mailroom because here the copies are prepared for mailing to the customers. Newspaper copies can be bundled directly so that they are ready to be put into a truck for transportation. Alternatively extra preprints from the newspaper press or flyers/brochures from external sources can inserted into the newspaper copies before creating bundles. Mailroom systems are mostly manufactured by three companies (Ferag, Müller Martini and Schur). \n"}
{"id": "2672029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2672029", "title": "Old Farmer's Almanac", "text": "Old Farmer's Almanac\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac is a reference book containing weather forecasts, planting charts, astronomical data, recipes, and articles. Topics include: gardening, sports, astronomy, and folklore. The \"Almanac\" also features sections that predict trends in fashion, food, home, technology, and living for the coming year.\n\nReleased the first Tuesday in the September that precedes the year printed on its cover, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" has been published continuously since 1792, making it the oldest continuously published periodical in North America.\n\nThe first \"Old Farmer's Almanac\" (then known as \"The Farmer's Almanac\") was edited by Robert B. Thomas, the publication's founder.\n\nThere were many competing almanacs in the 18th century, but Thomas's upstart was a success. In its second year, distribution tripled to 9,000. The initial cost of the book was six pence (about four cents).\n\nTo calculate the \"Almanac\"s weather predictions, Thomas studied solar activity, astronomy cycles and weather patterns and used his research to develop a secret forecasting formula, which is still in use today. Other than the \"Almanac\"s prognosticators, few people have seen the formula. It is kept in a black tin box at the \"Almanac\" offices in Dublin, New Hampshire.\n\nThomas also started drilling a hole through the \"Almanac\" so that subscribers could hang it from a nail or a string.\n\nThomas served as editor until his death on May 19, 1846. As its editor for more than 50 years, Thomas established \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" as America's \"most enduring\" almanac by outlasting the competition.\n\nIn 1832, with his almanac having survived longer than similarly named competitors, Thomas inserted the word \"Old\" in the title, later dropping it in the title of the 1836 edition. After Thomas's death, John Henry Jenks was appointed editor and, in 1848, the book's name was permanently and officially revised to \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\".\n\nIn 1851, Jenks made another change to the \"Almanac\" when he featured a \"four seasons\" drawing on the cover by Boston artist Hammatt Billings, engraved by Henry Nichols. Jenks dropped the new cover for three years and then reinstated it permanently in 1855. This trademarked design is still in use today.\n\nIn 1858, Abraham Lincoln may have used a copy of \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" to argue the innocence of his client, William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who was on trial for murder in Beardstown, Illinois. Lincoln used an almanac to refute the testimony of Charles Allen, an eyewitness who claimed he had seen the crime by the light of the moon on August 29, 1857.\n\nThe book stated that not only was the Moon in the first quarter, but it was riding \"low\" on the horizon, about to set. Because the actual almanac used in the trial was not retained for posterity, there exists some controversy as to whether \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" was the one used. In 2007, a competing almanac, the \"Farmers' Almanac\", based in Lewiston, Maine, ran an article claiming that the almanac in question may have been theirs.\nIn 1861, Charles Louis Flint became editor and provided his readers with a heavier emphasis on farming. The next two editors, John Bobies Tileston and Loomis Joseph Campbell, served short terms and made no format changes.\nRobert Ware took over as the book's sixth editor in 1877 and served for 23 years before his brother, Horace, was named to the position in 1900. During Horace Everett Ware's 19 years as editor, he began to orient the book toward a more general audience by replacing the scientific agricultural articles with general features on nature and modern life.\nThe eighth and ninth editors, Frank B. Newton and Col. Carroll J. Swan, kept \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" tradition alive through wartime and the Depression.\nRoger Scaife was appointed editor in 1936. His term coincided with the only time in the history of \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" that its distribution declined and the book's financial stability fell into question. The 1938 edition had a circulation of less than 89,000, compared with 225,000 in 1863.\nDuring his tenure, Scaife also committed the greatest of all blunders in \"Almanac\" history: In the 1938 edition, he dropped the weather forecasts. In their place, he substituted temperature and precipitation averages. The public outcry was so great that he reinstated the forecasts in the next year's edition, but the decision had already destroyed his reputation.\n\nIn 1939, Robb Sagendorph, founder and president of Yankee, Inc. (later known as Yankee Publishing, Inc.), acquired the publishing rights to \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" and became its editor. Sagendorph had moved his family to Dublin, New Hampshire in 1930, and started the magazine \"Yankee\" in 1935.\n\nFeeling that tradition was \"The Old Farmer's Almanac's\" strongest suit, Sagendorph immediately reestablished its format and editorial style to reflect the interests of the general populace much as it had a century earlier. He was fond of quoting Robert B. Thomas, who wrote in 1829 that the Almanac \"strives to be useful, but with a pleasant degree of humor.\" Under Sagendorph's leadership, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" thrived and readership grew each year.\n\nDuring World War II, a German spy was apprehended in New York with a copy of the 1942 \"Old Farmer's Almanac\" in his pocket.\n\nFrom 1943 through 1945, to comply with the U.S.\nOffice of Censorship's voluntary\n\"Code of Wartime Practices\" for press and radio, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" featured weather indications rather than forecasts. This allowed it to maintain its perfect record of continuous publication.\n\nSagendorph served as the \"Almanac\"s editor until his death in 1970. His nephew, Judson D. Hale, Sr., took over and kept the \"Almanac\" true to the vision of his uncle. In 2000, the editorial reins were passed to Janice Stillman, the first woman in the \"Almanac\"s history to hold the position. She is the 13th person to hold the title of editor since it was first published in 1792. Hale still acts as the publication's editor in chief. In 1992, the \"Almanac\"s distribution passed the four million mark. It is still headquartered in Dublin, New Hampshire.\n\nIn the 1990s, the editors decided to discontinue drilling the hole in the \"Almanac\" because it was costing them $40,000 a year and they felt that it was no longer needed. However, when they surveyed their subscribers, the response was overwhelmingly in favor of keeping the holes, so the editors decided to continue drilling them.\n\n\"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" publishes four editions per year. Its annual circulation is 3 million copies.\n\nThe only difference between the three U.S. editions is the city by which astronomical information is calculated and how tide times are presented. The National edition is fitted for Boston and the New England states; the Southern edition is fitted for Atlanta and the southern states; and the Western edition is fitted for San Francisco and the western states. Each edition contains calculations to answer for all the United States.\n\nIn 1982, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" began publishing an annual Canadian edition. This edition is fitted for Ottawa, with calculations to answer for all the Canadian provinces, and features provincial weather forecasts as well as stories that speak specifically to the history, traditions, and culture of the country.\n\nForecasts emphasize temperature and precipitation deviations from averages. These are based on 30-year statistical averages prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and updated every ten years. The most recent climatological normals tabulation spans the period 1971 through 2000.\n\nWhile \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" has always looked to Thomas's original formula to help with predictions, its forecasting methods have been refined over the years. Today, they also incorporate observations of sunspots and other solar activity. Weather trends and events are predicted by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity.\n\nForecasts are prepared as much as 18 months in advance and presented in each edition by region. There are 16 regions for the U.S. and five for Canada in their respective country editions. Four additional regions are available on the Almanac's Web site, Almanac.com. These include Hawaii and Alaska for the U.S. and the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories for Canada.\n\nIn 2008, the \"Almanac\" stated that the earth had entered a global cooling period that would probably last decades. The journal based its prediction on sunspot cycles. Said contributing meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo, \"Studying these and other factor suggests that cold, not warm, climate may be our future.\"\n\nThe accuracy of \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s predictions has been challenged. John Walsh, University of Illinois Atmospheric Sciences professor emeritus, reviewed the accuracy of five years of monthly forecasts from 32 weather stations around the county and found 50.7% of the monthly temperature forecasts and 51.9% of precipitation forecasts to correctly predict a deviation from averages.\n\nIn its bicentennial edition, the \"Almanac\" stated, \"neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy.\"\n\nUnder \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" brand, Yankee Publishing also produces \"The Old Farmer's Almanac Garden Guide\", an annual gardening resource, and \"The Old Farmer's Almanac for Kids\", an Almanac-inspired book designed for children ages 8 and up. The latter is published every other year.\n\nIn addition to annual and biannual books, the \"Almanac\" has inspired a line of themed calendars including Gardening, Weather Watcher's, and Country (all for wall display); Every Day (with advice, folklore, and quotes in a page-a-day format); and a spiral-bound Engagement calendar.\nOver the years, the Almanac has published several cookbooks, food-related magazines, and a guide for homeowners.\n\"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" has also inspired a chain of retail locations called The Old Farmer's Almanac General Store. Some store locations include Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut; the Louisiana Boardwalk shopping center in Bossier City, Louisiana; and the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Sparks, Nevada at the Legends at Sparks Marina shopping center, and The Outlets at Sands Bethlehem in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1996, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" launched Almanac.com. This online presence features the same kind of information found in the print edition, including weather forecasts, astronomy, folklore, recipes, gardening advice, history, and trivia.\n\nThe Almanac Webcam was installed and launched in February 2003. A second camera was installed and launched in September 2008. New cameras were installed and launched on May 8, 2015, giving a much clearer picture of the historical buildings in downtown Dublin, NH and The John Pierce Memorial Garden.\nIn 2003, \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\" distributed a 32-page \"Almanac Just For Kids\". The positive response led to the release of \"The Old Farmer's Almanac for Kids\" in 2005, and the Almanac launched Almanac4kids.com. This site is dedicated to content for younger readers, their parents, and teachers, featuring interactive activities and exclusive articles that further explore topics found in the book.\n\nIn addition to the official websites, the Almanac also maintains a large social media presence. The Almanac can be found on Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, and several other social sites. In August 2015, The Almanac's Facebook page reached 1 million fans.\n\n\n"}

At the court \"a quo\", the evidence tendered by the State consisted of alleged pointings out by the accused, and eyewitness evidence.\n\nMelani argued\n, \"inter alia\", that the accuseds' fundamental rights had been infringed as they had not been properly warned of their right to legal representation before the pointings out.\n\nThe court held that the content of the right to legal representation had in fact not been properly conveyed.\n\nThe right to consult with a legal practitioner and especially the right to be informed of this right, was found to be closely related to, and protective of, the presumption of innocence, the right to silence and the proscription of compelled confessions.\n\nFailure to recognize the importance of this right would have the effect of depriving persons, especially the uneducated, unsophisticated or poor, of the protection of their rights.\n\nThis was found to offend not only the concept of substantive fairness, but also the right to equality before the law.\n\nThe court held that accused No. 1 had merely been informed of his right to legal representation which was not explained to him at all and accused No. 2 had not been informed of his right at all.\n\nTherefore, in order to give proper effect to an accused's rights, he had to be informed of his right to consult with counsel in a manner that it could reasonably be supposed that he had understood the content of the right.\n"}

The Cinematheque was founded in cooperation between Sapir Academic College (thanks to Professor Haim Bereshit, the manager of the Media and Cinema School at the college) and Sderot mayor Eli Moyal. \n\nThere are two film screening halls at the Cinematheque, which's number of seats together add up to around 400.\n\nOf the many events hosted by the Cinematheque, the Cinema South International Film Festival, in which films from all over the world and Israel, as well as Final Film Projects of Sapir Academic College graduates are screened, is the Cinematheque's biggest event of the year. \n\nManager of the Sapir Academic College's Media and Cinema School Professor Haim Bereshit and mayor of Sderot Eli Moyal had the initial vision of founding the Cinematheque. The Cinematheque is the first educational and cultural cinema institution in the Southern District of Israel. The main goals of the Cinematheque were bringing about culture into the daily lives of the Southern District population, as well as minimizing the gaps between the Center of Israel and the South's populations. By definition, a Cinematheque is an institution that encourages the love of film. The Cinematheque in Sderot gives every person the chance to enjoy its activities, without worrying about their socio-economic status. One of its main goals is the promoting of the Israeli Cinema's various activities, including festivals, seminars, special screenings, meetings with creators, musical and cultural events, courses, and workshops. One of the unique things about the Cinematheque is that it exposes the audience to several Israeli/foreign productions, documentaries/feature films, and more, accompanied by creators who bring up social issues using cinematic language. The Cinematheque is active seven days a week, with an average of three to six screenings per day.\n\n"}

It was added to UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009.\n\nThe custom dates to pagan antiquity, and remains typical for this region. The primary task of Zvončari is to scare away evil spirits of winter and to stir up new spring-time cycle. During the Rijeka Carnival time Zvončari march from village to village throughout the region, following the same centuries-old route, making an extraordinary amount of noise, fueled in part by the wine provided by the locals en route.\nThe standard Zvončar costume includes white trousers, striped shirt, and a sheepskin throw. In their hands they hold a \"balta\" or \"bačuka\" - a stylized mace, and around the waist one or more big brass bells. The costume varies from village to village; for example, Zvončari of Halubje and (Dondolaši) wear special stylized masks representing fantastic animal heads, while Zvončari of Žejane and wear \"flower hats\". A legend tells that Zvončari scared away invading Tatars or Turks. According to the legend the shepherds put masks on their heads, belted on bells, and produced a deafening noise that scared the enemy away. From that time on, a mace became part of the standard equipment of Zvončari. The Zvončari participate regularly in the international Rijeka Carnival.\n\n\n"}
