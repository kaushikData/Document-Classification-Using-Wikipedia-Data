First published in the United Kingdom around 1840, the book is laid out in the style of a catechism and proved very popular. 47 editions were printed by 1905 in English alone and translations made into various other languages. A revised version was produced for the US market which was digitised and republished in 2005 as part of \"Making of America IV: the American voice, 1850–1877\".\n\nAlthough presented itself as an accurate science text, the book actually promotes religious ideas, including divine design.\n\nThe popularity of \"The Guide to Science\" enabled Brewer to gather material for his \"Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" which remains a classic reference work.\n\nThe object of \"The Guide to Science\" was to present answers to over 2000 questions about common phenomena. There are questions dealing with the man-made objects such as candles, stoves and chimneys as well as answers seeking to explain natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning (including a mention of ball lightning), clouds, dew and rainbows. Brewer intended that his book should be intelligible to a child, since children might often ask the questions he was seeking to answer, but without being so foolish as to offend the scientific.\n\nThe book is separated into two or three parts, depending upon the edition, each part having several chapters. \"Part one\" deals with questions relating to heat such as the sources of heat and its effects on humans and animals, while \"Part two\" deals with questions relating to air, explaining why metal rusts in air, the operation of barometers and the transmission of sound. A \"Miscellaneous\" section deals with several more nebulous questions, including questions about sleep and dreaming. Within each part, the different chapters break the questions and answers up into subject areas organised thematically.\n\n\"The Guide to Science\" had its origin in a habit of Brewer's of making and saving notes from his reading. He set his notes out in a question-and-answer or catechism style, leaving a space for answers when they were obtained. Brewer bound his book into a volume and, disregarding advice from one man of science to burn it, sought to have it published. His initial offer to Thomas Jarrold to sell the copyright for 50 pounds was rejected. Instead, Jarrold agreed to publish the book under a profit sharing arrangement. The ultimate success of the book meant that this arrangement proved to be very profitable for both Brewer and Jarrold with Jarrold later refusing to sell his share back to Brewer even when offered 4000 pounds.\nThe exact date of the book's first publication is uncertain. Brewer believed it was 1840 but other sources suggest 1841 or as late as 1847. A second edition of the book was published in 1848 and two more in 1849. A total of 47 editions were published with the 47th edition appearing in 1905. The print runs were among the highest of any scientific book published in the second half of the 19th century, and Brewer said the success of the book was almost unparalleled at the time. Several translations of the book were made including a Spanish translation in 1858 and two French translations. The French translations were themselves translated into Swedish in 1858 and 1890 and into Portuguese in 1900.\n\nAn edited version of the book by Robert Evans Peterson was published in the United States in 1851 as \"Familiar Science; or, the Scientific Explanation of Common Things\", with a revised edition following in 1863. These versions were edited and rearranged in order to make them more suitable for American pupils and were used as a text-book by schools in Pennsylvania and Brooklyn. Brewer wrote to Peterson expressing his satisfaction at the rearrangement but nevertheless prepared a revised edition of his own which was published in the US in 1864. This edition was digitised and republished by the University of Michigan Library in 2005 following a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation as part of \"Making of America IV: the American voice, 1850–1877\".\n\nBrewer said that he consulted \"the most approved modern authors\" and submitted additions to \"the revision of gentlemen of acknowledged reputation for scientific attainments\". Nevertheless, religious rather than scientific answers to certain questions are prevalent in the book, particularly answers inferring divine design. For example, although modern theories of ice formation show that most of its unusual properties result from the hydrogen bond between neighbouring water molecules, Brewer suggested that the reason ice is lighter than water, expanding as it freezes, is because it has been \"wisely ordained by God that water shall be an exception to a very general rule\".\n\nBrewer was ordained as a deacon and later as a priest and wished to provide a religious framework for science. He and many other Christian populist science writers of the time presented religious themes and were able to keep them relevant to modern science in the mind of the public even after the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. Part of Brewer's approach in promoting his ideas was to avoid discussing religious perspectives until about a third of the way into the book so that the introduction of these ideas would appear more natural.\n\nA review of the second edition of \"The Guide to Science\" was published by \"Punch\" magazine in 1850. The book was seen to be a \"very useful little work\". However, in typical \"Punch\" satirical style, the reviewer disagreed with one answer that we \"feel a desire for activity in cold weather\" due to \"fanning combustion in the blood\" by instead insisting that we feel a desire \"to sit cosily over a fire in cold weather\".\n\nThe success of \"The Guide to Science\" convinced Brewer that his readers still accepted religious explanations rather than evolutionary theory. Following the publication of \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, Brewer wrote \"Theology in Science; or The Testimony of Science to the Wisdom and Goodness of God\" (published in 1860) in order to demonstrate that evolution had not destroyed theological tradition and to continue \"The Guide to Science\"'s promotion of natural theology. The book's popularity also resulted in Brewer being sent \"a large number of questions on all imaginary matters\". These questions and their answers became the nucleus of \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\", first published in 1870. This latter book has long outlived all of Brewer's other publications and remains a classic reference work.\n\n\n"}

It is a parody of the 1984 horror film classic \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\".\n\nAfter having sex with her boyfriend, a woman is shocked when he transforms into Freddy Krueger, who she mistakes for Edward James Olmos. Freddy seduces the woman with his glove, which has vibrators affixed to the fingers.\n\nAt the second annual Elm Street High School reunion, three women discuss how all their classmates have mysteriously died. The sex ed professor appears and corrects them, explaining that their classmates fell into orgasm-induced \"pleasure comas\" while they slept. The professor theorizes it is the work of Freddy, a sex toy salesman who sold overpriced and shoddy merchandise. Angered by Freddy's defective products, the townspeople set him on fire, with the professor throwing the first match (\"That guy sold me a crappy toy. Told me it was a Fleshlight. It turned out just to be a flashlight\"). Freddy burnt from the waist up, and as he died he swore he would get his revenge on his killers through their children. The professor is dumbfounded by the girls failing to remember this (they witnessed Freddy's burning, and attended the block party celebrating the event) and warns them not to fall asleep.\n\nAt home, Betty tries to keep herself awake by watching the porno \"Dead Man Fucking\", but the video turns into one showing Freddy having sex with a female guard in a prison cell. When Freddy finishes with the guard he attacks Betty, but she wakes up. At the school, Betty tells the others about her nightmare, and the professor admits he once had a dream about Freddy (\"It's not gay\") where he saw Freddy's glove long enough to allow him to create a replica of it. Thinking the copy can help them find Freddy's weakness, the professor gives the glove to Kami. Kami masturbates into unconsciousness with the glove, and is rendered comatose by Freddy.\n\nWhile the professor takes Kami to a hospital and Betty goes home, Denise stays behind (\"If I learned anything from horror movies, it's that the psychotic fictional horror villain never goes for the hot girl in a room that's dark when she's all alone and most vulnerable\"). Hearing noises coming from her old textbook, Denise flips through the pages, and sees herself and the professor having sex in them. Denise is transported into the book, and when she and the professor finish fornicating, the professor turns into Freddy, and he puts Denise into a coma.\n\nFed up with living in fear, Betty goes to sleep, and confronts Freddy in her dream. The two have sex, and when Freddy tries to put her into a coma afterward, Betty reveals she stole his glove's batteries (\"Now all you have to turn those girls on is that burnt face, and that 1980s sweater\"). With Freddy robbed of his power, Betty wakes up, wonders if it was all just a dream, and discovers her underwear is soaked through.\n\n\nThe film was originally set to be released on October 31, but was moved ahead to September 28.\n\nThe cast and effects were commended by Video Junkie Strikes Back from Beyond the Grave, which wrote it \"might just be the best horror porn parody to date\". Similar sentiments were expressed by the websites Scarred Stiff Reviews, The Movies Made Me Do It, Blue Screw Reviews, Nerd Reactor and Coolest Porn Reviews.\n\nVideo Tramp had a lukewarm reaction to the film, beginning its review with \"I found myself severely underwhelmed by the whole thing. This is but another in Canadian-born director Lee Roy Meyers' long resume of cheaply-made, creatively-blasé efforts.\" The cast was criticized by All Things Horror, which stated \"If you are looking for something sexy, this movie is severely lacking. If you are looking for funny porn, there are a few key moments in here that I'm glad to have seen, but other parodies have certainly done better\".\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Director - Parody, Best Makeup, and Best Solo Scene at the 2012 AVN Awards.\n\n"}

It is used to indicate whether or not the file has been backed up (archived). \n\nIn Windows and OS/2, when a file is created or modified, the archive bit is set (i.e. turned on), and when the file has been backed up, the archive bit is cleared (i.e. turned off). Thus, the meaning of the archive bit is \"this file has not been archived\". \n\nIn CP/M, the meaning is inverted: creating or modifying a file clears the archive bit, and the bit is set when the file is backed up.\n\nAn incremental backup task may use the archive bit to distinguish which files have already been backed up, and select only the new or modified files for backup.\n\nBackup software may provide the option to do a full backup while clearing archive bits – that is, to back up all files regardless of their archive bit status, and to clear the archive bit for all files processed by the backup. This allows for the creation of an initial full backup that will be supplemented by incremental backups in the future.\n\nThe operating system never clears the archive bit unless explicitly told to do so by the user. Even when a user explicitly tells the operating system to copy a file for the purpose of archiving it, the archive bit will still not be cleared. A specific command for clearing or setting the bit must be executed. In MS-DOS as well as nearly all versions of Windows, the archive bit's status can be viewed or changed with the attrib command-line utility, or by viewing the properties of a file with the Windows shell or Windows Explorer. The archive bit's status can also be viewed or changed with the GetFileAttributes, GetFileAttributesEx, and SetFileAttributes Windows APIs. The archive bit can be set or cleared with the attributes property in VBScript or JScript.\n\nWhen a file with a clear archive bit is moved from one place on a file system to another, the archive bit reverts to being set.\n\nTypically on a computer system that has never been backed up in a manner that clears archive bits, all files on that computer will have their archive bits set, as there are few applications that make use of archive bits without the user's request.\n\nAs the archive bit is a file attribute and not part of the file itself; the contents of the file remain unchanged when the status of the archive bit changes.\n\nRelying on the archive bit for backing up files can be unreliable if multiple backup programs are setting and clearing the archive bit on the same volume. Another possibility is to use the timestamp of the last change to the file or directory. This is typically the technique used in UNIX-like operating systems.\n\n"}
{"id": "680270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680270", "title": "Atlantic bluefin tuna", "text": "Atlantic bluefin tuna\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna (\"Thunnus thynnus\") is a species of tuna in the family Scombridae. It is variously known as the northern bluefin tuna (mainly when including Pacific bluefin as a subspecies), giant bluefin tuna [for individuals exceeding ] and formerly as the tunny.\n\nAtlantic bluefins are native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. They have become extinct in the Black Sea. The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a close relative of the other two bluefin tuna species—the Pacific bluefin tuna and the southern bluefin tuna.\n\nAtlantic bluefin tuna may exceed in weight, and rival the black marlin, blue marlin, and swordfish as the largest Perciformes. Throughout recorded history, the Atlantic bluefin tuna has been highly prized as a food fish. Besides their commercial value as food, the great size, speed, and power they display as apex predators has attracted the admiration of fishermen, writers, and scientists.\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna has been the foundation of one of the world's most lucrative commercial fisheries. Medium-sized and large individuals are heavily targeted for the Japanese raw fish market, where all bluefin species are highly prized for sushi and sashimi.\n\nThis commercial importance has led to severe overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas affirmed in October 2009 that Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks have declined dramatically over the last 40 years, by 72% in the Eastern Atlantic, and by 82% in the Western Atlantic. On 16 October 2009, Monaco formally recommended Endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna for an Appendix I CITES listing and international trade ban. In early 2010, European officials, led by the French ecology minister, increased pressure to ban the commercial fishing of bluefin tuna internationally. European Union nations, which are responsible for most bluefin tuna overfishing, later abstained from voting to protect the species from international trade.\n\nMost bluefins are captured commercially by professional fishermen using longlines, purse seines, assorted hook-and-line gear, heavy rods and reels, and harpoons. Recreationally, bluefins have been one of the most important big-game species sought by sports fishermen since the 1930s, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Spain, France, and Italy.\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna was one of the many fish species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his \"Systema Naturae\", where it was given the binomial name of \"Scomber thynnus\".\n\nIt is most closely related to the Pacific bluefin tuna (\"T. orientalis\") and the southern bluefin tuna (\"T. maccoyii\"), and more distantly to the other large tunas of the genus \"Thunnus\" – the bigeye tuna (\"T. obesus\") and the yellowfin tuna (\"T. albacares\"). For many years, the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna species were considered to be the same, or subspecies, and referred to as the \"northern bluefin tuna\". This name occasionally gives rise to some confusion, as the longtail tuna (\"T. tonggol\") can in Australia sometimes be known under the name \"northern bluefin tuna\". This is also true in New Zealand and Fiji.\n\nBluefin tuna were often referred to as the common tunny, especially in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The name \"tuna\", a derivative of the Spanish \"atún\", was widely adopted in California in the early 1900s and has since become accepted for all tunas, including the bluefin, throughout the English-speaking world. In some languages, the red color of the bluefin's meat is included in its name, as in \"atún rojo\" (Spanish) and \"tonno rosso\" (Italian), amongst others.\n\nThe body of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is rhomboidal in profile and robust. The head is conical and the mouth rather large. The head contains a \"pineal window\" that allows the fish to navigate over its multiple thousands-of-miles range. The color is dark blue above and gray below, with a gold coruscation covering the body and bright yellow caudal finlets. Bluefin tuna can be distinguished from other family members by the relatively short length of their pectoral fins. Their livers have a unique characteristic in that they are covered with blood vessels (striated). In other tunas with short pectoral fins, such vessels are either not present or present in small numbers along the edges.\n\nFully mature adult specimens average long and weigh around . The largest recorded specimen taken under International Game Fish Association rules was caught off Nova Scotia, an area renowned for huge Atlantic bluefin, and weighed and long. The longest contest between man and tuna fish occurred near Liverpool, Nova Scotia in 1934, when six men taking turns fought a tuna for 62 hours. Both the Smithsonian Institution and the National Marine Fish Service in North America have accepted that this species can weigh up to , though further details are lacking. Atlantic bluefin tuna reach maturity relatively quickly. In a survey that included specimens up to in length and in weight, none was believed to be older than 15 years. However, very large specimens may be up to 50 years old.\n\nThe bluefin possesses enormous muscular strength, which it channels through a pair of tendons to its lunate-shaped caudal fin for propulsion. In contrast to many other fish, the body stays rigid while the tail flicks back and forth, increasing stroke efficiency. It also has a very efficient circulatory system. It possesses one of the highest blood hemoglobin concentrations among fish, which allows it to efficiently deliver oxygen to its tissues; this is combined with an exceptionally thin blood-water barrier to ensure rapid oxygen uptake.\nTo keep its core muscles warm, which are used for power and steady swimming, the Atlantic bluefin uses countercurrent exchange to prevent heat from being lost to the surrounding water. Heat in the venous blood is efficiently transferred to the cool, oxygenated arterial blood entering a \"rete mirabile\". While all members of the tuna family are warm-blooded, the ability to thermoregulate is more highly developed in bluefin tuna than in any other fish. This allows them to seek food in the rich but chilly waters of the north Atlantic.\n\nBluefin dive to depths of . They can reach speeds of .\n\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna typically hunts small fish such as sardines, herring, and mackerel, and invertebrates such as squid and crustaceans.\n\nThe tetraphyllidean tapeworm \"Pelichnibothrium speciosum\" parasitizes this species. As the tapeworm's definite host is the blue shark, which does not generally seem to feed on tuna, the Atlantic bluefin tuna likely is a dead-end host for \"P. speciosum\".\n\nFemale bluefin are thought to produce up to 30 million eggs. Atlantic bluefin tuna spawn in two widely separated areas. One spawning ground exists in the western Mediterranean, particularly in the area of the Balearic Islands. The other important spawning ground of the Atlantic bluefin is the Gulf of Mexico. Pop-up satellite tracking results appear to confirm in large measure the belief held by many scientists and fishermen that although bluefin that were spawned in each area may forage widely across the Atlantic, they return to the same area to spawn.\n\nAtlantic bluefin group together in large concentrations to spawn, and at such times are highly vulnerable to commercial fishing. This is particularly so in the Mediterranean, where the groups of spawning bluefin can be spotted from the air by light aircraft and purse seines directed to set around the schools. The western and eastern populations of Atlantic bluefin tuna are thought to mature at different ages. Bluefin born in the east are thought to reach maturity a year or two earlier than those spawned in the west.\n\nTuna farming began as early as the 1970s. Canadian fishermen in St Mary's Bay captured young fish and raised them in pens. In captivity, they grow to reach hundreds of kilos, eventually fetching premium prices in Japan. Farming enables farmers to exploit the unpredictable supply of wild-caught fish. Ranches across the Mediterranean and off South Australia grow bluefin offshore. Annual revenues are $220 million. A large proportion of juvenile and young Mediterranean fish are taken to be grown on tuna farms. Because the tuna are taken from the wild to the pens before they are old enough to reproduce, farming is one of the most serious threats to the species. The bluefin's slow growth and late sexual maturity compound its problems. The Atlantic population has declined by nearly 90% since the 1970s.\n\nIn Europe and Australia, scientists have used light-manipulation technology and time-release hormone implants to bring about the first large-scale captive spawning of Atlantic and southern bluefin. The technology involves implanting gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the fish to stimulate fertile egg production and may push the fish to reach sexual maturity at younger ages.\n\nHowever, since bluefin require so much food per pound of weight gained - up to 10 times that of salmon - if bluefin were to be farmed at the same scale as 21st-century salmon farming, many of their prey species might become depleted if farmed bluefin were fed the same diet as their wild counterparts. As of 2010, 30 million tons of small forage fish were removed from the oceans yearly, the majority to feed farmed fish.\n\nMarket entry by many North African Mediterranean countries, such as Tunisia and Libya in the 1990s, along with the increasingly widespread practice of tuna farming in the Mediterranean and other areas, such as southern Australia (for southern bluefin tuna), depressed prices. One result is that fishermen must now catch up to twice as many fish to maintain their revenues.\n\nThe bluefin species are listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides as fish to avoid due to overfishing.\n\nThis tuna is one of the most highly prized fish used in Japanese raw fish dishes. About 80% of the caught Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan. Bluefin tuna sashimi is a particular delicacy in Japan. For example, an Atlantic bluefin caught off eastern United States sold for US$247,000 at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo in 2008. This high price is considerably less than the highest prices paid for Pacific bluefin. Prices were highest in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nJapanese began eating tuna sushi in the 1840s, when a large catch came into Edo [old Tokyo] one season. A chef marinated a few pieces in soy sauce and served it as \"nigiri sushi\". At that time, these fish were nicknamed\" shibi\" — \"four days\" — because chefs would bury them for four days to mellow their bloody taste.\n\nBy the 1930s, tuna sushi was commonplace in Japan. After World War II, Japanese fishermen needed more fish to eat and to export for European and U.S. canning industries. They expanded their range and perfected industrial long-lining, a practice that employs thousands of baited hooks on miles-long lines. In the 1970s, Japanese manufacturers developed lightweight, high-strength polymers that were spun into drift nets. Though they were banned on the high seas by the early 1990s, in the 1970s hundreds of miles of them were often deployed in a single night. At-sea freezing technology then allowed them to bring frozen sushi-ready tuna from the farthest oceans to market after as long as a year.\n\nThe initial target was yellowfin tuna. Japanese did not value bluefin before the 1960s. By the late 1960s, sportfishing for giant bluefin tuna was burgeoning off Nova Scotia, New England, and Long Island. North Americans, too, had little appetite for bluefin, usually discarding them after taking a picture. Bluefin sportfishing’s rise, however, coincided with Japan’s export boom. In the 1960s and ’70s, cargo planes were returning to Japan empty. A Japanese entrepreneur realized he could buy New England and Canadian bluefin cheaply, and started filling Japan-bound holds with tuna. Exposure to beef and other fatty meats during the U.S. occupation had prepared the Japanese palate for bluefin’s fatty belly (\"otoro\"). The Atlantic bluefin was the biggest and the favorite. The appreciation rebounded across the Pacific when Americans started to eat raw fish in the late 1970s.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, Atlantic bluefin fisheries were relatively small scale, and populations remained stable. Although some local stocks, such as those in the North Sea, were damaged by unrestricted commercial fishing, other populations were not at risk. However, in the 1960s, purse seiners catching fish for the canned tuna market in United States coastal waters removed huge numbers of juvenile and young Western Atlantic bluefin, taking out several entire year classes. Mediterranean fisheries have historically been poorly regulated and catches under-reported, with French, Spanish, and Italian fishermen competing with North African nations for a diminishing population. The fish's migratory habits complicate the task of regulating the fishery, because they spend time in the national waters of multiple countries, as well as the open ocean outside of any national jurisdiction.\n\nGlobal appetite for fish is the predominant threat to Atlantic bluefin. Bluefin aquaculture, which arose in response to declining wild stocks, has yet to achieve a sustainability, in part because it predominantly relies on harvesting and ranching juveniles rather than captive breeding.\n\nDespite some concern, assessments from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill estimated that the population loss would not be significant, ranging from 0.4–4.0% of juveniles, which is within the range of annual variations.\n\nOverfishing continues despite repeated warnings of the current precipitous decline. In 2007, researchers from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)—the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global quota of 15,000 tonnes to maintain current stocks or 10,000 tonnes to allow the fisheries recovery. ICCAT then chose a quota of 36,000 tonnes, but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7500 tonnes are the sustainable limit. In November 2009, ICCAT set the 2010 quota at 13,500 tonnes and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the northern bluefin tuna to its seafood red list.\n\nOn 18 March 2010, the United Nations rejected a U.S.-backed effort to impose a total ban on Atlantic bluefin tuna fishing and trading. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) vote was 68 to 20 with 30 European abstentions. The leading opponent, Japan, claimed that ICCAT was the proper regulatory body.\n\nIn 2011, the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided not to list the Atlantic bluefin tuna as an endangered species. NOAA officials said that the more stringent international fishing rules created in November 2010 would be enough for the Atlantic bluefin tuna to recover. NOAA agreed to reconsider the species endangered status in 2013. It was made a National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, one of those species about which the U.S. government has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society led a campaign against supposedly illegal bluefin tuna fishing off the coast of Libya, which was under Muammar Gaddafi's regime at the time. The fishermen retaliated against Sea Shepherd's intervention by throwing various, small metal pieces at the crew. Nobody was injured due to the other side's actions during the conflict.\n\nIn November 2011, food critic Eric Asimov of \"The New York Times\" criticized the top-ranked New York City restaurant Sushi Yasuda for offering bluefin tuna on their menu, arguing that drawing from such a threatened fishery constituted an unjustifiable risk to bluefin, and to the future of culinary traditions that depend on it.\n\nIn November 2012, 48 countries meeting in Morocco for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas voted to keep strict fishing limits, saying the species' population is still fragile. The quota will rise only slightly, from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500. The decision was reviewed in November 2014, resulting in higher allowances listed below.\n\nThe latest stock assessment for Atlantic bluefin tuna reflected an improvement in the status for both\nwestern and eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stocks. The Commission adopted new management measures\nthat are within the range of scientific advice, are consistent with the respective rebuilding plans, and allow\nfor continued stock growth. For the western stock, the TAC of 2,000 mt annually for 2015 and 2016 will\nprovide for continued growth in spawning stock biomass and allow the strong 2003 year-class to continue\nto enhance the productivity of the stock. The TAC for the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stock was set at\n16,142 t for 2015; 19,296 t for 2016; and 23,155 t for 2017.\n\nThe American television reality show Wicked Tuna and its spinoff follow commercial hook and line Atlantic bluefin tuna off the east coast of the United States. Wicked Tuna premiered in 2014 and is broadcast by National Geographic.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"chain\" is actually an exponentially growing pyramid (a tree graph) that cannot be sustained indefinitely. Common methods used in chain letters include emotionally manipulative stories, get-rich-quick pyramid schemes, and the exploitation of superstition to threaten the recipient with bad luck or even physical violence or death if he or she \"breaks the chain\" and refuses to adhere to the conditions set out in the letter. It is usually assumed that the sender of a superstitious chain letter seriously believes it to be true and is legitimately trying to convince the recipient of the literal wording, although, in theory, it could also be sarcastic. Originally, chain letters were letters one received in the mail. Today, chain letters are often sent via email messages, postings on social network sites, and text messages.\n\nThere are two main types of chain letters:\n\n\nIn the United States, chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants (such as the infamous \"Make Money Fast\" scheme) are illegal.\n\nSome colleges and military bases have passed regulations stating that in the private mail of college students and military personnel, respectively, chain letters are not authorized and will be thrown out. However, it is often difficult to distinguish chain letters from genuine correspondence.\n\nThe oldest known channel for chain letters is written, or printed, on letters on paper. These might be exchanged hand-to-hand or distributed through the mail. One notorious early example was the \"Prosperity Club\" or \"Send-a-Dime\" letter. This letter started in Denver, Colorado in 1935, based on an earlier luck letter. It soon swamped the Denver post office with hundreds of thousands of letters before spilling into St. Louis and other cities.\n\nChain letters take religious perspectives especially relating to Christianity. Often these letters originate from photocopy centers, claiming to have originated from the Pope, with the intent of persuading people to make copies of such letters. The content usually gives one or two examples of people, sometimes public figures who obeyed and were rewarded and others who disobeyed and suffered heavily, which may even include cases of deaths and of someone becoming a millionaire overnight. These types of letters will flourish for some days and will die out naturally, partly based on the economic realities of the people, and maybe many would also reason that if that was truly the original letter, then it cannot contain cases of people who had broken or continued the chain.\n\nSome email messages sent as chain letters may seem fairly harmless, for example, a grammar school student wishing to see how many people can receive his/her email for a science project, but can grow exponentially and be hard to stop. Messages sometimes include phony promises from companies or wealthy individuals (such as Bill Gates) promising a monetary reward to everyone who receives the message. They may also be politically motivated, such as \"Save the Scouts, forward this to as many friends as possible\" or a concept that a popular TV or radio show may be forced off the air. Some, like the \"Hawaiian Good Luck Totem\" which has spread in thousands of forms, threaten users with bad luck if not forwarded.\nThere are many forms of chain email that threaten death or the taking of one's soul by telling tales of others' deaths, such as the Katu Lata Kulu chain email, stating that if it is not forwarded, the receivers of the message will be killed by the spirit.\n\nPlatforms like Facebook and YouTube can host chain letters playing with users' emotions. They may also be in the form of a warning, such as stories of escaped convicts et cetera which urge the reader to pass the message on. One chain letter distributed on MSN Hotmail began, \"Hey it's Tara and John the directors of MSN\"... and tells you that your account will be deleted if you don't send that message to everyone.\n\nAnother common form of email chain letter is the virus hoax and a form of cyberbullying.\n\nChain letters within social media platforms became widespread on Myspace (in the form of Myspace bulletins) and YouTube (in the form of video comments) as well as on Facebook through messages or applications. For instance, the chain post/email of Carmen Winstead, supposedly about a girl from Indiana who was pushed down a sewage drain in a firedrill, states that, \"if you do not repost/send this to 10 people, Carmen will find you and kill you.\" Chain letters are often coupled with intimidating hoaxes or the promise of providing the sender with \"secret\" information once they have forwarded the message.\n\nA chain letter may qualify as a fraudulent activity, as in the case of a pyramid scheme which asks recipients to funnel money up the chain while requesting the letter be distributed to multiple new recipients.\n\nThe legality of chain letters comes into question when they attempt to funnel monetary value to a single recipient. When a chain letter suggests a game of chance or a lottery with an opportunity for financial gain it is considered fraudulent under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute. Chain letters that ask for items of minor value such as business cards or recipes are not covered by this law.\n\nIf pyramid scheme chain letters are sent through email it may constitute wire fraud. An email chain letter may contain trojans or another type of computer virus which is covered under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) [18 U.S.C. Section 1030]. This law makes it illegal to distribute computer codes or place them in the stream of commerce if their intent is to cause damage or economic loss.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An unknown continuator brought the work down to 1418. The earliest parts of the chronicle concern St. Egwin, and were probably written by a prior of the house, Dominic, sometime before 1125. Egwin was a bishop of Worcester who died in 717. Also included in the \"Chronicon\" is a narrative of the translation of the relics of St Odulph, and the life of St Wigstan.\n\nThe historian R. R. Darlington felt that the account of Abbot Æthelwig that is part of the chronicle was not written by Thomas, and instead was written shortly after Æthelwig's death, which occurred in 1077 or 1078. The historian David Knowles felt that the account of Æthelwig was written instead by Dominic, but concurred with Darlington that the section was not composed by Thomas. Yet another continuator extended the history of the abbots until 1539.\n\nThe \"Chronicon\" has been printed a number of times, once in 1863 in the Rolls Series, edited by William Dunn Macray. This edition, number 29 in the Rolls Series, is titled \"Chronicon abbatiae de Evesham, ad annum 1418\", but it includes the continuation until 1539. Extracts from the period 1035 to 1236 were edited by Liebermann in the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\". Another version, with the continuation down to 1539, was published in 1965 by the Vale of Evesham Historical Society.

{"id": "492321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=492321", "title": "Commonplace book", "text": "Commonplace book\n\nCommonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts they have learned. Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests. They became significant in Early Modern Europe.\n\n\"Commonplace\" is a translation of the Latin term \"locus communis\" (from Greek \"tópos koinós\", see literary topos) which means \"a theme or argument of general application\", such as a statement of proverbial wisdom. In this original sense, commonplace books were collections of such sayings, such as John Milton's commonplace book. Scholars have expanded this usage to include any manuscript that collects material along a common theme by an individual.\n\nCommonplace books are not diaries nor\ntravelogues, with which they can be contrasted:\nEnglish Enlightenment philosopher John Locke wrote the 1706 book \"A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books\", \"in which techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, speeches were formulated. Locke gave specific advice on how to arrange material by subject and category, using such key topics as love, politics, or religion. Commonplace books, it must be stressed, are not journals, which are chronological and introspective.\"\n\nBy the early eighteenth century they had become an information management device in which a note-taker stored quotations, observations and definitions. They were even used by influential scientists. Carl Linnaeus, for instance, used commonplacing techniques to invent and arrange the nomenclature of his \"Systema Naturae\" (which is the basis for the system used by scientists today).\n\nDuring the course of the 15th century, the Italian peninsula was the site of a development of two new forms of book production: the deluxe registry book and the zibaldone (or hodgepodge book). What differentiated these two forms was their language of composition: a vernacular. Giovanni Rucellai, the compiler of one of the most sophisticated examples of the genre, defined it as a \"salad of many herbs.\"\n\nZibaldone were always paper codices of small or medium format – never the large desk copies of registry books or other display texts. They also lacked the lining and extensive ornamentation of other deluxe copies. Rather than miniatures, zibaldone often incorporate the author's sketches. Zibaldone were in cursive scripts (first chancery minuscule and later mercantile minuscule) and contained what palaeographer Armando Petrucci describes as \"an astonishing variety of poetic and prose texts.\" Devotional, technical, documentary and literary texts appear side-by-side in no discernible order. The juxtaposition of gabelle taxes paid, currency exchange rates, medicinal remedies, recipes and favourite quotations from Augustine and Virgil portrays a developing secular, literate culture. By far the most popular of literary selections were the works of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca and Giovanni Boccaccio: the \"Three Crowns\" of the Florentine vernacular traditions. These collections have been used by modern scholars as a source for interpreting how merchants and artisans interacted with the literature and visual arts of the Florentine Renaissance.\n\nThe best-known zibaldone is Giacomo Leopardi's nineteenth-century \"Zibaldone di pensieri\".\n\nBy the 17th century, commonplacing had become a recognized practice that was formally taught to college students in such institutions as Oxford. John Locke appended his indexing scheme for commonplace books to a printing of his \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\". The commonplace tradition in which Francis Bacon and John Milton were educated had its roots in the pedagogy of classical rhetoric, and “commonplacing” persisted as a popular study technique until the early 20th century. Commonplace books were used by many key thinkers of the Enlightenment, with authors like the philosopher and theologian William Paley using them to write books. Both Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were taught to keep commonplace books at Harvard University (their commonplace books survive in published form). Commonplacing was particularly attractive to authors. Some, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Mark Twain kept messy reading notes that were intermixed with other quite various material; others, such as Thomas Hardy, followed a more formal reading-notes method that mirrored the original Renaissance practice more closely. The older, \"clearinghouse\" function of the commonplace book, to condense and centralize useful and even \"model\" ideas and expressions, became less popular over time.\n\nMany of these works are not seen to have literary value to modern editors. The value of such collections is the insights they offer into the tastes, interests, personalities and concerns of their individual compilers.\n\nKeeping notebooks is a kind of tradition among authors. Therefore, a commonplace book of literary memoranda may serve as a symbol to the keeper, of the keeper's literary identity (or something psychologically not far removed), quite apart from its obvious value as a written record. Authors frequently treat their notebooks as quasi-works, giving them elaborate titles, compiling them neatly from rough notes, recompiling still neater revisions of them later, and preserving them with a special devotion and care that seems out of proportion to their apparent function as working materials.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1145353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1145353", "title": "Dominion theology", "text": "Dominion theology\n\nDominion theology (also known as dominionism) is a group of Christian political ideologies that seek to institute a nation governed by Christians based on their personal understandings of biblical law. Extents of rule and ways of achieving governing authority are varied. For example, dominion theology can include theonomy, but does not necessarily involve advocating Mosaic law as the basis of government. The label is applied primarily toward groups of Christians in the United States.\n\nProminent adherents of these ideologies are otherwise theologically diverse, including Calvinist Christian reconstructionism, Roman Catholic\nIntegralism, Charismatic/Pentecostal Kingdom Now theology, New Apostolic Reformation, and others. Most of the contemporary movements labeled dominion theology arose in the 1970s from religious movements asserting aspects of Christian nationalism.\n\nSome have applied the term \"dominionist\" more broadly to the whole Christian right. This usage is controversial. There are concerns from members of these communities that this is a label being used to marginalize Christians from public discourse. Others argue this allegation can be difficult to sympathize with considering the political power already held by these groups and on account of the often verbally blatant intention of these groups to influence the political, social, financial, and cultural spectrums of society for a specific religion, often at the expense of other marginalized groups.\n\nDominion theology is a reference to the King James Bible's rendering of , the passage in which God grants humanity \"dominion\" over the Earth.\n\nAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, several prominent evangelical authors used the phrase \"dominion theology\" (and other terms such as \"dominionism\") to label a loose grouping of theological movements that made direct appeals to this passage in Genesis. Christians typically interpret this passage as meaning that God gave mankind responsibility over the Earth, but one of the distinctive aspects of Dominion Theology is that it is interpreted as a mandate for Christian stewardship in civil affairs, no less than in other human matters.\n\nAn example of dominionism in reformed theology is Christian reconstructionism, which originated with the teachings of R. J. Rushdoony in the 1960s and 1970s. Rushdoony's theology focuses on theonomy (the rule of the Law of God), a belief that all of society should be ordered according to the laws that governed the Israelites in the Old Testament. His system is strongly Calvinistic, emphasizing the sovereignty of God over human freedom and action, and denying the operation of charismatic gifts in the present day (cessationism); both of these aspects are in direct opposition to Kingdom Now Theology.\n\nFull adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among most Christians. Dave Hunt, Albert James Dager Hal Lindsey, and Thomas Ice specifically criticize Christian reconstructionism from a Christian viewpoint, disagreeing on theological grounds with its theocratic elements as well as its Calvinism and postmillennialism. J. Ligon Duncan, Sherman Isbell,\nVern Poythress,\nRobert Godfrey,\nand Sinclair Ferguson analyze reconstructionism as conservative Calvinists, primarily giving a theological critique of its theocratic elements. Michael J. McVicar has noted that many leading Christian reconstructionists are also leading writers in paleolibertarian circles.\n\nSome social scientists have used the word \"dominionism\" to refer to adherence to Christian reconstructionism.\n\nCatholic Integralism has been characterized as a form of dominionist theology. Antonio Spadaro and Marcelo Figueroa have stated that Catholic Integralists have entered into a non-traditional ecumenical alliance with Protestant reconstructionists who share \"the same desire for religious influence in the political sphere\". Likewise, in the \"National Catholic Reporter\", Joshua J. McElwee stated that Catholic Integralists, along with their Protestant counterparts, wish to achieve the goal of establishing a \"theocratic type of state\".\n\nKingdom Now theology is a branch of Dominion Theology which has had a following within Pentecostalism. It attracted attention in the late 1980s.\n\nKingdom Now theology states that although Satan has been in control of the world since the Fall, God is looking for people who will help him take back dominion. Those who yield themselves to the authority of God's apostles and prophets will take control of the kingdoms of this world, being defined as all social institutions, the \"kingdom\" of education, the \"kingdom\" of science, the \"kingdom\" of the arts, etc. C. Peter Wagner, the founder of the New Apostolic Reformation, writes: \"The practical theology that best builds a foundation under social transformation is dominion theology, sometimes called 'Kingdom Now'. Its history can be traced back through R. J. Rushdoony and Abraham Kuyper to John Calvin.\"\n\nKingdom Now theology is influenced by the Latter Rain movement, and critics have connected it to the New Apostolic Reformation, \"Spiritual Warfare Christianity,\" and Fivefold ministry thinking.\n\nKingdom Now theology should not be confused with Kingdom theology, which is related to inaugurated eschatology.\n\nIn the late 1980s sociologist Sara Diamond began writing about the intersection of dominion theology with the political activists of the Christian right. Diamond argued that \"the primary importance of the [Christian reconstructionist] ideology is its role as a catalyst for what is loosely called 'dominion theology'\". According to Diamond, \"Largely through the impact of Rushdoony's and North's writings, the concept that Christians are Biblically mandated to 'occupy' all secular institutions has become the \"central unifying ideology\" for the Christian Right\" in the United States.\n\nWhile acknowledging the small number of actual adherents, authors such as Diamond and Frederick Clarkson have argued that postmillennial Christian reconstructionism played a major role in pushing the primarily premillennial Christian right to adopt a more aggressive dominionist stance.\n\nMisztal and Shupe concur that \"Reconstructionists have many more sympathizers who fall somewhere within the dominionist framework, but who are not card-carrying members\". According to Diamond, \"Reconstructionism is the most intellectually grounded, though esoteric, brand of dominion theology\".\n\nJournalist Frederick Clarkson\ndefined \"dominionism\" as a movement that, while including dominion theology and reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian right in the United States.\n\nIn his 1992 study of dominion theology and its influence on the Christian right, Bruce Barron writes,\nIn the context of American evangelical efforts to penetrate and transform public life, the distinguishing mark of a dominionist is a commitment to defining and carrying out an approach to building society that is \"self-consciously defined as exclusively Christian,\" and dependent specifically on the work of Christians, rather than based on a broader consensus.\n\nIn 1995, Diamond called the influence of dominion theology \"prevalent on the Christian Right\".\n\nJournalist Chip Berlet added in 1998 that, although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists assert a Christian duty to take \"control of a sinful secular society\".\n\nIn 2005, Clarkson enumerated the following characteristics shared by all forms of dominionism:\nEssayist Katherine Yurica began using the term \"dominionism\" in her articles in 2004, beginning with \"The Despoiling of America\" (February 11, 2004), Authors who also use the term \"dominionism\" in the broader sense include journalist Chris Hedges Marion Maddox, James Rudin, Michelle Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Sam Harris, Ryan Lizza, Frank Schaeffer,\nand the group TheocracyWatch. Some authors have applied the term to a broader spectrum of people than have Diamond, Clarkson, and Berlet.\n\nSarah Posner in \"Salon\" argues that there are various \"iterations of dominionism that call on Christians to enter ... government, law, media and so forth ... so that they are controlled by Christians\". According to Posner, \"Christian right figures promoted dominionism ... and the GOP courted ... religious leaders for the votes of their followers\". She added: \"If people really understood dominionism, they’d worry about it between election cycles.\"\n\nMichelle Goldberg notes that George Grant wrote in his 1987 book \"The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action:\"\n\nWriters including Chip Berlet and Frederick Clarkson distinguish between what they term \"hard\" and \"soft\" dominionism. Such commentators define \"soft\" dominionism as the belief that \"America is a Christian nation\" and opposition to separation of church and state, while \"hard\" dominionism refers to dominion theology and Christian reconstructionism.\n\nMichelle Goldberg uses the terms \"Christian nationalism\" and \"dominionism\" for the former view. According to Goldberg:\n\nIn many ways, Dominionism is more a political phenomenon than a theological one. It cuts across Christian denominations, from stern, austere sects to the signs-and-wonders culture of modern megachurches. Think of it like political Islamism, which shapes the activism of a number of antagonistic fundamentalist movements, from Sunni Wahabis in the Arab world to Shiite fundamentalists in Iran.\n\nBerlet and Clarkson have agreed that \"[s]oft Dominionists are Christian nationalists\". Unlike \"dominionism\", the phrase \"Christian nation\" occurs commonly in the writings of leaders of the Christian right. Proponents of this idea (such as David Barton and D. James Kennedy) argue that the Founding Fathers of the United States were overwhelmingly Christian, that founding documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are based on Christian principles, and that a Christian character is fundamental to American culture. They cite, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court's comment in 1892 that \"this [the United States] is a Christian nation\", after citing numerous historical and legal arguments in support of that statement.\n\nKennedy characterized his perspective on Christian political involvement as more akin to participatory democracy than to dominionism. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross, Kennedy was asked whether he wanted all public office holders to be Christians. Kennedy answered, \"We have people who are secular and humanist and unbelievers who are constantly supporting in every way possible other people who share those views. And I don't object to that. That's their privilege. And I think that Christians should be allowed the same privilege to vote for people whom they believe share their views about life and government. And that's all I'm talking about.\"\n\nThose labelled dominionists rarely use the terms \"dominionist\" and \"dominionism\" for self-description, and some people have attacked the use of such words. Journalist and conservative comentator Anthony Williams, writing for Frontpage Magazine, charged that such usage aims \"to smear the Republican Party as the party of domestic Theocracy, facts be damned\". Journalist and conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz, writing for the National Review, labeled it \"conspiratorial nonsense\", \"political paranoia\", and \"guilt by association\", and decried Hedges' \"vague characterizations\" that allow him to \"paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless 'Dominionist' Christian mass\". Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian reconstructionism:\n\nThe notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it's downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the \"Harper's\" cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside 'the old polite rules of democracy.' So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians—by any means necessary.\n\nJoe Carter of \"First Things\" writes:\n\n[T]here is no \"school of thought\" known as \"dominionism.\" The term was coined in the 1980s by Diamond and is never used outside liberal blogs and websites. No reputable scholars use the term for it is a meaningless neologism that Diamond concocted for her dissertation.\n\nDiamond has denied that she coined the broader sense of the term \"dominionism\", which appears in her dissertation and in \"Roads to Dominion\" solely to describe Dominion Theology. Nevertheless, Diamond did originate the idea that Dominion Theology is the \"central unifying ideology for the Christian Right\".\n\nJeremy Pierce of \"First Things\" coined the word \"dominionismist\" to describe those who promote the idea that there is a dominionist conspiracy, writing:\n\nIt strikes me as irresponsible to lump [Rushdoony] together with Francis Schaeffer and those influenced by him, especially given Schaeffer's many recorded instances of resisting exactly the kinds of views Rushdoony developed. Indeed, it strikes me as an error of the magnitude of some of Rushdoony's own historical nonsense to consider there to be such a view called Dominionism [sic] that Rushdoony, Schaeffer, James Dobson, and all the other people in the list somehow share and that it seeks to get Christians and only Christians into all the influential positions in secular society.\n\nLisa Miller of \"Newsweek\" writes that dominionism' is the paranoid \"mot du jour\"\" and that \"certain journalists use 'dominionist' the way some folks on Fox News use the word \"sharia\". Its strangeness scares people. Without history or context, the word creates a siege mentality in which 'we' need to guard against 'them'.\" Ross Douthat of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"many of the people that writers like Diamond and others describe as 'dominionists' would disavow the label, many definitions of dominionism conflate several very different Christian political theologies, and there's a lively debate about whether the term is even useful at all.\"\n\nOther criticism has focused on the proper use of the term. Berlet wrote that \"just because some critics of the Christian Right have stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point does not mean we should abandon the term\", and argued that, rather than labeling conservatives as extremists, it would be better to \"talk to these people\" and \"engage them\". Sara Diamond wrote that \"[l]iberals' writing about the Christian Right's take-over plans has generally taken the form of conspiracy theory\", and argued that instead one should \"analyze the subtle ways\" that ideas like Dominionism \"take hold within movements and why\". Authors Robert Gagnon and Edith Humphrey argued strongly against the use of the term in reference to US presidential candidate Ted Cruz in a 2016 op-ed for \"Christianity Today\".\n\n"}

It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh, as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the \"Britannica\" shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the \"Britannica\" became the first encyclopaedia to adopt \"continuous revision\", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on \"Encyclopædia Britannica Online\".\n\nThe 15th edition has a three-part structure: a 12-volume of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), a 17-volume of long articles (two to 310 pages), and a single volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge.

Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the , which organizes the \"Britannica\" contents by topic.\n\nThe core of the is its \"Outline of Knowledge\", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the \"Britannica\"'s editors to decide which articles should be included in the and . The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of \"Britannica\" articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth. However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia. The also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.\n\nTaken together, the and comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images. The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the \"Britannica\", together with 474,675 subentries under those topics. The \"Britannica\" generally prefers British spelling over American; for example, it uses \"colour\" (not \"color\"), \"centre\" (not \"center\"), and \"encyclopaedia\" (not \"encyclopedia\"). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as \"defense\" rather than \"defence\". Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as \"Color: \"see\" Colour.\"\n\nSince 1936, the articles of the \"Britannica\" have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year. According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years; however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.\n\nThe alphabetization of articles in the and follows strict rules. Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as \"1812, War of\" are alphabetized as if the number had been written out (\"Eighteen-twelve, War of\"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in \"Britannica\" as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were \"Charles, France, 3\" and \"Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1\".) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.\n\nIn March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution. The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was 1990 when 120,000 sets were sold, but it dropped to 40,000 in 1996. 12,000 sets of the 2010 edition were printed, of which 8,000 had been sold . By late April 2012, the remaining copies of the 2010 edition had sold out at Britannica's online store. , a replica of Britannica's 1768 first edition is sold on the online store.\n\n\"Britannica Junior\" was first published in 1934 as 12 volumes. It was expanded to 15 volumes in 1947, and renamed \"Britannica Junior Encyclopædia\" in 1963. It was taken off the market after the 1984 printing.\n\nA British \"Children's Britannica\" edited by John Armitage was issued in London in 1960. Its contents were determined largely by the eleven-plus standardized tests given in Britain. Britannica introduced the \"Children's Britannica\" to the US market in 1988, aimed at ages seven to 14.\n\nIn 1961 a 16 volume \"Young Children's Encyclopaedia\" was issued for children just learning to read.\n\n\"My First Britannica\" is aimed at children ages six to 12, and the \"Britannica Discovery Library\" is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991).\n\nThere have been and are several abridged \"Britannica\" encyclopaedias. The single-volume \"Britannica Concise Encyclopædia\" has 28,000 short articles condensing the larger 32-volume \"Britannica\"; there are authorized translations in languages such as Chinese and Vietnamese. \"Compton's by Britannica\", first published in 2007, incorporating the former \"Compton's Encyclopedia\", is aimed at 10- to 17-year-olds and consists of 26 volumes and 11,000 pages.\n\nSince 1938, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has published annually a \"Book of the Year\" covering the past year's events. A given edition of the \"Book of the Year\" is named in terms of the year of its publication, though the edition actually covers the events of the previous year. Articles dating back to the 1994 edition are included online. The company also publishes several specialized reference works, such as \"Shakespeare: The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard\" (Wiley, 2006).\n\nThe \"Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2012 DVD\" contains over 100,000 articles. This includes regular \"Britannica\" articles, as well as others drawn from the \"Britannica Student Encyclopædia\", and the \"Britannica Elementary Encyclopædia.\" The package includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from Merriam-Webster.\n\n\"Britannica\" Online is a website with more than 120,000 articles and is updated regularly. It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from \"The New York Times\" and the BBC. , roughly 60% of Encyclopædia Britannica's revenue came from online operations, of which around 15% came from subscriptions to the consumer version of the websites. , subscriptions were available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannica's business. Beginning in early 2007, the \"Britannica\" made articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non-subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising.\n\nOn 20 February 2007, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to launch a mobile encyclopaedia. Users will be able to send a question via text message, and AskMeNow will search \"Britannica\"'s 28,000-article concise encyclopaedia to return an answer to the query. Daily topical features sent directly to users' mobile phones are also planned.\n\nOn 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica's online content (in the spirit of a wiki), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced. Approved contributions would be credited, though contributing automatically grants Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable license to those contributions.\n\nOn 22 January 2009, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that the company would be accepting edits and additions to the online \"Britannica\" website from the public. The published edition of the encyclopaedia will not be affected by the changes. Individuals wishing to edit the \"Britannica\" website will have to register under their real name and address prior to editing or submitting their content. All edits submitted will be reviewed and checked and will have to be approved by the encyclopaedia's professional staff. Contributions from non-academic users will sit in a separate section from the expert-generated \"Britannica\" content, as will content submitted by non-\"Britannica\" scholars. Articles written by users, if vetted and approved, will also only be available in a special section of the website, separate from the professional articles. Official \"Britannica\" material would carry a \"Britannica Checked\" stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced a partnership with mobile phone development company Concentric Sky to launch a series of iPhone products aimed at the K-12 market. On 20 July 2011, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced that Concentric Sky had ported the Britannica Kids product line to Intel's Intel Atom-based Netbooks and on 26 October 2011 that it had launched its encyclopedia as an iPad app. In 2010, Britannica released Britannica ImageQuest, a database of images.\n\nIn March 2012, it was announced that the company would cease printing the encyclopaedia set, and that it would focus more on its online version.\n\nOn June 7, 2018, Britannica released a Google Chrome extension, Britannica Insights, which shows snippets of information from Britannica Online in a sidebar for Google search results. The Britannica sidebar does not replace Google's sidebar and is instead placed above Google's sidebar.\n\nThe 2007 print version of the \"Britannica\" has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey. Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.\n\nWhile \"Britannica\"'s authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Leon Trotsky, as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov, some have been criticized for lack of expertise. In 1911 the historian George L. Burr wrote:\n\n in the fifteenth edition of \"Britannica\", Dale Hoiberg, a sinologist, was listed as \"Britannica's\" Senior Vice President and editor-in-chief. Among his predecessors as editors-in-chief were Hugh Chisholm (1902–1924), James Louis Garvin (1926–1932), Franklin Henry Hooper (1932–1938), Walter Yust (1938–1960), Harry Ashmore (1960–1963), Warren E. Preece (1964–1968, 1969–1975), Sir William Haley (1968–1969), Philip W. Goetz (1979–1991), and Robert McHenry (1992–1997). Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor. Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.\n\nPaul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of Treasurer, Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.\n\nThe 2007 editorial staff of the \"Britannica\" included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the and some sections of the . The preparation and publication of the required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 , the staff were organized into ten departments:\n\n\nSome of these departments were organized hierarchically. For example, the copy editors were divided into 4 copy editors, 2 senior copy editors, 4 supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by Dale Hoiberg and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.\n\nThe \"Britannica\" has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars: non-fiction author Nicholas Carr, religion scholar Wendy Doniger, political economist Benjamin M. Friedman, Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb, computer scientist David Gelernter, Physics Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann, Carnegie Corporation of New York President Vartan Gregorian, philosopher Thomas Nagel, cognitive scientist Donald Norman, musicologist Don Michael Randel, Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood, President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and cultural anthropologist Michael Wesch.\n\nThe and its \"Outline of Knowledge\" were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler. Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects — Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned articles.\n\nIn January 1996, the \"Britannica\" was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra, who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. In 1999, a new company, Britannica.com Inc., was created to develop digital versions of the \"Britannica\"; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses. In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies. Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the \"Britannica\"′s Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the \"Britannica's\" Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the \"Britannica\" brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.\n\nUnder Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the \"New York Post\", the \"Britannica\" management has eliminated employee 401(k) accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the \"Britannica\" staff have gone years without pay rises.\n\nIn the fall of 2017, publishing executive Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (Reed Elsevier, FT SE 100) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for “driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth.” \n\nTaking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250 anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K-12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year.\n\nFirst was Britannica Insights, a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to “provide trusted, verified information” in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and “fake news.”\n\nThe product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica’s online classroom solutions, and a partnership with YouTube in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading.   \n\nKrishnan, himself an educator at New York University’s Stern School of Business, believes in the “transformative power of education” and set steering the company toward solidifying its place among leaders in educational technology and supplemental curriculum. Krishnan aimed at providing more useful and relevant solutions to customer needs, extending and renewing Britannica’s historical emphasis on “Utility,” which had been the watchword of its first edition in 1768.\n\nKrishnan also is active in civic affairs, with organizations such as the Urban Enterprise Initiative and Urban Upbound, whose board he serves on.\n\nAs the \"Britannica\" is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the \"Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\" or the \"Dictionary of the Middle Ages\", which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the \"Britannica\"'s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, \"Rees's Cyclopædia\" and Coleridge's \"Encyclopædia Metropolitana\". In the 20th century, successful competitors included \"Collier's Encyclopedia\", the \"Encyclopedia Americana\", and the \"World Book Encyclopedia\". Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the \"Britannica\" was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The print version of the \"Britannica\" was significantly more expensive than its competitors.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the \"Britannica\" has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine. In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated. In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the \"Britannica\" has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust. Eventually, the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition.\n\nThe has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the \"Britannica\" with two comparable encyclopaedias, \"Collier's Encyclopedia\" and the \"Encyclopedia Americana\". For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the \"Britannica\" received one \"D\" and seven \"A\"s, \"Encyclopedia Americana\" received eight \"A\"s, and \"Collier's\" received one \"D\" and seven \"A\"s; thus, \"Britannica\" received an average score of 92% for accuracy to \"Americana\"s 95% and \"Collier's\" 92%. In the timeliness category, \"Britannica\" averaged an 86% to \"Americana\"'s 90% and \"Collier's\" 85%.\n\nThe most notable competitor of the \"Britannica\" among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was \"Encarta\", now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: \"Funk & Wagnalls\", \"Collier's\" and the \"New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia\". \"Encarta\" was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006. Both occupied the same price range, with the \"2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate\" CD or DVD costing US$40–50 and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45. The \"Britannica\" contains 100,000 articles and \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus\" (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions. \"Encarta\" contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. Like \"Encarta\", the \"Britannica\" has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary. Like the \"Britannica\", \"Encarta\" was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.\n\nThe dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to \"Britannica\" is the multilingual, Web-based, free-content encyclopaedia, Wikipedia. The key differences between the two lie in accessibility; the model of participation they bring to an encyclopedic project; their respective style sheets and editorial policies; relative ages; the number of subjects treated; the number of languages in which articles are written and made available; and their underlying economic models: unlike Britannica, Wikipedia is a not-for-profit and is not connected with traditional profit- and contract-based publishing distribution networks.\n\nThe 699 printed articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a \"Britannica\" article either has known authorship or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the \"Britannica\"'s contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates. By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials. It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former \"Britannica\" editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the \"Britannica\" in accuracy.\n\nIn 2005, the journal \"Nature\" chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called \"relevant\" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. \"Nature\" got back 42 usable reviews.\n\nIn the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in \"Britannica\", an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for \"Britannica\". Although \"Britannica \"was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with fewer errors, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called \"Nature\"'s study flawed and misleading and called for a \"prompt\" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a \"Britannica\" yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from \"Compton's Encyclopedia\" (called the \"Britannica Student Encyclopedia\" on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalized for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what \"Nature\" called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. \"Nature\" defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of \"Britannica\", it used whatever relevant material was available on \"Britannica\"s website.\n\nInterviewed in February 2009, the managing director of \"Britannica UK\" said: \n\nSince the 3rd edition, the \"Britannica\" has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence. The 3rd and the 9th editions were pirated for sale in the United States, beginning with \"Dobson's Encyclopaedia\". On the release of the 14th edition, \"Time\" magazine dubbed the \"Britannica\" the \"Patriarch of the Library\". In a related advertisement, naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the \"Britannica\" was \"beyond comparison because there is no competitor.\" References to the \"Britannica\" can be found throughout English literature, most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, \"The Red-Headed League\". The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the \"Britannica\".\n\nThe \"Britannica\" has a reputation for summarising knowledge. To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire \"Britannica\", taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so. When Fat'h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the \"Britannica's\" 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include \"Most Formidable Lord and Master of the \". Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles—and Richard Evelyn Byrd took the \"Britannica\" as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934, while Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A.J. Jacobs, an editor at \"Esquire\" magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, \"\". Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman, who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th. Several editors-in-chief of the \"Britannica\" are likely to have read their editions completely, such as William Smellie (1st edition), William Robertson Smith (9th edition), and Walter Yust (14th edition).\n\nThe CD/DVD-ROM version of the \"Britannica\", \"Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite\", received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers. On 15 July 2009, was awarded a spot as one of \"Top Ten Superbrands in the UK\" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.\n\nTopics are chosen in part by reference to the \"Outline of Knowledge\". The bulk of the \"Britannica\" is devoted to geography (26% of the ), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%). A complementary study of the found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%. Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the \"range, depth, and catholicity of coverage [of the \"Britannica\"] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia.\"\n\nThe \"Britannica\" does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles. However, the \"Britannica\" has been lauded as the \"least\" biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.\n\nOn rare occasions, the \"Britannica \"was criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies. Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the and . Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a \"qualified failure...[that] cares more for juggling its format than for preserving.\" More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 , along with the article on psychology.\n\nSome very few \"Britannica\"-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the \"Britannica's\" early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire. The \"Britannica\" has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).\n\nThe \"Britannica\" has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the \"Britannica,\" and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years). For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, \"The Myth of the Britannica\", the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work. It is still difficult to keep the \"Britannica\" current; one recent critic writes, \"it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision\", noting that the longer articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter articles. Information in the is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other. The bibliographies of the articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.\n\nIn 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish civil war was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.\n\nWriting about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), \"Britannica\"s chief editor George Gleig observed that \"perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects.\" In March 2006, the \"Britannica\" wrote, \"we in no way mean to imply that \"Britannica\" is error-free; we have never made such a claim.\" The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, William Smellie:\n\nHowever, Jorge Cauz (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that \"\"Britannica\" […] will always be factually correct.\"\n\nPast owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable, Scottish publisher A & C Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck and William Benton.\n\nThe present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, \"Encarta\" and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias. To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the \"Britannica\", reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.\n\nThe \"Britannica\" has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the Table below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.\n\nThroughout history, the \"Britannica\" has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material. In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge. The history of the \"Britannica\" can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary.\n\nIn the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the \"Britannica\" was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The \"Britannica\" was first published between December 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh as the \"Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan\". In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French \"Encyclopédie\" of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" (first edition 1728). It went on sale December 10.\n\nThe \"Britannica\" of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment. In this era, the \"Britannica\" moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—William Smellie—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees's \"Cyclopædia\" and Coleridge's \"Encyclopædia Metropolitana\" and David Brewster's \"Edinburgh Encyclopædia\".\n\nDuring the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the \"Britannica\" was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A & C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the \"Britannica's\" reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.\n\nProduction of the 9th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes, the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the \"Scholar's Edition\", the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all \"Britannicas\". After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith. No biographies of living persons were included. James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science. However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the \"Britannica\" faced financial difficulties.\n\nIn the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the \"Britannica\" was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection.\n\nWhen Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the \"Britannica\" was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the \"Britannica\"; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions. Powell developed new educational products that built upon the \"Britannica\"s reputation.\n\nIn 1943, Sears donated the to the University of Chicago. William Benton, then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock. Benton became Chairman of the Board and managed the \"Britannica\" until his death in 1973. Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the \"Britannica\" until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the \"Britannica\" celebrated its bicentennial.\n\nIn the fourth era (1974–94), the \"Britannica\" introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organized into three parts: the , the , and the . Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of \"Britannica\" from 1965), the \"Britannica\" sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the and ) provoked a \"firestorm of criticism\" of the initial 15th edition. In response, the 15th edition was completely re-organized and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the \"New Encyclopædia Britannica\", although it has also been promoted as \"Britannica 3\".\n\nOn 9 March 1976 the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.\n\nIn the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the \"Britannica\" was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the \"Britannica\" name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.\n\n\"Britannica\"s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set. \"Britannica Global Edition\" was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller \"compact\" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain and sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is \"Britannica\"s description of the work:\n\nThe \"Britannica\" was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States. Thus, the 11th edition is \"dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America.\" The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is \"Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second.\" Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was \"dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, George W. Bush, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II,\" while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is \"dedicated by permission to Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "173688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173688", "title": "Enoch (ancestor of Noah)", "text": "Enoch (ancestor of Noah)\n\nEnoch () is of the Antediluvian period in the Hebrew Bible. Enoch was son of Jared and fathered Methuselah.\nThis Enoch is not to be confused with Cain's son Enoch (). \n\nThe text of the Book of Genesis says Enoch lived 365 years before he was taken by God. The text reads that Enoch \"walked with God: and he was no more; for God took him\" (), which some Christians interpret as Enoch's entering Heaven alive. \n\nEnoch is the subject of many Jewish and Christian traditions. He was considered the author of the \"Book of Enoch\" and also called Enoch the scribe of judgment. \nThe New Testament has three references to Enoch from the lineage of Seth (Luke 3:37, Hebrews 11:5, Jude 1:14–15).\n\nEnoch appears in the Book of Genesis of the Pentateuch as the seventh of the ten pre-Deluge Patriarchs. Genesis recounts that each of the pre-Flood Patriarchs lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 provides a genealogy of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), providing the age at which each fathered the next, and the age of each figure at death. Enoch is considered by many to be the exception, who is said to \"not see death\" (). Furthermore, states that Enoch lived 365 years, which is shorter than his peers, who are all recorded as dying at over 700 years of age. The brief account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that \"he \"[was]\" not; for God took him\".\n\nThree extensive Apocrypha are attributed to Enoch:\nThese recount how Enoch was taken up to Heaven and was appointed guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on the Throne of God. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord whatever comes out of the mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3 Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbalah of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees.\n\nThe Book of Giants is a Jewish Pseudepigrapha from the third century BC and resembles the Book of Enoch. At least six and as many as eleven copies were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls collections.\n\nThe third-century BC translators who produced the Septuagint in Koine Greek rendered the phrase \"God took him\" with the Greek verb \"metatithemi\" () meaning moving from one place to another. Sirach 44:16, from about the same period, states that \"Enoch pleased God and was translated into paradise that he may give repentance to the nations.\" The Greek word used here for paradise, \"paradeisos\" (), was derived from an ancient Persian word meaning \"enclosed garden\", and was used in the Septuagint to describe the garden of Eden. Later, however, the term became synonymous for heaven, as is the case here.\n\nIn classical Rabbinical literature, there are various views of Enoch. One view regarding Enoch that was found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which thought of Enoch as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of \"Safra rabba\" (\"Great scribe\"). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of Enoch's character and exaltation.\n\nAccording to Rashi [from Genesis Rabbah], \"Enoch was a righteous man, but he could easily be swayed to return to do evil. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, hastened and took him away and caused him to die before his time. For this reason, Scripture changed [the wording] in [the account of] his demise and wrote, 'and he was no longer' in the world to complete his years.\"\n\nAmong the minor Midrashim, esoteric attributes of Enoch are expanded upon. In the \"Sefer Hekalot\", Rabbi Ishmael is described as having visited the Seventh Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel. Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite the small number of people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, to the extent that he was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to Heaven to rule over the \"sons of God\".\n\nThe New Testament contains three references to Enoch.\n\nThe introductory phrase \"Enoch, the Seventh from Adam\" is also found in 1 Enoch (1 En. 60:8), though not in the Old Testament. In the New Testament this Enoch prophesies \"to\" ungodly men, that God shall come with His holy ones to judge and convict them ().\n\nIn early Christianity, use of the Book of Enoch as a divinely inspired text was widespread, since the canon had not yet been established definitively in the Church. Church Fathers such as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras of Athens, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and Lactantius all speak highly of Enoch and contain many allusions to the Book of Enoch as well as in some instances advocating explicitly for the use of the Book of Enoch as Scripture. Because of the letter of Jude's citation of the Book of Enoch as prophetic text, this encouraged acceptance and usage of the Book of Enoch in early Christian circles. The main themes of Enoch about the Watchers corrupting humanity were commonly mentioned in early literature. This positive treatment of the Book of Enoch was associated with millennialism which was popular in the early Church. When amillennialism began to be common in Christianity, the Book of Enoch, being incompatible with amillennialism, started to be rejected widespread, and with the split of Oriental Orthodox from the Catholic Church in the 5th century, usage of the Book of Enoch was limited primarily to the Oriental Orthodox Church. Eventually, the usage of the Book of Enoch became limited to Ethiopian circles of the Oriental Orthodox Church. Another common element that some Church Fathers, like John of Damascus, spoke of, was that they considered Enoch to be one of the two witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelation. This view still has many supporters today in Christianity.\n\nAmong the Latter Day Saint movement and particularly in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Enoch is viewed as having founded an exceptionally righteous city, named Zion, in the midst of an otherwise wicked world. This view is encountered in the standard works, the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants, which states that not only Enoch, but the entire peoples of the city of Zion, were taken off this earth without death, because of their piety. (Zion is defined as \"the pure in heart\" and this city of Zion will return to the earth at the Second Coming of Jesus.) The Doctrine and Covenants further states that Enoch prophesied that one of his descendants, Noah, and his family, would survive a Great Flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the Scripture. The Book of Moses in the \"Pearl of Great Price\" has several chapters that give an account of Enoch's preaching, visions and conversations with God. In these same chapters are details concerning the wars, violence and natural disasters in Enoch's day, and notable miracles performed by Enoch. The Book of Moses is itself an excerpt from Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible, which is published in full, complete with these chapters concerning Enoch, by Community of Christ, in the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, where it appears as part of the Book of Genesis. D&C 104:24 (CofC) / (LDS) states that Adam ordained Enoch to the higher priesthood (now called the Melchizedek, after the great high priest) at age 25, that he was 65 when Adam blessed him, and he lived 365 years \"after that\" until he was translated, so making him 430 years old when that occurred.\n\nAdditionally in LDS theology, Enoch is implied to be the scribe who recorded Adam's blessings and prophecies at Adam-ondi-Ahman, as recorded in D&C (LDS) / D&C 104:29b (CofC).\n\nIn Islam, Enoch ( [commonly in Islamic literature]: \"ʼIdrīs\" إِِدْرِيس)) is identified with Idris, as for example by the \"History of Al-Tabari\" intrepretation and the \"Meadows of Gold\". The Quran contains two references to Idris; in Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets) verse number 85, and in Surah Maryam (Mary) verses 56-57:\n\n\nIdris is closely linked in Muslim tradition with the origin of writing and other technical arts of civilization, including the study of astronomical phenomena, both of which Enoch is credited with in the Testament of Abraham. Nonetheless, although some Muslims view Enoch and Idris as the same prophet while others do not, many Muslims still honor Enoch as one of the earliest prophets, regardless of which view they hold.\n\n\n"}

The books are meant for younger readers. The books ranged from 100 pages to 200 pages in large print. The series of 12 books was written by John Whitman, and were released from February 1997 through to October 1998. The \"Galaxy of Fear\" line was created with an intent to cash in on the popularity of, and was meant to be a science fiction parody of, the \"Goosebumps\" franchise.\n\nThe books are about a young brother and sister, Zak and Tash, who travel the galaxy with their mysterious Uncle Hoole. Tash and Zak are orphans; their parents were on their homeworld of Alderaan when it was destroyed by the Death Star. Tash is fascinated with the Jedi, while Zak is interested in machines and technology.\n\nThe first six books form an arc. The protagonists discover pieces of a large Imperial experiment in biological weapons, codenamed \"Project Starscream\". The first five books deal with the heroes discovering the various components of \"Project Starscream\", each dangerous in its own right The sixth book deals with their discovery of the final goal of the experiments: creating a prototype organism, simply named \"Weapon\".\n\nThe next six books lacked a central arc. The protagonists, now wanted fugitives, simply travel from planet to planet attempting to avoid Imperial authorities. Each book told a story of the main characters stumbling onto some danger and the resulting adventure.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "331020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331020", "title": "Getty Images", "text": "Getty Images\n\nGetty Images, Inc. is a visual media company, with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is a supplier of stock images, editorial photography, video and music for business and consumers with an archive of over 200 million assets. It targets three markets—creative professionals (advertising and graphic design), the media (print and online publishing), and corporate (in-house design, marketing and communication departments).\n\nGetty has distribution offices around the world and capitalizes on the Internet and for distribution. As Getty has acquired other older photo agencies and archives, it has digitized their collections, enabling online distribution. Getty Images operates a large commercial website that clients use to search and browse for images, purchase usage rights, and download images. Image prices vary according to resolution and type of rights. Cost-per-image is typically around . The company also offers custom photo services for corporate clients.\n\nIn 1995, Mark Getty and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Klein co-founded Getty Investments LLC. Mark Getty is the company's chairman. In September 1997, Getty Communications, as it was called at the time, merged with PhotoDisc, Inc. to form Getty Images. In April 2003, Getty Images entered into a partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) to market each other's images.\n\nGetty Images acquired the Michael Ochs Archives in February 2007. The Michael Ochs Archives were described by \"The New York Times\" as \"the premier source of musician photography in the world\".\n\nIn 2008, the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman (H&F) acquired Getty Images. In 2012, H&F put Getty up for sale. As of the ensuing sale to Carlyle Group, the company was said to have an archive that included 80 million stills and illustrations.The company was aquired by the Getty family in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, Jonathan Klein became the company's chairman and Dawn Airey was hired as chief executive officer (CEO) of Getty Images.\n\nSince its formation, Getty Images has pursued an aggressive programme of acquisition, buying up many privately owned agencies that had built up the stock photography industry, from small family-run firms to larger agencies. By 1999 it had acquired one of the largest agencies, Tony Stone Images; the online art seller Art.com; the sports photography agency Allsport; the market leader in the Benelux and Scandinavia: Word View (1996, from Mr. Bert Blokhuis, four offices, for undisclosed sum); journalistic specialists Liaison Agency; Newsmakers the first digital news photo agency; Online USA, a specialist in celebrity shots; and the Hulton Press Library, the former archive of the British photojournalistic magazine \"Picture Post\". The Hulton collection was sold by the BBC to Brian Deutsch in 1988, when it was renamed Hulton Deutsch. In 1996, the Hulton collection was sold on once more, this time purchased by Getty Images and renamed Hulton Getty. With the acquisition of the Hulton library, Getty Images took ownership of the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the Nineteenth Century. Hulton Getty also included photographs from the Keystone Collection, as well as images by notable photographers such as Bert Hardy, Bill Brandt, Weegee and Ernst Haas.\n\nGetty has branched out into stock audio, music and sound effects. And also video with the acquisition of EyeWire and Energy Film Library. Getty has partnered with other companies including Slidely for companies and advertisers to use the Getty Images video library of around 2 million videos.\n\nIn 2000, Getty acquired one of its main competitors, Archive Photos of New York (a division of The Image Bank), for US$183 million. The Archive Photos library was combined with the Hulton Getty collection to form a new subsidiary, Hulton Archive. Archive Photos had been formed in 1990 from the merger of Pictorial Parade (est. 1935) and Frederick Lewis Stock Photos (est. 1938), two well-established US photo agencies. Their collections included archive images from \"The New York Times\", \"Metronome\" and George Eastman House, and works by photographers such as Ruth Orkin, Anacleto Rapping, Deborah Feingold, Murray Garrett, Nat Fein and John Filo.\n\nFurther acquisitions followed, with the purchase in 2004 of image.net for US$20 million. On February 9, 2006, the microstock photo website iStockphoto was acquired by Getty Images for US$50 million. In 2007, Getty successfully purchased its largest competitor, MediaVast, for $207 million. The acquisition gave Getty Images control of WireImage (Entertainment, creative, and sports photography), FilmMagic (fashion and red carpet photography), and Contour Photos (portrait and studio photography). Getty Images also acquired other subsidiaries, including Master Delegates, which includes Isifa Image Service in Prague and Laura Ronchi in Italy. In 2008, Getty purchased Redferns Music Picture Library, the music photo library built up by British jazz photographer David Redfern.\n\nOn October 23, 2008, Getty Images announced their intention to buy Jupitermedia's online images division, Jupiterimages, for $96 million in cash. The sale went ahead in February 2009; Jupiterimages (including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert) is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Getty. Jupitermedia, now trading as WebMediaBrands, continues its Internet publishing business, which they didn't sell to Getty Images.\n\nOn January 25, 2016, Corbis announced that it had sold its image licensing business, including the Corbis Images, Corbis Motion and Veer libraries and their associated assets, to an affiliate of Visual China Group—Getty's exclusive distributor in China. Concurrently, it was announced that VCG would, after a transition period, license distribution and marketing of the Corbis library outside of China to Getty. The firm will also manage Corbis's physical archives.\n\nIn February 2008, it was announced that Getty Images would be acquired by the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman in a transaction valued at an estimated US$2.4 billion. On July 2, 2008, Getty Images announced the completion of its acquisition. Getty Images common stock ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange at the close of the acquisition and was delisted from the NYSE.\n\nIn 2012, H&F engaged investment bankers to sell the company. While a price of $4 billion was initially discussed, in August when the private equity firm Carlyle Group emerged as the likely acquirer, the price under consideration was said to be $3.3–3.4 billion. CVC Capital Partners Ltd. was also said to have been bidding but had yet to top Carlyle's price. The sale to Carlyle thereafter was announced at $3.3 billion, with co-founders Getty and Klein and the Getty family all carrying their investments over into the new ownership structure. Getty continues to serve as chairman and Klein as chief executive.\n\nIn September 2018, the Getty family announced it would acquire majority stake in the company from Carlyle Group.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Getty Images has created controversy for its methods of pursuing copyright enforcement on behalf of its photographers. Rather than pursue a policy of sending \"cease and desist\" notices, Getty typically mails a demand letter that claims substantial monetary damages from owners of websites it believes infringed on their photographers' copyrights. Getty commonly tries to intimidate website owners by sending collection agents, even though a demand letter does not create a debt.\n\nOne photographer noted, \"Courts don't like to be used as a means of extortion.\" In one case, Getty sent a church in Lichfield, Staffordshire, a £6,000 bill for photographs it used on its website, apparently placed there by a church volunteer. In this case, the church offered to pay Getty what it thought was a reasonable amount. The diocese's communications director said:\n\nGetty was not playing ball or following the normal litigation or dispute resolution procedures and [I advised the church] to ignore them. We don't deal with bullies; we deal with legal threats appropriately. I told [Getty] by letter that's what [the church was] doing, that we were not going to play, and didn't hear any more. \n\n\"The Guardian\" described other instances in which Getty or other stock photo businesses dropped a claim when a website owner refused to pay and hired a lawyer. A law firm was quoted as saying: \"Once we get involved generally Getty does back off.\"\n\nIn 2009, Oscar Michelen, a New York attorney who focuses on such damages claims, said: \"The damages they're requesting aren't equal to the copyright infringement,\" and \"there's no law that says definitively what images are worth in the digital age.\" He called Getty's effort to assess four-figure fines \"a legalized form of extortion\".\n\nIn an effort to combat online copyright infringement, in March 2014 Getty Images made over 35 million images available free for non-commercial online use via embedding with attribution and a link back to the Getty Images website. According to Getty Images executive Craig Peters, \"The principle is to turn what's infringing use with good intentions, turning that into something that's valid licensed use with some benefits going back to the photographer\".\n\nIn 2016, Getty Images entered a lawsuit with Google, taking issue with the way the search giant handled their images scraping methods. Two years later in 2018, Google removed the \"View Image\" button from their image search results. This led to outrage from users around the world, and a number of articles referencing this lawsuit. The button was removed as part of a settlement Google made with Getty Images.\n\nIn 2009, Car-Freshner Corp. filed a lawsuit against Getty Images in U.S. Federal Court, Northern District New York (Case 7:09-cv-01252-GTS -GHL). Car-Freshner claimed that Getty Images had in its catalog photos that included the famous \"tree-shaped\" trademarked car fresheners. In 2011, Getty Images attempted to have the case dismissed, but its motion was denied. In 2012, Getty Images agreed to settle by paying $100,000 to Car-Freshener Corp., but admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nIn September 2013, Avril Nolan brought a $450,000 suit against Getty Images. Nolan alleged that Getty Images improperly let her image be used in advertisements that depicted her as HIV-positive. She claimed the ad's depiction of her as HIV-positive (she is not) hurt her personal and professional relationships and caused her emotional distress. In March 2014 a judge ruled the lawsuit will be taken to court rather than dismissed. Getty Images settled with Nolan in January 2015.\n\nIn November 2013, Getty and Agence France-Presse were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on Twitter related to the 2010 Haiti earthquake without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter's terms of service.\n\nIn July 2016, Getty was sued, unsuccessfully, for over $1 billion by Carol Highsmith, an American photographer notable for donating her 100,000+ image collection, royalty-free, to the Library of Congress, when Highsmith found that Getty has been selling unauthorized licenses of her work (an instance of copyfraud). Carol Highsmith found out about this when she received a letter from a law firm representing Getty demanding $120 for displaying her pictures on a personal website of hers.\n\nIn August 2016, Zuma Press, an independent press agency, filed suit against Getty for alleged copyright violations and unauthorized licensing of more than 47,000 images.\n\nGetty Images has continued practice Corbis (whose license it acquired in 2016) has been criticized for, namely of claiming copyright, watermarking and selling images that are in public domain, including images related to The Holocaust like the Warsaw Ghetto boy photo or the Polish cavalry in Sochaczew photograph.\n\nThe Getty Images Prestige Grant is awarded to two commercial photographers to realise a dream project, awarding them USD$15,000 and $7,500 respectively. The first recipients, in 2015, were Lisa Barnard and Andy Lo Po.\n\n"}

Grant's \"\" as the standard identification work on Northern Hemisphere gulls. Although the Helm series already contained a volume on seabirds, by Peter Harrison, gulls compete for space in that volume with several other seabird families; in addition, Harrison's book was published in 1983, a time when knowledge of gull identification (and taxonomy) was in a considerably more primitive state (and Harrison himself was a specialist in pelagic birds rather than gulls specifically). Malling Olsen & Larsson's book equals or exceeds Grant's work in terms of its level of detail, and consolidates and synthesises the considerable amount of new information that has been discovered since then.\n\nThe first edition of Olsen and Larsson's book was released in 2003. While the book was initially generally well-received, a large number of errors soon came to light. As a result, this edition was withdrawn, and a reprint with corrections was released in 2004. Because the publishers required only the title page of the book to be returned in order for purchasers to receive the reprint free of charge, many copies of the first printing are still in circulation. (Those with a title page are identifiable by the absence of the words \"Reprinted with corrections 2004\" below the publisher's address on reverse of the title page.) The ISBN of the corrected reprint is .\n\nThe corrected reprint has 608 pages. In total, 43 species are given full treatment by this work — identification text, colour plates by Larsson, and several colour photographs (the plates and photographs are placed with the species texts, not grouped together in a separate section). In addition, three Southern Hemisphere species which have occurred as vagrants in the Northern Hemisphere (band-tailed gull, grey gull and swallow-tailed gull) are covered more briefly in an appendix, with a single photograph each, and brief mention is also made here of silver gull which has occurred as an escape from captivity. Preceding the species accounts, an introduction covers the book's species-level taxonomy, and gives general advice on gull identification, including ageing and moult, hybrid and aberrant birds, and the effects of lighting conditions, and plumage wear and fading.\n\nThe book is particularly notable in that it is the first work to bring together information discovered during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 21st century on the identification of birds of the large white-headed gull complex. The book adopts a conservative approach at higher taxonomic levels, lumping all gulls (except for ivory gull, Ross's gull and the two kittiwakes) in the genus \"Larus\". A revised taxonomy is adopted at the species level, however; a number of distinctive forms (mainly in the large white-headed gull complex) are regarded as separate species.\n\nSpecies-level taxonomic decisions adopted in the book are as follows:\n\nOlsen and Larsson had previously collaborated on two other volumes in the Helm series, on terns and skuas.\n\nThe following is a list of errors in the corrected reprint:\n\n"}
{"id": "34753814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34753814", "title": "Inquisition post mortem", "text": "Inquisition post mortem\n\nAn Inquisition post mortem (abbreviated to Inq.p.m. or i.p.m., and formerly known as an escheat) (Latin, meaning \"(inquisition) after death\") is an English medieval record of the death, estate and heir of one of the king's tenants-in-chief, made for royal fiscal purposes. The process of making such inquisition was effected by the royal escheators in each county where the deceased held land. The earliest inq.p.m. was made in 1236, in the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272), and the practice ceased c.1640, at the start of the Civil War, and was finally abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, which ended the feudal system.\n\nThe escheators were ordered by a writ from the king's chancery to investigate the deaths of tenants-in-chief in order to assess what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the mediaeval royal revenues. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a relief, from Latin \"levo, levare\" (to lift-up), plus \"re\" (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a lord of the manor and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the feudal land tenure of barony had become a fixed sum under clause two of Magna Carta (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would \"escheat\" (i.e. revert to the demesne of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of \"escheats\". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which entailed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted a significant part of the royal revenues in mediaeval times.\n\nThe practice arose amongst tenants-in-chief of transferring the legal title in their lands to feoffees to uses, which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief to continue to use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from the scope of the Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal corporation one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of King Henry VII (1485–1509)\nthe king's ancient right to his feudal incidents was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.\n\nFor an heir to inherit his paternal lands a formal and lengthy standard procedure had to be completed, only at the end of which he could \"sue out his livery of seisin\" (i.e. gain physical possession of his inheritance), so it was in his best interest to get the process started as soon as possible after the death. He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred, and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's great seal addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ \"diem clausit extremum\". This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254, informed the escheator that the king had been informed (\"quia datum est nobis intelligi\" (\"because it has been given to us to know\")) that the tenant-in-chief named had \"closed his last day\", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition \"post mortem\", and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ \"diem clausit extremum\" sewn onto it. On receipt of the writ the escheator requested the sheriff of the county concerned to empanell a jury made up of local freeholders, that is to say persons of social standing, who could be relied upon to provide the standard information required in accurate form. Such information, termed 'the jurors' \"verdict\"' comprised:\nThe most immediate order in the writ however was that requiring the escheator to take control of all the deceased's demesne lands, i.e. those which had not been sub-enfeoffed to mesne tenants but had been managed in-hand directly by the deceased and his household officials. All revenues resulting from such lands whilst in the hands of the escheator had to be audited (i.e. accounted for before the Barons of the Exchequer) periodically at the treasury.\n\nThe end result of the inquisition would be one of the three following, depending on what the jury reported:\n\nInquisitions post mortem (or \"escheats\") were recorded on two duplicate sheets of parchment. The original return was held in the records of the chancery, to which department the escheator had made his original return, the other by the treasury, which had caused a copy to be made for fiscal purposes, in order to verify the escheator's accounts which were presented to the treasury periodically. Unlike some other series of records, they were not historically sewn together as rolls, but in modern times the parchment sheets have been bound in files with covers, and are today held at the National Archives in Kew. The documents formerly comprising the chancery records are classified under the initial letter \"C\", whilst those from the exchequer bear the class letter \"E\". After the establishment of the Court of Wards in 1540 a copy of the Inq.p.m. was also sent to that court, and these records also survive at the National Archives classified as \"WARD 7\". When an Inq.p.m. had been held not as a result of a writ from chancery but under the escheator's own authority, the verdict was sent to the exchequer only.\n\nInquisitions post mortem form a valuable source for historians and genealogists, as they not only detail the familial relationships of many of the English nobility and gentry, but also provide information on the history of individual manors, including their size and forms of tenure by which they were held. They thus constitute \"one of the most important sources for the social and economic history of mediaeval England\". They also provide summaries and terms of settlements made during the lifetime of the deceased, for example settlement to feoffees, the original copy of which has rarely survived.\n\nThe following example of the abstracted Latin inq.p.m. of William Pagam (d.1422), published in 1995 as no. 932 in vol. 20, 6–10 Henry V, of the \"Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem\", illustrates many common elements:\n\n\"Writ 24 July 1422. Hampshire. Inquisition. Alton, 26 Aug.\nHe held of the king in-chief in his demesne as of fee the manor of Drayton, annual value 8 marks, for 6s. 8d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas and providing at his own expense for 15 days a hobbler to keep the castle in time of war. By an indenture of 26 Oct. 1418, shown to the jurors, William Tauk, Robert Monkeston and Thomas Welegh, who were seised in their demesne as of fee, granted the manor of Pury, a messuage, carucate and 13 acres meadow, 40 a. pasture and 20 a. wood at \"la Bere juxta Southwyke\" as lands and tenements in Pury, Badley, \"Colvyle\", \"Holdmede\", and \"Bere\", to William Pagam and his wife Agnes, who survives, for life of Agnes, remainder to William and his heirs in fee simple. The manor of Pury, annual value 6 marks, is held of the king in chief, service unknown. The messuage, carucate, arable, meadow, pasture and wood at \"le Bere\" annual value 40s. are held of the king in chief for 7s. 4d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas. He died on 15 July last. Philip Pagam is his son and next heir, aged 6 years and more. C 138/63, no.26A\"\n\nHere the manor of Drayton is held by the feudal military tenure of castle-guard; the manor of Pury had been transferred to feoffees to uses, and was re-granted by them in 1418 back to William and his wife for their uses under trust.\n\nPrinted calendars (abstracted summaries) of almost all the rolls of Inq.p.m.'s have been published in some form, with the exception of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1660. An extensive series of calendars extending from the reign of Henry III to that of Richard III, and with an appendix of lists to the reign of James VI and I, was published in four volumes by the Record Commission between 1806 and 1828, edited by John Caley and John Bayley. However, these volumes were later judged by Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte to be of \"unsatisfactory character\", and to contain many omissions. In 1865 two volumes were published, covering the reigns of Henry III and Edward I, in a new series edited by Charles Roberts entitled \"Calendarium Genealogicum\", which concentrated on providing the names of heirs omitted from the previous publications, designed to be of particular use to genealogists. In 1898 the production of three volumes covering the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509) was started, and was completed in 1955. In 1904 the first volume of a new series of Inq.p.m.'s was published, intended to be more complete and systematic, under Maxwell Lyte's editorship. It covered the reign of Henry III, from 1236, when the practice of producing inq.p.m.'s began. This \"first series\" continued for 26 volumes, the last volume having been published in 2009, although volumes were not published in chronological order. Winchester University and the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London are currently working on a project to publish on-line in searchable format a revised and expanded series of all existing texts covering the years 1236–1447 and 1485–1509. The project also aims in the long-term to produce calendars for the first time of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1542. A number of county record societies have published calendars of Inq.p.m.'s relating to their own counties, abstracted from the chancery and exchequer rolls.\n\n\n\n"}

The policy was created to address the country's overpopulation issue and economic problems.\n\nBy 2010, family planning efforts in Puning had diminished due to rapid economic growth in the area, as Guangdong had become the most successful manufacturing region in the People's Republic of China. However, local family planning officials were pressured to reduce births to meet the nationwide quotas. Chen Hong-Ping, the regional Communist Party chief, launched the Iron Fist Campaign in order to meet these demands.\n\nIn April 2010, a task force of approximately 600 local officials targeted 9,559 women who had violated the country's one-child policy. The women were required to report to government clinics to undergo sterilization. Family members of those women who had refused sterilization were detained indefinitely until the women complied with the procedure. In some cases, the women themselves were detained. Over the course of the 20-day campaign, 1,377 people were detained. From April to June, over 9,000 women were reported to have been sterilized as a result of the campaign.\n\nNews of the campaign did not make major headlines outside of local newspapers. He Yafu, an independent expert on family planning in China, suggested that the central government made an effort to conceal the results of the campaign because Chinese law specifically prohibited the means used to enforce it. Provincial officials have reported that the local Puning authorities will be investigated to determine the legality of their actions. Kate Allen of Amnesty International described the campaign as \"appalling\" and voiced her opinion that \"authorities must condemn this practice immediately\". \n"}
{"id": "11463742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11463742", "title": "Isaac Lampronti", "text": "Isaac Lampronti\n\nIsaac Lampronti (February 3, 1679 – November 16, 1756) was an Italian rabbi and physician, best known as author of the rabbinic encyclopedia \"Paħad Yitzħak\".\n\nLampronti was born at Ferrara. His great-grandfather, Samuel Lampronti, had emigrated from Constantinople to Ferrara in the sixteenth century. His father, a man of wealth, died when Isaac was six years of age. Isaac was sent to school in his eighth year, his teachers being Shabbethai Elhanan Recanati and S. E. Sanguineti. In his fourteenth year he went to Lugo, to the school of R. Manoah Provençal; thence he went to Padua to study medicine, attending at the same time lectures on philosophy. There he enjoyed especially the intercourse and instruction of the physician R. Isaac Cantarini.\n\nOn completing his medical studies he was employed as teacher for a time in various Italian cities, and on his return to his native city the \"yeshibah\" conferred upon him the title of \"ḥaber\". Shortly afterward he went to Mantua to complete his rabbinical studies under R. Judah Brial and R. Joseph Cases, who also was a physician. Lampronti entered into especially close relations with R. Judah, whom he frequently mentions in his great work. When Mantua was threatened with war, in 1701, Lampronti, following the wishes of his family, returned to Ferrara, where he established himself as physician and teacher, delivering lectures for adults in his house both on week-days and on the Sabbath.\n\nIn 1709 Lampronti was appointed teacher at the Italian Talmud Torah, receiving a monthly salary of twelve \"scudi\" in return for devoting the larger part of his day to teaching chiefly Hebrew grammar, arithmetic, and Italian. Lampronti gave his pupils his own homilies on the weekly sections, composed in Italian, for practise in translating into Hebrew. He also set some of his pupils to copy from the sources material which he needed for the encyclopedic work he had undertaken.\n\nThe directors of the community, who thought this interfered with his duties as teacher, forbade him, in October, 1725, to keep the material for his work in the schoolhouse. When the Spanish Talmud Torah was discontinued, in 1729, the pupils of this school also passed into the hands of Lampronti. Thus he became the teacher of most of the members of the community, and long after his death it was said in the community of Ferrara, \"All the learning found among us is derived from the mouth of our father Isaac.\"\n\nIn addition to his duties as teacher he filled the position of preacher, from 1704, in the Sephardic community, and, beginning with 1717, in the Italian synagogue. His sermons, which were very popular, have not been preserved. He mentions one of them, on truth and untruth, in referring to his \"Sefer ha-Derushim Shelli\" in an article of his \"Paḥad Yiẓḥaḳ\" (letter מ, article ). His funeral oration (\"Darke Shalom\") on Samson Morpurgo he mentions in his approbation to the latter's responsa \"Shemesh Ẓedaḳah.\" His name is connected with an Ark of the Law in the Sephardic synagogue at Ferrara, placed there by him in 1710, at his own cost.\n\nIn 1718 Lampronti was appointed a full member of the rabbinical college. His signature as the latest member, following those of Mordecai Zahalon, Shabbethai Elhanan Recanati, and Samuel Baruch Borghi, is found in a responsum of the \"yeshibah\" of Ferrara of the year 1727, which he quotes (letter ב, p. 20d).\n\nIn 1738 he was elected rabbi of the Spanish synagogue in place of his former teacher, Recanati; and after the death of Mordecai Zahalon he became president of the \"yeshibah\" (1749). He began immediately the printing of his great work (see below). He had then reached the age of seventy, and for the next eight years until his death, he taught continuously, although he had to be taken to the school by his pupils on account of an ailment of his feet.\n\nNotwithstanding his other occupations, he continued to practise medicine, visiting his patients early in the morning, because, as he said, the physician has a surer eye and can judge better of the state of his patient after the night's rest. He had a great reputation as physician, and his contemporaries generally added to his name the epithet \"the famous physician.\"\n\nHe corresponded on medical subjects with his teacher Isaac Cantarini, and he drew upon his medical knowledge in many passages of his work.\n\nHe died deeply mourned by the community and his numerous pupils. No stone was erected on his grave, for half a year before his death the tombstones of the Jewish cemetery of Ferrara had been destroyed at the instigation of the clergy (Ferrara belonged to the Papal States), and the Jews were at the same time forbidden to place stones on the graves of their dead. More than a century later, Ferrara publicly honored the memory of Lampronti; on April 19, 1872, a stone tablet, for which Jews and Christians had contributed, was placed on the house in which he had lived; it bears the following inscription: \"Abitò in questa casa Isacco Lampronti, nato nel MDCLXXIX., morto nel MDCCLVI. Medico Teologo tra i dotti celebratissimo. Onorò la patria. Riverenti alla scienza alcuni cittadini posero MDCCCLXXII.\"\n\nLampronti's life-work was his rabbinical encyclopedia \"Pachad Yitzchak\" (name derived from Gen. xxxi. 42), the material for which he had begun to collect as early as his student days at Mantua, and on which he worked during his whole life. When he decided in his old age to publish this great work, he traveled together with his pupil Jacob Raphael Saraval, as the latter says in the preface of the correctors (Saraval and Simchah Calimani), through the Italian cities in order to secure the approbations (\"haskamot\") of the rabbinical authorities of Italy for the work.\n\nThe collection of these approbations, which were given in 1749 and 1750, is a curious monument of the Jewish scholars of northern Italy in the eighteenth century; it includes sonnets and poems in other forms in honor of Lampronti. The following cities are represented by their yeshibahs or rabbis: Venice, Leghorn, Reggio, Verona, Ancona, Padua, Mantua, Casale Monferrato, Modena, Turin, Florence, Alessandria della Paglia, Pesaro, Finale, Lugo, Rovigo. In the second volume are added the approbations of R. Malachi ben Jacob Kohn of Livorno, author of the \"Yad Mal'achi,\" and of three Palestinian scholars stopping at Ferrara.\n\nThe work was planned to fill six volumes, as recorded in the printing permit of the Jewish communal directorate of Venice. But only the first volume and the first half of the second volume appeared during the author's lifetime. Vol. i. (1750) contains in two specially paged sections (of 124 and 76 folios respectively) the letter א; the first part of vol. ii. (1753) contains the letters ב (fol. 1-75) and ו (fol. 76-105). The second part of vol. ii. appeared forty years after the author's death (1796); it contains the letters ח (fol. 1-49), ו (fol. 50-60), ן (fol. 67-77), ח, beginning (78-110). Vol. iii. appeared in the same year; it contains: ח, end (fol. 1-61), ט (fol. 63-93). These volumes were printed at the press of Isaac Foa (formerly Bragadini) at Venice. Two other volumes appeared in 1813 (vol. iv., Reggio) and 1840 (vol. v., Leghorn); vol. iv. contains the letters י (fol. 1-41a.), ב (fol. 41a-108); ל (specially paged, 1-26); vol. v. contains the letter מ (241 fols.). This last-named volume contains additions to the text by Abraham Baruch Piperno, under the title \"Zechor le-Abraham.\"\n\nIn 1845 the autograph manuscript of the entire work was acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, in 120 volumes, 68 of which corresponded with the parts that had so far appeared. The Paris manuscript also contains the author's Italian correspondence, which was not included in the edition (see Cat. Hebr. MSS. Bibliothèque Nationale. p. 61. Nos. 458-577). The society Mekitze Nirdamim, on its foundation, took as one of its first tasks the publication of those portions of Lampronti's work which had not yet been printed. The first to appear (in octavo instead of folio, the size of the previous volumes) were the letters נ (1864; 100 fols.), ס (1866; 196 fols.), ע (1868; 173 fols.), פ (1871; 74 fols.), and צ and first half of ק (1874; 200 fols.). The work was continued ten years later by the reorganized society Mekitze Nirdamim; during 1885-87 the remainder of the letter ק was published and the letters ר (148 fols.), ש (318 fols.), and ח (183 fols.). Thus the publication of the work was completed 127 years after the printing of the first volume.\n\nLampronti's work is an alphabetically arranged encyclopedia to the \"Talmud\" and Talmudic literature. In the censor's permit, dated June, 1749, prefixed to the first volume, it is designated as \"Dizionario Rituale in Lingua Ebraica,\" a designation which probably originated with the author. As a matter of fact Lampronti's encyclopedia deals chiefly with the Halachah, the material for the articles being taken from the entire halachic literature down to the latest responsa, which he had, in part, in manuscript. He devotes much space to discussing questions of ritual law, as found in the responsa of contemporary Italian rabbis. On some questions he gives the entire correspondence, as on fols. 9d-13a, 31d-37d, 46d-50a, 74b-76a, 79c-80b, 102b-107a, in the first volume.\n\nThe arrangement is a characteristic feature of the work. Single words are used occasionally as headings for his articles, but more frequently he uses entire sentences, either as he found them in the sources, or as propositions derived from the sources. In vol. i. thirty articles begin with the word<?> ; and a special article, besides, refers to about one hundred other articles of the work in which this concept is treated (see Jew. Encyc. ii. 215-218). About one hundred articles begin with the word<?>, and a special article refers to as many more in which the word occurs. The articles are arranged in strictly alphabetical order, this being especially important in a work of this kind. The quotations are accompanied by an exact statement of their sources. In addition to the Halakah much space is devoted to the Haggadah of the Talmuds, and the work may also be regarded as an alphabetical index of the Talmudic haggadic sentences.\n\nIt may be noted as a curious instance that in the article (ii. 766) Lampronti refers to a work in Italian, the title of which he quotes in carefully punctuated Hebrew transcription: \"Demostrazioni della Essenza di Dio dalle Opere della sua Creazione; da Guglielmo Deram [], Firenze, 1719.\" Lampronti's work has not yet been critically examined, nor has a list been made of the sources which he used or quoted. Addenda made by Lampronti are preserved in the library of the Talmud Torah at Ferrara; according to Rabbi Benedetto Isaac Levi of Ferrara, the author of a short biography of Lampronti (\"Ha-Maggid,\" xix. 70), there are thirty-five folios, most of the leaves of which are, however, blank. But the addenda which are scattered through the several volumes of the work itself would if collected make a stout volume.\n\nLampronti's elder son, Samuel Ḥay, is mentioned in the article ; his younger son, Solomon Lampronti, was a physician, like his father, and versed in rabbinical lore.\n\n"}
{"id": "577929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577929", "title": "Lion dance", "text": "Lion dance\n\nLion dance () is a form of traditional dance in Chinese culture and other Asian countries in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume to bring good luck and fortune. The lion dance is usually performed during the Chinese New Year and other Chinese traditional, cultural and religious festivals. It may also be performed at important occasions such as business opening events, special celebrations or wedding ceremonies, or may be used to honour special guests by the Chinese communities.\n\nThe Chinese lion dance is sometimes mistakenly referred to as dragon dance by most first timers. An easy way to tell the difference is that a lion is normally operated by just two dancers and has a tail, while a dragon is longer and is held on poles by many people. Chinese lion dance fundamental movements can be found in Chinese martial arts.\n\nThere are two main forms of the Chinese lion dance, the Northern Lion and the Southern Lion. Both forms are commonly found in China, but around the world especially in South East Asia, the Southern Lion predominates as it was spread by the Chinese diaspora communities who are historically mostly of Southern Chinese origin. The Southern Lion consists of three styles, Hok San, Fut San and Fut Hok. Versions of the lion dance are also found in Japan, Korea, Tibet and Vietnam. Another form of lion dance exists in Indonesian culture, but it may be of a different tradition and may be referred to as \"Singa Barong\".\n\nThere has been an old tradition in China of dancers wearing masks to resemble animals or mythical beasts since antiquity, and performances described in ancient texts such as \"Shujing\" where wild beasts and phoenix danced may have been masked dances. In Qin Dynasty sources, dancers performing exorcism rituals were described as wearing bearskin mask, and it was also mentioned in Han Dynasty texts that \"mime people\" (象人) performed as fish, dragons, and phoenixes. However, lion is not native to China (a species found in Northeast China \"Panthera youngi\" had long become extinct), and the Lion Dance therefore has been suggested to have originated outside of China from countries such as India or Persia, and introduced via Cental Asia. According to ethnomusicologist Laurence Picken, the Chinese word for lion itself, \"shi\" (獅, written as 師 in the early periods), may have been derived from the Persian word \"šer\". The earliest use of the word \"shizi\" meaning lion first appeared in Han Dynasty texts and had strong association with Central Asia (an even earlier but obsolete term for lion was \"suanni\" (狻麑 or 狻猊)), and lions were presented to the Han court by emissaries from Central Asia and the Parthian Empire. Detailed descriptions of Lion Dance appeared during the Tang Dynasty and it was already recognized by writers and poets then as a foreign dance, however, Lion dance may have been recorded in China as early as the third century AD where \"lion acts\" were referred to by a Three Kingdoms scholar Meng Kang (孟康) in a commentary on \"Hanshu\". In the early periods it had association with Buddhism: it was recorded in a Northern Wei text, \"Description of Buddhist Temples in Luoyang\" (洛陽伽藍記), that a parade for a statue of Buddha of a temple was led by a lion to drive away evil spirits. An alternative suggestion is therefore that the dance may have been developed from a local tradition that appropriated the Buddhist symbolism of lion.\nThere were different versions of the dance in the Tang Dynasty. In the Tang court, the lion dance was called the Great Peace Music (太平樂, \"Taiping yue\") or the Lion Dance of the Five Directions (五方師子舞) where five large lions of different colours and expressing different moods were each led and manipulated on rope by two persons, and accompanied by 140 singers. In another account, the 5 lions were described as each over 3 metres tall and each had 12 \"lion lads\", who may tease the lions with red whisks. Another version of the lion dance was described by the Tang poet Bai Juyi in his poem \"Western Liang Arts\" (西凉伎), where the dance was performed by two \"hu\" (胡, meaning here non-Han people from Central Asia) dancers who wore a lion costume made of a wooden head, a silk tail and furry body, with eyes gilded with gold and teeth plated with silver as well as ears that moved, a form that resembles today's Lion Dance. By the eighth century, this lion dance had reached Japan. During the Song Dynasty the lion dance was commonly performed in festivals and it was known as the Northern Lion during the Southern Song.\n\nThe Southern Lion is a later development in the south of China originating in the Guangdong province. There are a number of myths associated with the origin of the Southern Lion: one story relates that the dance originated as a celebration in a village where a mythical monster called Nian was successfully driven away; another has it that the Qianlong Emperor dreamt of an auspicious animal while on a tour of Southern China, and ordered that the image of the animal be recreated and used during festivals. However it is likely that the Southern Lion of Guangzhou is an adaptation of the Northern Lion to local myths and characteristics, perhaps during the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe two main types of lion dance in China are the Northern and Southern Lions. There are however also a number of local forms of lion dance in different regions of China, and some of these lions may have significantly differences in appearance, for example the Green Lion (青獅, Qing Shi) popular with the Hokkien people and Taiwanese. Other ethnic minorities groups in China may also have their own lion dances, for examples the lion dance of the Muslim minority in Shenqiu County in Henan. Chinese lion dances usually involve two dancers but may also be performed by one. The larger lions manipulated by two persons may be referred to as great lions (太獅), and those manipulated by one person little lions (少獅). The performances may also be broadly divided into civil (文獅) and martial (武獅) styles. The civil style emphasizes the character and mimics and behaviour of the lion, while the martial style is focused on acrobatics and energetic movements.\n\nThere are related forms of dances with mask figures that represent mythical creatures such as the Qilin and Pixiu. The Qilin dance is most commonly performed by the Hakka people who were originally from northern China, but have largely settled in the south of China and southeast Asia in modern times.\n\nVarious forms of lion dance are also found widely in East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, as well as among the communities in the Himalayan region.\n\nThe Chinese Northern Lion () Dance is often performed as a pair of male and female lions in the north of China. Northern lions may have a gold-painted wooden head, and shaggy orange and yellow hair with a red bow on its head to indicate a male lion, or a green bow (sometimes green hair) to represent a female. There are however regional variations of the lion.\n\nNorthern lions resemble Pekingese or Fu Dogs, and its movements are lifelike during a performance. Acrobatics are very common, with stunts like lifts, or balancing on a tiered platform or on a giant ball. Northern lions sometimes appear as a family, with two large \"adult\" lions and a pair of small \"young lions\". There are usually two performers in one adult lion, and one in the young lion. There may also be a \"warrior\" character who holds a spherical object and leads the lions.\n\nThe dance of the Northern Lion is generally more playful than the Southern Lion. Regions with well-known lion dance troupes include Xushui in Hebei province, and Ninghai in Ningbo. There are a number of variations of the lion dance performance, for example the Heavenly Tower Lion Dance () from Xiangfen County in Shanxi is a performance whereby a number of lions climb up a tall tower structure constructed out of wooden stools, and there are also high-wire acts involving lions\n\nThe Chinese Southern Lion () or Cantonese Lion dance originated from Guangdong. The Southern Lion has a single horn, and is associated with the legend of a mythical monster called Nian. The lion consists of a head which is traditionally constructed using papier-mâché over a bamboo frame covered with gauze, then painted and decorated with fur, and a body made of durable layered cloth trimmed with more fur. Newer lions however may be made with modern materials such as aluminium instead of bamboo and are lighter. Newer versions may also apply shinier modern material over the traditional lacquer such as sequin or laser sticker but they do not last as long as those with semi-dull lacquer. Depending on the lion type (Traditional or Modern), Different types of fur can be used.\n\nThere are two main styles of Guangdong or Cantonese Lion: the \"Fut San\" or \"Fo Shan\" (), and the \"Hok San\" or \"He Shan\" (), both named after their place of origin. Other minor styles include the Fut-Hok (a hybrid of Fut San and Hok San created in Singapore by Kong Chow Wui Koon in the 1960s), and the Jow Ga (performed by practitioners of Jow family style kung fu). The different lion types can be identified from the design of the lion head.\n\nFo Shan is the style many kung fu schools adopt. It requires power in moves and strength in posture, using kung fu stances to help with the sharp movements and emotions, and only the most advanced students are allowed to perform. Traditionally, the Fo Shan lion has bristles instead of fur and is heavier than the modern ones now popularly used. It also has a very long tail and eyes that swivel left and right. On the back there are gold foiled rims and a gilded area called the collar where the troupe's name may be sewn on. All the traditional style Fo Shan have pop-up teeth on the side on the head, tongue, and swiveling eyes. The underside of the tail is white; the designs of the tail are also more square and contain a diamond pattern going down the back, and often has bells attached to the tail. It has a high forehead, curved lips and a sharp horn on its head. Traditional Fo Shan lions are ornate in appearance, a number of regional styles however have developed around the world. The newer styles of Fo Shan lions replace all the bristles with fur and the tails are shorter. The eyes are fixed in place, and the tongue and teeth do not pop up. The tail is more curvy in design, does not have a diamond pattern, and lacks bells.\nThe He Shan style lion is known for its richness of expression, unique footwork, impressive-looking appearance and vigorous drumming style. The founder of this style is thought to be the \"Canton Lion King\" Feng Gengzhang () in the early 20th century. Feng was born in a village in He Shan county in Guangdong, and he was instructed in martial arts and lion dance by his father. Later, he also studied martial arts and Southern lion dance in Foshan before returning to his hometown and setting up his own training hall. He developed his unique version of lion dance, creating new techniques by studying and mimicking movement of cats, such as \"catching mouse, playing, catching birds, high escape, lying low and rolling\". He and his disciples also made changes to the lion head, its forehead is lower, its horn rounded and it has a duck beak mouth with flat lips. The body of the lion is also more powerful in structure with eye-catching colours. Together with new dance steps and agile footwork, a unique rhythm invented by Feng called the \"Seven Star Drum\", Feng created a new style of lion dancing that is high in entertainment value and visual appeal. In the early 1920s, the He Shan lion dance was performed when Sun Yat-Sen assumed office in Guangzhou, and created a stir. Around 1945, He Shan lion performers were often invited to perform in many places within China and Southeast Asia during celebratory festivals. The He Shan style became very popular in Singapore; the lion acquired the title of \"Lion King of Kings\", and has a \"king\" character () on its forehead. Further improvement had been made by the Singapore Hok San Association, for example making the lion more \"cat-like\" by shortening the tail of He Shan lion, and creating new drum beat for the dance.\n\nDifferent colors are used to signify the age and character of the lions. The lion with white fur is considered to be the oldest of the lions, while the lion with golden yellow fur is the middle child. The black lion is considered the youngest lion, and the movement of this lion should be fast like a young child or a headstrong teenager. The colors may also represent the character of the lion: the golden lion represents liveliness, the red lion courage, and the green lion friendship. There are also three lion types that represent three historical characters recorded in the classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms who were blood oath brothers that swore to restore the Han dynasty: Hok san lion dance has been adopted by many modern groups, leaving only a few traditional groups - main Jow Ga related.\n\nLater three more Lions were added to the group. The Green Faced Lion represented Zhao Yun or Zhao (Cantonese: Chiu) Zi Long. The Zhao Zi Long lion is a green lion with a green tail with black trim and a white underside, as well as a white beard and fur and an iron horn. He is often called the fourth brother, this lion is called the Heroic Lion because it is said he rode through Cao Cao’s million man army and rescued Liu Bei’s infant and fought his way back out. The Yellow (yellow/orange) face and body with white beard represented Huang Zhong (Cantonese: Wong Tsung), he was given this color when Liu Bei rose to become Emperor. The Huang Joon has a full yellow tail with white trim. This lion is called the Righteous Lion. The white lion is known as Ma Chao (Cantonese: Ma Chiu), he was assigned this color because he always wore a white arm band in his battle against the Emperor of Wei, Cao Cao, to signify that he was in mourning for his father and brother who had been murdered by Cao Cao. Thus this lion was known as the funeral lion. This lion is never used except for the funeral of a Master or an important head of a group, and in such cases the lion is usually burned right after use as it is symbolically inauspicious to be kept around. This lion is sometimes confused with the silver lion which sometimes has a whitish colouring. These three along with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were known as the \"Five Tiger Generals of Shun,\" each representing one of the colors of the five elements.\n\nGreen Lion (青狮) is the lion dance form associated with the province of Fujian and the Hokkien-speaking people. It is similar to the Chinese southern lion dance, except that the lion is mainly green in color and has a distinct round flat mask. It is believed to have originated in the anti-Manchu movements after the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. The word \"green lion\" in the Hokkien language sounds similar to \"Qing army\" (清师). During training sessions for fighters, the Green lion was fitted with blades symbolizing the Manchurian army and would become a moving target for trainees. It is said that after the fall of Qing dynasty in 1912, martial arts expert Mr. Gan De Yuan (干德源) organized a performance in Quanzhou where the Green Lion was dismembered to represent the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. From that point onwards, the Green Lion is used without the blades and performed for cultural and ritual purposes.\n\nThe lion dance is known in Vietnam as the unicorn dance (Vietnamese: ). Most lions in Vietnam resemble the Southern Lion – they are part of the Chinese Southern Lion tradition but have acquired local characteristics. There are however also distinct local forms that differ significantly in appearance and performance, for example the lion dances of the Tay and Nung minority people. A court version of the dance is performed at the Duyet Thi Duong Theatre within the ground of the royal palace in Huế. \n\nThe dance is performed primarily at traditional festivals such as Vietnamese lunar new year (') and Mid-Autumn Festival ('), as well as during other occasions such as the opening of a new business. The dance is typically accompanied by martial artists and acrobatics. A feature of the Vietnamese unicorn dance is its dance partner \"Ông Địa\" or the spirit of the earth, depicted as a large bellied, broadly grinning man holding a palm-leaf fan similar to the Chinese 'Big Head Buddha' (大头佛). The good-hearted spirit, according to popular beliefs, has the power to summon the auspicious unicorn, and thus during the dance, takes the lead in clearing the path for the unicorn. The comical appearance of Ông Địa adds to the festive and merry-making nature of the dance. The vietnamese lion heads are made differently because it's missing its horn. This is because teams used to fight each other. This resulted in the horn being kicked off constantly. To solve this problem, many Vietnamese teams have requested no horns to make it harder for the opponent to damage the lion.\n\nJapan has a long tradition of the lion dance and the dance is known as \"\" () in Japanese. It is thought to have been imported from China during the Tang Dynasty, and became associated with celebration of Buddha's Birthday. The first lion dance recorded in Japan was at the inauguration ceremonies of Tōdai-ji in Nara in 752. The oldest surviving lion mask, made of paulownia wood with an articulated lower jaw, is also preserved in Tōdai-ji. The dance is commonly performed during the New Year to bring good luck and drive away evil spirits, and the lion dancers may be accompanied by flute and drum musicians. It is also performed at other festivals and celebrations. In some of these performances, the lions may bite people on the head to bring good luck.\n\nThe lion dance has been completely absorbed into Japanese tradition. There are many different lion dances in Japan and the style of dancing and design of the lion may differ by region – it is believed that as many as 9,000 variations of the dance exist in the country. The lion dance is also used in religious Shinto festivals as part of a performing art form called '. ' may be found in different forms - for example the ' which is mainly acrobatic, the ', a type of theatrical performance done by \"yamabushi\" ascetics, and also in \"bangaku\" and others. Various forms of \"shishi\" dances are also found in \"noh\", \"kabuki\" (where the lion dances form a group of plays termed \"shakkyōmono\"), and \"bunraku\" theatres.\n\nThe Japanese lion consists of a wooden, lacquered head called a ' (lit. Lion Head), often with a characteristic body of green dyed cloth with white designs. It can be manipulated by a single person, or by two or more persons, one of whom manipulates the head. The one-man variety is most often seen in eastern Japan. As with Chinese lions, the make of the head and designs on the body will differ from region to region, and even from school to school. The mask however may sometimes have horns appearing to be a deer ('), and ' written with different Kanji characters can mean beast, deer or wild boar, for example as in ' (鹿踊, lit. Deer Dance). Historically the word \"shishi\" may refer to any wild four-legged animal, and some of these dances with different beasts may therefore also be referred to as \"shishi-mai\". The dance may also sometimes feature tigers (') or \"qilin\" (').\n\nIn Okinawa, a similar dance exists, though the lion there is considered to be a legendary '. The heads, bodies and behavior of the shisa in the dance are quite different from the ' on mainland Japan. Instead of dancing to the sounds of flutes and drums, the Okinawan \"shisa\" dance is often performed to folk songs played with the \"\".\n\nLion dance was recorded in the Korean historical work \"Samguk Sagi\" as \"'\" (狻猊, the old Chinese word for lion), one of the five poems on the dances of the Silla kingdom written by Choe Chiwon. It may have been recorded as early as the King Jinheung's reign in the 6th century during which a tune titled \"The Lion's Talent\" was composed that could be a reference to a lion dance. Two main traditions of lion dance survive in Korea, the ', which is performed as an exorcism drama; and the \"\" which is performed in association with masked dramas. In many of the traditional masked dance dramas, the lion dance appears as one part of a number of acts. Examples of these dramas are \"Ŭnyul t'alch'um\", \"Pongsan t'alch'um\" (봉산탈춤), \"Suyong Yayu\" (수영야류), and \"T'ongyong Ogwangdae\" (통영오광대). The lion masks of Pongsan and Gangnyeong may feature rolling eyes and bells meant to frighten demons when they make a sound as the lion moves. There was also once a court version of the lion dance.\nLion dance as an exorcism ritual began to be performed in the New Year in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. The best known of the Korean \"saja-noreum\" lion dances is the \"Bukcheong sajanoreum\" or lion mask play from Bukcheong. In this lion dance the lion with a large but comic lion mask and brown costume may be performed together with performers wearing other masks. The dancers may be accompanied by musicians playing a double-headed drum, an hourglass-shaped drum, a large gong, and a six-holed bamboo flute. The dance was originally performed every night of the first fifteen nights of the lunar New Year, where the dance troupe in lion masks and costumes visited every house in the villages of the Bukcheong region, and the lion dance is meant to expel evil spirits and attract good luck for the coming year. The eyes of the lion mask may be painted gold to expel negative spirits. It is also believed that children who sat on the back of the lion during such performances would enjoy good health and a long life.\n\nIn the Himalayan and Tibetan area, there is also a lion dance called the snow lion dance. This dance may be found in Tibet and also among Tibetan diaspora communities where it is called \"\", Nepal, and parts of Northeastern India – among the Monpa people in Arunachal Pradesh, in Sikkim where it is called \"Singhi Chham\", and in some parts of Uttar Pradesh and Ladakh. The name \"seng ge\" and its related forms come from Sanskrit \"siṅha\", and \"cham\" is a Buddhist ritual dance. The snow lion has white fur, and in Tibet, it may also have a green mane or green fringes, while in Sikkim, the mane may be blue.\n\nThe Snow Lion is regarded as an emblem of Tibet and the Snow Lion Dance is popular dance in Tibetan communities and it is performed during festivals such as during the ritual dance (cham) festival and the New Year. Ths snow lion represents the snowy mountain ranges and glaciers of Tibet and is considered highly auspicious, and it may also symbolize a number of characteristics, such as power and strength, and fearlessness and joy. The snow lion may have a long history in Tibet, but some local versions of the dance may also have been influenced by Chinese Lion Dance in the Sino-Tibetan borderland – for example, it was recording that the local chief in Songpan, Sichuan gave a lion costume to the Jamyang Zhépa II of the Amdo region in the 18th century. The snow lion dance may be performed as a secular dance, or as a ritual dance performed by bon po monks.\n\nThe Chinese lion dance is referred to as \"barongsai\" in Indonesia, often performed by Chinese Indonesian during \"Imlek\". Indonesians however, have developed their own style of lion dances. The lion dance (Indonesian: \"\") in Indonesia has different forms that are distinct to the local cultures in Indonesia, and it is not known if it has any relation to the Chinese lion. The best known lion dances are performed in Bali and Java.\n\nIn Hindu Balinese culture, the Barong is the king of good spirits, and the enemy of the demon queen Rangda. Like the Chinese lion, it requires more dancers than in the Javanese Reog.\n\nThe Reog dance of Ponorogo in Java involves a lion figure known as the '. It is held on special occasions such as the \"Lebaran\" (Eid al-Fitr), City or Regency anniversary, or Independence day carnival. A single dancer, or ', carries the heavy lion mask about 30 – 40 kg weight by his teeth. He is credited with exceptional strength. The \"\" may also carry an adolescent boy or girl on its head. When holding an adolescent boy or girl on his head, the Reog dancer holds the weight up to total 100 kilograms. The great mask that spans over 2.5 meters with genuine tiger or leopard skin and real peacock feathers. It has gained international recognition as the world's largest mask.\n\nThe Chinese Lion Dance is performed accompanied by the music of beating of tanggu (drum) (in Singapore, datanggu), cymbals, and gongs. Instruments synchronise to the lion dance movements and actions. Fut San, Hok San, Fut Hok, Chow Gar, etc. all play their beat differently. Each style plays a unique beat.\nDevelopments in electronic devices have allowed music to be played via phone/tablet/computer/mp3 player. This has contributed to the evolution of how people can play lion dance music - which eliminates the need to carry around instruments (which can be quite large).\n\nThe most common style is Sar Ping lion dance beats. This has more than 22 different testings that you can use to show the lion's movement, whereas fut san has only around 7.\n\nThe lion dance costumes used in these performances can only be custom made in specialty craft shops in rural parts of Asia and have to be imported at considerable expense for most foreign countries outside Asia. For groups in Western countries, this is made possible through funds raised through subscriptions and pledges made by members of local cultural and business societies. For countries like Malaysia with a substantial Chinese population, local expertise may be available in making the \"lion\" costumes and musical instruments without having to import them from China. Most modern Southern Lion dance costumes comes with a set of matching pants, however some practitioners use black kung fu pants to appear more traditional. Modern lion dance costumes are made to be very durable and some are waterproof.\n\nThe Chinese lion dance has close relations to kung fu or Wǔshù (武術) and the dancers are usually martial art members of the local kung fu club or school. They practice in their club and some train hard to master the skill as one of the disciplines of the martial art. In general, it is seen that if a school has a capable troupe with many 'lions', it demonstrates the success of the school. It is also generally practised together with Dragon dance in some area.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year, lion dance troupes will visit the houses and shops of the Asian community to perform the traditional custom of \"cai qing\" (採青), literally meaning \"plucking the greens\", whereby the lion plucks the auspicious green lettuce either hung on a pole or placed on a table in front of the premises. The \"greens\" (\"qing\") is tied together with a \"red envelope\" containing money and may also include auspicious fruit like oranges. In Chinese \"cǎi\" (採, pluck) also sounds like \"cài\" (菜, meaning vegetable) and \"cái\" (财, meaning fortune). The \"lion\" will dance and approach the \"green\" and \"red envelope\" like a curious cat, to \"eat the green\" and \"spit\" it out but keep the \"red envelope\" which is the reward for the lion troupe. The lion dance is believed to bring good luck and fortune to the business. During the Qing Dynasty, there may be additional hidden meanings in the performances, for example the green vegetables (\"qing\") eaten by the lion may represent the Qing Manchus.In modern Hok San lion dance, they will use one of the many testings to approach the food, each one with a specific beat and movement sequence.\n\nDifferent types of vegetables, fruits, foods or utensils with auspicious and good symbolic meanings; for instance pineapples, pomelos, bananas, oranges, sugar cane shoots, coconuts, beer, clay pots or even crabs can be used to be the \"greens\" (青) to be \"plucked\" to give different difficulty and challenge for the lion dance performers. But the difficulties of the challenge should comes with the bigger the rewards of the \"red envelope\" given.\n\nIn the old days, the lettuce was hung 5 to 6 metres above ground and only a well-trained martial artist could reach the money while dancing with a heavy lion head. These events became a public challenge. A large sum of money was rewarded, and the audience expected a good show. Sometimes, if lions from multiple martial arts schools approached the lettuce at the same time, the lions are supposed to fight to decide a winner. The lions had to fight with stylistic lion moves instead of chaotic street fighting styles. The audience would judge the quality of the martial art schools according to how the lions fought. Since the schools' reputation were at stake, the fights were usually fierce but civilized. The winner lion would then use creative methods and martial art skills to reach the high-hanging reward. Some lions may dance on bamboo stilts and some may step on human pyramids formed by fellow students of the school. The performers and the schools would gain praise and respect on top of the large monetary reward when they did well. The lion dance troupes are sometimes accompanied by various characters such as the Big Head Buddha,\n\nDuring the 1950s-60s, in some areas with high population of Chinese and Asian communities especially the Chinatown in many foreign countries abroad China in the world, people who joined lion dance troupes were \"gangster-like\" and there was a lot of fighting between lion dance troupes and kung fu schools. Parents were afraid to let their children join lion dance troupes because of the \"gangster\" association with the members. During festivals and performances, when lion dance troupes met, there may be fights between groups. Some lifts and acrobatic tricks are designed for the lion to \"fight\" and knock over other rival lions. Performers even hid daggers in their shoes and clothes, which could be used to injure other lion dancers’ legs, or even attached a metal horn on their lion’s forehead, which could be used to slash other lion heads. The violence became so extreme that at one point the Hong Kong government banned lion dance completely. Now, as with many other countries, lion dance troupes must attain a permit from the government in order to perform lion dance. Although there is still a certain degree of competitiveness, troupes are a lot less violent and aggressive. Now days, whenever teams meet each other, they'll shake hands through the mouth of the lion to show sportsmanship.\n\nIn a traditional performance, when the dancing lion enters a village or township, it is supposed to pay its respects first at the local temple(s), then to the ancestors at the ancestral hall, and finally through the streets to bring happiness to all the people.\n\nLion dance has spread across the world due to the worldwide presence of the diaspora Chinese communities and immigrant settlers in many countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Pacific Polynesia, and in particular, in South East Asia where there is a large overseas Chinese presence.\n\nThe dance has evolved considerably since the early days when it was perform as a skill part of Chinese martial arts, and has grown into a more artistic art that takes into accounts the lion's expression and the natural movements, as well as the development of a more elaborate acrobatic styles and skills during performances. This evolution and development has produced the modern form of lion dances, and competition are held to find the best lion dance performances. \n\nInternational Lion Dance championships are held in many countries, for example in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The competition may be performed on a series of small circular platforms raised on poles called \"Jongs\", and there are a total of 21 poles in the traditional set. These can reach 3m for normal heights, but championship poles can go up to 6m. The competition is judged based on the skill and liveliness of the \"lion\" together with the creativity of the stunts and choreographed moves, as well as the difficulty of the acrobatics, and rhythmic and pulsating live instrumental accompaniment that can captivate the spectators and the judges of the competition. The main judging rubric is developed by international dragon and lion dance federation. Their rubric is used in many professional competitions including Genting. World championships are held every 2 years in Malaysia called genting lion dance championship. The current champion is consecutive winner KSK from Malaysia. Winning almost every world championships.\n\nThe lion dance is seen as a representative part of Chinese culture in many overseas Chinese communities, and in some South East Asian countries, there were attempts to ban or discourage the dance in order to suppress the Chinese cultural identity in those countries. For example, in Malaysia, lion dance was criticized by a Malay politician in the 1970s as not Malaysian in style and suggested that it be changed to a tiger dance, and it was banned except at Chinese New Year until 1990. Lion dance became a matter of political and public debate about the national culture of the country. During the Suharto era in Indonesia, public expression of Chinese culture was also banned and \"barongsai\" (lion dance) procession was considered \"provocative\" and \"an affront to Indonesian nationalism\". This ban was however overturned after the collapse of the Suharto regime in 1998, nevertheless the occasional local banning of the lion dance still occurred.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, during the era when the Hong Kong's Chinese classic and martial arts movies are very popular, kung fu movies including Jet Li's \"Wong Fei Hung\" has actually indirectly shows and indicates how lion dance was practised with the kung fu close co-relation and kung fu during that time. In those days the lion dance was mostly practised and performed as Wushu or kung fu skills, with the challenge for the 'lion' built of chairs and tables stacked up together for the 'lion' to perform its stunts and accomplish its challenge.\n\nSeveral 1990s movies, including a remade version of \"Wong Fei Hung\", and the sequels of \"Once Upon a Time in China\", involve plots centered on lion dancing, especially \"Once Upon a Time in China III\" and \"IV\". The series' main actor, Jet Li, has performed as a lion dancer in several of his films, including Southern style lion dancing in \"Once Upon a Time in China III\", \"Once Upon a Time in China and America\" and Northern style lion dancing in \"\" and \"\".\n\n\n"}

Medhurst's intention was to publish an abridged and cheaper dictionary that still contained all the 47,035 head characters from the (1716) \"Kangxi Dictionary\", which Morrison's huge dictionary included. Medhurst reversed and revised into his Chinese-English dictionary in compiling the (1847-1848) English and Chinese Dictionary in Two Volumes.\n\nWalter Henry Medhurst and Robert Morrison were London Missionary Society (LMS) colleagues and friends. Both were professional printers, missionaries in China, and amateur lexicographers. In an 1817 letter, Morrison told the LMS directors that Medhurst had sent a promising specimen of small metal types, intended for magazines and tracts, and said the \"qualifications and attention of Mr. M. give us great satisfaction\" (Morrison 1839: 477). When Morrison was returning to China in 1826, he met with Medhurst in Java and they discussed their common work (Broomhall 1927: 172).\n\nMedhurst began compiling his dictionary in 1838, and wrote the LMS missionary printer William Ellis in Tahiti that he planned for his English-Chinese dictionary to include about 15,000 entry words and be \"fit for every purpose of religion and science\" (Su 1996: 227).\n\nAs Medhurst explained in an 1841 letter to the LMS directors, his motivation to produce a Chinese and English dictionary came from Morrison's expensive one, which the missionary school's students could not afford. He said his \"compendious and cheap\" dictionary would contain \"every character in Morrison's with all of the useful phrases, in one volume at the moderate cost of a few dollars\" (Su 1996: 227-228).\n\nMedhurst's preface (1842: iii) says his purpose was to compile a \"commodious, uniform, and comprehensive Dictionary\" for English students of the Chinese language, comprising the 47,035 head characters in the (1716) \"Kangxi Dictionary\" (\"Imperial Dictionary of Kang-he\"), with the exception of those that supposedly have \"either no sound or no meaning attached to them\". Medhurst initially intended to compile a complete English-Chinese dictionary, but he found that the available materials were insufficient, and it was necessary for him to first create a Chinese-English dictionary, after which the work would be \"comparatively easy to reverse the whole\", and then add further English terms. Medhurst acknowledges taking phrases from Morrison's Chinese-English Dictionary and elsewhere, and adopting Morrison's widely used orthography, with the addition of aspirated consonants and pitch accents or tones, \"as far as they were ascertainable\".\n\nMedhurst printed, at his own expense, the \"Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing all the words in the Chinese imperial dictionary, arranged according to the radicals\" in 1842, at Parapattan Batavia, Dutch East Indies.\n\nThe 648-page Volume I was completed by October 1842, and the 838-page Volume II was finished in May 1843, both were published in 600 copies. Its inexpensive printing enabled Medhurst to sell this bulky dictionary at only 10 Spanish dollars.\n\nAs the title says, Medhurst collated his bilingual dictionary by radical-and-stroke sorting according to the 214 Kangxi radicals—the same collation method used in Morrison's (1815-1823) Part I Chinese-English dictionary.\n\nVolume I comprises 648 pages of dictionary entries, from Radical 1 一 \"one\" to Radical 111 矢 \"arrow\", and 50 pages of supplementary materials. The front matter includes an 11-page preface, 3-page list of the radicals, and the 5-page \"Directions for discovering under what Radical any given character may be found\"; the postface is a 29-page \"List of Obsolete, Contracted, and Vulgar Characters, Not occurring in the foregoing Dictionary Volume I\". Volume II comprises 838 pages of dictionary entries, from Radical 112 石 \"stone\" to Radical 214 龠 \"flute\", and a 28-page postface list of uncommon characters not in the volume.\n\nThe preface briefly explains to dictionary users, particularly English-speaking students of the Chinese language, Medhurst's orthography for Standard Chinese phonology.\n\nThe dictionary includes 20 initials, and Medhurst adopted Morrison's method of using apostrophes to represent the unaspirated-aspirated stop consonant pairs (listen to examples here). For instance (1842: v-vi), this description of the denti-alveolar consonants of unaspirated IPA // and aspirated // (Wade-Giles \"t\" and \"t\"'; pinyin \"d\" and \"t\"): \"\"T\", as in \"top\"; and \"t'h\" like the former, only with an aspirate between the \"t\", and following vowel; not as the \"th\" in \"though\", or in \"thing\", but at the same letters in the words \"at home\", supposing the initial \"a\" to be left out\".\n\nThe 55 finals are also explained, for example (1842: viii-ix), the rhotic coda or r-colored vowel //, which is difficult for many non-native speakers. \"\"Urh\", is a peculiar sound, something between the \"r\" and \"I\", produced by a vibration of the lower part of the tongue against the inward region of the palate, near the entrance of the throat; it is something similar to the smooth sound of the \"r\", heard in end of English words, as in \"liar\".\"\n\nMedhurst's dictionary annotates tones in terms of the classical four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation used in rime dictionaries, instead of the four tones of Mandarin Chinese spoken by Medhurst (1 \"high-level\", 2 \"rising\", 3 \"dipping\", and 4 \"falling\") (1842: xiv-xv). Medhurst indicated \"píng\" 平 \"level\" tone as unmarked (a), \"shǎng\" 上 \"rising\" tone with circumflex accent (â), \"qù\" 去 \"departing\" tone with grave accent (à), and \"rù\" 入\"entering\" tone with acute accent (á). As a result of using 17th-century \"Wufang yuanyin\" pronunciations, early Chinese-English dictionaries were much concerned with the \"entering\" tone, which had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation (Norman 1988: 173).\n\nMedhurst adopted Morrison's dictionary page layout with the page number centered between the character radical number and stroke number: Radical 162 辵 or 辶 \"walk\" and the 9 additional strokes in \"shǒu\" 首 \"head\" (animated 12-stroke order for 道 is shown here).\n\nThe Mission Press in Shanghai published Medhurst's \"English and Chinese dictionary in two volumes\" in 1847 and 1848, respectively. Publishing 600 copies of this 1,436-page dictionary was the largest work of the mission in its hand-press period.\n\nOwing to Medhurst's disappointment with the low quality results from combining typography and lithography to print Chinese characters for the \"Chinese and English Dictionary\", he decided to use letterpress printing for the \"English and Chinese Dictionary\", which required the cutting of small type. The LMS had previously used small type to print Christian translations and tracts that were smuggled into China, where they were forbidden. In Shanghai, Medhurst employed Chinese workers to punchcut moveable-type Chinese characters on blank shanks, \"about 15,000 sorts, and nearly 100,000 individual types\" that were required for the dictionary (Medhurst 1847: v).\n\nFor the bilingual sources of his English-Chinese dictionary, Medhurst says he extracted \"all that he thought serviceable from Morrison\" and an anonymous Latin-Chinese manuscript dictionary—presumably the Italian Franciscan Basilio Brollo's (1698) \"Dictionarium Sino-Latinum\"—\"while he flatters himself that he has gone far beyond either of his predecessors, in the amount of foreign words adduced, and of expressions brought together to elucidate them.\" (1847: iv).\n\nVolume I (1847) has a 6-page preface, 2-page summary of orthographic conventions, and the 766-page dictionary proper. The entries begin with \"A, the letter a; the broad and open sound of this letter is expressed by 亞 a [\"yà\"], or 阿 a [\"ā\"].\" and end with \"KORAN, the Mahomedans, call the Koran 天經 \"t'hëen king\" [\"tiānjīng\"].\"\n\nVolume II (1848) of Medhurst's English-Chinese dictionary comprises 669 pages. The entries go from \"LABEL, 帖 \"t'ëĕ\" [\"tiè\"]; the label of a book, 檢 \"këen\" [\"jiǎn\"].\" To \"ZONE, 帶 taé [\"dài\"], 束腰之帶 shǔ yaou che taé [\"shùyāo zhī dài\"], 腰帶 yaou taé [\"yāodài\"], 地球道 té k'hêu taóu [\"dìqiúdào\"].\"\n\nThe sample page (to the right) contains Medhurst's dictionary entry for WAY.\nWay. 道 Taóu, 路 loó, 庚 käng, 康 k'hang, 彭 p'hang, 疏 sоо, 略路 lëǒ loó, 繇道 yaòu taóu, 道術途 taóu shǔh t'hoô, 街 keae, 街路 keae loó, 迪 teĭh, 逕 king, 途 t'hoô, 坻閣 te kǒ, 道路 taóu loó; in the way, 途間 t'hoô këen, 路中 loó chung, 街上 keae sháng; do not go in the way of death, 死路莫行 szè loó mǒ hing; leave the right way, 離開正路 lê k'hae chíng loó; public way, 大路 tá loó, 官路 kwan loó; a great way off, 離遠 lê yuèn; the way of Providence, 天步 t'ёеп poó; way to effect an object, 方法 fang fǎ; manner, 般 pwan, 術 shǔh; method, 樣法 yang fǎ, 計策 ké tsĭh, 法子 fǎ tszè; way-marks, 旌節 tsing tsëĕ; a wayfaring man, 羇旅 ke leù, 路人 loó jin. (1848: 1396)\nThe first part of the WAY headword gives 16 translation equivalents of Chinese words meaning \"way\". This illustrates how one single English headword can have ten or more Chinese translation equivalents, which Medhurst ascribes to either \"the richness of the Chinese language, in certain particulars\", or to \"the inability of the compiler (from want of time and skill) to discover the slight shades of meaning that exist among them\" (1847: iii). Most of these equivalents are common terms, such as 道 \"taóu\" (\"dào\" \"way; road; path), 路 \"loó\" (\"lù\" \"road; path; way\"), and 途 \"t'hoô\" (\"tú\" \"road; route; way\") (given in Morrison's dictionary. 1822b: 369), but some are obscure classical Chinese terms, such as \"dǐgé\" 坻閣, which the \"Kangxi zidian\" (s.v., 閣) notes was the name of a road mentioned in commentaries to the \"Rites of Zhou\" (野廬氏). The second part of the WAY headword gives translations of 11 usage examples, for instance, \"public way, 大路 \"tá loó\" , 官路 \"kwan loó\"\" (\"dàlù\" \"big street; main road; highway\" and \"guānlù\" \"government-financed road; public road\", respectively).\n\nScholars have expressed diverse opinions of Walter Henry Medhurst's Chinese-English and English-Chinese dictionaries.\n\nThe first published evaluation of the (1842-1843) \"Chinese and English Dictionary\" was an anonymous 1843 review in \"The Chinese Repository\", which was a Protestant missionary periodical published in Canton. On the one hand, the reviewer praises the dictionary's portability and price, \"two octavo volumes containing 1500 pages for ten dollars\", but on the other, expresses regret that Medhurst \"has said so little on the subject of \"tones\"\" other than \"that he considers them of paramount importance\" (Anon 1843: 499).\n\nBased upon comparison of the entries under Radical 46 山 \"mountain\" in Morrison's and Medhurst's Chinese-English dictionaries, the reviewer said, \"If Mr. Medhurst does not improve upon himself, he improves vastly upon Dr. Morrison\" (Anon 1943: 497).\n\nThe next major Chinese-English dictionary after Medhurst's was the American sinologist and missionary Samuel Wells Williams's (1874) \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\". The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and others were published in small numbers, they became \"very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold\", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison's dictionary (1874: v). Williams explicitly identified \"Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien\" as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary (1874: vi). \n\nThe preface to the British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles's \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1892: vii-viii) praised Morrison as \"the great pioneer\" of Chinese and English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst \"attempted aspirates, but omitted many and wrongly inserted others\". \n\nHuiling Yang, a researcher at Beijing Foreign Studies University, expresses surprise that the \"Chinese and English Dictionary\", which Medhurst claimed to be his translation based on \"Kangxi zidian\", \"is in fact just an abbreviated and edited copy of Morrison’s, a plagiarism rather than an original compilation\" (2014: 317-318).\n\n"}

{"id": "2062225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062225", "title": "Operation Murambatsvina", "text": "Operation Murambatsvina\n\nOperation Murambatsvina (Move the Rubbish), also officially known as Operation Restore Order, was a large-scale Zimbabwean government campaign to forcibly clear slum areas across the country. The campaign started in 2005 and according to United Nations estimates has affected at least 700,000 people directly through loss of their homes or livelihood and thus could have indirectly affected around 2.4 million people. Robert Mugabe and other government officials characterised the operation as a crackdown against illegal housing and commercial activities, and as an effort to reduce the risk of the spread of infectious disease in these areas.\n\nHowever, the campaign was met with harsh condemnation from Zimbabwean opposition parties, church groups, non-governmental organisations, and the wider international community. The United Nations described the campaign as an effort to drive out and make homeless large sections of the urban and rural poor, who make up much of the internal opposition to the Mugabe administration.\n\nThe word was initially used to refer to a communal village worker by the Shona who lived in \"reserves\". These people were employed by the ministry of health to improve levels of sanitation in these areas, to communicate health information, etc. Police Inspector John Tupiri of Operations Manicaland decided on the name \"Murambatsvina\". The Zimbabwean police were ruthless in executing their duties with the result that they were dreaded by the local populace. The sense behind the word therefore mirrors the alleged purpose of the operation as asserted by the government of Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabweans refer to the operation as \"Zimbabwe's tsunami\", in reference to the devastation which followed the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The crackdown has affected most of the major cities in the country, and the Zimbabwean government has stated its intention to widen the operation to include rural farming areas. Estimates of the number of people affected vary considerably. The latest United Nations figures estimate that it has led to the unemployment of 700,000 people and affected a further 2.4 million people countrywide. Earlier, the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum estimated that 64,677 families had been displaced, representing a total of approximately 323,385 people (this estimate was based on figures from 45 locations). However, according to the police only 120,000 people have been affected.\n\nWhichever figures are correct, large numbers of people have been affected, all of whom are in need of emergency relief and resettlement following the loss of their homes and livelihood. The clearances have been condemned both internally and internationally. A report written by Anna Tibaijuka, the Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, was handed to the Zimbabwean government on 21 July 2005. Excerpts from the report, which calls for all demolitions to be stopped immediately, were made public the following day and describe the operation as a \"disastrous venture\" which has violated international law and led to a serious humanitarian crisis. The actions of the government are described as indiscriminate, unjustified and conducted without regard for human suffering. The \"Washington Post\" on 7 February 2008, described how some men and women displaced from Harare are now walking – 5 hours round-trip every day to work (furthermore without breakfast), because the individual bus fare for one day now costs nearly a week's wages – ZW$10 million.\n\nOverall responsibility for the clearances rests with the ruling party, ZANU-PF. The previous Chairperson of the Harare Commission, Dr. Jameson Kurasha, initiated Operation Murambatsvina weeks after the disputed elections were held there. The Harare Commission led by Sekesai Makwavarara is currently running the affairs of the City of Harare despite the fact that there is a pending application to the High Court questioning its authority to do so. The Commission itself was appointed by Ignatious Chombo, the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and Urban Development, leading one Zimbabwean newspaper to comment that \"President Mugabe, through the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Ignatious Chombo, is now effectively in control of the City of Harare\".\n\nMugabe said the clearances are needed to carry out \"a vigorous clean-up campaign to restore sanity\" and he has described the program as an \"urban renewal campaign.\" Chombo has described the operation in terms of 'restoring order': \"It is these people who have been making the country ungovernable by their criminal activities actually.\" The Zimbabwean Police Commissioner, Augustine Chihuri, said that Operation Murambatsvina was meant to \"clean the country of the crawling mass of maggots bent on destroying the economy.\"\n\nWhile police have carried out most of the demolitions, they have been supported by the army and the National Youth Service. Many inhabitants have been forced to destroy their own homes, sometimes at gunpoint.\n\nPeople whose homes have been demolished are being told to return to the rural areas or face further action from the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the dreaded Central Intelligence Organization. Education Minister Aeneas Chigwedere claimed that there is \"nobody in Zimbabwe who does not have a rural home\".\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has argued that Operation Murambatsvina is about restoring order (see section above). However, the timing of the clearances, so soon after the disputed parliamentary elections on 31 March 2005, combined with the contradictory nature of the operation, has prompted commentators to state that there are alternative reasons for the demolitions, although most say a combination of many of these.\n\nThe opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has argued that the government's main reason for Murambatsvina is to punish the urban poor for voting for the opposition during the March parliamentary elections. The cities are traditionally MDC strongholds, and, in fact, the Harare Commission that initiated the campaign was set up to override the governing powers of the elected MDC City Council. However, the retribution as a rationale is somewhat undermined by the fact that some Zanu-PF supporters, including liberation war-veterans, have also been caught up in the squatter camp clearances.\n\nCommentators such as Tererai Karimakwenda have noted the similarity between the name of this operation and the Gukurahundi campaign conducted as part of Mugabe's struggle against the Matabele tribe in the early 1980s. The Gukurahundi campaign ultimately resulted in the demise of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) when it merged with Robert Mugabe's party in 1987. There has been speculation that the government is aiming to create a situation where the MDC has no choice but to merge with the ruling party.\n\nKarimakwenda also argued that by forcing urban voters out into the rural areas the cities will be de-populated of MDC supporters thus enabling the government to re-populate the shanty town areas with Zanu-PF supporters. Further, MDC supporters will be forced to return to live in areas traditionally viewed as Zanu-PF strongholds.\n\nScience and Technology Deputy Minister Patrick Zhuwawo used state media to say that the government had demarcated nearly 10,000 residential stands at Whitecliff Farm for allocation to what he called \"deserving people\". \"The Independent\", a Zimbabwe newspaper, has interpreted this to mean \"Zanu-PF supporters\" and supports the view by identifying the presence of \"Zanu-PF sharks\" at the centre where people were meant to sign up for new stands. A different source reported that, in Bulawayo, a Zanu-PF representative was tasked with compiling a list of future stand beneficiaries and that the resulting list was dominated by the names of known Zanu-PF supporters. One opposition supporter, whose name was not on the list, alleges that he was bluntly told that he supported the wrong party.\n\nThere were many reports in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 parliamentary elections, widely viewed by the west as neither free nor fair, of potential mass uprisings against the government. In fact, Catholic Archbishop Pius Ncube, a respected human rights activist and outspoken critic of the government, publicly called for a peaceful uprising before the elections took place, claiming that the elections had already been fixed.\n\nIt has been argued that, by dispersing MDC supporters to remote rural locations, the Zanu-PF government would find it easier to control an angry population in the event of possible riots or mass protests. David Coltart, the MDC's legal affairs spokesperson, described the operation as a sinister pre-emptive strike designed to remove the maximum possible number of people from urban areas to rural areas where they are easier to control\".\n\nOther sources suggest that former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam, who fled to Harare in 1991, may have given Robert Mugabe the idea in the form of a security advise, warning the Zimbabwean leader that the swelling slum and backyard population in Zimbabwe was creating a fertile ground for a mass uprising.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum has advanced another reason for pre-emptively dispersing citizens living in opposition party strongholds. They point to the fact that the government faces an unprecedented economic crisis characterised by fuel and food shortages, rampant hyperinflation, and virtually no foreign currency. To resolve the crisis, they argue that the Zanu-PF government will be forced, against its will, to re-engage with the international community:\n\nThis means a reversal of its whole style of governing, adherence to the rule of law, an end to political violence and repression, opening of the press and media space, and a cessation of all interference with citizens basic freedoms.\n\nThe suggestion therefore is that if totalitarian controls were relaxed – to satisfy international principles and standards – the government would suddenly be exposed to protest and civic pressure. In other words, Operation Murambatsvina may be less to do with fear of protests immediately following the elections (which could be controlled using current methods which rely on a politicised police and army), and more to do with controlling the population \"after\" heavy-handed measures were dispensed with:\n\nIt is predicated on the observation that the greatest risk to repressive governments comes when they seek to liberalise.\n\nZimbabwean 2005 election experiences give some credence to this view. Anticipating electoral observers coming to the country, the government eased up on a few of its repressive tactics in the months immediately preceding the parliamentary elections. The immediate effect was that MDC supporters felt confident and suddenly openly showed their support for their party in a way they hadn't been able to before.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Zimbabwe fought to keep control of the foreign currency market by adopting a range of measures, usually spearheaded by Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono. Sokwanele, a Zimbabwean civic action support group, describes Gideon Gono as having played a major role in Operation Murambatsvina. In fact, Gideon Gono's appointment to Governor coincided with the beginning of a crackdown on illegal foreign currency dealings prompting one popular source of independent news to report that \"one of his key areas of focus is the illegal foreign currency market\".\n\nSokwanele, in a different article, explains that the foreign currency market in Zimbabwe is broadly characterised by the formal market, the parallel market and the black market. They describe the black market as follows:\n\nBlack market transactions happen on the streets, in the flea markets, and in back-rooms; sometimes for small sums of money like 20 US dollars; and the deals often take place between individuals.\n\nCommentators believe the government is specifically targeting the small-scale black market traders through Operation Murambatsvina. \"The Age\", an Australian newspaper, reported on how informal vendors at one market, dubbed \"The World Bank\", maintains a façade of trading goods when their real business is dealing in hard cash, albeit very small amounts at a time. (In fact, Bulawayo's \"The World Bank\" was one of the markets targeted when Gono first become Governor of the Reserve Bank in [2003].)\n\nFew analysts believe that the small amounts seized from vendors in one operation could begin to meet the country's massive foreign currency shortfall. This has led to some describing the government's action as indicative of their extreme desperation.\n\nZanu-PF's drive towards resolving its economic crisis has included strengthening its historical ties with China. The state-controlled newspaper \"The Herald\" reported on Robert Mugabe's support for Operation Murambastvina, and on his view that the economy was beginning to receive serious and significant investments from the Far East:\n\nWe should not look back, for, looking back, means back to our political enemies and detractors. Industry must recognise this new direction (Look East policy). \n\nThis has led some to speculate that the destruction of the shanty towns are partly in support of Chinese business interests in Zimbabwe. A report co-authored by Archbishop Ncube stated that:\n\nSpeculation over the motives behind Operation Murambatsvina has pointed to the removal of local competition threatening newly arrived Chinese businessmen whose stores sell cheap and often poor quality goods. It is estimated that, as a result of the government's aggressive \"Look East\" policy, up to 10,000 Chinese citizens have moved into the country, and some have moved onto farms taken from highly skilled commercial farmers, notably to grow tobacco for China's 300 million smokers.\n\nAs well as practical support of Chinese business interests, many have suggested that Operation Murambatsvina also demonstrates an adherence to a 'Look East' ideology and is evidence that Zanu-PF has embraced an Asian model of government where individual rights are often subverted for the good of the masses, or the regime. Robert Mugabe's approach to governance has prompted regular comparisons between him and Pol Pot.\n\nOperation Murambatsvina has been widely condemned by Zimbabwean non-governmental organisations, churches, legal organisations, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change as well as many other groups in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe operation also made topics for those in the literature world with Valerie Tagwira with her book \"The Uncertainty of Hope\", which vivified mostly the effects of Operation Murambatsvina on the ordinary female citizens of Zimbabwe and other difficulties faced by that time. The other known literature figure who hand penned the happenings of the era is a young poet and script writer, Poseidon Tsautsau who wrote his poem:The Uncaring father, who should care. In his poem it seems like Tsautsau is blasting Mugabe the Zimbabwean father for not caring for his children, by \"cleaning the mess through adding trash\" as he writes in his piece.\n\nThe international community has also condemned the operation with nations and international organisations strongly attacking the Zimbabwean government's policy.\n\nKate Hoey MP called on former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to encourage South Africa to use its regional influence to put pressure on Zimbabwean authorities to cease the crackdown.\n\nThe New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Phil Goff expressed his condemnation of the operation by suggesting in a radio interview a boycott of the planned tour by the Zimbabwean cricket team of New Zealand in 2005–06.\n\nCondoleezza Rice, then United States Secretary of State, called upon African leaders to speak out against the Operation and to increase pressure on the Zimbabwean authorities to end the evictions. The African Union has rejected these calls stating it has 'more serious concerns'. For example, then South African President Thabo Mbeki questioned why Western leaders were so concerned about Zimbabwe while not paying the same amount of attention to far more dire African emergencies, such as civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nKofi Annan, then UN Secretary-General, dispatched special envoy Anna Tibaijuka to Zimbabwe to study the effects of the campaign and report back her findings. The report is highly critical of the government, prompting one news source to say that the report used \"language unusually harsh for the United Nations\". Excerpts of the report describe the operation as disastrous and inhumane, representing a clear violation of international law. The executive summary stated:\n\nOperation Restore Order, while purporting to target illegal dwellings and structures and to clamp down on alleged illicit activities, was carried out in an indiscriminate and unjustified manner, with indifference to human suffering, and, in repeated cases, with disregard to several provisions of national and international legal frameworks.\n\nOn 23 May 2007 the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and another group, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, sought independent legal opinion. This concluded that the evictions in Zimbabwe were a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population, as part of state policy.\n\nIn a 45-page response to the highly critical report by UN envoy Anna Tibaijuka, President Robert Mugabe's government says it acted in the public interest, and denied that it was responsible for the deaths of several people during clean-up operation, and was carried out in compliance with the government's laws, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on 17 August 2005.\n\nThe government said Tibaijuka had used \"value-laden and judgemental language, which clearly demonstrated in-built bias\" against it and the operation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "83096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83096", "title": "Philomela", "text": "Philomela\n\nPhilomela () or Philomel (; , \"Philomēlē\") is a minor figure in Greek mythology and is frequently invoked as a direct and figurative symbol in literary, artistic, and musical works in the Western canon.\n\nShe is identified as being the \"princess of Athens\" and the younger of two daughters of Pandion I, King of Athens, and Zeuxippe. Her sister, Procne, was the wife of King Tereus of Thrace. While the myth has several variations, the general depiction is that Philomela, after being raped and mutilated by her sister's husband, Tereus, obtains her revenge and is transformed into a nightingale (\"Luscinia megarhynchos\"), a migratory passerine bird native to Europe and southwest Asia and noted for its song. Because of the violence associated with the myth, the song of the nightingale is often depicted or interpreted as a sorrowful lament. Coincidentally, in nature, the female nightingale is mute and only the male of the species sings.\n\nOvid and other writers have made the association (either fancifully or mistakenly) that the etymology of her name was \"lover of song,\" derived from the Greek and (\"song\") instead of (\"fruit\" or \"sheep\"). The name means \"lover of fruit,\" \"lover of apples,\" or \"lover of sheep.\"\n\nThe most complete and extant rendering of the story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the \"Metamorphoses\" of the Roman poet Ovid (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity. It is likely that Ovid relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the \"Bibliotheca\" of Pseudo-Apollodorus (2nd century BC), or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially Sophocles' tragic drama \"Tereus\" (5th century BC).\n\nAccording to Ovid, in the fifth year of Procne's marriage to Tereus, King of Thrace and son of Ares, she asked her husband to \"Let me at Athens my dear sister see / Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me.\" Tereus agreed to travel to Athens and escort her sister, Philomela, to Thrace. King Pandion of Athens, the father of Philomela and Procne, was apprehensive about letting his one remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect her as if he were her father. Tereus agrees. However, Tereus lusted for Philomela when he first saw her, and that lust grew during the course of the return voyage to Thrace.\nArriving in Thrace, he forced her to a cabin or lodge in the woods and raped her. After the assault, Tereus threatened her and advised her to keep silent. Philomela was defiant and angered Tereus. In his rage, he cut out her tongue and abandoned her in the cabin. In Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" Philomela's defiant speech is rendered (in an 18th-century English translation) as:\n<poem>\nStill my revenge shall take its proper time,\nAnd suit the baseness of your hellish crime.\nMy self, abandon'd, and devoid of shame,\nThro' the wide world your actions will proclaim;\nOr tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely den,\nObscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of men,\nMy mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,\nAnd my complainings echo thro' the grove.\nHear me, o Heav'n! and, if a God be there,\nLet him regard me, and accept my pray'r.</poem>\nRendered unable to speak because of her injuries, Philomela wove a tapestry (or a robe) that told her story and had it sent to Procne. Procne was incensed and in revenge, she killed her son by Tereus, Itys (or Itylos), boiled him and served him as a meal to her husband. After Tereus ate Itys, the sisters presented him with the severed head of his son, and he became aware of their conspiracy and his cannibalistic meal. He snatched up an axe and pursued them with the intent to kill the sisters. They fled but were almost overtaken by Tereus at Daulia in Phocis. In desperation, they prayed to the gods to be turned into birds and escape Tereus' rage and vengeance. The gods transformed Procne into a swallow and Philomela into a nightingale. Subsequently, the gods would transform Tereus into a hoopoe.\n\nIt is typical for myths from antiquity to have been altered over the passage of time or for competing variations of the myth to emerge. With the story of Philomela, most of the variations concern which sister became the nightingale or the swallow, and into what type of bird Tereus was transformed. Since Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", it has been generally accepted that Procne was transformed into a nightingale, and Philomela into a swallow. The description of Tereus as an \"epops\" has generally been translated as a hoopoe (scientific name: \"Upupa epops\"). Since many of the earlier sources are no longer extant, or remain only fragments, Ovid's version of the myth has been the most lasting and influenced most later works.\n\nEarly Greek sources have it that Philomela was turned into a swallow, which has no song; Procne turns into a nightingale, singing a beautiful but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the \"Bibliotheca\" of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was turned into a nightingale, and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.\n\nIt is salient to note that in taxonomy and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is \"Progne\", a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins \"Ptyonoprogne\", and Saw-wings \"Psalidoprocne\". Coincidentally, although most of the depictions of the nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.\n\nIn an early account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus was turned into a large-beaked bird whom some scholars translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, \"The Birds\") hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.\n\nSeveral writers omit key details of the story. According to Pausanias, Tereus was so remorseful for his actions against Philomela and Itys (the nature of the actions is not described) that he kills himself. Then two birds appear as the women lament his death. Many later sources omit the Tereus' tongue-cutting mutilation of Philomela altogether.\n\nAccording to Thucydides, Tereus was not King of Thrace, but rather from the city of Daulia in Phocis, a city inhabited by Thracians. He cites in proof of this that poets who mention the nightingale refer to it as a \"Daulian bird.\" It is thought that Thucydides commented on the myth in his famous work on the Peloponnesian War because Sophocles' play confused the mythical Tereus with contemporary ruler Teres I of Thrace.\n\nThe story of Philomela, Procne and Tereus is largely influenced by the lost tragedy \"Tereus\" of Sophocles. Scholar Jenny Marsh claims that Sophocles borrowed certain plot elements from Euripides drama \"Medea\"—notably a wife killing her child in an act of revenge against her husband—and incorporated them in his tragedy \"Tereus\". She implies that the infanticide of Itys did not appear in the Tereus myth until Sophocles' play and that it was introduced because of what was borrowed from Euripides.\n\nIt is possible that social and political themes have woven their way into the story as a contrast between Athenians who believed themselves to be the hegemonic power in Greece and the more civilized of the Greek peoples, and the Thracians who were considered to be a \"barbaric race.\" It is possible that these elements were woven into Sophocles' play \"Tereus\" and other works of the period.\n\nThe material of the Philomela myth has been used in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years. Over the centuries, the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful. The continued use of the image in artistic, literary, and musical works has reinforced this association.\n\nBeginning with Homer's \"Odyssey\", ancient dramatists and poets evoked the story of Philomela and the nightingale in their works. Most notably, it was the core of the tragedy \"Tereus\" by Sophocles (lost, extant only in fragments), and later in a set of plays by Philocles, the nephew of the great playwright Aeschylus. In Aeschylus's \"Agamemnon\", the prophetess Cassandra has a visionary premonition of her own death in which she mentioned the nightingale and Itys, lamenting:\n<poem>\nAh for thy fate, O shrill-voiced nightingale!\nSome solace for thy woes did Heaven afford,\nClothed thee with soft brown plumes, and life apart from wail(ing)—\n</poem>\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", Aristotle points to the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy \"Tereus\" as an example of a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has happened earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy \"The Birds\" and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.\n\nWhile Ovid's retelling of the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he finished the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version of the myth, it is the basis for many later works.\n\nIn the 12th century, French trouvère (troubadour) Chrétien de Troyes, adapted many of the myths recounted in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" into Old French. However, de Troyes was not alone in making use of Ovid's material. Geoffrey Chaucer recounted the story in his unfinished work \"The Legend of Good Women\" and briefly alluded to the myth in his \"Troilus and Criseyde\". John Gower included the tale in his \"Confessio Amantis\". References to Philomela are common in the motets of the ars nova, ars subtilior, and ars mutandi musical eras of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.\n\nThroughout the late Renaissance and Elizabethean eras, the image of Philomela and the nightingale incorporated elements of mourning and beauty after being subjected to an act of violence. In the long poem \"The Steele Glas\" (1576), poet George Gascoigne (1535–1577) depicts \"Philomel\" as the representative of poetry (Poesys), her sister Progne as satire (Satyra), and Tereus as \"vayne Delight.\" The characterization of Philomela and the nightingale was that of a woman choosing to exercise her will in recovering her voice and resisting those forces which attempts to silence her. Critics have pointed to Gascoigne's use of the Philomela myth as a personal appeal and that he was fighting in verse a battle with his enemies who violently opposed his poems. In his poem \"The complaynt of Philomene\" (1576), the myth is employed to depict punishment and control.\n\nIn \"The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd\", Sir Walter Raleigh (1554–1618) relays consolation regarding the nymph's harsh rejection of the shepherd's romantic advances in the spirit of \"time heals all wounds,\" by citing in the second stanza (among several examples) that eventually with the passage of time Philomel would become \"dumb\" to her own pain and that her attention would be drawn away from the pain by the events of life to come.\n\nIn Sir Philip Sidney's (1554–1586) courtly love poem \"The Nightingale\", Sydney's narrator who is in love with a woman he cannot have compares his own romantic situation to that of Philomela's plight and claims that he has more reason to be sad. However, recent literary criticism has labelled this claim as sexist and an unfortunate marginalization of the traumatic rape of Philomela. Sydney argues that the rape was an \"excess of love\" and less severe than being deprived of love as attested by the line, \"Since wanting is more woe than too much having.\"\n\nPlaywright and poet William Shakespeare (1564–1616) makes frequent use of the Philomela myth—most notably in his tragedy \"Titus Andronicus\" (c. 1588–1593) where characters directly reference Tereus and Philomela in commenting on rape and mutilation of Lavinia by Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius. Prominent allusions to Philomela also occur in the depiction of Lucrece in \"The Rape of Lucrece\", in the depiction of Imogen in \"Cymbeline,\" and in Titania's lullaby in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" where she asks Philomel to \"sing in our sweet lullaby\". In Sonnet 102, Shakespeare addresses his lover (the \"fair youth\") and compares his love poetry to the song of the nightingale, noting that \"her mournful hymns did hush the night\" (line 10), and that as a poet would \"hold his tongue\" (line 13) in deference to the more beautiful nightingale's song so that he \"not dull you with my song\" (line 14). Emilia Lanyer (1569–1645), a poet who is considered by some scholars to be the woman referred to in the poetry of William Shakespeare as \"Dark Lady\", makes several references to Philomela in her patronage poem \"The Description of Cookeham\" in \"Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum\" (1611). Lanyer's poem, dedicated to Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland and her daughter Lady Anne Clifford refers to Philomela's \"sundry layes\"(line 31) and later to her \"mournful ditty\" (line 189).\n\nThe image of the nightingale appears frequently in poetry of the period with it and its song described by poets as an example of \"joyance\" and gaiety or as an example of melancholy, sad, sorrowful, and mourning. However, many use the nightingale as a symbol of sorrow but without a direct reference to the Philomela myth.\n\nPoets in the Romantic Era recast the myth and adapted the image of the nightingale with its song to be a poet and “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. John Keats (1795–1821), in \"Ode to a Nightingale\" (1819) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write. Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" (1820) where the rape of Madeline by Porphyro mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus. Keats' contemporary, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) invoked a similar image of the nightingale, writing in his \"A Defence of Poetry\" that \"a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.”\n\nIn France, \"Philomèle\" was an operatic stage production of the story, produced by Louis Lacoste during the reign of Louis XIV.\n\nFirst published in the collection \"Lyrical Ballads\", \"The Nightingale\" (1798) is an effort by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) to move away from associations that the nightingale's song was one of melancholy and identified it with the joyous experience of nature. He remarked that \"in nature there is nothing melancholy,\" (line 15) expressing hope \"we may not thus profane / Nature’s sweet voices, always full of love / And joyance!\" (lines 40–42).\n\nAt the poem's conclusion, Coleridge writes of a father taking his crying son outside in the night:\n<poem>\nAnd he beheld the moon, and, hushed at once,\nSuspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,\nWhile his fair eyes, that swam with undropped tears,'\nDid glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well!—\nIt is a father’s tale: But if that Heaven\nShould give me life, his childhood shall grow up\nFamiliar with these songs, that with the night\nHe may associate joy.—\n</poem>\nColeridge, and his friend William Wordsworth (1770–1850) who called the nightingale a \"fiery heart,\" depicted the bird \"as an instance of natural poetic creation,\" and as the \"voice of nature.\"\n\nOther notable mentions include:\n\nThe Philomela myth is perpetuated largely through its appearance as a powerful device in poetry. In the 20th century, American-British poet T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) directly referenced the myth in his most famous poem, \"The Waste Land\" (1922), where he describes,\n<poem>\nThe change of Philomel, by the barbarous king\nSo rudely forced; yet there the nightingale\nFilled all the desert with inviolable voice\nAnd still she cried, and still the world pursues,\n\"Jug Jug\" to dirty ears.\n</poem>\nEliot employs the myth to depict themes of sorrow, pain, and that the only recovery or regeneration possible is through revenge. Several of these mentions reference other poets' renderings of the myth, including those of Ovid and Gascoigne. Eliot's references to the nightingales singing by the convent in \"Sweeney and the Nightingales\" (1919–1920) is a direct reference the murder of Agamemnon in the tragedy by Aeschylus—wherein the Greek dramatist directly evoked the Philomela myth. The poem describes Sweeney as a brute and that two women in the poem are conspiring against him for his mistreatment of them. This mirrors not only the elements of Agamemnon's death in Aeschylus' play but the sister's revenge against Tereus in the myth.\n\nIn the poem \"To the Nightingale\", Argentine poet and fabulist, Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986), who compares his efforts as a poet to the bird's lament though never having heard it. He describes its song as \"encrusted with mythology\" and that the evolution of the myth has distorted it—that the opinions of other poets and writers have kept both poet and reader from actually hearing the original sound and knowing the essence of the song.\n\nSeveral artists have applied Ovid's account to new translations or reworkings, or adapted the story for the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work \"Tales from Ovid\" (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in \"The Great Whore of Babylon\") and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in \"The Three Birds\") wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander.\n\nSeveral female writers have used the Philomela myth as a vehicle for exploring the subject of rape, women and power (empowerment), and feminist themes, including novelist Margaret Atwood in her novella \"Nightingale\" published in \"The Tent\" (2006), Emma Tennant in her story \"Philomela\", Jeannine Hall Gailey who uses the myth in several poems published in \"Becoming the Villainess\" (2006), and Timberlake Wertenbaker in her play \"The Love of the Nightingale\" (1989) (later adapted into an opera of the same name composed by Richard Mills).\n\n"}

It was designed for describing and searching information resources according to their subject. PSH contains more than 13,900 terms, which cover the main fields of human knowledge.\nThanks to its release in SKOS, PSH can be used not only for describing documents in a library, but also for indexing web pages. Everyone can use PSH for free. PSH is a part of the Linking Open Data cloud diagram (LOD cloud diagaram). The image of the LOD cloud diagram shows datasets that have been published in Linked Data format, by contributors to the Linking Open Data community project and other individuals and organisations.\n\nThe PSH preparation project started in 1993, supported by several grants from the Czech Ministry of Culture and Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. Since 1995, PSH has been used for indexing the State Technical Library's documents. Starting 1997, PSH has been distributed to other libraries and companies, originally as a commercial, paid product; since 2009 for free. In 2000, the State Technical Library received a grant from the Ministry of Culture to translate PSH into English. The next milestone in its development was its releasing in the SKOS format, in 2009.\n\nThe vast majority of new subject headings is suggested and approved by the indexing experts from the National Technical Library. However, the users and public can also make suggestions, using an online form, which are then assessed by the experts. The main decisions about the development and the future of PSH are done by the Committee for Coordination of Polythematic Structured Subject Heading System. The Committee consists of specialists from the National Technical Library and cooperating institutions, and representatives from the libraries and companies which use PSH. The Committee meets once a year in the National Technical Library; in the meantime, the members communicate using an electronic mailing list.\n\nPSH Browser was released in June 2009.

Subject headings are included in a hierarchy of six (or seven) levels according to their semantic content and specificity. There are hierarchical, associative (\"see also\") and equivalence (\"see\") relations in PSH. Hierarchical relations are represented by broader and narrower terms (e.g. \"physical diagnostic methods\" is broader term to \"electrocardiography\", and on the other hand, \"electrocardiography\" is narrower term to \"physical diagnostic methods\"). Equivalence relations link subject headings with their nonpreferred versions (e.g. \"electrocardiography\" and \"ECG\"). Moreover, associative relations are used to link related subject headings from different parts of PSH, regardless their affiliation to a section, (e.g. \"electrocardiography\": see also \"cardiology\"). Every subject heading belongs to just one section, which has its own two-character abbreviation, assigned to every subject heading of the section. This enables users to recognize affiliation of subject headings from lower levels to the thematic sections. The 44 thematic sections have following root nodes: \n\n\nThe main format for storage, maintenance and sharing PSH is the MARC 21 Format for Authority Data, which is implemented in library automated systems.

Alternatively, the whole vocabulary can be downloaded in one file. It is possible to display tags from PSH (metadata snippets – Dublin Core and CommonTag), which can be embedded in an HTML document to provide its semantic description in a machine-readable way.\n\nNew subject headings are primarily obtained through the log analysis in the National Technical Library's on-line catalogue of documents, which are the terms used by end-users when searching various documents.

{"id": "35895841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35895841", "title": "Preorbital gland", "text": "Preorbital gland\n\nThe preorbital gland is a paired exocrine gland found in many species of hoofed animals, which is homologous to the lacrimal gland found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined by a combination of sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals.\n\nThe preorbital gland serves different roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animal's dominance (especially in preparation for breeding), mark its territory, or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal. Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of scent gland. A further function of these glands may be to produce antimicrobial compounds to fight against skin pathogens. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be biosynthesized by the animal itself, or by microorganisms that live in these glands.\n\nDeer have seven major external scent glands, distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the forehead glands (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the nasal glands (located inside the nostrils), the interdigital glands (located between the toes), the preputial gland (located inside the foreskin of the deer's penis), the metatarsal glands (located outside of the hind legs), and the tarsal glands (located inside of the hind legs). Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands also function as scent glands. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate with other members of their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.\n\nThe two major species of deer found in North America are the white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") and the mule deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus\"). The most important sense in these animals is olfaction (the sense of smell)—so much so that they have an accessory olfaction system.\nThe vomeronasal organ, located at the base of the nasal cavity, is the sensory organ for this system. Besides locating food and water, deer rely on their two separate olfactory systems to detect the presence of predators, as well as to supply them with information about the identity, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of other deer.\n\nThe preorbital gland of \"O. virginianus\" is about in length, while that of \"O. hemionus\" is roughly in length. In black-tailed deer (\"O. h. columbianus\"), a subspecies of \"O. hemionus\", the preorbital gland measures about . In all of these animals, the preorbital glands are surrounded by muscle which is under voluntary control, at least to some extent.\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether the preorbital gland secretions of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but they are capable of opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.\n\nIn juvenile red deer (\"Cervus elaphus\"), the preorbital gland appears to play a role in the response to stress. The preorbital gland is closed in a relaxed calf, whereas it is opened in a stressed calf. One example of this is the signalling of hunger and satiety. Fawns open their preorbital glands as a signal that they are hungry, and close the gland after feeding, when they are no longer hungry.\n\nOther than during the rut (mating season) and for the first six months after giving birth, the adult Indian muntjac (\"Muntiacus muntjac\") is a solitary animal. Adult males in particular are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory.\n\nThe bovids (family Bovidae) comprise some 140 species of ruminants in which at least the males bear unbranched, hollow horns covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most species of bovids have means of spacing themselves across their habitat; territorial behavior is the most consistent type of spacing behavior.\n\nCaprids (dwarf antelope, such as the sheep, goats, muskox, serows, gorals, and several similar species) use their preorbital glands to establish social rank. For example, when competition arises between two grazing sheep (\"Ovis aries\"), they have been observed to nuzzle each other's preorbital glands. By sending and receiving olfactory cues, this behavior appears to be a means of establishing dominance and of avoiding a fight, which would otherwise involve potentially injurious butting or clashing with the forehead.\n\nThe antilopine bovids (dwarf antelope, such as the springbok, blackbuck, gazelles, dik-diks, oribi, and several similar species) have well-developed preorbital glands.\n\nAmong the cephalophines, members of the \"Philantomba\" and \"Sylvicapra\" genera are all solitary animals which display territorial behavior and have well developed preorbital glands. Maxwell's duiker (\"Philantomba maxwellii\") is a solitary animal which utilizes preorbital gland secretions to mark its territory. This behavior is observed most in adult males, less frequently in females, and less still in subadults of this species. Secretions from the preorbital gland of the common duiker contain at least 33 different chemical compounds. Two thiazole compounds and an epoxy ketone are present in significantly higher concentrations in male than in female secretions, suggesting that they could serve as sex recognition cues.\n\nThe alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, hirola, bontebok, blesbok, and several similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex mixtures of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the bontebok (\"Damaliscus pygargus pygarus\") are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at the borders of their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the head from side to side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (\"Oreotragus oreotragus\") is a semi-gregarious species, while the hirola (\"Beatragus hunteri\") is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.\n\nDifferences in the social structure and marking behavior among different species may lead to a different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, Günther's dik-dik (\"Madoqua guentheri\") is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone, and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the saiga antelope (\"Saiga tatarica\") is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory at any time during the year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.\n\nThe recent identification of several antimicrobial compounds from the secretions of animal dermal scent glands may be the beginning of a promising new area of drug development. Assuming functional analogs of these lead compounds can be synthesized and found to be effective \"in vivo\", the potential exists for producing new antimicrobial agents against pathogenic skin microorganisms.\n\n\n"}

Aspects of a complex technical specification may necessarily have more than one interpretation, and there are probably many optional features. These aspects constitute a profile of the standard. Two implementations engineered from the same description may not interoperate due to having a different profile of the standard. Vendors can even ignore features that they view as unimportant, yet prevail in the long run. \n\nThe use of profiles in these ways can force one interpretation, or create de facto standards from official standards. Engineers can design or procure by using a profile to ensure interoperability. For example, the International Standard Profile, ISP, is used by the ISO in their ISO ISP series of standards; in the context of OSI networking, Britain uses the UK-GOSIP profile and the US uses US-GOSIP; there are also various mobile profiles adopted by the W3C for web standards. In particular, implementations of standards on mobile devices often have significant limitations compared to their traditional desktop implementations, even if the standard which governs both permits such limitations. \n\nIn structural engineering a profile means a hot rolled structural steel shape like an -beam.\n\nIn civil engineering, a profile consists of a plotted line which indicates grades and distances (and typically depths of cut and/or elevations of fill) for excavation and grading work. Constructors of roadways, railways (and similar works) normally chart the profile along the centerline. A profile can also indicate the vertical slope(s) (changes in elevation) in a pipeline or similar structure. Civil engineers always depict profile as a side (cross section) view (as opposed to an overhead (plan) view).\n\nIn fabricating, a profile consists of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or steel plate. In modern practice, a drawing office determines the shape and dimensions required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a profile cutter. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a rotating cutter like that of a spindle router or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns oxy-acetylene or other oxy-gas. \n\n"}

(31 August 1859 – 15 May 1928) was a British medievalist who made significant contributions to lexicography.\n\nRobert Jowitt Whitwell was born in August 1859 to Mary Ann Jowitt and Edward Whitwell. The Whitwell family were based in Kendal, where Edward's brother John was the local MP from 1868 to 1880. In April 1884, Robert married Louisa Crommelin Brown, a Glaswegian, with whom he had two daughters and one son. By 1898, they had moved to Oxford, where they lived at 70 Banbury Road, a few doors away from the editor of the OED. In 1914 their younger daughter, Louisa Crommelin Roberta Jowitt Whitwell, married Hastings Russell, the then Marquess of Tavistock, who had studied history at Oxford. Robert died in May 1928, and his wife Louisa died in January 1945.\n\nIn his twenties, while he was still living in Kendal, Whitwell became a prolific voluntary contributor to the OED, submitting some 17,000 quotation slips between 1879 and 1884; by the time the first volume was published in 1888, his slip total was the 7th highest at 33,000. His academic life was, however, based at Oxford University, where he received a B.Litt. from Corpus Christi before becoming associated with New College. In 1901, he was Honorary Secretary of the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, and in 1907 he was listed as a tutor in Modern History with colleagues including H. W. C. Davis, G. Baskerville, F. Madan, R. L. Poole, R. Rait, and A. L. Smith.\n\nWhitwell made his greatest contribution to scholarship in 1913. Frustrated with the standard dictionary of medieval Latin, Du Cange's \"Glossarium\" (1678), he petitioned the British Academy to use the third 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies to propose \"an adequate and complete dictionary of the language, based on the best authorities and compiled on modern scientific principles\" with the collaboration of \"historical scholars of all countries\". The petition was signed by 82 British scholars, including the editors of the OED, and Whitwell was duly allowed to put the proposal to the first plenary session of the Congress, held in the Great Hall of Lincoln's Inn.\n\nThe American historian J. F. Jameson, reporting on the Congress, warned that the task that Whitwell envisaged \"could not be hopefully undertaken with resources less formidable than those of the International Union of Academies\". The First World War made cooperation on such a scale impossible, but it was indeed the IUA who revived Whitwell's suggestion in 1920, and by the time he died in May 1928 a coordinated effort from over ten countries was well under way. His death was noted with regret at the sixth 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies by Charles Johnson, who said that Whitwell \"not only actively promoted the whole [international] scheme but was a zealous member of the committee [on British medieval Latin after 1066] and a generous contributor of excerpts.\"\n"}
{"id": "27165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27165", "title": "Sexism", "text": "Sexism\n\nSexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls. It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles, and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another. Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. Gender discrimination may encompass sexism, and is discrimination toward people based on their gender identity or their gender or sex differences. Gender discrimination is especially defined in terms of workplace inequality.\n\nAccording to Fred R. Shapiro, the term \"sexism\" was most likely coined on November 18, 1965, by Pauline M. Leet during a \"Student-Faculty Forum\" at Franklin and Marshall College. Specifically, the word sexism appears in Leet's forum contribution \"Women and the Undergraduate\", and she defines it by comparing it to racism, stating in part (on page 3): \"When you argue ... that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you in this case a 'sexist' ... Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone's value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant.\"\n\nAlso according to Shapiro, the first time the term \"sexism\" appeared in print was in Caroline Bird's speech \"On Being Born Female\", which was published on November 15, 1968, in \"Vital Speeches of the Day\" (p. 6). In this speech she said in part: \"There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn't matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism.\"\n\nSexism may be defined as an ideology based on the belief that one sex is superior to another. It is discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping on the basis of gender, and is most often expressed toward girls and women. It has been characterized as the \"hatred of women\" and \"entrenched prejudice against women\".\n\nSociology has examined sexism as manifesting at both the individual and the institutional level. According to Schaefer, sexism is perpetuated by all major social institutions. Sociologists describe parallels among other ideological systems of oppression such as racism, which also operates at both the individual and institutional level. Early female sociologists Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida B. Wells, and Harriet Martineau described systems of gender inequality, but did not use the term \"sexism\", which was coined later. Sociologists who adopted the functionalist paradigm, e.g. Talcott Parsons, understood gender inequality as the natural outcome of a dimorphic model of gender.\n\nPsychologists Mary Crawford and Rhoda Unger define sexism as a form of prejudice held by individuals that encompasses \"negative attitudes and values about women as a group.\" Peter Glick and Susan Fiske coined the term \"ambivalent sexism\" to describe how stereotypes about women can be both positive and negative, and that individuals compartmentalize the stereotypes they hold into hostile sexism or benevolent sexism.\n\nFeminist author bell hooks defines sexism as a system of oppression that results in disadvantages for women. Feminist philosopher Marilyn Frye defines sexism as an \"attitudinal-conceptual-cognitive-orientational complex\" of male supremacy, male chauvinism, and misogyny.\n\nThe status of women in ancient Egypt depended on their fathers or husbands, but they had property rights and were allowed to attend court, including as plaintiffs. Women of the Anglo-Saxon era were commonly afforded equal status. Evidence, however, is lacking to support the idea that many pre-agricultural societies afforded women a higher status than women today. After the adoption of agriculture and sedentary cultures, the concept that one gender was inferior to the other was established; most often this was imposed upon women and girls. Examples of sexism in the ancient world include written laws preventing women from participating in the political process; women in ancient Rome could not vote or hold political office. Another example is scholarly texts that indoctrinate children in female inferiority; women in ancient China were taught the Confucian principles that a woman should obey her father in childhood, husband in marriage, and son in widowhood.\n\nSexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the 15th and 18th centuries. In early modern Europe, and in the European colonies in North America, claims were made that witches were a threat to Christendom. The misogyny of that period played a role in the persecution of these women.\n\nIn \"Malleus Malificarum\", the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials, the authors argue that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men, and write that:\n\nWitchcraft remains illegal in several countries, including Saudi Arabia, where it is punishable by death. In 2011, a woman was beheaded in that country for 'witchcraft and sorcery'. Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world; for example, in Tanzania, about 500 elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations.\n\nWhen women are targeted for accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence, it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact - for example, discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on caste, as is the case in India and Nepal, where such crimes are relatively common.\n\nUntil the 20th century, U.S. and English law observed the system of coverture, where \"by marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage\". U.S. women were not legally defined as \"persons\" until 1875 (\"Minor v. Happersett\", 88 U.S. 162). A similar legal doctrine, called marital power, existed under Roman Dutch law (and is still partially in force in present-day Swaziland).\n\nRestrictions on married women's rights were common in Western countries until a few decades ago: for instance, French married women obtained the right to work without their husband's permission in 1965, and in West Germany women obtained this right in 1977. During the Franco era, in Spain, a married woman required her husband's consent (called \"permiso marital\") for employment, ownership of property and traveling away from home; the \"permiso marital\" was abolished in 1975. In Australia, until 1983, the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.\n\nWomen in parts of the world continue to lose their legal rights in marriage. For example, Yemeni marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission. In Iraq, the law allows husbands to legally \"punish\" their wives. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.\n\nAbuses and discriminatory practices against women in marriage are often rooted in financial payments such as dowry, bride price, and dower. These transactions often serve as legitimizing coercive control of the wife by her husband and in giving him authority over her; for instance Article 13 of the Code of Personal Status (Tunisia) states that \"The husband shall not, in default of payment of the dower, force the woman to consummate the marriage\", implying that, if the dower is paid, marital rape is permitted (in this regard, critics have questioned the alleged gains of women in Tunisia, and its image as a progressive country in the region, arguing that discrimination against women remains very strong in that country).\n\nThe OMCT has recognized the \"independence and ability to leave an abusive husband\" as crucial in stopping mistreatment of women. However, in some parts of the world, once married, women have very little chance of leaving a violent husband: obtaining a divorce is very difficult in many jurisdictions because of the need to prove fault in court; while attempting a \"de facto\" separation (moving away from the marital home) is also not possible due to laws preventing this. For instance, in Afghanistan, a wife who leaves her marital home risks being imprisoned for \"running away\". In addition, many former British colonies, including India, maintain the concept of restitution of conjugal rights, under which a wife may be ordered by court to return to her husband; if she fails to do so she may be held in contempt of court. Other problems have to do with the payment of the bride price: if the wife wants to leave, her husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.\n\nLaws, regulations, and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world, and to contribute to the mistreatment of women, in particular in areas related to sexual violence and to self-determination in regard to sexuality, the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of women's rights; in 2012, Navi Pillay, then High Commissioner for Human Rights, has stated that:\n\nGender has been used, at times, as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere. Women's suffrage was not achieved until 1893, when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. Saudi Arabia was the most recent country, as of August 2015, to extend the right to vote to women in 2011. Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently: Swiss women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last canton to grant women the right to vote on local issues (in 1991, when it was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland). French women were granted the right to vote in 1944. In Greece, women obtained the right to vote in 1952. In Liechtenstein, women obtained the right to vote in 1984, through the women's suffrage referendum of 1984.\n\nWhile almost every woman today has the right to vote, there is still progress to be made for women in politics. Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia, Canada and the United States, women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press. Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the 1980s, but are nonetheless still present. Certain issues (e.g., education) are likely to be linked with female candidates, while other issues (e.g., taxes) are likely to be linked with male candidates. In addition, there is more emphasis on female candidates' personal qualities, such as their appearance and their personality, as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent.\n\nSexism in politics can also be shown in the imbalance of law making power between men and women. Lanyan Chen stated that men hold more political power than women, serving as the gatekeepers of policy making. It is possible that this leads to women's needs not being properly represented. In this sense, the inequality of law making power also causes the gender discrimination in politics. The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the UN created Gender Empowerment Measure and its newer incarnation the Gender Inequality Index.\n\nGender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men. Empirical studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women in a number of activities. Dustin B. Thoman and others (2008) hypothesize that \"[t]he socio-cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender-math stereotype may impact women pursuing math\". Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender-math stereotype components, which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively, Thoman and others found that women’s math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype, which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States, rather than the effort component. As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States, Thoman and others concluded that individuals' academic outcomes can be affected by the gender-math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs.\n\nSexism in language exists when language devalues members of a certain gender. Sexist language, in many instances, promotes male superiority. Sexism in language affects consciousness, perceptions of reality, encoding and transmitting cultural meanings and socialization. Researchers have pointed to the semantic rule in operation in language of the male-as-norm. This results in sexism as the male becomes the standard and those who are not male are relegated to the inferior. Sexism in language is considered a form of indirect sexism, in that it is not always overt.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\nVarious feminist movements in the 20th century, from liberal feminism and radical feminism to standpoint feminism, postmodern feminism and queer theory have all considered language in their theorizing. Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language.\n\nOne of the most common calls is for gender-neutral language. Many have called attention, however, to the fact that the English language isn't inherently sexist in its linguistic system, but rather the way it is used becomes sexist and gender-neutral language could thus be employed. At the same time, other opposed critiques of sexism in language with explanations that language is a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, and attempts to control it can be fruitless.\n\nRomanic languages such as French and Spanish may be seen as reinforcing sexism, in that the masculine form is the default form. The word \"mademoiselle\", meaning \"miss\", was declared banished from French administrative forms in 2012 by Prime Minister François Fillon. Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed-sex group to change. As to Spanish, Mexico's Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language.\n\nGerman speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar. The German language is heavily inflected for gender, number, and case; nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender-differentiated. For more gender-neutral constructions, gerund nouns are sometimes used instead, as this completely eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural, and significantly reduces it in the singular. For example, instead of \"die Studenten\" (\"the men students\") or \"die Studentinnen\" (\"the women students\"), one writes \"die Studierenden\" (\"the [people who are] studying\"). However, this approach introduces an element of ambiguity, because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity, rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation.\n\nIn Chinese, some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters. For example, the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom, considered of low worth.\n\nGender-specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender. Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender-oriented implications, such as condescension. For example, one may refer to a female as a \"girl\" rather than a \"woman\", implying that they are subordinate or not fully mature. Other examples include obscene language. Some words are offensive to transgender people, including \"tranny\", \"she-male\", or \"he-she\". Intentional misgendering (assigning the wrong gender to someone) and the pronoun \"it\" are also considered pejorative.\n\nOccupational sexism refers to discriminatory practices, statements or actions, based on a person's sex, occurring in the workplace. One form of occupational sexism is wage discrimination. In 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere, on average women still have 20% less chance to have a job and are paid 17% less than men. The report stated: [In] many countries, labour market discrimination—i.e. the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group—is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities [...] Evidence presented in this edition of the \"Employment Outlook\" suggests that about 8 percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and 30 percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market.\n\nIt also found that despite the fact that almost all OECD countries, including the U.S., have established anti-discrimination laws, these laws are difficult to enforce.\n\nWomen who enter predominantly male work groups can experience the negative consequences of tokenism: performance pressures, social isolation, and role encapsulation. Tokenism could be used to camouflage sexism, to preserve male worker's advantage in the workplace. No link exists between the proportion of women working in an organization/company and the improvement of their working conditions. Ignoring sexist issues may exacerbate women’s occupational problems.\n\nIn the \"World Values Survey\" of 2005, responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted only to men. In Iceland the percentage that agreed was 3.6%, whereas in Egypt it was 94.9%.\n\nResearch has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally-qualified fathers and, if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children.\n\nOne study found that female applicants were favored; however, its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers, since it contradicts most other studies on the issue. Joan C. Williams, a distinguished professor at the University of California's Hastings College of Law, raised issues with its methodology, pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well-qualified. Studies using more moderately-qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired, offered better salaries, and offered mentorship.\n\nIn Europe, studies based on field experiments in the labour market, provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender. However, unequal treatment is still measured in particular situations, for instance when candidates apply for positions at a higher functional level in Belgium, when they apply at their fertiles ages in France, and when they apply for male-dominated occupations in Austria.\n\nStudies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide. Some people argue that this is the result of widespread gender discrimination in the workplace. Others argue that the wage gap is a result of different choices by men and women, such as women placing more value than men on having children, and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business, engineering and technology.\n\nEurostat found a persistent, average gender pay gap of 27.5% in the 27 EU member states in 2008. Similarly, the OECD found that female full-time employees earned 27% less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in 2009.\n\nIn the United States, the female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.77 in 2009; female full-time, year-round (FTYR) workers earned 77% as much as male FTYR workers. Women's earnings relative to men's fell from 1960 to 1980 (56.7–54.2%), rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (54.2–67.6%), leveled off from 1990 to 2000 (67.6–71.2%) and rose from 2000 to 2009 (71.2–77.0%). When the first Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, female full-time workers earned 48.9% as much as male full-time workers.\n\nResearch conducted in the Czech and Slovak Republics shows that, even after the governments passed anti-discrimination legislation, two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to \"represent a major source of the gap\".\n\nThe gender gap can also vary across-occupation and within occupation. In Taiwan, for example, studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within-occupation. In Russia, research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels, and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution. The research also found that \"wage arrears and payment in-kind attenuated wage discrimination, particularly amongst the lowest paid workers, suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment\".\n\nThe gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women (such as education, hours worked and occupation), innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market (such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias). Women currently take significantly more time off to raise children than men. In certain countries such as South Korea, it has also been a long-established practice to lay-off female employees upon marriage. A study by professor Linda Babcock in her book \"Women Don't Ask\" shows that men are eight times more likely to ask for a pay raise, suggesting that pay inequality may be partly a result of behavioral differences between the sexes. However, studies generally find that a portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained after accounting for factors assumed to influence earnings; the unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination.\n\nEstimates of the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary. The OECD estimated that approximately 30% of the gender pay gap across OECD countries is due to discrimination. Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately 60% of the wage differential between men and women. Studies examining the gender pay gap in the United States show that a large portion of the wage differential remains unexplained, after controlling for factors affecting pay. One study of college graduates found that the portion of the pay gap unexplained after all other factors are taken into account is 5% one year after graduating and 12% a decade after graduation. A study by the American Association of University Women found that women graduates in the United States are paid less than men doing the same work and majoring in the same field.\n\nWage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of supply and demand, which states that if a good or service (in this case, labor) is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market. If a worker offered equal value for less pay, supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower-paid workers. If a business hired lower-wage workers for the same work, it would lower its costs and enjoy a competitive advantage. According to supply and demand, if women offered equal value demand (and wages) should rise since they offer a better price (lower wages) for their service than men do.\n\nResearch at Cornell University and elsewhere indicates that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally-qualified fathers and, if hired, receive a lower salary than male applicants with children. The OECD found that \"a significant impact of children on women’s pay is generally found in the United Kingdom and the United States\". Fathers earn $7,500 more, on average, than men without children do.\n\nThere is research to suggest that the gender wage gap leads to big losses for the economy as a whole.\n\nAccording to Denise Venable at the National Center for Policy Analysis, the \"wage gap\" in the United States is not the result of discrimination but of differences in lifestyle choices. Venable's report found that women are less likely than men to sacrifice personal happiness for increases in income or to choose full-time work. She found that among American adults working between one and thirty-five hours a week and part-time workers who have never been married, women earn more than men. Venable also found that among people aged 27 to 33 who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98% of men's and \"women who hold positions and have skills and experience similar to those of men face wage disparities of less than 10 percent, and many are within a couple of points\". Venable concluded that women and men with equal skills and opportunities in the same positions face little or no wage discrimination: \"Claims of unequal pay almost always involve comparing apples and oranges\".\n\nThere is considerable agreement that gender wage discrimination exists, however, when it comes to estimating its magnitude, significant discrepancies are visible. A meta-regression analysis concludes that \"the estimated gender gap has been steadily declining\" and that the wage rate calculation is proven to be crucial in estimating the wage gap. The analysis further notes that excluding experience and failing to correct for selection bias from analysis might also lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n\"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career.\"\n\nIn the United States, women account for 52% of the overall labor force, but only make up 3% of corporate CEOs and top executives. Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender, conducted by current top executives and corporate directors (primarily male), as well as \"the historic absence of women in top positions\", which \"may lead to hysteresis, preventing women from accessing powerful, male-dominated professional networks, or same-sex mentors\". The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color (according to a report, \"women of colour perceive a 'concrete ceiling' and not simply a glass ceiling\").\n\nIn the economics profession, it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service. Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion, \"the cumulative effect of small, contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion\". In the high-tech industry, research shows that, regardless of the intra-firm changes, \"extra-organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade, leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high-tech work\".\n\nThe United Nations asserts that \"progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow\".\n\nResearch by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a possible remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards, which could subsequently lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions. The same research suggests that this could also result in a \"feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members (for the companies they manage, as well as other companies), leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives\".\n\nA 2009 study found that being overweight harms women's career advancement, but presents no barrier for men. Overweight women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses, making up between 5% and 22% of female CEOs. However, the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between 45% and 61%, over-representing overweight men. On the other hand, approximately 5% of CEOs were obese among both genders. The author of the study stated that the results suggest that \"the 'glass ceiling effect' on women's advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women, but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women\".\n\nTransgender people also experience significant workplace discrimination and harassment. Unlike sex-based discrimination, refusing to hire (or firing) a worker for their gender identity or expression is not explicitly illegal in most U.S. states.\n\nIn August 1995, Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal against Vancouver Rape Relief & Women's Shelter. Nixon, a trans woman, had been interested in volunteering as a counselor with the shelter. When the shelter learned that she was transsexual, they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization. Nixon argued that this constituted illegal discrimination under Section 41 of the British Columbia Human Rights Code. Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the socialization and experiences of their formative years, and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up, and that, therefore, Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counseling to the female born women that the shelter served.\n\nIn social philosophy, objectification is the act of treating a person as an object or thing. Objectification plays a central role in feminist theory, especially sexual objectification. Feminist writer and gender equality activist Joy Goh-Mah argues that by being objectified, a person is denied agency. According to the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, a person might be objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them:\nRae Helen Langton, in \"Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification\", proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum's list:\nAccording to objectification theory, objectification can have important repercussions on women, particularly young women, as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders, such as unipolar depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders.\n\nWhile advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles (e.g., as a housewife, breadwinner), in modern advertisements, they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles. However, advertising today nonetheless still stereotypes men and women, albeit in more subtle ways, including by sexually objectifying them. Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising. When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images, shown in more 'feminine' poses, and generally present a higher degree of 'body display'.\n\nToday, some countries (for example Norway and Denmark) have laws against sexual objectification in advertising. Nudity is not banned, and nude people can be used to advertise a product if they are relevant to the product advertised. Sol Olving, head of Norway's Kreativt Forum (an association of the country's top advertising agencies) explained, \"You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream, but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car\".\n\nOther countries continue to ban nudity (on traditional obscenity grounds), but also make explicit reference to sexual objectification, such as Israel's ban of billboards that \"depicts sexual humiliation or abasement, or presents a\nhuman being as an object available for sexual use\".\n\nAnti-pornography feminist Catharine MacKinnon argues that pornography contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles. MacKinnon, along with Andrea Dworkin, argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools, and is a form of sex discrimination. The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating:\n\n\"We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes (i) women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain; or (iii) women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest or other sexual assault; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up, cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility, or display; or (vi) women's body parts—including but not limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks—are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals; or (viii) women are presented in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual.\"\n\nRobin Morgan and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to violence against women by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated, coerced, humiliated or sexually assaulted.\n\nSome people opposed to pornography, including MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it. Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths; it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time, with any person, on their terms, responding positively to any requests.\n\nMacKinnon writes:\nDefenders of pornography and anti-censorship activists (including sex-positive feminists) argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual, since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality. They contend that men and women are objectified in pornography (particularly sadistic or masochistic pornography, in which men are objectified and sexually used by women).\n\nProstitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment. Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients, thus calling their sense of agency into question. There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally, prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact. As a result, sex workers face higher rates of violence and sexual assault. This is often dismissed, ignored and not taken seriously by authorities.\n\nIn many countries, prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps, who often claim ownership over sex workers. This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency. This is literally the case in instances of sexual slavery.\n\nVarious authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable, that men's desires must be satisfied, and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually. The European Women's Lobby condemned prostitution as \"an intolerable form of male violence\".\n\nCarole Pateman writes that:\n\nSome scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups. According to Susan Douglas: \"Since the early 1990s, much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it-completely-in the professions, as having gained sexual equality with men, and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany's-encrusted doyennes of Laguna Beach.\" These images may be harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of African American women often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying). In a recent analysis of images of Haitian women in the Associated Press photo archive from 1994 to 2009, several themes emerged emphasizing the \"otherness\" of Haitian women and characterizing them as victims in need of rescue.\n\nIn an attempt to study the effect of media consumption on males, Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame, though not through self-objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women. The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately. Another study also found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively, but again with different mechanisms, namely self-objectification for women and internalization for men.\n\nFrederick Attenborough argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification, which reduce the butt of the joke to an object. They not only objectify women, but can also condone violence or prejudice against women. \"Sexist humor—the denigration of women through humor—for instance, trivializes sex discrimination under the veil of benign amusement, thus precluding challenges or opposition that nonhumorous sexist communication would likely incur.\" A study of 73 male undergraduate students by Ford found that \"sexist humor can promote the behavioral expression of prejudice against women amongst sexist men\". According to the study, when sexism is presented in a humorous manner it is viewed as tolerable and socially acceptable: \"Disparagement of women through humor 'freed' sexist participants from having to conform to the more general and more restrictive norms regarding discrimination against women.\"\n\nGender discrimination is discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity. Gender identity is \"the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual's designated sex at birth\". Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism. Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex, gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities, including third gender, genderqueer, and other non-binary identified people. It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace, and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, \"although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination, there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion\". Hurst states that \"[c]ourts often confuse sex, gender and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex\".\n\nOppositional sexism is a term coined by transfeminist author Julia Serano, who defined oppositional sexism as \"the belief that male and female are rigid, mutually exclusive categories\". Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of social norms, such as cissexism, heteronormativity, and traditional sexism.\n\nOppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females. This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism, the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people.\n\nThe idea of having two, totally opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what gender theorist Judith Butler calls a \"compulsory practice of heterosexuality\". Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way, non-heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms.\n\nThe concept of opposite genders sets a \"dangerous precedent\", according to Serano, where \"if men are big then women must be small; and if men are strong then women must be weak\". The gender binary and oppositional norms work together to support \"traditional sexism\", the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity.\n\nSerano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with \"traditional sexism\". This ensures that \"those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine, and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine\".\n\nTransgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with. Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one's gender, sex-segregated public restrooms and other facilities, dress codes according to binary gender codes, and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services. In a recent adjudication, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that discrimination against a transgender person is sex discrimination.\n\nThe 2008-09 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS)—a U.S. study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was, at its time, the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination—showed that Black transgender people in the United States suffer \"the combination of anti-transgender bias and persistent, structural and individual racism\" and that \"black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races (15%), four times the general Black population rate 9% and over eight times the general US population rate (4%)\". Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, due to displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between 8% and 15% high rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that \"gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts.\"\n\nIn another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens, Latino/a transgender people who were non-citizens were most vulnerable to harassment, abuse and violence.\n\nAn updated version of the NTDS survey, called the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, was published in December 2016.\n\nAlthough the exact rates are widely disputed, there is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence mostly committed by men. In addition, there is broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are more likely to be injured by an abusive partner. The United Nations recognizes domestic violence as a form of gender-based violence, which it describes as a human rights violation, and the result of sexism.\n\nDomestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children if he does not leave visible marks. In 2015, Equality Now drew attention a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria, titled \"Correction of Child, Pupil, Servant or Wife\" which reads: \"(1) Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done: (...) (d) by a husband for the purpose of correcting his wife, such husband and wife being subject to any native law or custom in which such correction is recognized as lawful.\"\n\nHonor killings are another form of domestic violence practiced in several parts of the world, and their victims are predominantly women. Honor killings can occur because of refusal to enter into an arranged marriage, maintaining a relationship relatives disapprove of, extramarital sex, becoming the victim of rape, dress seen as inappropriate, or homosexuality. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime states that, \"[h]onour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence\".\n\nAccording to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women:\n\nPractices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 Balochistan honour killings in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan, Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services Israr Ullah Zehri defended the practice: \"These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them. Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid.\" Following the 2006 case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani (which has placed Iran under international pressure for its stoning sentences), Mohammad-Javad Larijani (a senior envoy and chief of Iran’s Human Rights Council) defended the practice of stoning; he claimed it was a \"lesser punishment\" than execution, because it allowed those convicted a chance at survival.\n\nDowry deaths are the result of the killing women who are unable to pay the high dowry price for their marriage. According to Amnesty International, \"the ongoing reality of dowry-related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property\".\n\nFemale infanticide is the killing of newborn female children, while female selective abortion is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus. Gendercide is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender and it is an extreme form of gender-based violence. Female infanticide is more common than male infanticide, and is especially prevalent in South Asia, in countries such as China, India and Pakistan. Recent studies suggest that over 90 million girls and women are missing in China and India as a result of infanticide.\n\nSex-selective abortion involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby. The abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where the culture values male children over females, such as parts of East Asia and South Asia (China, India, Pakistan, Korea, Taiwan), the Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia), and Western Balkans (Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo). \n\nForced sterilization and forced abortion are also forms of gender-based violence. Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the 20th century by many Western countries and there are reports of this practice being currently employed in some countries, such as Uzbekistan and China.\n\nIn China, the one child policy interacting with the low status of women has been deemed responsible for many abuses, such female infanticide, sex-selective abortion, abandonment of baby girls, forced abortion, and forced sterilization.\n\nIn India the custom of dowry is strongly related to female infanticide, sex-selective abortion, abandonment and mistreatment of girls. Such practices are especially present in the northwestern part of the country (Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Delhi); see Female foeticide in India and Female infanticide in India).\n\nFemale genital mutilation is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons\". WHO further state that, \"the procedure has no health benefits for girls and women\" and \"[p]rocedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn death,\" and \"is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women\" and \"constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women\". The European Parliament stated in a resolution that the practice \"clearly goes against the European founding value of equality between women and men and maintains traditional values according to which women are seen as the objects and properties of men\".\n\nResearch by Lisak and Roth into factors motivating perpetrators of sexual assault, including rape, against women revealed a pattern of hatred towards women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and physical trauma, rather than sexual interest. Mary Odem and Peggy Reeves Sanday posit that rape is the result not of pathology but of systems of male dominance, cultural practices and beliefs.\n\nMary Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, and Susan Brownmiller argue that sexist attitudes are propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists. They state that in contrast to those myths, rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim and acquaintance rape (not assault by a stranger) is the most common form of rape. Odem also asserts that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men, by perpetuating the belief that men cannot control their sexuality.\n\nSexism can promote the stigmatization of women and girls who have been raped and inhibit recovery. In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are ostracized, rejected by their families, subjected to violence, and—in extreme cases—may become victims of honor killings because they are deemed to have brought shame upon their families.\n\nThe criminalization of marital rape is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades; and in many countries it is still legal. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970; other European countries and some of the English-speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s; some countries outlawed it in the 2000s. The WHO wrote that: \"Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women. The custom of marrying off young children, particularly girls, is found in many parts of the world. This practice—legal in many countries—is a form of sexual violence, since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent\".\n\nIn countries where fornication or adultery are illegal, victims of rape can be charged criminally.\n\nSexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers, committed by soldiers, combatants or civilians during armed conflict, war or military occupation. This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training.\n\nSexual violence and rape are also committed against men during war and are often under-reported. Sexism plays a significant part in the difficulty that the survivors face coping with their victimization, especially in patriarchal cultures, and in the lack of support provided to men who have been raped.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund writes that \"Family planning is central to gender equality and women's empowerment\". Women in many countries around the world are denied medical and informational services related to reproductive health, including access to pregnancy care, family planning, and contraception. In countries with very strict abortion laws (particularly in Latin America) women who suffer miscarriages are often investigated by the police under suspicion of having deliberately provoked the miscarriage, and are sometimes jailed, a practice which Amnesty International called a \"ruthless campaign against women's rights\". Doctors may be reluctant to treat pregnant women who are very ill, because they are afraid the treatment may result in fetal loss. According to Amnesty Intentional, \"Discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls also means access to sex education and contraceptives are near impossible [in El Salvador]\". The organization has also criticized laws and policies which require the husband's consent for a woman to use reproductive health services as being discriminatory and dangerous to women's health and life: \"[F]or the woman who needs her husband's consent to get contraception, the consequences of discrimination can be serious – even fatal\".\n\nA child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under 18, a practice that disproportionately affects women. Child marriages are most common in South Asia, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, but occur in other parts of the world, too. The practice of marrying young girls is rooted in patriarchal ideologies of control of female behavior, and is also sustained by traditional practices such as dowry and bride price. Child marriage is strongly connected with the protection of female virginity. UNICEF states that:\n\nConsequences of child marriage include restricted education and employment prospects, increased risk of domestic violence, child sexual abuse, pregnancy and birth complications, and social isolation. Early and forced marriage are defined as forms of modern-day slavery by the International Labour Organisation. In some cases a woman or girl who has been raped may be forced to marry her rapist, in order to restore the honor of her family; or marriage by abduction, a practice in which a man abducts the woman or girl whom he wishes to marry and rapes her, in order to force the marriage (common in Ethiopia).\n\nIn several OIC countries the legal testimony of a woman is worth legally half of that of a man (see Status of women's testimony in Islam). Such countries include: Algeria (in criminal cases), Bahrain (in Sharia courts), Egypt (in family courts), Iran (in most cases), Iraq (in some cases), Jordan (in Sharia courts), Kuwait (in family courts), Libya (in some cases), Morocco (in family cases), Palestine (in cases related to marriage, divorce and child custody), Qatar (in family law matters), Syria (in Sharia courts), United Arab Emirates (in some civil matters), Yemen (not allowed to testify at all in cases of adultery and retribution), and Saudi Arabia. Such laws have been criticized by Human Rights Watch and Equality Now as being discriminatory towards women.\n\nThe criminal justice system in many common law countries has also been accused of discriminating against women. Provocation is, in many common law countries, a partial defense to murder, which converts what would have been murder into manslaughter. It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the \"heat of passion\" upon being \"provoked\" by the behavior of the victim. This defense has been criticized as being gendered, favoring men, due to it being used disproportionately in cases of adultery, and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners. As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias, and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women, it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions.\n\nThe traditional leniently towards crimes of passion in Latin American countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, stated that, \"[S]o-called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.\" The OHCHR has called for \"the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation, including mitigating factors for 'crimes of passion.\n\nIn the United States, some studies have shown that for identical crimes, men are given harsher sentences than women. Controlling for arrest offense, criminal history, and other pre-charge variables, sentences are over 60% heavier for men. Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely, and to avoid imprisonment if convicted. The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case. For example, the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms. This disparity occurs in US federal courts, despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing. The death penalty in may also suffer from gender bias. According to Shatz and Shatz, \"[t]he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown: that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women\".\n\nThere have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States. One of the most common is expectation that women are predominantly care-givers. Other possible reasons include the \"girlfriend theory\" (whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends), the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities, and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as postpartum depression or battered wife syndrome. However, none of these theories account for the total disparity, and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause.\n\nGender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.\n\nTransgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated. They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex, rather than their gender identity. Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment. They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment.\n\nSome countries use stoning as a form of capital punishment. According to Amnesty International, the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system.\n\nOne study found that \"on average, women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men... roughly 30% of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender. We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders. There is little evidence, however, that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges.\"\n\nA 2017 study by Knepper found that \"female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case. Additionally, female judges are 15 percentage points less likely than male judges to grant motions filed by defendants, which suggests that final negotiations are shaped by the emergence of the bias.\"\n\nWomen have traditionally had limited access to higher education. In the past, when women were admitted to higher education, they were encouraged to major in less-scientific subjects; the study of English literature in American and British colleges and universities was instituted as a field considered suitable to women's \"lesser intellects\".\n\nEducational specialties in higher education produce and perpetuate inequality between men and women. Disparity persists particularly in computer and information science, where in the US women received only 21% of the undergraduate degrees, and in engineering, where women obtained only 19% of the degrees in 2008. Only one out of five of physics doctorates in the US are awarded to women, and only about half of those women are American. Of all the physics professors in the country, only 14% are women.\n\nWorld literacy is lower for females than for males. Data from \"The World Factbook\" shows that 79.7% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). In some parts of the world, girls continue to be excluded from proper public or private education. In parts of Afghanistan, girls who go to school face serious violence from some local community members and religious groups.\nAccording to 2010 UN estimates, only Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen had less than 90 girls per 100 boys at school. Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney's study of Sri Lankan economic development has suggested that increases in the life expectancy for women encourages educational investment because a longer time horizon increases the value of investments that pay out over time.\n\nEducational opportunities and outcomes for women have greatly improved in the West. Since 1991, the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men, and the gap has widened over time. , women made up the majority—54%—of the 10.8 million college students enrolled in the United States. However, research by Diane Halpern has indicated that boys receive more attention, praise, blame and punishment in the grammar-school classroom, and \"this pattern of more active teacher attention directed at male students continues at the postsecondary level\". Over time, female students speak less in a classroom setting.\n\nWriter Gerry Garibaldi has argued that the educational system has become \"feminized\", allowing girls more of a chance at success with a more \"girl-friendly\" environment in the classroom; this is seen to hinder boys by punishing \"masculine\" behavior and diagnosing boys with behavioral disorders. A recent study by the OECD in over 60 countries found that teachers give boys lower grades for the same work. The researchers attribute this to stereotypical ideas about boys and recommend teachers to be aware of this gender bias. One study found that students give female professors worse evaluation scores than male professors, even though the students appear to do as well under female professors as male professors.\n\nFeminists argue that clothing and footwear fashion has been oppressive to women, restricting their movements, increasing their vulnerability, and endangering their health. The use of thin models within the fashion industry has encouraged the development of bulimia and anorexia nervosa, as well as locking female consumers into false feminine identities.\n\nThe assignment of gender-specific baby clothes can instill in children a belief in negative gender stereotypes. One example is the assignment in some countries of the color pink to girls and blue to boys. The fashion is a recent one; at the beginning of the 20th century the trend was the opposite: blue for girls and pink for boys. In the early 1900s, \"The Women's Journal\" wrote that \"pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl\". \"DressMaker\" magazine also explained that \"[t]he preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink. Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler, and the more dainty of the two colours, and pink is thought to be stronger (akin to red)\". Today, in many countries, it is considered inappropriate for boys to wear dresses and skirts, but this is also a relatively recent view. From the mid-16th century until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the Western world were unbreeched and wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.\n\nLaws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International, as a form of gender discrimination. In many countries, women are faced with violence for failing to adhere to certain dress codes, whether by the authorities (such as the religious police), family members, or the community. Amnesty International states:\n\nThe production process also faces criticism for sexist practices. In the garment industry, approximately 80 percent of workers are female. Much garment production is located in Asia because of the low labor cost. Women who work in these factories are sexually harassed by managers and male workers, paid low wages, and discriminated against when pregnant.\n\nConscription, or compulsory military service, has been criticized as sexist. Prior to the late 20th century, only men were subjected to conscription, and most countries still require only men to serve in the military.\n\nIn his book \"The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys\" (2012), philosopher David Benatar states that \"[t]he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted and, similarly, that only males should be forced into combat\". This, he believes, \"is a sexist assumption\". Anthropologist Ayse Gül Altinay has commented that \"given equal suffrage rights, there is no other citizenship practice that differentiates as radically between men and women as compulsory male conscription\".\n\nCurrently, only nine countries conscript women into their armed forces: China, Eritrea, Israel, Libya, Malaysia, North Korea, Norway, Peru, and Taiwan. Other countries—such as Finland, Turkey, and Singapore—still use a system of conscription which requires military service from only men, although women are permitted to serve voluntarily. In 2014, Norway became the first NATO country to introduce obligatory military service for women as an act of gender equality and in 2015, the Dutch government started preparing a gender-neutral draft law. The gender selective draft has been challenged in the United States.\n\n\n"}

It was an initiative of John Tyndall of the British National Front; sister organisations were also formed in Australia and New Zealand at the same time.\n\nSANF's first Chairman was Jack Noble, with the party being organised during the 1970s by Ray Hill. SANF channelled funds to the NF as part of an international network of neo-fascism. It moved beyond a mere gathering of expatriates when it linked up with Italian and Portuguese neo-fascists and the South African Ku Klux Klan. It also tried to link with the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) and the Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP) (from whom it received funding) with the ultimate aim of a single united racist/neo-fascist party in South Africa but this 'embryonic’ party never came to fruition.\n\nSANF published its own magazine \"Hitback\". It also \"published a number of anti-black and ‘anti-Zionist’ pamphlets which led to calls for it to be prosecuted for incitement to racial hatred\", SANF’s policies would have led to a \"massive increase in the death rate of black infants\". By 1979 SANF's anti-semitism led Jewish youths to threaten to take matters into their own hands; Harry Schwarz and Alf Widman of the Progressive Federal Party called on the government to do something about the party.\n\nIn 1979 the HNP replaced Noble as leader with Alan Fotheringham, a former HNP candidate, and Ray Hill returned to England.\n\nSANF formed its own paramilitary wing Wit Kommando/White Commando, a not unusual development in the context of right wing South African politics. In 1980 the Wit Kommando/White Commando began a campaign of terrorism mainly against blacks. A number of bombings took place, notably against the offices of the South African Institute of Race Relations and the University of South Africa. In 1981 they planned to also attack whites whom they regarded as \"white kaffirs\" or race mixers. The South African police made arrests and discovered a hitlist of targets which included Bishop Desmond Tutu, the White Commando having previously \"threatened him repeatedly\". Fotheringham was not charged but Max (Massimo) Bollo from SANF's national directorate, and leader of the Italian associated grouping UNIDO, received a lengthy jail sentence, as did two other fellow Italians. SANF disbanded in the early 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "418478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418478", "title": "The Adventures of Nero", "text": "The Adventures of Nero\n\nThe Adventures of Nero or Nero was a Belgian comic strip drawn by Marc Sleen and the name of its main character. The original title ranged from \"De Avonturen van Detectief Van Zwam\" in 1947 to \"De Avonturen van Nero en zijn Hoed\" in 1950, and finally \"De Avonturen van Nero & Co\" from 1951. It ran in continuous syndication until 2002. From 1947 until 1993 it was all drawn by Sleen himself. From 1992 until 2002 Dirk Stallaert took over the drawing while Sleen kept inventing the stories.\n\nTogether with \"Suske en Wiske\" and \"Jommeke\", \"Nero\" is regarded as the Big Three of Flemish comics. The stories were noted for their satirical content, with references to politicians and celebrities of the day. With \"Nero\", Marc Sleen holds the world record of issues of a comic book series title drawn by the same author. He drew \"The Adventures of Nero\" singlehandedly from 1947 to 1992 without any assistance from other artists. This feat is even more remarkable considering he also drew other comic strip series from 1947 to 1965.\n\nThe series debuted in the newspaper \"De Nieuwe Gids\" in the autumn of 1947 and was written and drawn by Marc Sleen from the start. Originally the central character was Detective Van Zwam, but halfway through the first story \"Het Geheim van Matsuoka\" (\"The Secret of Matsuoka\") (1947), Van Zwam meets a man who has drunk from a serum that makes people go insane and thinks he is the Roman emperor Nero. The character was also dressed in a toga with some laurel leaves behind his ears. Near the end of the story the character regained his senses and revealed his real name was \"Schoonpaard\" (in reprints this was changed to \"Heiremans\", in both cases inside joke references to colleagues of Sleen). The character proved popular and remained a friend of Van Zwam in the next stories, though everyone kept referring to him as \"Nero\" rather than by his real name. After nine stories, the series was renamed after \"Nero\" and Van Zwam became a side character instead.\n\nIn 1950 Sleen left \"De Nieuwe Gids\" and joined the newspaper \"Het Volk\". During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960 \"The Adventures of Nero\" was popular enough to rival Willy Vandersteen's \"Suske en Wiske\" which was published in \"De Standaard\". In 1965 Sleen joined \"De Standaard\" too, following a legal dispute with his publishers. The first 53 \"Nero\" stories, which were published in black-and-white, remained property of Uitgeverij Het Volk. From \"Het Bobobeeldje\" (\"The Bobo Statue\") (1965) on all new \"Nero\" stories were published in \"De Standaard\" and \"Het Nieuwsblad\", after which they were released as colour albums.\n\nSleen continued drawing \"Nero\" for many decades. Only in 1992 did he finally hire an assistant, Dirk Stallaert, to do the drawing for him, because his eyesight had become too poor. Stallaert was promoted as Sleen's successor but in 2002 he decided to leave the series in favour of Studio Vandersteen. Sleen then terminated the series for good. Stallaert still draws \"Nero\"-related publicity images and merchandise.\n\nThe early stories had a random length, often around 240 strips, while the latter ones (from 1965 on) had a length of 32 pages of 4 strips each. Every day, two strips appeared in the newspaper.\n\n\"The Adventures of Nero\" is a humorous adventure comic strip about Nero, an unemployed man who describes himself as \"newspaper appearance\" and prefers reading his newspaper on his sofa. He and his wife, named \"Madam Nero\" (\"Madam Nero\") by everyone, have one son, Adhemar, who is a child prodigy. Nero has an eccentric group of friends, who often help him out or force him to set out on an adventure. Many stories display a love for nature and the animal world, which mirrors the creator's own frequent safari trips. Since the album \"Het Groene Vuur\" (\"The Green Fire\") (1965) nearly all \"Nero\" albums end with a traditional waffle feast, where Madam Nero and Madam Pheip bake waffles for the entire cast.\n\nWith two strips published a day, six days a week, the comic strip followed daily news events quite closely and often made references to real life news events. In the story \"De IJzeren Kolonel\" (\"The Iron Colonel\") (1956), for instance, the then-current Suez Crisis and Hungarian Uprising are incorporated into the plot. The series also had cameos by several Belgian and internationally famous politicians, such as Paul-Henri Spaak, Achiel Van Acker, Paul Vanden Boeynants, Wilfried Martens, Jean-Pierre Van Rossem, Jean-Luc Dehaene, Jozef Stalin, Mobutu, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Hirohito, Fidel Castro, Richard Nixon, Idi Amin, Khomeini , Margaret Thatcher and Saddam Hussein. Media celebrities, such as The Beatles, Pablo Escobar, Urbanus, Paul Newman and Frank Zappa were also frequently caricatured. Sleen also gave himself cameos in several stories. Very exceptional was the fact that all these jokes about past politics were not removed when the newspaper episodes were published in album format. This is the major reason why \"Nero\" provides readers with an overview of almost 60 years of post-war history in Belgium.\n\nSince Sleen worked without assistance for the majority of his career, he kept his drawing style simple and efficient. He had no time for elaborate detailed drawings and as a result many of his stories are filled to the brim with continuity errors or off-model drawing mistakes. Contrary to other comics, many readers accept this as part of \"Nero\"'s charm. Only when Dirk Stallaert took over the drawings did the art work become more technically detailed, with more attention towards space and perspective.\n\nDuring its 55-year course, a lot of regular characters joined the original duo of Nero and Van Zwam.\n\n\nDuring its heyday \"Nero\" was the most popular Flemish comic strip, second only to \"Suske en Wiske\". The albums sold well, also because they were a lot cheaper than their main rival. From the late 1940s until the early 1960s all the stories were published on cheap paper and often smelt of fresh ink. During the 1960s Jef Nys' \"Jommeke\" overshadowed \"Nero\"'s sales among children.\n\nAttempts have been made to translate \"Nero\" to the Dutch, British, French, German and South African market. Except for in Wallonia and the Netherlands, the translated versions of Nero never caught on. Sleen has very rarely used his characters for merchandising or other commercializations.\n\n\"Nero\" was very influential for the development of comics in Flanders. Its loose drawing style and story lines replete with folly were an inspiration for \"Urbanus\", \"Biebel\", \"Cowboy Henk\", among others. Dutch artists like Martin Lodewijk (\"Agent 327\") and René Windig and Eric De Jong (\"Heinz\") are also notable fans.\n\nThe Flemish comics prize Bronzen Adhemar is named and sculpted after the character Adhemar. In Turnhout, where the award ceremony is traditionally held, a huge statue of Adhemar can be seen in the Warande park since June 15, 1991. It was created by Frank-Ivo Van Damme.\n\nSeveral characters from the series also have their own statues. Nero has a bronze statue in Hoeilaart, sculpted by Luc Cauwenberghs, which was erected in 1994 in front of the old tram station. In the series this building is Nero's house since the story \"De Verschrikkelijke Tweeling\" (\"The Horrible Twin\") (1992). The station has been redecorated as a \"Nero\"-themed café. Nero has another statue in front of the casino in Middelkerke. Meneer Pheip has a statue in the Statiestraat in Moerbeke-Waas, the village of which he supposedly is the major. It was sculpted by Guy Du Cheyne on August 24, 2012. In the Dorpsstraat in Wuustwezel sculptor Gilbert Uitdenhouwen made a statue of Abraham Tuizentfloot, which was revealed in 2000.\n\nThe organisation \"Nero-Harmonie\" in Hoeilaart and a mountain bike route have been named after \"Nero\".\n\nIn 1984 composer Johan De Smet, conductor Vincent D'Hondt and director Arne Sierens chose upon the \"Nero\" story \"Het Rattenkasteel\" (\"The Rats' Castle\") (1947) for an opera adaptation. It premiered as \"Het Rattenkasteel\". \n\nThe entire cast of the series was sculpted on a bas-relief in Sint-Niklaas, made by sculptor Paul Dekker in 1988 to commemorate Marc Sleen's appointment as an honorary citizen of the city.\n\nIn the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition pays homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Marc Sleen. In the room dedicated to his work everything is designed to look like Nero's cosy home, complete with a tower of Belgian waffles and champagne nearby.\n\nNero is among the many Belgian comics characters to have, facetiously, a Brussels street named after them. The Rue de la Fourche/ Greepstraat has a commemorative plaque with the name \"Rue Néron/ Nerostraat\" placed under the actual street sign. \n\nIn 1995 a wall was dedicated to \"Nero\" at the Sint-Goriksplein/Place Saint-Géry in Brussels, where it is part of the Brussels' Comic Book Route. Between 1996 and 2011 Hasselt also had a wall. In 2014 a wall was dedicated to \"Nero\" in the Kloosterstraat in Antwerp, depicting a scene from the album \"De Oliespuiter\" (\"The Oil Injector\"). depicting Nero, Petoetje and Petatje.\n\nThe Marc Sleen Museum in the Zandstraat in Brussels is dedicated to Sleen and his creations. It was opened in 2009.The museum organizes a special tourists' route in Brussels, based on several locations that appeared in \"Nero\" comic book albums, including the Black Tower, Palais de Justice, Kapellekerk, The Sablon, Brussels Central Station, the Grand Place and Manneken Pis. One has to make an appointment, though. \n\nNero, the dog of the character Carmen Waterslaeghers in the successful Flemish TV sitcom \"FC De Kampioenen\", was named after Nero. In one of the episodes Carmen is thinking of a name for her dog and coincidentally sees the daily \"Nero\" comic in the newspaper.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2690104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2690104", "title": "Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal", "text": "Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\n\nWoordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (, commonly abbreviated \"WNT\") is a dictionary of the Dutch language. It contains between 350,000 to 400,000 entries for Dutch words from 1500 to 1921. The paper edition consists of 43 volumes (including three supplements), almost 50,000 pages. The dictionary was almost 150 years in the making; the first volume was published in 1864, and the final volume was presented to Albert II of Belgium and Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1998.\n\nThe \"WNT\" follows the formula of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and the \"Deutsches Wörterbuch\" in being a historical dictionary whose entries are based on primary sources of actual usage.\n\nIts impetus was the inaugural 1849 \"Nederlandsch Congres\" (\"Dutch Congress\"), a conference of linguists from the Netherlands and Belgium. The conference, which was held alternately south and north of the border, ran from 1849 to 1912; its goal was to (re-)establish contacts between Netherlanders and Belgians (after Belgium split off from the Netherlands in 1830) and to lend strength to the Flemish movement in Belgium (which was up against the widespread influence of French). At that first conference, in August 1849 at Ghent University, it was proposed that a dictionary be written \"for our common tongue\". Dutch linguist Matthias de Vries (1820–1892) was given the task of writing it.\n\nFinancial support for the project came from the Dutch and Belgian governments. Also part of the project was spelling reform; De Vries's coauthor Lammert Allard te Winkel (1809–1868) designed the new orthography, though the system is named for both. Another project related to the \"WNT\" was the development of a dictionary of Middle Dutch, the \"Middelnederlandsch Woordenboek\" (1885–1927), by two students of De Vries, Jacob Verdam and Eelco Verwijs.\n\nDe Vries published the first fascicle (\"A-Aanhaling\") in 1864; the first volume (\"A-Ajuin\") in 1882. The last (\"Zuid\"-\"Zythum\") was published in 1998; afterward, three supplements to the original dictionary text containing modern-day Dutch words were published, in 2001. It is published by the \"Instituut voor Nederlandse Lexicologie\" (\"Institute for Dutch Lexicology\"), which works under the supervision of the Dutch Language Union, and is available for free online.\n\nBesides its sheer size and its historical value, the \"WNT\" is credited with supporting the \"integrationist\" movement in Flanders, that is, those who sought a rapprochement between the speakers of Dutch in the Netherlands and Belgium. The De Vries-Te Winkel orthography was made mandatory by the Belgian government in 1864, and shortly thereafter by the Dutch government. It still underlies the rules for orthography and has thus contributed to orthographic unity between the two countries.\n\n\n"}

It was originally published in 1963 under the editorship of Clarence Barnhart, who wrote definitions for the Thorndike-Barnhart graded dictionary series for children, based on the educational works of Edward Thorndike whom Clarence Barnhart had known and worked with decades before. In some editions it was called the \"World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary\". The writing and editing of special articles was carried out by the staff of the World Book Encyclopedia. Encyclopedia staff also reviewed the work for consistency with the encyclopedia and appropriateness of its users. \n\nLike the encyclopedia, it is designed to be user friendly to young people, yet comprehensive enough to be useful to adults. The definitions are designed with consideration for the age at which a person usually encounters the word. Quotations or sample sentences are offered with many words. Most proper names are excluded, leaving their treatment to the encyclopedia.\n\nThe word list is based on a formula for calculating frequency of use. Originally covering about 180,000 words, it has expanded to over 225,000 words with over 3,000 illustrations, making it considerably larger than most dictionaries, though not of \"unabridged\" scope. Its vocabulary has largely been drawn from the \"Century Dictionary\", the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", and Barnhart's own extensive quotation file begun in the 1940s.\n\nFrom 1963 the \"World Book Dictionary\" was updated annually and received a major revision in 1976. With the decline of traditional lexicography and the death of Clarence Barnhart in 1993, the work appears to have fallen almost into obscurity having been overshadowed by the \"World Book Encyclopedia\", which also includes the dictionaries as part of the set. As a standalone work, the \"World Book Dictionary\" has faded from use and public recognition. The \"World Book Dictionary\" was last edited and updated by Robert and Cynthia Barnhart in 1996. Robert Barnhart died in 2007, and Cynthia Barnhart went on to produce the \"Facts on File Student’s Dictionary of American English\" (2008). David Barnhart continues to edit the \"Barnhart Dictionary Companion\" and the \"Barnhart New-Words Concordance\".\n"}
