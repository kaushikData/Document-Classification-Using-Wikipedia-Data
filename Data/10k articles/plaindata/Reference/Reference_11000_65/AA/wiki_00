Arthur clarified that the proclamation would not limit Aboriginals from traveling through Tasmania to shellfish hunting territories, provided a passport was coordinated with their leaders. The proclamation was justified as protecting Aboriginals from violence from colonists, and to protect the colonists from \"repeated and wanton barbarous murders and other crimes\" by the Aboriginals.\n\nThe proclamation established a line of military outposts separating the declared Aboriginal and colonial territories, which the Aboriginals were forbidden to pass. Tasmanian Aboriginals were pressed into remote areas of Tasmania, and eventually relocated to Flinders Island; scholar Rod Edmond notes that the pretext of \"protecting\" the Aboriginals served as a mechanism to clear desirable land for colonial use.\n"}

Revision A was released in December 2010. It was recognized by the FAA in AC 20-174 published November 2011. EUROCAE jointly issues the document as ED–79.\n\nThe Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) is a guideline for development of civil aircraft and systems with an emphasis on safety aspects. Revision A is a substantial rewrite of the document which describes the safety process as a part of an Integrated Development Process. A significant new section is devoted to the process of determining Development Assurance Level (DAL) which determines the rigor of complex hardware and software development and verification activities.\n\nIt is intended to be used in conjunction with SAE ARP4761 (still under revision in December 2013) and is supported by other aviation standards such as RTCA DO-178C/DO-178B and DO-254.\n\nThis guideline addresses Functional Safety and design assurance processes. DAL allocation pertaining to functional failure conditions and hazard severity are assigned to help mitigate risks. Functional Hazard Analyses / Assessments are central to determining hazards and assigning DAL, in addition to requirements based testing and other verification methods. This guideline concerns itself with Physical (item) DAL and Functional (software/systems integration behavior) DAL and the Safety aspects of systems for the whole life-cycle for systems that implement aircraft functions.\n\nARP4754 was defined in the context of aircraft certification, in particular Part 25 Sections 1301 and 1309 of harmonized civil aviation regulations for transport category airplanes. These are found in the U.S. FAA Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) at 14 CFR 25.1309 and the corresponding European JAA Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), which have been replaced by EASA certification standards. FAA Advisory Circular AC 25.1309-1A, \"System Design and Analysis\", explained certification methodology for Part 25 Section 1309.\n\nIn May 1996, the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was tasked with a review of harmonized FAR/JAR 25.1309, AC 1309-1A, and related documents, and to consider revision to AC 1309-1A incorporating recent practice, increasing complex integration between aircraft functions and the systems that implement them, and the implications of new technology. This task was published in the Federal Register at 61 FR 26246-26247 (1996-05-24). The focus was to be on safety assessment and fault-tolerant critical systems.\n\nIn a parallel effort, SAE published ARP4754 in November 1996. In 2002 ARAC submitted to the FAA a draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and draft revision AC 1309-1B (the draft ARSENAL version) recognizing the role of ARP4754 in complex system certification. This draft remains unreleased, but ARP4754 became broadly recognized as an appropriate standard for aircraft system development and certification. The corresponding EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance AMC 25.1309 (included as a section of CS-25) does recognize ARP4754/ED–79.\n\nThe FAA and EASA have both subsequently recognized ARP4754/ED–79 as valid for certification of other aircraft categories, and for specific systems such as avionic databuses.\n\nARP4754A and ED79A were released by SAE and EUROCAE in December 2010. The document title has changed to \"Guidelines For Development Of Civil Aircraft and Systems\". ARP4754A recognizes AMC 25.1309 (published in 2003) and AC 25.1309-1B-Arsenal draft. This revision expands the design assurance concept for application at the aircraft and system level and standardizes on the use of the term development assurance. As a consequence, Functional Development Assurance Level (FDAL) is introduced for aircraft and systems concerns and the term Design Assurance Level has been renamed Item Development Assurance Level (IDAL). Furthermore, the addition of definitions for \"Error\", \"Failure\", and \"Failure Condition\" are acknowledge as derived from AMC 25.1309. The qualitative and quantitative classification of failure conditions by severity and probability now used by ARP4754A and ARP4761 are defined in AMC 25.1309/AC 25.1309–1B-Arsenal draft.\n\n\n"}

As such, \"Afrophobia\" is distinct from the historical racial phenomenon \"negrophobia\", which is a contempt for \"negro\" peoples specifically. The opposite of Afrophobia is Afrophilia, which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa.\n\nTo overcome any perceived \"Afrophobia\", writer Langston Hughes suggested that European Americans must achieve peace of mind and accommodate the uninhibited emotionality of African Americans. Author James Baldwin similarly recommended that White Americans could quash any \"Afrophobia\" on their part by getting in touch with their repressed feelings, empathizing to overcome their \"emotionally stunted\" lives, and thereby overcome any dislike or fear of African Americans.\n\nIt has been observed that writing and terminology about racism, including about Afrophobia has been somewhat U.S.-centric. In 2016, Afrophobia has been used as a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage Afrophobia is an inexact term, because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as reflected in advertising.\n\nIn 2016, Tess Asplund made a viral protest against Neo-Nazism as part of her activism against Afrophobia.\n\n"}

Its founding members included the Scottish literary scholar Matthew McDiarmid (1914–1996). Originally based at the University of Aberdeen, it moved to its current home within the University of Glasgow in 1996. In November 2015, ASLS was allocated £40,000 by the Scottish Government to support its work providing teacher training and classroom resources for schools.\n\nASLS's main field of activity is publishing, and the organisation is a member of Publishing Scotland.\n\nASLS produces periodicals, including \"Scottish Literary Review\" (formerly \"Scottish Studies Review\"), a peer reviewed journal of Scottish literature and cultural studies; \"Scottish Language\", a peer reviewed journal of Scottish languages and linguistics; \"The International Journal of Scottish Literature\", a free online peer reviewed journal (2006–2013); and \"The Bottle Imp\", a free online ezine (named after the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson). Since June 2013, \"Scottish Literary Review\" has been included in Project MUSE's Premium Collection of journals.\n\nSince 1971 ASLS has republished a number of out of print Scottish texts in their \"Annual Volumes\" series (45 volumes by 2016). Titles in the series include reprints of 18th- and 19th-century fiction, anthologies of Scottish drama, editions of poetry and collections of other writings. Two ASLS Annual Volumes have won Saltire Society Research Book of the Year awards: \"The Poems of William Dunbar\", edited by Priscilla Bawcutt (1998), and Sorley MacLean's \"Dàin do Eimhir\", edited by Christopher Whyte (2002).\n\nIn 2015, ASLS launched the \"International Companions to Scottish Literature\" series, co-edited by Ian Brown and Thomas Owen Clancy. Titles in the series to date include \"The International Companion to Lewis Grassic Gibbon\", \"The International Companion to Edwin Morgan\", \"The International Companion to Scottish Poetry\", \"The International Companion to James Macpherson and The Poems of Ossian\", and \"The International Companion to John Galt\".\n\nSince its first issue in 1983, many contemporary Scottish writers have had early work published in ASLS's annual anthology of new short fiction and poetry, \"New Writing Scotland\", including Leila Aboulela, Lin Anderson, Iain Banks, Polly Clark, Anne Donovan, Janice Galloway, Jane Harris, Gail Honeyman, A L Kennedy, James Meek, Ian Rankin, James Robertson, Suhayl Saadi, Ali Smith, Chiew-Siah Tei, Irvine Welsh, and others. \"New Writing Scotland\" is part-funded by Creative Scotland.\n\nThe ASLS \"Occasional Papers\" series publishes essays and monographs on Scottish literary and linguistic topics, often based on papers presented at ASLS conferences. The most recent edition in this series, number 22, is entitled \"Empires and Revolutions: Cunninghame Graham and His Contemporaries\".\n\nASLS publishes the \"Scotnotes\" series of study guides to Scottish writers and their literary works. There are currently thirty-four titles in this series, on authors ranging from late medieval poets such as William Dunbar and Robert Henryson to contemporary writers such as Iain Banks, Liz Lochhead and Ian Rankin.\n\nIn May 2010, in partnership with the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, ASLS published an illustrated edition of Sir Walter Scott's narrative poem \"The Lady of the Lake\", to mark the 200th anniversary of the original publication.\n\nIn June 2011, with financial support from the Gaelic Books Council, ASLS published a new edition of Sorley MacLean's \"An Cuilithionn/The Cuillin\".\n\nIn February 2013, ASLS hosted the inaugural Dr Gavin Wallace Fellowship, set up by Creative Scotland \"to enable a writer to take time out of their usual environment to embark upon a year-long literary adventure to develop their practice\". Kirsty Logan was selected to be the first recipient of the Fellowship, and on 10 August 2015 ASLS published her collection of short stories \"A Portable Shelter\".\n\nSince 2004, ASLS has mounted the Scottish Writing Exhibition at the Modern Language Association of America's annual conventions in the USA, most recently in New York City in January 2018, and plans to attend the 2019 event in Chicago. In August 2008 the Scottish Writing Exhibition was on display at the biannual European Society for the Study of English (ESSE) conference in Aarhus in Denmark.\n\nA number of literary scholars have held the presidency of the ASLS:\n\nTo date, two ASLS Annual Volumes have won Saltire Society Research Book of the Year awards: \"The Poems of William Dunbar\", edited by Priscilla Bawcutt (1998); and Sorley MacLean's \"Dàin do Eimhir\", edited by Christopher Whyte (2002).\n\nIn 2011, the ASLS's edition of Sorley MacLean's \"An Cuilithionn/The Cuillin\" was shortlisted for the Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year award.\n\nAlso in 2011, along with VisitScotland and the University of Glasgow, the ASLS co-produced \"Literary Scotland: A Traveller's Guide\".

{"id": "1897478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897478", "title": "Buddy Roberts", "text": "Buddy Roberts\n\nDale Hey (May 16, 1947 – November 26, 2012) was an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Buddy Roberts. Primarily a tag team wrestler, Roberts is known for his appearances as one of The Hollywood Blonds in the 1970s and as one of The Fabulous Freebirds in the 1980s. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2015 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHey was born in Oklahoma on May 16, 1947. He was raised in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada.\n\nHey was trained as a professional wrestler by Ivan Koloff. He debuted in 1965 under the ring name \"Dale Valentine\", billed as being the younger brother of Johnny Valentine. \n\nAt the tail end of the 1960s, he was working as a preliminary wrestler in the American Wrestling Association (AWA).\n\nIn 1970, Hey was brought into the Oklahoma-based NWA Tri-State promotion by booker Bill Watts. Watts had intended to create a new tag team comprising Jack Donovan and veteran journeyman Jerry Brown. After Donovan left the promotion following a dispute with Watts, Watts hired Hey in his place. Hey was renamed \"Buddy Roberts\" and began teaming with Brown as The Hollywood Blonds. In 1972, Oliver Humperdink began managing The Hollywood Blonds.\n\nThe team of Brown and Roberts won numerous regional tag team titles across the United States throughout the 1970s.\n\nAfter splitting from Brown, Roberts joined with Michael Hayes and Terry Gordy to form The Fabulous Freebirds. Again, Bill Watts played a major role in this decision. Hayes and Gordy had been teaming together in various promotions in the Mid-South and Southeastern regions of the United States for several years, but Watts was not as impressed with Hayes's in-ring work as he was with his skills on the microphone. His original plan was to have Gordy and Roberts as the actual tag team, with Hayes as their manager. Except for a high-profile stint in 1980 in Mid-South Wrestling (formed by Watts the previous year after breaking away from NWA Tri-State) with Hayes and Gordy as the Freebirds, Roberts did not work full-time with the team until they joined World Class Championship Wrestling (see below).\n\nHey later became known as Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts, due to his penchant for drinking Jack Daniel's whiskey.\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds won several titles and moved on to World Class Championship Wrestling in late 1982 and began a high-profile feud with the Von Erich family. They wrestled David Von Erich, Kerry Von Erich, Mike Von Erich and Kevin Von Erich numerous times in 1986. Roberts also had a long-standing feud with Von Erich ally Chris Adams, which lasted on and off for more than five years.\n\nRoberts' most famous singles angle came in WCCW in 1983, and involved the invention of what the Freebirds referred to as \"Freebird Hair Removal Cream\". The angle culminated in a hair match between Roberts and Iceman Parsons on June 17. Roberts seemingly won the match via tight-pulling, but the decision was reversed and the match restarted. In the fracas, Roberts' head was lathered in the hair removal cream. At subsequent events, Roberts wore a wig, kept in place by boxing headgear.\n\nIn 1984, Roberts and the Freebirds had a short stint in the World Wrestling Federation, mainly competing in six-man tag matches. Here, they were managed by Cyndi Lauper's manager, David Wolff. They left the promotion when WWF officials stated their intention to split the team up. At the AWA's SuperClash in 1985, Roberts helped Hayes and Gordy defeat The Road Warriors for the AWA World Tag Team Championship, but the decision was later reversed.\n\nIn early 1986, The Freebirds went to the Universal Wrestling Federation, where Roberts won the UWF Television Championship on September 28. He lost it to Savannah Jack on November 9.\n\nIn 1987, The Freebirds split up and reformed. Roberts and Gordy turned on Hayes and teamed with Iceman Parsons to feud with Hayes and the Von Erichs. Gordy eventually left Roberts to rejoin Hayes. The feud ended in late 1988 when Hayes and Gordy left for the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions, and Roberts acted as a manager to the Samoan Swat Team before he retired from wrestling. Roberts also had a short feud with World Class referee David Manning, which included several gimmick matches, such as Roberts wrestling with one arm tied behind his back. Manning, who was touted as an accomplished amateur wrestler by the promotion to compensate for the obvious size difference between the two, won most of the matches on a fluke.\n\nRoberts managed Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in one match against Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on September 5, 1990. He came out of retirement on April 2, 1993 for the Global Wrestling Federation's Kerry Von Erich Memorial Show, and teamed with Michael Hayes (with Skandor Akbar in their corner), losing to Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams (with Fritz Von Erich in their corner).\n\nRoberts later developed throat cancer, and had surgery to treat it. He was quoted as saying \"Don't smoke. I think the reason this happened to me is because I was smoking too much. I recommend to anyone who smokes to quit now. It is hard, but it is worth it.\"\n\nRoberts died on November 26, 2012, at the age of 65, of pneumonia.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Roberts was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame by his son, Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts Jr. as part of The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\n\n"}

It also provided conference and market research services to a wide variety of industries. Chilton grew from a small publisher of a single magazine to a leading publisher of business-to-business magazines, consumer and professional automotive manuals, craft and hobby books, and a large, well-known marketing research company.\n\nIn the early years, its flagship magazine was \"Iron Age\". In 1955, Chilton's profit reached $1 million for the first time, of which \"Iron Age\" accounted for $750,000. By 1980, \"Iron Age\"'s revenue and status had declined due to the reduction in the size of the US metalworking manufacturing industry, and \"Jewelers Circular Keystone\" captured the position of Chilton's most profitable magazine. While Chilton had leading magazines in several different industries, the Chilton name is most strongly associated with the consumer and professional automotive manuals, which Cengage Learning continues to license or publish.\n\nThe company's origins go back to July 1896, and the first issue of \"Cycle Trade Journal\", edited by James Artman who became the first president of the future Chilton Company. In 1899 the magazine changed its name to \"Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal\". A 1900 magazine masthead listed Musselman & Buzby as the exclusive advertising representatives for \"Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal\". In 1900 George Buzby, C. A. Musselman, and James Artman merged their companies to form the \"Trade Advertising & Publishing Co\". The new company expanded into automotive catalogs, booklets, circulars, and posters.\n\nThe company selected the name \"Chilton\" from the Mayflowers passenger list. The earliest known use of the corporate name \"Chilton Company\" was in 1904. It appears on a corporate seal that reads \"Chilton Company of Pennsylvania, incorporated March 31, 1904.\" In 1907, the three partners purchased a printing company that they renamed the \"Chilton Printing Company\", only publicly adopting the name \"Chilton Company\" in 1910.\n\nIn March 1911, Chilton published the first issue of \"Commercial Car Journal\". In February 1912, they renamed the original \"Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal\" to \"Automobile Trade Journal\", and eventually merged it into Motor Age magazine.\n\nIn 1923, the partners sold Chilton to United Publishers Corp of New York for $1,635,000, and Artman and Buzby retired. In the same year, Chilton opened a new printing plant at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. This location became the Chilton Company corporate headquarters in the late 1940s.\n\nShortly after the purchase, United Publishers merged their Class Journal subsidiary and Chilton into what became known as the \"Chilton Class Journal Co\", with C. A. Musselman as its president. This merger brought several future flagship magazines (such as Iron Age, Motor Age, Dry Goods Economist, Jewelers Circular, Hardware Age, and Automotive Industries) into the Chilton stable of magazines.\n\nIn 1934, the company underwent a complete reorganization. J. Howard Pew provided an infusion of cash that saved the company from bankruptcy, in exchange for a majority of the stock. All subsidiaries merged into one company and incorporated in the state of Delaware as \"Chilton Company\". While the cash infusion from J. Howard Pew saved the company, it became the single biggest inhibitor to its growth, as Pew did not permit Chilton to seek outside funding for acquisitions. As a result, Chilton Company's growth over the next thirty years lagged behind competitors like McGraw Hill and Penton.\n\nGeorge Buzby's son G. C. (Carroll) Buzby became president of Chilton in the early 1950s and remained the Chief Executive Officer until he retired in the late 1960s. George C. Buzby died of cancer in 1970.\n\nIn 1979, the American Broadcasting Company purchased the Chilton Company and made it an operating unit of ABC Publishing. In 1985, Capital Cities purchased ABC, and in 1996 the Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC. Over-extended financially by its acquisition of Capital Cities ABC, Disney had to sell assets to reduce its debt—and Chilton, despite its status and recognition as an excellent business-to-business magazine publisher, was not considered a core business. Disney therefore decided to split up and sell the Chilton Company profit centers to multiple buyers:\n\nIn 2001, Nichols sold the do-it-yourself automotive print manuals to Haynes Publishing Group (publishers of Haynes Manuals), while retaining licensing rights to the Chilton do-it-yourself brand for print products for 10 years.\n\nIn 2003, Nichols sold the remaining automotive assets to Thomson Learning. In 2007 Thomson Learning became Cengage Learning. In 2011, Cengage Learning became owner of the Chilton brand for do-it-yourself print manuals as well. Cengage Learning continues to publish or license the professional and consumer automotive products and assets.\n\nAfter acquisition by United Publishers in 1923, the corporate office moved to New York City. In 1955, all former United Publishers magazines and their staffs relocated from New York City to the corporate headquarters at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. In 1968 Chilton moved their corporate offices to Decker Square in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. This served as temporary headquarters until 1972 when Chilton moved into its new corporate headquarters building in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\n\nChilton currently publishes hundreds of automobile repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Here are some of the manufacturers covered in the Chilton do-it-yourself library:\n\n\n\nAfter many years of publishing business-to-business magazines and automotive manuals, Chilton acquired the trade publisher Greenberg: Publisher in 1958. Chilton published the celebrated science fiction novels \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert (1965), and \"The Witches of Karres\" (1966) by James H. Schmitz. Each was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in its respective year, and \"Dune\" won the award. \"Dune\" became the first of a series of six novels by Frank Herbert, which were followed by many books, mostly prequels, by his son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson, an unrelated but experienced author. Of these books, Chilton only published the first.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32251958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32251958", "title": "Cyprianus", "text": "Cyprianus\n\nCyprianus is a name given in Scandinavian traditions of folk magic to the \"black book\" (\"Svarteboken\"): a grimoire or manuscript collection of spells; and by extension to the magical tradition that these spells form a part of. There is no standard text called \"Cyprianus\"; it was a general label given to a collection of spells. \n\nManuscripts called or referring to Cyprianus had a dark reputation; in some versions, you obtained the text by renouncing your baptism and devoting yourself to Satan. The common people's opinion of the book was that it was a standard grimoire concerned with the summoning of demons and spirits. Ministers were often thought to have obtained it through their studies at university; it is not coincidence that ministers' wives often functioned as folk healers in rural communities. Like many such texts, it is bound to its owner and hard to get rid of; it will not burn nor be destroyed by water, and attempting to discard it will only result in its supernatural return. These compilations nevertheless were widely circulated among the cunning folk of Scandinavia, who in a rural land with few physicians were the folk healers sought out by ordinary people beset by injury or illness.\n\n\"Cyprianus\" is the name frequently given to the compiler or author of the spells contained in the tradition. A variety of stories are told concerning the identity of this Cyprianus.\n\nSaint Cyprian of Antioch was a bishop and martyr in early Christianity. In the Middle Ages, a variety of legends attached to his name, including a tradition that he practiced magic before his conversion, and as such was the author of a magical textbook. In another medieval tradition, Cyprianus was a sorcerer who sought to seduce St. Justina, but was foiled and converted when she made the sign of the cross and he followed suit, freeing himself from the power of the devil. The sorcerer and the historical bishop were likely conflated in later legend. The \"Black Books of Elverum\" claim to be a summary of a \"Cyprianus\" by a \"Bishop Johannes Sell\" from Oxford, England in 1682. The British bishop John Fell may be the person who is meant here; Fell did publish an edition of the works of St. Cyprian. \n\nThe actual stories told of Cyprianus in Scandinavia often made no reference to St. Cyprian. Some made Cyprianus into a typical Faust figure; some said that Cyprianus was a wicked Norwegian or Dane who learned magic through his dealings with the Devil; one version makes Cyprianus so evil that the Devil threw him out of Hell; Cyprianus wrote the text to have his revenge. A different and strongly contradictory version explains that Cyprianus was a student who discovered he was attending a diabolical \"black school\", and wrote the text to explain how to undo all the witchcraft he learned there. \n\nAn anachronistic tale told in the printed Danish spell collection \"Oldtidens Sortebog\" (\"Old Time Magic Book\") makes Cyprianus to have been a pious and beautiful Mexican nun from the fourteenth century. In a gothic tale, \"Oldtidens Sortebog\" has Cyprianus cast into a dungeon in 1351. While imprisoned in the dungeon, Cyprianus rends her clothing and commits her magical knowledge to the rags, written in her own blood. Her text was then found in an old castle.\n\nThe spells in the Cyprianus tradition are typical Germanic folk magic: a mixed bag of folk remedies, prayers, and actual magic. They resemble the spells of the German language \"braucherei\", \"pow-wow\", and \"The Long Lost Friend\" traditions. One typical spell to heal a sprained ankle went:\n\nThe methods of contagion and transference are in use here; a sacred personage in an apocryphal story is confronted with a problem similar to that faced by the actual sufferer, who avails himself of their supernatural aid.\n\nAn important aspect of the magical tradition was the performance of divination, often by pouring molten lead through a hole in a piece of flatbread into cold water, a practice called \"støyping\". Lead scraped from the windows of churches was often used for this purpose. This was done to divine the cause of rickets, which was often thought to be the result of a changeling, a \"huldrabarn\" or \"bytting\", left in the place of a healthy child by the malicious \"huldra-folk\". The diviner in this ritual was called a \"signekjerring\", a \"blessing crone\".\n\nThe Inexperienced Use of the Black Book is a motif in Scandinavian folklore. In such legends, a servant, maid or someone else unexpectedly happens to find and read the Black Book, thus summoning the devil, while the owner, often a clergyman, is away. The only way to save oneself is to give the devil a task that he can’t solve: to empty a fjord, to untie all knots in a fishing net, to twist a rope of sand, to row against the wind with a boat filled with empty buckets, etc.. The devil is then kept busy until the expert or the owner of the book returns and exorcises the devil away. It is given an ML (Migratory Legend) number of 3020 and is related to Aarne-Thompson type 325, \"Apprentice and Ghost\" and type 565, \"The Magic Mill\".\n\n\n"}

The work of an Estonian company known as Rove Digital, the malware infected computers by modifying a computer's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers, which then injected its own advertising into Web pages. At its peak, DNSChanger was estimated to have infected over four million computers, bringing in at least US$14 million in profits to its operator from fraudulent advertising revenue.\n\nBoth Windows and Mac OS X variants of DNSChanger were circulated, the latter taking the form of a related Trojan known as RSPlug. The FBI raided the malicious servers on November 8, 2011, but they kept the servers up after they captured it to avoid affected users from losing internet access until July 9, 2012.\n\nDNSChanger was distributed as a drive-by download claiming to be a video codec needed to view content on a Web site, particularly appearing on rogue pornography sites. Once installed, the malware then modified the system's Domain Name System (DNS) configuration, pointing them to rogue name servers operated through affiliates of Rove Digital. These rogue name servers primarily substituted advertising on Web pages with advertising sold by Rove. Additionally, the rogue DNS server redirected links to certain Web sites to those of advertisers, such as for example, redirecting the IRS Web site to that of a tax preparation company. The effects of DNSChanger could also spread itself to other computers within a LAN by mimicking a DHCP server, pointing other computers toward the rogue DNS servers. In its indictment against Rove, the United States Department of Justice also reported that the rogue servers had blocked access to update servers for antivirus software.\n\nOn October 1, 2011, as part of \"Operation Ghost Click\" (a collaborative investigation into the operation), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced charges against six Estonian nationals and one Russian national connected to DNSChanger and Rove Digital for wire fraud, computer intrusion, and conspiracy. Arrests were made by Estonian authorities, and servers connected to the malware located in the United States were seized by the FBI. \n\nDue to concerns by FBI agents that users still infected by DNSChanger could lose Internet access if the rogue DNS servers were shut down entirely, a temporary court order was obtained to allow the Internet Systems Consortium to operate replacement servers, which would serve DNS requests from those who had not yet removed the infection, and to collect information on those still infected in order to promptly notify them about the presence of the malware. While the court order was set to expire on March 8, 2012, an extension was granted until July 9, 2012 due to concerns that there were still many infected computers. F-Secure estimated on July 4, 2012 that at least 300,000 computers were still infected with the DNSChanger malware, 70,000 of which were located in the United States. The interim DNS servers were officially shut down by the FBI on July 9, 2012.\n\nImpact from the shutdown was considered to be minimal, due in part to major Internet service providers providing temporary DNS services of their own and support to customers affected by DNSChanger. and informational campaigns surrounding the malware and the impending shutdown. These included online tools that could check for the presence of DNSChanger, while Google and Facebook provided notifications to visitors of their respective services who were still affected by the malware. By July 9, 2012, F-Secure estimated that the number of remaining DNSChanger infections in the U.S. had dropped from 70,000 to 42,000.\n\n"}

{"id": "1597743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1597743", "title": "Ephebiphobia", "text": "Ephebiphobia\n\nEphebiphobia is the fear of youth. First coined as the \"fear or loathing of teenagers\", today the phenomenon is recognized as the \"inaccurate, exaggerated and sensational characterization of young people\" in a range of settings around the world. Studies of the fear of youth occur in sociology and youth studies.\n\nThe word \"ephebiphobia\" is formed from the Greek \"éphēbos\", meaning \"youth\" or \"adolescent\" and \"phóbos\", meaning \"fear\" or \"phobia\". The coinage of this term is attributed to a 1994 article by Kirk Astroth published in \"Phi Delta Kappan\". Today, common usage occurs internationally by sociologists, government agencies, and youth advocacy organizations that define ephebiphobia as an abnormal or irrational and persistent fear or loathing of teenagers or adolescence.\n\nThe term paedophobia has gained popular acceptance in Europe to describe the aforementioned \"fear of youth\". Pediaphobia is the fear of infants and children. \"Hebephobia\" (from the Greek , \"hḗbē\", \"youth, puberty\") has also been proposed. Similar terms include adultism, which is a predisposition towards adults that is biased against children and youth, and ageism, which describes discrimination against any person because of their age.\n\nThe fear of youth, along with fear of street culture and the fear of crime, is said to have been in Western culture for \"time immemorial\". Machiavelli is said to have realized that a fear of youth is what kept the city of Florence from keeping a standing army. Ancient Venice and ancient Greece are also said to have had floundering public policy because of their fear of youth.\n\nEarly American Puritanism has been seen as reliant on a fear of youth, who were seen as embodying adventure and enlightenment, and therefore were viewed as susceptible to \"decadent morality\". During the Industrial Revolution, Western European and North American popular media was particularly driven to propagate the fear of children and youth in order to further the industrialization of schooling, and eventually to remove young people from the workplace when their labor became unnecessary due to mechanization and the influx of new labor.\n\nPost-World War II France was said to have been stricken by concern for \"mal de jeunesse\" when they created policies that reflected their fear of youth. \"Send them to summer camps, place others in reformatories, the rest should have some fresh air, build some athletic fields...\". were the intentions of youth policies in that era. Following World War II the United States military identified the growing number of youth in the Deep South as a problematic scenario for national security. Analysts have suggested the upswing in the popular culture's fear of youth may be attributed to defense policies created in response to that threat.\n\n\"In the 1990s public fear of adolescents mounted\", caused by the \"increased youth access to handguns, the syndicatization of territorial youth gangs into illegal drug cartels, racist stereotyping of urban youth, academic and political pandering, media frenzy, and a spate of high-profile school shootings of students by their fellow students\". The \"Seattle Weekly\" specifically cited the fear of youth as the driving factor behind Seattle, Washington's now-defunct Teen Dance Ordinance. The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the Anti-Social Behaviour Order in 1998, which has also been attributed directly to a fear of youth.\n\nMedia, marketers, politicians, youth workers and researchers have been implicated in perpetuating the fear of youth. Since young people in developed countries are expected to stay out of the workforce, any role for them outside that of consumer is potentially threatening to adults. Selling safety to parents and teachers has also been a driving force, as home security systems, cellphones, and computer surveillance usage is marketed to parents; and x-ray machines, metal detectors and closed-circuit television are increasingly sold to schools on the premise that young people are not to be trusted. These steps are in spite of the fact that experience consistently shows that monitoring youth does little to prevent violence or tragedy: the Columbine High School massacre occurred in a building with video surveillance and in-building police.\n\nThe very creation of the terms youth, adolescence and teenager have all been attributed to the fear of youth. As the western world became more industrialized, young people were increasingly driven from the workforce, including involuntary and voluntary positions, and into increasingly total institutions where they lost personal autonomy in favor of social control. Government policies outside of schools have been implicated as well, as over the last forty years curfews, anti-loitering and anti-cruising laws, and other legislation apparently targeted at teenagers have taken hold across the country. Courts have increasingly ruled against youth rights, as well. Before the 1940s \"teenagers\" were not listed in newspaper headlines, because as a group they did not exist. The impact of youth since World War II on western society has been immense, largely driven by marketing that proponents them as the \"Other\". In turn, youth are caused to behave in ways that appear different from adults. This has led to the phenomenon of youth, and in turn has created a perpetuated fear of them.\n\nThe fear of youth is thought to exist throughout the entire Western world. Sociologist Ray Oldenburg has attributed the generation gap and the \"increasing segregation of youth from adults in American society\" to \"adult estrangement and fear of youth\". \n\nAt least one major economist has proposed that the fear of youth can have grave effects on the economic health of nations. A growing number of researchers report that the fear of youth affects the health of democracy, reporting that the consequential vilification of youth has in the past, and continues to presently undermine public, social, political, religious, and cultural participation among current and future generations.\n\nAs it affects young people themselves, ephebiphobia has been recognized as a barrier towards successful academic achievement, a barrier to successful social intervention programs, and as an indicator of the ineptitude of many adults to be successful parents.\n\n\"Today citizens as a whole as well as people who work with children live in fear of youth in our homes and schools and on our streets\". While \"society loves their attractive bodies, youthfulness and commercial firepower\", we also \"vilify adolescents as a noncontributing drain on the economy and our democracy\". In the mainstream media, young people are most often portrayed as self-absorbed and apathetic, uninterested in the common good or in advancing social goals.\n\nMany social programs and social critics view the fear of youth as a condemning force against youth throughout society, particularly when coupled with racism. Poet Gwendolyn Brooks was applauded for her consciousness-raising work around the fear of youth, particularly young African-Americans. Popular contemporary beliefs about adolescents are different from historical narratives; in the past youth were portrayed as \"the future\" and the \"leaders of tomorrow\"; today they are seen as \"a source of worry, not potential,\" contributing to a fear of adolescents, especially racial and ethnic minorities. In turn this racist and adultist perspective informs urban law enforcement, public schools, and social services. Sociologists have suggested that much of the current spread of the fear of youth is due to \"adult anxiety over the shifting racial mix in the general population\". The effects of sexism are similarly reported to be amplified by ephebiphobia. However, New York University professor Pedro Noguera has suggested that the fear of youth extends beyond color boundaries, as \"skateboarders, punks, even straight-laced suburban teenagers can evoke anxiety among adults by congregating in large numbers in places deemed off-limits to youth\".\n\nThe ability of youth to participate throughout society is seen as compromised because of the fear of youth, and is often disguised as a paternalism or protectionism among adults. Additionally, scholar Henry Jenkins, \"links criticism of new media with fear of adolescents, who are the most eager adopters. Teen culture seems meaningless and dangerous without an appreciation of its context\".\n\nAcademics specifically acknowledge the force of ephebiphobia in the commercial sector, where this fear of youth has been extensively exploited for financial gain. This is elaborated on by researchers and social critics who claim that popular media, including cinema and television, specifically exacerbated society's fear of youth for financial gain, as one study reports, \"Extreme fear of youth is an established media panic\".\n\nPulp novels in the 1950s were mass-produced to specifically cash in on the growing fear of youth that was spreading throughout society. Ironically, it has also been said that popular media's effects on young people are not as powerful as the fear of youth, which drives the fear of technology and in turn perpetuates the fear of youth.\n\nDecision-making by government agencies, including public schools, policing and courts, have been found to be driven by the fear of youth. The fear of adolescents has been said to cause a disjunction between what is said about the value of young people and what is done to them in education and social services, and causes them to be seen, \"primarily as threats—to persons, to institutions, to status quo\". A number of observers have indicated the deliberate perpetuation of mass social ephebiphobia in order to elicit particular public and social responses. American sociologist Mike Males has identified trends among politicians and policy-makers of stoking the fear of youth among society in order to make headway in political campaigns and build popular support for otherwise \"generate media sensation and public fear\". Similarly, the fear of youth has been identified as the driving factor behind many governmental programs designed to combat so-called \"youth violence,\" in which the actions of few youth are attributed to the population of youth in general. In a specific instance, \"In Dallas, fear of youth led to accelerated surveillance and policing, particularly in its poorest area, Gaston\". The fear of adolescents is also said to have caused many governments to lower their age of criminal responsibility and escalate the detention of young people from childhood through adulthood.\n\nExamining the Black Power movement of the 1970s, one researcher wrote, \"The common adult dislike and fear of youth is compounded by the teacher's fear—fear of losing control in the classroom, fear of losing one's authority\". A specific increase in the fear of youth in schools following the Columbine High School massacre of 1999 is seen as a particular cause in evidence suggesting an overall decrease in student engagement throughout high schools today. Fear of youth has led to the development of zero tolerance policies in many schools, which in turn is attributed as the cause of the increase in arrests for juvenile crime on school campuses, which has promoted the fear of youth and led school administrators to call police for infractions once dealt with internally.\n\nThe American Library Association has developed a resource collection for librarians specifically to combat the ephebiphobia by promoting customer service skills specific to youth. However, sociologist Mike Males has suggested that ephebiphobia does not analyze the problem deep enough, as the fear of adult stereotype of adolescence, or kourophobia, is the core challenge facing young people today.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "438752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438752", "title": "HMAS Onslow", "text": "HMAS Onslow\n\nHMAS \"Onslow\" (SS 60/SSG 60) was one of six s operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The submarine was named after the town of Onslow, Western Australia, and Sir Alexander Onslow, with the boat's motto and badge derived from Onslow's family heritage. Ordered in 1963, \"Onslow\" was laid down at the end of 1967 by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Scotland, launched almost a year later, and commissioned into the RAN at the end of 1968.\n\nAlthough never involved in war, three major incidents occurred during \"Onslow\"s career. The first occurred in 1972, when a disgruntled sailor who disobeyed orders caused the submarine to dive to almost twice her safe operating depth. As a result, the RAN changed the Submarine Service from being able to \"conscript\" any sailor for submarine service to volunteer only. The second happened in 1981, when carbon monoxide fumes from one of the diesel generators filled the submarine, resulting in the death of one sailor. Although changes were made to submarine operating procedures, the boat's company was not provided with any psychological counselling, and the incident report remained classified until 2009. The third was a controversial line-crossing ceremony in 1995, which resulted in restrictions being placed on similar ceremonies aboard RAN vessels. During her career, \"Onslow\" became the first conventionally powered submarine to be fitted with anti-ship missiles, and was successful in wargames: \"sinking\" a seven-ship flotilla during Exercise Kangaroo 3 in 1980, and the United States supercarrier at RIMPAC 1998.\n\n\"Onslow\" was decommissioned in 1999, and was presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum, where she is preserved as a museum ship.\n\n\"Onslow\" was one of four \"Oberon\"-class submarines ordered in 1963. The last of this group, \"Onslow\" was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. in Greenock, Scotland on 4 December 1967. She was launched by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy on 3 December 1968, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 December 1969. The boat was named after the coastal town of Onslow, Western Australia, which was in turn named after Sir Alexander Onslow, the third Chief Justice of Western Australia. \"Onslow\"s motto, \"Festina Lente\" (Latin for \"Hasten Slowly\"), is shared with the Onslow family, and the ship's badge contains a judge's wig. Although this was the only use of the name by the RAN, two surface ships of the Royal Navy have previously been named .\nThe submarine is long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, \"Onslow\" displaces 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts are each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these is generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. These could propel the submarine at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged. \"Onslow\" had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.\n\nUnlike other submarines in her class, \"Onslow\" was fitted with a four-man diver access hatch, allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.\n\nThe main armament of \"Onslow\" was six bow torpedo tubes, capable of firing torpedoes or releasing sea mines. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. During a refit from 1982 to 1984, \"Oberon\" became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with anti-ship missiles; specifically the UGM-84 Sub Harpoon. At the same time, the Mark 23 torpedoes were replaced by the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. As of 1996, the standard payload of \"Onslow\" was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.\n\nThe submarine's secondary armament consisted of two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes: these were intended for use against pursuing submarines, but the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes shortly after the boat entered service made these redundant, and they were closed off during the 1982-84 refit. The aft tubes fired Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes.\n\n\"Onslow\" arrived in Sydney at the conclusion of her delivery voyage to Australia on 4 July 1970. On board was Vice Admiral Sir Victor Smith, at the time the Chief of Naval Staff, who had embarked at Brisbane. The boat visited Pearl Harbor later that year; arriving without being detected by the USN until she surfaced in the middle of the harbour. \"Onslow\" returned to Pearl Harbor in 1971 to participate in the RIMPAC multinational naval exercise. During the exercise, a practice torpedo fired by the United States Coast Guard Cutter failed to disengage as designed and hit the submarine—the only damage was a small dent near the stern.\n\nIn 1972, the first major incident of \"Onslow\"s career occurred. The submarine was performing dive tests off the continental shelf outside Sydney Heads. One of the boat's company, transferred to the RAN Submarine Service against his will, refused to obey an order to close the valve on forward ballast tank, causing it to overfill with seawater and forcing the submarine into a steep crash dive. The dive took \"Onslow\" to a depth of , well beyond the safe operating depth of the , before another sailor was able to close the valve. Seven tons of water had been taken on by the ballast tank, and with not enough compressed air available to completely empty the tank and allow the submarine to rise, \"Onslow\"s company had to rely on the submarine's twin propeller screws to help make it to the surface. The sailor responsible for the incident was beaten by his comrades and removed from the submarine in a straitjacket upon the boat's return to submarine base . This incident led the RAN to change submarine service to volunteers only.\n\n\"Onslow\" became the first vessel of the RAN to be assigned to the ANZUK force in Singapore on 22 July 1972. During another ANZUK deployment, in 1974, the boat's attack periscope was damaged when it came in contact with the log probe of the frigate . The boat returned to Australia on 18 December. On 5 May 1975, \"Onslow\" began a two-year refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, becoming the first Australian submarine to use the dockyard's new slave dock. This dock had been built specifically for refit work on \"Oberon\"-class submarines, and was the main location of all \"Onslow\"s refits until 1990. In 1977, \"Onslow\" was presented with the Gloucester Cup, marking her as the most efficient warship in the RAN during the previous year—\"Onslow\" was the first submarine to receive the award.\nIn 1980, \"Onslow\" participated in Exercise Kangaroo 3 as an opposing submarine. During the exercise, \"Onslow\" carried out successful simulated attacks on all seven surface ships involved in the exercise without being 'sunk' herself, including a simultaneous 'attack' on two United States Navy (USN) amphibious warfare vessels and a RAN replenishment ship while they were under escort by the other four warships. To indicate her success, the submarine flew a Jolly Roger from her communications mast upon her return to port, which was marked with the silhouettes of her seven targets: the s and , the , the , the , the , and the .\n\nThe second major incident of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when \"Onslow\" was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate off the coast of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. \"Onslow\" rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.\n\nThe RAN Board of Inquiry into the incident concluded that the accident was caused by human error—the duty engineer failed to shut down both engines—but members of \"Onslow\"s complement disagree with this, claiming the problem to be mechanical in origin. Changes were made to Submarine Service operating procedures as a result of the Inquiry, but the investigation and subsequent report remained classified until 2009, when the information was acquired by the \"Sunday Night\" newsmagazine program under the Freedom of Information Act. When interviewed by \"Sunday Night\" in March 2009, the deputy Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas (who had been Passlow's divisional officer prior to the incident) promised counselling for the survivors, and claimed that prior treatment of the \"Onslow\" submariners was due to a limited understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder back in the 1980s.\n\n\"Onslow\" underwent a modernisation refit from 1982 until 1984; becoming the third Australian \"Oberon\" to be modernised. As part of the modernisation, integrated data processing and fire control systems were installed, and the boat was fitted with Micropuffs passive ranging sonar. The torpedo payload was upgraded to the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. In addition to new torpedoes, the modernisation allowed \"Oberon\"-class submarines to carry and fire the Harpoon anti-ship missile through the torpedo tubes: \"Onslow\" became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with guided anti-ship missiles.\n\"Onslow\" was the first Australian submarine to visit the west coast of the United States of America when she arrived in San Diego on 17 July 1985. The boat made goodwill visits to the cities of San Francisco and Seattle during mid-August, before participating in the Royal Fleet Review for the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\n\"Onslow\"s \"safe to dive\" certificate ran out just after Christmas 1989. The Australian government had been trialling a program whereby refit work was tendered out to the private sector; delays in selecting the winning company and allocating the funds meant that an 18-month refit of the submarine scheduled to begin at the start of 1990 did not commence on time. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was awarded the $100 million refit contract for \"Onslow\" and sister submarine in July. Cockatoo Island's slave dock was transferred to the ADI facilities at Garden Island in November 1990, and was used for the refit. It was later found, during arbitration between the Australian Government and Cockatoo Island Dockyard for various issues, that by tendering out the submarine refits to other companies, the government was in breach of contract with the Dockyard; A$17.3 million in compensation was awarded to the dockyard in August 1996 for loss of profits and overhead costs.\n\nIn the early 1990s, four of \"Onslow\"s sister boats were decommissioned from service. By 1996, \"Onslow\" and \"Otama\" were the only members of the class in active service.\n\nDuring 1995, \"Onslow\" was deployed to South East Asia. During this deployment, the personnel of \"Onslow\" were involved in a controversial line-crossing ceremony while operating near the equator. During this particular ceremony, normally intended to induct new sailors into the 'court of King Neptune', the victims were verbally and physically abused, had their pelvises and genitals covered in what was described as a \"blistering concoction\", then thrown overboard and forced to stay there until the rest of the company permitted them on board. When one of the victimised sailors complained to superiors, he became subject to several administrative errors and inconveniences, to the point where he was forced to resign a year later. The sailor acquired a copy of a videotape made of the ceremony and presented it to the Nine Network, which broke the story on 6 July 1999. An inquiry into the incident aboard \"Onslow\" was held, which found that although guidelines had been developed in the years after the incident to prevent harassment in the Australian Defence Force, disciplinary charges against the sailors involved could not be laid, as more than three years had passed since the offence. The inquiry also stated that while line-crossing ceremonies would continue to be held aboard RAN vessels, they would be supervised by a non-involved member of the crew to prevent similar extreme situations developing. The deployment ended in December, with \"Onslow\" visiting her namesake town for the last time on her return to Australia.\n\nOn the evening of 16 April 1997, three Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldiers were injured when they were thrown from their Zodiac boat during launch and recovery exercises with the submarine. Later that year, in November, \"Onslow\" participated in a joint RAN-RAAF exercise off the coast of Western Australia. Over the end of 1997 and the start of 1998, \"Onslow\" and \"Otama\" were used for trials of the Australian-designed Narama towed array sonar. The Narama sonar was one of the towed arrays under consideration for incorporation with the under-development s, and was the array selected.\nIn mid-1998, the date of \"Onslow\"s decommissioning was announced for early 1999. Representatives from the town of Onslow, Western Australia requested that the submarine visit her namesake town before decommissioning, but were informed that the submarine's planned operational schedule could not accommodate such a visit. As part of this schedule, \"Onslow\" participated in the 1998 RIMPAC exercise. The submarine had to pull out of the early part of the exercise: a resistor in the motor room switchboard had begun to smoke, forcing \"Onslow\" to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. She departed on 12 July, but was forced to return less than 24 hours later when a smouldering smell was noticed. The boat's luck changed during the latter part of RIMPAC 98, when on the morning of 10 August, \"Onslow\" located the 'enemy' , closed to within without being detected, then released green flares to indicate her location, 'sinking' the supercarrier. From 7 November onwards, \"Onslow\" was used as the target submarine for the annual Fincastle competition. \"Onslow\" operated on a secret patrol course south of Kangaroo Island while aircraft from the competing Australian, British, Canadian, and New Zealand air forces attempted to locate and 'sink' her. No. 5 Squadron RNZAF was declared the winner, although all teams were successful in locating the submarine during at least one of their three attempts.\n\n\"Onslow\" was decommissioned from service on 30 March 1999. While in service, \"Onslow\" travelled . On the same day, sister boat \"Otama\" was permanently reassigned to the submarine base at in Western Australia, clearing the way for the closure of .\n\nThe submarine was gifted to the Australian National Maritime Museum in April 1999. On 3 May 1999, the submarine was towed from \"Platypus\" to the museum at Darling Harbour. \"Onslow\" was docked next to , another warship belonging to the museum, and was officially opened to the public on 1 June 1999. \"Onslow\" is the second RAN submarine to be preserved as a museum ship; the first was sister submarine , which was decommissioned at the end of 1998 and installed at the Western Australian Maritime Museum. As of 2004, she is one of seven \"Oberon\"-class submarines preserved in this manner.\n\nOn 22 November 2002, \"Onslow\" was taken by tugs to Garden Island for three weeks of maintenance in drydock. This included cleaning and repainting of the hull, replacement of the tributyltin coating used to prevent biofouling with a coating that was not harmful to marine organisms, and the sealing of several ballast tanks to improve the boat's stability and raise the aft section relative to the waterline. \"Onslow\" was returned to the museum on 11 December, and re-opened to the public three days later. In October and November 2008, \"Onslow\" returned to Garden Island for maintenance and upkeep. During this refit, an additional torpedo was loaded into the submarine's torpedo tubes and her hull was cleaned and painted. Another docking occurred on 18 May 2012, with hull cleaning, rust removal, repainting, and repairs to the boat's aft torpedo tubes done before she returned to display on 6 June. In November 2015, the submarine was moved to the new Warships Pavilion 'Action Stations' at the Australian National Maritime Museum alongside HMAS Vampire (D11) and HMAS Advance. In February 2018 Onslow was towed from the museum to Garden Island, Sydney for regular maintenance in dry dock. \n\n\n\n\n"}

In November 1942, he returned to Japan and he entered Rissho University with the objective of becoming a monk.\n\nOkazaki became a member of ultra-nationalist group Kinno Makotomusubi. With his own money, he built a house in Meguro, Tokyo. He discussed the news of Japanese reverses in the war with his friends. He suggested that the ruling military Hideki Tojo Cabinet be overthrown.\n\nThey tried to obtain weapons for this purpose. When the authorities became aware of the plot in July 1943, Okazaki was arrested. He was given two years of imprisonment with three years of suspension in September He was released from prison in November under the surveillance of Tokubetsu Koto Keisatsu (political police).\n\nAfter returning to Matsue, he was employed by the Government mobilization office. Because Okazaki sympathized with the families of soldiers, he was in frequent conflict with his superiors. He was ordered to select 75 women to work at the Kure Naval Arsenal, but realized that women of higher status were not part of the selection pool, and leaked this fact. He was forced to resign. He then became a member of Dai Nippon Genron Hokokukai, a right-wing party.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Okazaki entered the lumber business in Matsue City. He took care of those who had been imprisoned for the war. A right-wing organization, \"Seinen Kodotai\" (Young Pro-emperor organization) formed with him as its leader. In December 1956, the National Union (of right wing organizations) was formed with him as the leader of the Shimane Branch. The group never had more than a small following.

United States International Trade Commission\n\nJazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission, 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001), was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the law of repair and reconstruction (permitting the owner of a patented item to fix the item when it breaks, but not to essentially build a new item from the parts of an old one), holding that it was not a patent infringement for one party to restore another party's patented \"one-use\" camera to be used a second time.\n\nA company called Polytech Enterprise Limited acquired used disposable cameras which had been manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and sold by Fuji to consumers. Fuji owned several patents on the technology used in the cameras. Polytech refurbished the cameras through a process which included fitting the camera with new film, and in some instances with new flash batteries, repairing the camera case to exclude light following the film reloading operation, repackaging, and relabeling under the trademark of Jazz Photo Corp. The cameras were brought to China to be refurbished, and Jazz Photo then reimported them into the United States for sale.\n\nThe United States Customs Service intercepted two shipments of these cameras, and sought to prevent their entry into the United States on the grounds that they infringed Fuji's patents. Jazz Photo objected, asserting that the patents were not infringed because, rather than build new cameras incorporating the proprietary technology, Jazz Photo had simply purchased Fuji's own cameras and repaired them.\n\nThe Federal Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge Pauline Newman, concluded that Jazz Photo was correct. The court clarified the line between \"reconstruction\" - building a new copy of a patented invention - and permissible \"repair\".\n\nThe court indicated that \"[w]hile ownership of a patented article does not include the right to make a substantially new article, it does include the right to preserve the useful life of the original article.\" The opinion then recounted the common law history of repair-reconstruction law, before finally determining that Jazz Photo's actions amounted to repair. The court held that Jazz Photo had legally acquired patented inventions, and, rather than infringe on Fuji's patent by reverse engineering, manufacturing, and selling a new product, it opted to refurbish existing items to extend their useful lives.\n\nIn April 2014, the Federal Circuit \"sua sponte\" called for briefing and \"amicus curiae\" participation in an \"en banc\" consideration of whether \"Jazz Photo\" should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the \"Kirtsaeng\" case. The court ordered:\nIn light of \"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\", 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2012), should this court overrule \"Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission\", 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001), to the extent it ruled that a sale of a patented item outside the United States never gives rise to United States patent exhaustion.\nThe Federal Circuit, en banc, reaffirmed its holding from Jazz Photo in \"Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc.\"\n"}

In addition, there are instances of cross-dressing, and of androgyny which in post-1990s gender terminology has been grouped under the acronym LGBT.\n\nThese myths have been described as being crucially influential on Western LGBT literature, with the original myths being constantly re-published and re-written, and the relationships and characters serving as icons. In comparison, lesbianism is rarely found in classical myths.\n\nDionysus, a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form, has been dubbed \"a patron god of hermaphrodites and transvestites\" by Roberto C. Ferrari in the 2002 \"Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture\". Other gods are sometimes considered patrons of homosexual love between males, such as the love goddess Aphrodite and gods in her retinue, such as the Erotes: Eros, Himeros and Pothos. Eros is also part of a trinity of gods that played roles in homoerotic relationships, along with Heracles and Hermes, who bestowed qualities of Beauty (and Loyalty), strength, and eloquence, respectively, onto male lovers. In the poetry of Sappho, Aphrodite is identified as the patron of lesbians. \nThe sex-change theme also occurred in classical mythology. The reason for the transformation varies, as in the case of Sypretes (Συπρετεσ) or Siproites (Σιπροιτεσ), a hunter from Crete, who was transformed to a woman by Artemis after having seen the goddess bathing.\n\nThere was also a motif of a woman needing to disguise herself as a male and later being transformed into a biological male by mysterious forces (mainly the gods). In the cases of Iphis and Leucippus, the woman's mother was pressured (by her husband) to bear a male child so the protagonist was forced to impersonate a male from birth. Later in life, manhood was granted through the blessing of a deity (Juno/Hera in Iphis' case and Leto in Leucippus').\n\nCaeneus and Mestra, each of who was a mate of a god (Caeneus was a rape victim of Poseidon/Neptune and Mestra was a lover of Apollo), were granted manhood by the said god. Mestra, however, had the ability to change her shape voluntarily, instead of staying in male form like Caeneus and other instances above.\n\nTiresias, on the other hand, became female because he struck a couple of copulating snakes, displeasing Hera, who punished him by transforming Tiresias into a woman. Later the sentence was remitted, due to either trampling on the mating snakes or avoiding them, and she became male again. In another version, Tiresias' sex-change was caused by an argument between Zeus and Hera, on which they debated whether a male or a female had greater pleasure in sex, so they transformed him to a female to experiment.\n\n\nAphroditus was an androgynous Aphrodite from Cyprus, in later mythology became known as Hermaphroditus (also the namesake of the word \"hermaphrodite\") the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.\n\n"}

The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on Western art from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of Dutch Masters.\n\nVia the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.\n\nThe RKD also manages the Dutch version of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus, a thesaurus of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe collection was started through bequests by Frits Lugt, art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and Cornelis Hofstede de Groot (1863–1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (National Library).\nThough not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its metadata is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.\nIn the artist database \"RKDartists\", each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for Salvador Dalí is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.\n\nIn the images database \"RKDimages\", each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for The Night Watch is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.\n\nThe Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called \"The Night Watch\" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: \"algemene trefwoord\") can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.\n\nThe thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the iconclass database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.\n\n"}

{"id": "24192619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24192619", "title": "Polyethnicity", "text": "Polyethnicity\n\nPolyethnicity refers to the proximity of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, conquest and post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.\n\nMany, if not all, countries have some degree of polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.\n\nIn 1985, Canadian historian William H. McNeill gave a series of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.\n\nPolyethnicity divides nations, complicating the politics as local and national governments attempt to satisfy all ethnic groups. Many politicians in countries attempt to find the balance between ethnic identities within their country and the identity of the nation as a whole. Nationalism also plays a large part in these political debates, as cultural pluralism and consociationalism are the democratic alternatives to nationalism for the polyethnic state. The idea of nationalism being social instead of ethnic entails a variety of culture, a shared sense of identity and a community not based on descent. Culturally plural states vary constitutionally between a decentralized and unitary state (such as Great Britain) and a federal state (such as Belgium, Switzerland, or Canada). Ethnic parties in these polyethnic regions are not anti-state but instead seek maximum power within this state. Many polyethnic countries face this dilemma with their policy decisions. The following nations and regions are just a few specific examples of this dilemma and its effects:\n\nThe United States is a nation founded by different ethnicities frequently described as coming together in a \"melting pot,\" a term used to emphasize the degree to which constituent groups influence and are influenced by each other, or a \"salad bowl,\" a term more recently coined in contrast to the \"melting pot\" metaphor and emphasizing those groups' retention of fundamentally distinct identities despite their proximity to each other and their influence on the overall culture that all of those groups inhabit. A controversial political issue in recent years has been the question of bilingualism. Many immigrants have come from Hispanic America, who are native Spanish speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority in many areas of the Southwest. In New Mexico the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%. Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language. It has evolved into an ethnic conflict between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the official English movement. The United States does not have an official language, but English is the default national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.\n\nCanada has had many political debates between the French speakers and English speakers, particularly in the province of Quebec. Canada holds both French and English as official languages. The politics in Quebec are largely defined by nationalism as French Québécois wish to gain independence from Canada as a whole, based on ethnic and linguistic boundaries. The main separatist party, Parti Québécois, attempted to gain sovereignty twice (once in 1980 and again in 1995) and failed by a narrow margin of 1.2% in 1995. Since then, in order to remain united, Canada granted Quebec \"statut particulier\", recognizing Quebec as a nation within the united nation of Canada. Canada is often described as a cultural mosaic.\n\nThe divide between the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the parliamentary democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though an equal number of seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.\n\nEthiopia is a polyethnic nation consisting of 80 different ethnic groups and 84 indigenous languages. Due to the diverse population and rural areas throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution. Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue had come to the forefront of political debate. Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates. The Derg military government took control with a Marxist–Leninist ideology, urging self-determination and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues. In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the USSR broke apart, they lost their aid from the Soviet Union and the Derg government collapsed. Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a federal parliamentary republic. It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn. The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and democracy.\n\nIn Spain from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence took place amidst a multi-cultural Spain. Spain, at the time, was under the control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother. Because the nation was under the control of French rule, the Spanish formed coalitions of ethnic groups to reclaim their own political representation, instead of the current French political system in power.\n\nIn Southeast Asia the continental area (Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam) generally practices Theravada Buddhism. Most of insular Southeast Asia (namely Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia) practices mostly Sunni Islam. The rest of the insular region (Philippines and East Timor) practices mostly Roman Catholic Christianity and Singapore practises mostly Mahayana Buddhism. Significant long-distance labor migration that occurred during the late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity. Relations between the indigenous population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group. During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well. Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities and there has been a significant amount of unity throughout history. This differs from both nearby East and South Asia.\n\nPolyethnicity, over time, can change the way societies practice cultural norms.\n\nAn increase in intermarriage in the United States has led to the blurring of ethnic lines. Anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 and now it is estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 will be part of the polyethnic population. In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.\nWhile the number of interethnic marriages is on the rise, there are certain ethnic groups that have been found more likely to become polyethnic and recognize themselves with more than one ethnic background. Bhavani Arabandi states in his article on polyethnicity that:\nAsians and Latinos have much higher rates of interethnic marriages than do blacks, and they are more likely to report polyethnicity than blacks who more often claim a single ethnicity and racial identity. This is the case, the authors [Lee, J & Bean, F.D] argue, because blacks have a \"legacy of slavery,\" a history of discrimination, and have been victimized by the \"one drop rule\" (where having any black blood automatically labeled one as black) in the US.\n\nPresently, most armed forces are composed of people from different ethnic backgrounds. They are considered to be polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background. While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic armed forces are not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans. The U.S. Military was one of the first modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of President Truman in 1945.\n\nThere are also arguments against polyethnicity, as well as the assimilation of ethnicities in polyethnic regions. Wilmot Robertson in \"The Ethnostate\" and Dennis L. Thomson in \"The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia\", argue for some level of separatism.\n\nIn \"The Ethnostate\", Robertson declares polyethnicity as an ideal that only lessens each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region as a whole is less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.\n\nIn \"The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia\", Thomson points out the benefits in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, to live on the edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "304097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304097", "title": "Press release", "text": "Press release\n\nA press release, news release, media release, press statement or video release is a written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media for the purpose of announcing something ostensibly newsworthy. Typically, they are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to assignment editors and journalists at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, online media, television stations or television networks.\n\nTechnically, anything deliberately sent to a reporter or media source is considered a press release: it is information released by the act of being sent to the media. However, public relations professionals often follow a standard format that they believe is efficient and increases their odds of getting the publicity they desire. The format is supposed to help journalists separate press releases from other PR communication methods, such as pitch letters or media advisories. Generally, a PR body consists of 4 to 5 paragraphs with word limit ranging from 400 to 500. However, press releases can be anywhere from 300 to 800 words\n\nAs the internet has gained prevalence, the way journalists like to be approached has also changed. A format suggested by Kristen Nicole, a former Mashable writer who is now the Senior Managing Editor of SiliconANGLE.com. is sending one sentence as to why this story works for my publication, and 5 bullet points for context. Kristen also recommends pitching writers directly over pitching editors saying: \n\n\"I’d recommend pitching the writer first, with an angle specific to their beat. If a case needs to be made to the editor, it can fare better coming from the writer, who’s already had an opportunity to work out an angle with the PR rep. As an editor, I’m more likely to prioritize emails coming from those I have personal relationships with. These have been built over the years from the days when I was the writer presenting to my editors. Starting a new relationship with me as an editor, the most successful pitches have been those offering high profile interviews (editors that still write columns will want to take these for themselves before passing them off to junior writers) or highly specific content, like an original guest contribution.\"\nSome of these common structural elements include:\n\n\nAs the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the news cycle, press release writing styles have necessarily evolved. Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into more readable, print-ready copy.\n\nIn the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the newswires. The newswire then disseminates the information as it is received or as investigated by a journalist.\n\nAn alternative is the \"self-published press release\". In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local newspapers or to free and paid distribution services. The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually online.\n\nSome public relations firms send out video news releases (VNRs) which are pre-taped video programs that can be aired intact by TV stations. Often, the VNRs are aired without the stations' identifying or attributing them as such.\n\nTV news viewers can often detect the use of VNRs within television newscasts; for example, many movie-star \"interviews\" are actually VNRs, taped on a set which is located at the movie studio and decorated with the movie's logo. Another frequent example of VNRs masquerading as news footage is videotapes of particular medical \"breakthroughs,\" that are really produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of selling new medicines.\n\nVideo news releases can be in the form of full blown productions costing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. They can also be in the TV news format, or even produced for the web.\n\nRecently, many broadcast news outlets have discouraged the use of VNRs. Many stations, citing an already poor public perception, want to increase their credibility. Public relations companies are having a tougher time getting their pre-edited video aired.\n\nVNRs can be turned into podcasts then posted onto newswires. Further to this, a story can be kept running longer by engaging \"community websites\", which are monitored and commented on by many journalists and features writers.\n\nSometimes a press release is distributed early and embargoed – that is, news organizations are requested not to report the story until a specified time. For instance, news organizations usually receive a copy of presidential speeches several hours in advance. Product or media reviewers are commonly given a sample or preview of a product ahead of its release date.\n\nUnless the journalist has voluntarily agreed to honor the embargo in advance, usually via a legally binding non-disclosure agreement, the journalist is under no obligation to it. However, even in the absence of any obligation, news organizations generally do not break the embargo for sources that they wish to cultivate. If they do, then the agency or client that sent the release may blacklist them.\n\nPress release material can be beneficial towards media corporations because releases help decrease costs and improve the amount of material a firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, this saves journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand. \n\nAlthough the utilization of press release material can save a company time and money, it makes the distributed media boring and similar to the output of other firms. In the digital age, consumers want to get their information instantly and this puts pressure on media companies to output as much material as possible. This often causes them to heavily rely on the use of press releases in order to create their stories.\n\nPress releases are crucial from the point of view of public companies.\n\n"}

The concession gave him control over Persian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for 5 years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The concession was so immense that even imperialists like Lord Curzon characterized it as the most complete grant ever made of control of resources by any country to a foreigner. Local clergy were outraged by the concession and flyers were distributed in Tehran proclaiming that a Jew, Baron Reuter, will be in charge of country's affairs and that he plans to pass the railroad through the holy shrine in south Tehran. Clergy believed that this railroad plan is the work of Satan and will bring corruption to the Muslim lands. The concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests but the Russian government was also hostile towards the concession as well. Under immense pressure, Nasir al-Din Shah consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. The concession cancellation was also due to British government refusing to support Reuter's unrealistic ambitions. While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the entire debacle set the foundation for the revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890 as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian sovereignty would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers, in this case the Russian government, who had their own interests in the region.\n\nReuter concession cancellation however resulted in the second Reuter concession which led to the formation of Imperial Bank of Persia by Baron Julius de Reuter.\n"}

It is also one of the largest museums in the country.\n\nThe museum was established on April 13, 1895, upon enthronement of Nicholas II to commemorate his father, Alexander III. Its original collection was composed of artworks taken from the Hermitage Museum, Alexander Palace, and the Imperial Academy of Arts. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many private collections were nationalized and relocated to the Russian Museum. These included Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\".\n\nThe main building of the museum is the Mikhailovsky Palace, a splendid Neoclassical residence of Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, erected in 1819-25 to a design by Carlo Rossi on Square of Arts in St Petersburg. Upon the death of the Grand Duke the residence was named after his wife as the \"Palace of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna\", and became famous for its many theatrical presentations and balls.\n\nSome of the halls of the palace retain the Italianate opulent interiors of the former imperial residence. Other buildings assigned to the Russian museum include the Summer Palace of Peter I (1710–14), the Marble Palace of Count Orlov (1768–85), St Michael's Castle of Emperor Paul (1797–1801), and the Rastrelliesque Stroganov Palace on the Nevsky Prospekt (1752–54).\n\nToday the collection shows Russian art beginning in the 12th century up to the socialist realism and in the USSR the inofficial art of the 20th century. In 1995 the Ludwig-Museum was funded, which is a substantial collection of contemporary art. The collection holds important masterpieces since 1945, amongst others Jasper Johns, Pablo Picasso, Jeff Koons, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, Ilja Kabakow, Jörg Immendorff, Werner Branz and Gottfried Helnwein.\n\nThe Ethnographic Department was originally set up in a building specially designed by Vladimir Svinyin in 1902. The museum soon housed gifts received by Emperor's family from representatives of peoples inhabiting various regions of the Russian Empire. Further exhibits were purchased by Nicholas II and other members of his family as State financing was not enough to purchase new exhibits. In 1934, the Ethnographic Department was given the status of an independent museum: the Russian Museum of Ethnography.\n\nThe city of Málaga, home to thousands of Russian expats, has signed an agreement to host the first overseas branch of the State Russian Museum. Works displayed in Malaga will range from Byzantine-inspired icons to social realism of the Soviet era. They will be on display in yards) of exhibition space in La Tabacalera, a 1920s tobacco factory. The new museum is scheduled to open in early 2015.\n\n"}

Like many houses of its period, it reflects the popularity of Greek Revival architecture, which gained prominence in the United States during the second quarter of the 19th century. While classical design motifs had predominated in American architecture from the late 18th century, by the 19th century American architects began to draw inspiration specifically from Grecian temples. Often considered the first national style, Greek Revival architecture became so pervasive in the United States in part because regional architects could access the classical idiom through publications such as Stuart & Revett’s Antiquities of Athens and Asher Benjamin’s 1797 pattern book The Country Builder’s Companion. Vernacular Greek Revival architecture developed across the United States as local builders combined classical elements with local traditions creating distinct regional characteristics within the style.\n\nAllen built Dorset House for his children, Florenze and Lucia. Allen’s interpretation of the Greek Revival resulted in Dorset House’s substantial yet unpretentious silhouette. He designed the house with mirroring wings so that his children and their families would have separate living quarters that they could access through individual doors. In combining the two cross-gabled flanking wings with the massive corniced façade, Allen achieved the classical balance and symmetry characteristic of the Greek Revival style.\n\nAllen, and later his son Florenze, was proprietor of an iron foundry that produced stove plates, plow points, and kettles. Subsequently, unlike most homes of the era, Allen designed Dorset House without open hearths and used closed iron stoves to heat the building instead.\n\nWildfowl decoys, made to lure game birds to within shooting range, have been used by American hunters for centuries. Native Americans originated the idea over a thousand years ago in response to the abundance of the continent’s wild game. The earliest decoys made by white settlers were probably carved in the late 18th century. The idea spread rapidly and by 1840 the wooden decoy was firmly established in American hunting traditions.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War, improved transpiration systems, more advanced weapons, and abundant game combined to crate what has been called the greatest wildfowl hunt in history of the world. Professional market gunners worked in most areas supplying game to meet intense public demand. Well-made decoys were among the tools most vital to their trade. To meet the needs of the market gunners and the many well-to-do sportsmen who traveled from the cities to shoot birds, scores of craftsmen turned to decoy-making full-time. Just before 1900, such firms as mason’s decoy factory of Detroit, which employed a number of carvers working from the same patterns, offered decoys by mail order. Federal conservation legislation brought the market-gunning era to an end just after World War I. However, sportsmen continued to hunt over wooden decoys until after World War II, when inexpensive molded plastic decoys took over the marketplace.\n\nShelburne Museum’s collection of nearly nine hundred working decoys, housed in Dorset House, is the finest and most comprehensive public collection in the world. It contains superb examples by master craftsmen from all over North America, including an Elmer Crowell- whose wide variety of working decoys, decorative carvings and miniatures prove him to be the most versatile of the old-time masters- and such well kjnown carvers as Bill Bowman, Lee Dudley, Nathan Cobb, Lem Ward, Steve Ward, Joseph Lincoln, Albert Laing, Shang Wheeler, George Warin and John Blair. There is also a small collection of fish decoys, used by ice fishermen to lure pike, muskellunge and other predators within spearing range.\n\nEvery major hunting area in North America produced decoys. Differences in hunting methods and water conditions affected local decoy-making traditions, and dozens of regional variations developed. Exhibits in the Dorset House are arranged by region to allow easy comparison of the treatment of like species by carvers from different regions and more subtly within regions. Maine decoys, for example as seen in the work of Gus Wilson, are typically solid-bodied with wide, flat bottoms and simple paint patterns. By contrast Illinois decoys such as those made by Robert and Catherine Elliston, are hollow-bodied with rounded bottoms and elaborately detailed paint. Other regional styles, including those of Louisiana, Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay, New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut, Quebec and Ontario are equally distinctive.\n\nIn addition to decoys, many carvers also crafted miniatures and decorative birds. Elmer Crowell of Cape Cod was a pioneer in these areas. He offered his customers what he called a “songless aviary,” producing miniature songbirds, shorebirds, and ducks insets of twenty-five species and also creating many life-sized decorative carvings of birds and fish. A wide variety of Crowell’s work, including a heron used as a garden ornament, several wall-mounted flying birds and nearly a hundred miniatures, is exhibited in the Dorset House. Miniatures and decorative carvings by such other masters as Lem Ward, A.J. King and Harold Haertel are also on exhibit.\n\n\n\n"}

It tells the story of a film crew stuck in Portugal after the production runs out of film stock and money. The director travels to Los Angeles in search of his missing producer.\n\nA film crew in Portugal shoots a black-and-white science fiction film about the survivors on a post-apocalyptic Earth, titled \"The Survivors\". The shooting stops when the production runs out of film stock and money. In an abandoned hotel, the crew waits for money to arrive or a sign from vanished producer Gordon. As they grow restless and bored, the film depicts some of their philosophical thoughts and emotional reactions. Director Friedrich Munro finally sets off to find Gordon in Los Angeles who hides in a mobile home because of money he owes to the Mafia.\n\n\nThe film emerged during the production of Wenders' 1981 \"Hammett\" for Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola interrupted the shooting to have the screenplay re-written. Wenders returned to Europe for an intermediate film project, which was not realized in the end. He then went to Portugal to help out director Raúl Ruiz with film stock during the making of his film \"The Territory\" (1981). Wenders hired much of the cast and crew to make \"The State of Things\", including lead cinematographer Henri Alekan, the noted photographer of Jean Cocteau's 1946 motion picture \"Beauty and the Beast\". After completing the filming in Portugal, Wenders flew to Los Angeles to shoot the final scenes before continuing work on \"Hammett\".\n\n\"The State of Things\" bears many references to other movies and movie makers. Fictitious director Friedrich Munro's name is an homage to silent film director Friedrich Murnau. The name of his cameraman Joe Corby is an anagram of Joe Biroc. Other film makers and films referred to are Fritz Lang, \"The Searchers\", \"Body and Soul\", \"Thieves' Highway\", \"He Ran All the Way\" and \"They Drive by Night\".\n\nThe soundtrack includes original music from Jürgen Knieper, as well as tracks from Joe Ely, X and The Del-Byzanteens. Jim Jarmusch was a then member of The Del-Byzanteens which often leads to the misinformation that Jarmusch co-wrote the music score. Leftover film stock from \"The State of Things\" was later used on the first third of Jarmusch's 1984 black-and-white film \"Stranger Than Paradise\".\n\nAlthough the film \"The Survivors\", which the crew is shooting during the opening of \"The State of Things\", was repeatedly called a remake of either \"Day the World Ended\" or \"Most Dangerous Man Alive\" by reviewers and encyclopaedia, it bears no close resemblance to either except for the post-apocalyptic scenery.\n\nIn 1994, Wenders made \"Lisbon Story\", in which the fictitious film director in \"The State of Things\", Friedrich Munro (played again by Bauchau), reappears under the name Friedrich Monroe, having expatriated to Portugal.\n\nThe film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival of 1982. In 1983, it won the German Film Award in Gold for Cinematography and in Silver for Best Feature Film.\n\n"}
{"id": "45854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45854", "title": "Uffizi", "text": "Uffizi\n\nThe Uffizi Gallery (, ) is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the Historic Centre of Florence in the region of Tuscany, Italy. One of the most important Italian museums, and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best known in the world, and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nAfter the ruling house of Medici died out, their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous \"Patto di famiglia\" negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.\n\nToday, the Uffizi is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Florence and one of the most visited art museums in the world. \n\nThe building of Uffizi complex was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1560 for Cosimo I de' Medici so as to accommodate the offices of the Florentine magistrates, hence the name , \"offices\". The construction was later continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures.\n\nThe \"cortile\" (internal courtyard) is so long and narrow, and open to the Arno at its far end through a Doric screen that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter and architect as well, emphasised its perspective length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the palace-fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the Loggiato filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.\n\nThe Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime art works of the Medici collections on the piano nobile; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke Francesco I. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the Tribuna degli Uffizi that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a Grand Tour. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.\n\nOver the years, more sections of the palace were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculpture collected or commissioned by the Medici. According to Vasari, who was not only the architect of the Uffizi but also the author of \"Lives of the Artists\", published in 1550 and 1568, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo gathered at the Uffizi \"for beauty, for work and for recreation.\"\n\nFor many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.\n\nBecause of its huge collection, some of the Uffizi's works have in the past been transferred to other museums in Florence—for example, some famous statues to the Bargello. A project was finished in 2006 to expand the museum's exhibition space some 6,000 metres² (64,000 ft²) to almost 13,000 metres² (139,000 ft²), allowing public viewing of many artworks that had usually been in storage. \n\nThe Nuovi Uffizi (New Uffizi) renovation project which started in 1989 was progressing well in 2015 to 2017. It was intended to modernize all of the halls and more than double the display space. As well, a new exit was planned and the lighting, air conditioning and security systems were updated. During construction, the museum remained open, although rooms were closed as necessary with the artwork temporarily moved to another location. For example, the Botticelli rooms and two others with early Renaissance paintings were closed for 15 months but reopened in October 2016.\n\nThe major modernization project, New Uffizi, had increased viewing capacity to 101 rooms by late 2016 by expanding into areas previously used by the Florence State Archive.\n\nThe Uffizi hosted over two million visitors in 2016, making it the most visited art gallery in Italy. In high season (particularly in July), waiting times can be up to five hours. Tickets are available on-line in advance, however, to significantly reduce the waiting time. A new ticketing system is currently being tested to reduce queuing times from hours to just minutes. The museum is being renovated to more than double the number of rooms used to display artwork.\n\nOn 27 May 1993, the Sicilian Mafia carried out a car bomb explosion in Via dei Georgofili and damaged parts of the palace, killing five people. The blast destroyed five pieces of art and damaged another 30. Some of the paintings were fully protected by bulletproof glass. The most severe damage was to the Niobe room and classical sculptures and neoclassical interior (which have since been restored), although its frescoes were damaged beyond repair.\n\nIn early August 2007, Florence experienced a heavy rainstorm. The Gallery was partially flooded, with water leaking through the ceiling, and the visitors had to be evacuated. There was a much more significant flood in 1966 which damaged most of the art collections in Florence severely, including some of the works in the Uffizi.\n\nThe collection also contains some ancient sculptures, such as the \"Arrotino\" and the \"Two Wrestlers\".\n\n"}
{"id": "31748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31748", "title": "Ultra", "text": "Ultra\n\nUltra was the designation adopted by British military intelligence in June 1941 for wartime signals intelligence obtained by breaking high-level encrypted enemy radio and teleprinter communications at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. \"Ultra\" eventually became the standard designation among the western Allies for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence thus obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British security classification then used (\"Most Secret\") and so was regarded as being \"Ultra secret\". Several other cryptonyms had been used for such intelligence.\n\nThe code name \"Boniface\" was used as a cover name for \"Ultra\". In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans, British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy, Boniface, who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany. Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the human intelligence from the Boniface network. The U.S. used the codename \"Magic\" for its decrypts from Japanese sources including the so-called \"Purple\" cipher.\n\nMuch of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine. Used properly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in practice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. The term \"Ultra\" has often been used almost synonymously with \"Enigma decrypts\". However, Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines that were used by the German High Command, and the Hagelin machine.\n\nMany observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies. Winston Churchill was reported to have told King George VI, when presenting to him Stewart Menzies (head of the Secret Intelligence Service and the person who controlled distribution of Ultra decrypts to the government): \"It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!\" F. W. Winterbotham quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war's end describing Ultra as having been \"decisive\" to Allied victory. Sir Harry Hinsley, Bletchley Park veteran and official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment of Ultra, saying that while the Allies would have won the war without it, \"the war would have been something like two years longer, perhaps three years longer, possibly four years longer than it was.\" However, Hinsley and others have emphasized the difficulties of counterfactual history in attempting such conclusions, and some historians have said the shortening might have been as little as the three months it took the United States to deploy the atomic bomb.\n\nThe existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war. After it was revealed in the middle 1970s, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, \"Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read [General Erwin] Rommel's Enigma communications, [Field Marshall Bernard] Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail.\" Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction. As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, \"The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy.\"\n\nMost Ultra intelligence was derived from reading radio messages that had been encrypted with cipher machines, complemented by material from radio communications using traffic analysis and direction finding. In the early phases of the war, particularly during the eight-month Phoney War, the Germans could transmit most of their messages using land lines and so had no need to use radio. This meant that those at Bletchley Park had some time to build up experience of collecting and starting to decrypt messages on the various radio networks. German Enigma messages were the main source, with those of the Luftwaffe predominating, as they used radio more and their operators were particularly ill-disciplined.\n\n\"Enigma\" refers to a family of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines. These produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher and were widely thought to be unbreakable in the 1920s, when a variant of the commercial Model D was first used by the Reichswehr. The German Army, Navy, Air Force, Nazi party, Gestapo and German diplomats used Enigma machines in several variants. Abwehr (German military intelligence) used a four-rotor machine without a plugboard and Naval Enigma used different key management from that of the army or air force, making its traffic far more difficult to cryptanalyse; each variant required different cryptanalytic treatment. The commercial versions were not as secure and Dilly Knox of GC&CS, is said to have broken one before the war.\n\nGerman military Enigma was first broken in December 1932 by the Polish Cipher Bureau, using a combination of brilliant mathematics, the services of a spy in the German office responsible for administering encrypted communications, and good luck. The Poles read Enigma to the outbreak of World War II and beyond, in France. At the turn of 1939, the Germans made the systems ten times more complex, which required a tenfold increase in Polish decryption equipment, which they could not meet. On 25 July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau handed reconstructed Enigma machines and their techniques for decrypting ciphers to the French and British. Gordon Welchman wrote,\n\nAt Bletchley Park, some of the key people responsible for success against Enigma included mathematicians Alan Turing and Hugh Alexander and, at the British Tabulating Machine Company, chief engineer Harold Keen.\nAfter the war, interrogation of German cryptographic personnel, led to the conclusion that German cryptanalysts understood that cryptanalytic attacks against Enigma were possible but were thought to require impracticable amounts of effort and investment. The Poles' early start at breaking Enigma and the continuity of their success, gave the Allies an advantage when World War II began.\n\nIn June 1941, the Germans started to introduce on-line stream cipher teleprinter systems for strategic point-to-point radio links, to which the British gave the code-name Fish. Several systems were used, principally the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) and Geheimfernschreiber (Sturgeon). These cipher systems were cryptanalysed, particularly Tunny, which the British thoroughly penetrated. It was eventually attacked using Colossus, which were the first digital programme-controlled electronic computers. In many respects the Tunny work was more difficult than for the Enigma, since the British codebreakers had no knowledge of the machine producing it nor the head-start that the Poles had given them against Enigma.\n\nAlthough the volume of intelligence derived from this system was much smaller than that from Enigma, its importance was often far higher because it produced primarily high-level, strategic intelligence that was sent between Wehrmacht High Command (OKW). The eventual bulk decryption of Lorenz-enciphered messages contributed significantly and perhaps decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, the Tunny story has become much less well known among the public than the Enigma one. At Bletchley Park, some of the key people responsible for success in the Tunny effort included mathematicians W. T. \"Bill\" Tutte and Max Newman and electrical engineer Tommy Flowers.\n\nIn June 1940, the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages, except for the Italian Navy which, in early 1941 had started using a version of the Hagelin rotor-based cipher machine C-38. This was broken from June 1941 onwards by the Italian subsection of GC&CS at Bletchley Park.\n\nIn the Pacific theatre, a Japanese cipher machine, called \"Purple\" by the Americans, was used for highest-level Japanese diplomatic traffic. It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, but unlike Enigma, was not a rotor machine, being built around electrical stepping switches. It was broken by the US Army Signal Intelligence Service and disseminated as \"Magic\". Detailed reports by the Japanese ambassador to Germany were encrypted on the Purple machine. His reports included reviews of German assessments of the military situation, reviews of strategy and intentions, reports on direct inspections by the ambassador (in one case, of Normandy beach defences), and reports of long interviews with Hitler.\n\nThe chief fleet communications code system used by the Imperial Japanese Navy was called JN-25 by the Americans and by early 1942, they had made considerable progress in decrypting Japanese naval messages. The Japanese are said to have obtained an Enigma machine in 1937, although it is debated whether they were given it by the Germans or bought a commercial version which apart from the plugboard and internal wirings, was the German \"Heer/Luftwaffe\" machine. The Japanese did not use it for their most secret communications, having developed a similar machine.\n\nArmy- and air force-related intelligence derived from signals intelligence (SIGINT) sources—mainly Enigma decrypts in Hut 6—was compiled in summaries at GC&CS (Bletchley Park) Hut 3 and distributed initially under the codeword \"BONIFACE\", implying that it was acquired from a well placed agent in Berlin. The volume of the intelligence reports going out to commanders in the field built up gradually. Naval Enigma decoded in Hut 8 was forwarded from Hut 4 to the Admiralty Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), which were distributed initially under the codeword \"HYDRO\". The codeword \"ULTRA\" was adopted in June 1941. This codeword was reportedly suggested by Commander Geoffrey Colpoys, RN, who served in the RN OIC.\n\nThe distribution of Ultra information to Allied commanders and units in the field involved considerable risk of discovery by the Germans, and great care was taken to control both the information and knowledge of how it was obtained. Liaison officers were appointed for each field command to manage and control dissemination.\n\nDissemination of Ultra intelligence to field commanders was carried out by MI6, which operated Special Liaison Units (SLU) attached to major army and air force commands. The activity was organized and supervised on behalf of MI6 by Group Captain F. W. Winterbotham. Each SLU included intelligence, communications, and cryptographic elements. It was headed by a British Army or RAF officer, usually a major, known as \"Special Liaison Officer\". The main function of the liaison officer or his deputy was to pass Ultra intelligence bulletins to the commander of the command he was attached to, or to other indoctrinated staff officers. In order to safeguard Ultra, special precautions were taken. The standard procedure was for the liaison officer to present the intelligence summary to the recipient, stay with him while he studied it, then take it back and destroy it.\n\nBy the end of the war, there were about 40 SLUs serving commands around the world. Fixed SLUs existed at the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, RAF Fighter Command, the US Strategic Air Forces in Europe (Wycombe Abbey) and other fixed headquarters in the UK. An SLU was operating at the War HQ in Valletta, Malta. These units had permanent teleprinter links to Bletchley Park.\n\nMobile SLUs were attached to field army and air force headquarters, and depended on radio communications to receive intelligence summaries. The first mobile SLUs appeared during the French campaign of 1940. A SLU supported the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) headed by General Lord Gort. The first liaison officers were Robert Gore-Browne and Humphrey Plowden. A second SLU of the 1940 period was attached to the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force at Meaux commanded by Air Vice-Marshal P H Lyon Playfair. This SLU was commanded by Squadron Leader F.W. \"Tubby\" Long.\n\nIn 1940, special arrangements were made within the British intelligence services for handling BONIFACE and later Ultra intelligence. The Security Service started \"Special Research Unit B1(b)\" under Herbert Hart. In the SIS this intelligence was handled by \"Section V\" based at St Albans.\n\nThe communications system was founded by Brigadier Sir Richard Gambier-Parry, who from 1938 to 1946 was head of MI6 Section VIII, based at Whaddon Hall in Buckinghamshire, UK. Ultra summaries from Bletchley Park were sent over landline to the Section VIII radio transmitter at Windy Ridge. From there they were transmitted to the destination SLUs.\n\nThe communications element of each SLU was called a \"Special Communications Unit\" or SCU. Radio transmitters were constructed at Whaddon Hall workshops, while receivers were the National HRO, made in the USA. The SCUs were highly mobile and the first such units used civilian Packard cars. The following SCUs are listed: SCU1 (Whaddon Hall), SCU2 (France before 1940, India), SCU3 (RSS Hanslope Park), SCU5, SCU6 (possibly Algiers and Italy), SCU7 (training unit in the UK), SCU8 (Europe after D-day), SCU9 (Europe after D-day), SCU11 (Palestine and India), SCU12 (India), SCU13 and SCU14.\n\nThe cryptographic element of each SLU was supplied by the RAF and was based on the TYPEX cryptographic machine and one-time pad systems.\n\nRN Ultra messages from the OIC to ships at sea were necessarily transmitted over normal naval radio circuits and were protected by one-time pad encryption.\n\nAn intriguing question concerns the alleged use of Ultra information by the \"Lucy\" spy ring, headquartered in Switzerland and apparently operated by one man, Rudolf Roessler. This was an extremely well informed, responsive ring that was able to get information \"directly from German General Staff Headquarters\" – often on specific request. It has been alleged that \"Lucy\" was in major part a conduit for the British to feed Ultra intelligence to the Soviets in a way that made it appear to have come from highly placed espionage rather than from cryptanalysis of German radio traffic. The Soviets, however, through an agent at Bletchley, John Cairncross, knew that Britain had broken Enigma. The \"Lucy\" ring was initially treated with suspicion by the Soviets. The information it provided was accurate and timely however, and Soviet agents in Switzerland (including their chief, Alexander Radó) eventually learned to take it seriously.\n\nMost deciphered messages, often about relative trivia, were insufficient as intelligence reports for military strategists or field commanders. The organisation, interpretation and distribution of decrypted Enigma message traffic and other sources into usable intelligence was a subtle task.\n\nAt Bletchley Park, extensive indexes were kept of the information in the messages decrypted. For each message the traffic analysis recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the indicator setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one. The indexes included message preambles, every person, every ship, every unit, every weapon, every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon that might be usable as \"cribs\".\n\nThe first decryption of a wartime Enigma message was achieved by the Poles at PC Bruno on 17 January 1940, albeit one that had been transmitted three months earlier. Little had been achieved by the start of the Allied campaign in Norway in April. At the start of the Battle of France on 10 May 1940, the Germans made a very significant change in the indicator procedures for Enigma messages. However, the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts had anticipated this, and were able—jointly with PC Bruno—to resume breaking messages from 22 May, although often with some delay. The intelligence that these messages yielded was of little operational use in the fast-moving situation of the German advance.\n\nDecryption of Enigma traffic built up gradually during 1940, with the first two prototype bombes being delivered in March and August. The traffic was almost entirely limited to \"Luftwaffe\" messages. By the peak of the Battle of the Mediterranean in 1941, however, Bletchley Park was deciphering daily 2,000 Italian Hagelin messages. By the second half of 1941 30,000 Enigma messages a month were being deciphered, rising to 90,000 a month of Enigma and Fish decrypts combined later in the war.\n\nSome of the contributions that Ultra intelligence made to the Allied successes are given below.\n\n\nThe Allies were seriously concerned with the prospect of the Axis command finding out that they had broken into the Enigma traffic. The British were more disciplined about such measures than the Americans, and this difference was a source of friction between them. It was a little bit of a joke that in Delhi, the British Ultra unit was based in a large wooden hut in the grounds of Government House. Security consisted of a wooden table flat across the door with a bell on it and a sergeant sitting there. This hut was ignored by all. The American unit was in a large brick building, surrounded by barbed wire and armed patrols. People may not have known what was in there, but they surely knew it was something important and secret.\n\nTo disguise the source of the intelligence for the Allied attacks on Axis supply ships bound for North Africa, \"spotter\" submarines and aircraft were sent to search for Axis ships. These searchers or their radio transmissions were observed by the Axis forces, who concluded their ships were being found by conventional reconnaissance. They suspected that there were some 400 Allied submarines in the Mediterranean and a huge fleet of reconnaissance aircraft on Malta. In fact, there were only 25 submarines and at times as few as three aircraft.\n\nThis procedure also helped conceal the intelligence source from Allied personnel, who might give away the secret by careless talk, or under interrogation if captured. Along with the search mission that would find the Axis ships, two or three additional search missions would be sent out to other areas, so that crews would not begin to wonder why a single mission found the Axis ships every time.\n\nOther deceptive means were used. On one occasion, a convoy of five ships sailed from Naples to North Africa with essential supplies at a critical moment in the North African fighting. There was no time to have the ships properly spotted beforehand. The decision to attack solely on Ultra intelligence went directly to Churchill. The ships were all sunk by an attack \"out of the blue\", arousing German suspicions of a security breach. To distract the Germans from the idea of a signals breach (such as Ultra), the Allies sent a radio message to a fictitious spy in Naples, congratulating him for this success. According to some sources the Germans decrypted this message and believed it.\n\nIn the Battle of the Atlantic, the precautions were taken to the extreme. In most cases where the Allies knew from intercepts the location of a U-boat in mid-Atlantic, the U-boat was not attacked immediately, until a \"cover story\" could be arranged. For example, a search plane might be \"fortunate enough\" to sight the U-boat, thus explaining the Allied attack.\n\nSome Germans had suspicions that all was not right with Enigma. Admiral Karl Dönitz received reports of \"impossible\" encounters between U-boats and enemy vessels which made him suspect some compromise of his communications. In one instance, three U-boats met at a tiny island in the Caribbean Sea, and a British destroyer promptly showed up. The U-boats escaped and reported what had happened. Dönitz immediately asked for a review of Enigma's security. The analysis suggested that the signals problem, if there was one, was not due to the Enigma itself. Dönitz had the settings book changed anyway, blacking out Bletchley Park for a period. However, the evidence was never enough to truly convince him that Naval Enigma was being read by the Allies. The more so, since \"B-Dienst\", his own codebreaking group, had partially broken Royal Navy traffic (including its convoy codes early in the war), and supplied enough information to support the idea that the Allies were unable to read Naval Enigma.\n\nBy 1945, most German Enigma traffic could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security. Had they known better, they could have changed systems, forcing Allied cryptanalysts to start again.\n\nThe exact influence of Ultra on the course of the war is debated; an oft-repeated assessment is that decryption of German ciphers advanced the end of the European war by two years. Hinsley is often cited as an authority for the two-year estimate, yet his assessment in \"Codebreakers\" is not specific:\n\nWinterbotham's quoting of Eisenhower's \"decisive\" verdict is part of a letter sent by Eisenhower to Menzies after the conclusion of the European war and later found among his papers at the Eisenhower Presidential Library. It allows a contemporary, documentary view of a leader on Ultra's importance:\n\nThere is wide disagreement about the importance of codebreaking in winning the crucial Battle of the Atlantic. To cite just one example, the historian Max Hastings states that \"In 1941 alone, ultra saved between 1.5 and two million tons of Allied ships from destruction.\" This would represent a 40 percent to 53 percent reduction, though it is not clear how this extrapolation was made. Another view is from a history based on the German naval archives written after the war for the British Admiralty by a former U-boat commander and son-in-law of his commander, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. His book reports that several times during the war they undertook detailed investigations to see whether their operations were being compromised by broken enigma code. These investigations were spurred because the Germans had broken the British naval code, and found the information useful. Their investigations were negative and the conclusion is that their defeat \"... was due firstly to outstanding developments in enemy radar ... .\" The great advance was centimetric radar, developed in a joint British-American venture, which became operational in the spring of 1943. Earlier radar was unable to distinguish U-boat conning towers from the surface of the sea, so they could not even locate U-boats attacking convoys on the surface on moonless nights; so the surfaced U-boats were almost invisible while having the additional advantage of being swifter than their prey. The new higher frequency radar could spot conning towers and periscopes could even be detected from airplanes. Some idea of the relative impact of codebreaking and radar improvement can be obtained from graphs showing the tonnage of merchantmen sunk and number of U-boats sunk in each month of the battle. Of course the graphs cannot be interpreted unambiguously, because we are unable to factor in many variables like improvements in code breaking and the numerous other advances in equipment to combat U-boats. Nonetheless the data seems to favor the German view—that radar was crucial.\n\nWhile Ultra certainly affected the course of the Western Front during the war, two factors often argued against Ultra shortening the overall war by a measure of years are the relatively small role it played in the Eastern Front conflict between the Germans and the Soviet Union and the completely independent development of the U.S.-led Manhattan Project to create the atomic bomb. Author Jeffrey T. Richelson mentions Hinsley's estimate of at least two years, and concludes that \"It might be more accurate to say that Ultra helped shorten the war by three months – the interval between the actual end of the war in Europe and the time the United States would have been able to drop an atomic bomb on Hamburg or Berlin – and might have shortened the war by as much as two years had the U.S. atomic bomb program been unsuccessful.\" Military historian Guy Hartcup analyzes aspects of the question but then simply says, \"It is impossible to calculate in terms of months or years how much Ultra shortened the war.\"\n\nWhile it is obvious why Britain and the U.S. went to considerable pains to keep Ultra a secret until the end of the war, it has been a matter of some conjecture why Ultra was kept officially secret for 29 years thereafter, until 1974. During that period the important contributions to the war effort of a great many people remained unknown, and they were unable to share in the glory of what is likely one of the chief reasons the Allies won the war – or, at least, as quickly as they did.\n\nAt least three versions exist as to why Ultra was kept secret so long. Each has plausibility, and all may be true. First, as David Kahn pointed out in his 1974 \"New York Times\" review of Winterbotham's \"The Ultra Secret\", after the war, surplus Enigmas and Enigma-like machines were sold to Third World countries, which remained convinced of the security of the remarkable cipher machines. Their traffic was not as secure as they believed, however, which is one reason the British made the machines available.\n\nBy the 1970s newer computer-based ciphers were becoming popular as the world increasingly turned to computerised communications, and the usefulness of Enigma copies (and rotor machines generally) rapidly decreased. Switzerland developed its own version of Enigma, known as NEMA, and used it into the late 1970s, while the United States National Security Agency (NSA) retired the last of its rotor-based encryption systems, the KL-7 series, in the 1980s.\n\nA second explanation relates to a misadventure of Churchill's between the World Wars, when he publicly disclosed information from decrypted Soviet communications. This had prompted the Soviets to change their ciphers, leading to a blackout.\n\nThe third explanation is given by Winterbotham, who recounts that two weeks after V-E Day, on 25 May 1945, Churchill requested former recipients of Ultra intelligence not to divulge the source or the information that they had received from it, in order that there be neither damage to the future operations of the Secret Service nor any cause for the Axis to blame Ultra for their defeat.\n\nSince it was British and, later, American message-breaking which had been the most extensive, the importance of Enigma decrypts to the prosecution of the war remained unknown despite revelations by the Poles and the French of their early work on breaking the Enigma cipher. This work, which was carried out in the 1930s and continued into the early part of the war, was necessarily uninformed regarding further breakthroughs achieved by the Allies during the balance of the war. In 1967, Polish military historian Władysław Kozaczuk in his book \"Bitwa o tajemnice\" (\"Battle for Secrets\") first revealed Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Later the 1973 public disclosure of Enigma decryption in the book \"Enigma\" by French intelligence officer Gustave Bertrand generated pressure to discuss the rest of the Enigma–Ultra story.\n\nIn 1967 David Kahn in \"The Codebreakers\" described the 1944 capture of a Naval Enigma machine from and gave the first published hint about the scale, mechanisation and operational importance of the Anglo-American Enigma-breaking operation:\n\nLadislas Farago's 1971 best-seller \"The Game of the Foxes\" gave an early garbled version of the myth of the purloined Enigma. According to Farago, it was thanks to a \"Polish-Swedish ring the British obtained a working model of the 'Enigma' machine, which the Germans used to encipher their top-secret messages.\" \"It was to pick up one of these machines that Commander Denniston went clandestinely to a secluded Polish castle [!] on the eve of the war. Dilly Knox later solved its keying, exposing all Abwehr signals encoded by this system.\" \"In 1941 [t]he brilliant cryptologist Dillwyn Knox, working at the Government Code & Cypher School at the Bletchley centre of British code-cracking, solved the keying of the Abwehr's Enigma machine.\"\n\nThe British ban was finally lifted in 1974, the year that a key participant on the distribution side of the Ultra project, F. W. Winterbotham, published \"The Ultra Secret\". A succession of books by former participants and others followed. The official history of British intelligence in World War II was published in five volumes from 1979 to 1988, and included further details from official sources concerning the availability and employment of Ultra intelligence. It was chiefly edited by Harry Hinsley, with one volume by Michael Howard. There is also a one-volume collection of reminiscences by Ultra veterans, \"Codebreakers\" (1993), edited by Hinsley and Alan Stripp.\n\nA 2012 London Science Museum exhibit, \"Code Breaker: Alan Turing's Life and Legacy\", marking the centenary of his birth, includes a short film of statements by half a dozen participants and historians of the World War II Bletchley Park Ultra operations. John Agar, a historian of science and technology, states that by war's end 8,995 people worked at Bletchley Park. Iain Standen, Chief Executive of the Bletchley Park Trust, says of the work done there: \"It was crucial to the survival of Britain, and indeed of the West.\" The Departmental Historian at GCHQ (the Government Communications Headquarters), who identifies himself only as \"Tony\" but seems to speak authoritatively, says that Ultra was a \"major force multiplier. It was the first time that quantities of real-time intelligence became available to the British military.\" He further states that it is only in 2012 that Alan Turing's last two papers on Enigma decryption have been released to Britain's National Archives; the seven decades' delay had been due to their \"continuing sensitivity... It wouldn't have been safe to release [them earlier].\"\n\nHistorians and holocaust researchers have tried to establish when the Allies recognized the full extent of Nazi-era extermination of Jews, and specifically, the extermination-camp system. In 1999, the U.S. Government passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act (P.L. 105-246), making it policy to declassify all Nazi war crime documents in their files; this was later amended to include the Japanese Imperial Government. As a result, more than 600 decrypts and translations of intercepted messages were disclosed; NSA historian Robert Hanyok would conclude that Allied communications intelligence, \"by itself, could not have provided an early warning to Allied leaders regarding the nature and scope of the Holocaust.\"\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, decrypts in August 1941 alerted British authorities to the many massacres in occupied zones of the Soviet Union, including those of Jews, but specifics were not made public for security reasons. Revelations about the concentration camps were gleaned from other sources, and were publicly reported by the Polish government-in-exile, Jan Karski and the WJC offices in Switzerland a year or more later. A decrypted message referring to \"Einsatz Reinhard\" (the Höfle Telegram), from January 11, 1943, may have outlined the system and listed the number of Jews and others gassed at four death camps the previous year, but codebreakers did not understand the meaning of the message. In summer 1944, Arthur Schlesinger, an OSS analyst, interpreted the intelligence as an \"incremental increase in persecution rather than... extermination.\"\n\nThere has been controversy about the influence of Allied Enigma decryption on the course of World War II. It has also been suggested that the question should be broadened to include Ultra's influence not only on the war itself, but also on the post-war period.\n\nF. W. Winterbotham, the first author to outline the influence of Enigma decryption on the course of World War II, likewise made the earliest contribution to an appreciation of Ultra's \"postwar\" influence, which now continues into the 21st century—and not only in the postwar establishment of Britain's GCHQ (Government Communication Headquarters) and America's NSA. \"Let no one be fooled,\" Winterbotham admonishes in chapter 3, \"by the spate of television films and propaganda which has made the war seem like some great triumphant epic. It was, in fact, a very narrow shave, and the reader may like to ponder [...] whether [...] we might have won [without] Ultra.\"\n\nDebate continues on whether, had postwar political and military leaders been aware of Ultra's role in Allied victory in World War II, these leaders might have been less optimistic about post-World War II military involvements.\n\nKnightley suggests that Ultra may have contributed to the development of the Cold War. The Soviets received disguised Ultra information, but the existence of Ultra itself was not disclosed by the western Allies. The Soviets, who had clues to Ultra's existence, possibly through Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt, may thus have felt still more distrustful of their wartime partners.\n\nThe mystery surrounding the discovery of the sunk off the coast of New Jersey by divers Richie Kohler and John Chatterton was unraveled in part through the analysis of Ultra intercepts, which demonstrated that, although \"U-869\" had been ordered by U-boat Command to change course and proceed to North Africa, near Rabat, the submarine had missed the messages changing her assignment and had continued to the eastern coast of the U.S., her original destination.\n\n\n"}

When his father became a professor at the University of Leiden in 1877, the family moved to the Netherlands. Wilhelm's two yonger brothers, Herman Martin (1881-1968, director of the Fries Museum) and Hans Martin (1886-1964, a writer) were both born in the Netherlands.\n\nWilhelm Martin successfully studied Arts at the University of Leiden between 1894 and 1899, and became a Ph.D. in 1901 with his study \"Het leven en de werken van Gerrit Dou beschouwd in verband met het schildersleven van zijn tijd\", the first purely art historical doctorate in the Netherlands.\n\nAlso in 1901, Martin became vice-director of the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague under Abraham Bredius. Martin specialized in Dutch Golden Age painting, i.e. 17th-century Dutch painting. In 1904 he started giving private lessons at the University of Leiden.\nOn 9 August 1906, he married Maria Cornelia Visser. They had three daughters and one son. In 1907, Martin became extraordinary professor of art history at the University of Leiden. In 1909, Martin succeeded Bredius as the director of the Mauritshuis, which he remained for 36 years. He published a second book on Gerrit Dou in 1912, together with E. W. Moes two parts of \"Oude Schilderkunst in Nederland\" (Ancient painting in the Netherlands) in 1912 and 1914, and scientific catalogues of the Mauritshuis collection in 1914 and 1915.\n\nIn 1918, Martin published \"Alt-holländische Bilder\" (Old Netherlandic Images), with a revised reprint in 1921. It was aimed at collectors and contained advice on conservation and restoration. Meanwhile, he also published some sorks on 19th-century Dutch painters, including the 1915 \"Albert Neuhuys, zijn leven en zijn kunst\", in 1917 together with G. H. Marius \"Johannes Bosboom, 1817-1891\", and in 1921 \"Thérèse van Duyl-Schwartze. 1851-1918. Gedenkboek\".\n\nHe wrote studies on Jan Steen in 1924, 1926 and 1954. His major work, \"De Hollandsche schilderkunst in de zeventiende eeuw\" (Dutch painting in the seventeenth century), appeared in two parts in 1935-1936.\n\nIn 1934, he also became the director of the Museum Mesdag, which he remained until his death in 1954. In 1935, he became director of the Prentenkabinet (Print cabinet) of the University of Leiden. In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, he gave his resignation from the University: it was accepted in 1943, although he stayed as director of the Prentenkabinet. He retired as director of the Mauritshuis in 1945, only to return for one year in 1946-1947 when his successor suddenly left. He published a few more works, including a 1947 work on \"The Night Watch\" and a 1950 picture book on Dutch painting of the second half of the seventeenth century.\n\nIn between his career as an academic, director and writer of art historical books, he contributed to the organisation of exhibitions, was a member of different committess on Dutch Museums and Dutch Heritage, and wrote articles for many magazines, including The Burlington Magazine and Elsevier.\n\n"}
