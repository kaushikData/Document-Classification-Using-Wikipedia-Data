{"id": "1557388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1557388", "title": "Albania (placename)", "text": "Albania (placename)\n\nThe toponym Albania may indicate several different geographical regions: a country in the Balkans; an ancient land in the Caucasus; as well as Scotland, \"Albania\" being a Latinization of a Gaelic name for Scotland, \"Alba\"; and even a city in the U.S. state of New York.\n\nAlbania is the name of a country in the Balkans, attested in Medieval Latin. The name has derived from the Illyrian tribe of the \"Albanoi\" and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD.\nLinguists think that the element \"*alb-\" in the root word, is an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, meaning \"hill, mountain\", also present in \"Alps\".\nThrough the root word \"alban\" and its rhotacized equivalents \"arban\", \"albar\", and \"arbar\", the term appears as the ethnonym of Albanians in Medieval Greek documents as \"Albanoi\" and \"Arbanitai\", and in Medieval Latin as \"Albanenses\" and \"Arbanenses\", gradually entering in other European languages.\n\nThe toponym \"Arbon\" () or \"Arbo\" (\"\") is mentioned by Polybius in the \"History of the World\" (2nd century BC). It was perhaps an island in Liburnia or another location within Illyria. Stephanus of Byzantium in the 6th century AD, in his important geographical dictionary entitled Ethnica (Εθνικά), cites Polybius, saying it was a city in Illyria and gives an ethnic name for its inhabitants, calling them Arbonios (Greek: Αρβώνιος) and Arbonites (Greek: Αρβωνίτης).\n\n\"Albanopolis\" was an ancient illyrian city in the Roman province of Macedon, the center of the Illyrian tribe of Albani, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, during 150 AD in his famous work \"Geography\". It was located in the Zgërdhesh hill-fort near Krujë, central Albania. The city may have a continuation with the name of the city of Albanon or Arbanon, mentioned during the Middle Ages.\n\n\"Albanoi\" (Ἀλβανόί) reappeared in Byzantine documents in the 11th century, around 1043, as the exonym of the \"Albanians\". During the late Byzantine period the names Albanoi, alongside Arbanitai, were used interchangeably, and gradually entered other European languages, in which similar derivative names emerged. The national ethnonym of the Albanians has derived from this illyrian tribe.\n\n\"Arbanon\", or \"Albanon\", originally, was a region in the mountainous area to the west of Lake Ohrid and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin, in the 11th century AD.\n\nThe Albanians are mentioned in Anna Comnena's account \"Alexiad\", as Arbanites, because of their fights against the Normans in the region of Arbanon, during the reign of her father Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118). Before that, in the book \"History\" written in 1079-1080, Byzantine historian Michael Attaliates was first to refer to the Albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against Constantinople in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the duke of Dyrrachium. In later Byzantine usage, the terms \"Arbanitai\" and \"Albanoi\", with a range of variants, were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising name Illyrians.\n\nIn the 12th to 13th centuries, \"Arbanon\" (\"\") appears as a principality in Byzantine sources. In 1190 the \"Principality of Arbanon\" (Albanian: \"Principata e Arbërit\") became the first Albanian state during the Middle Ages. Its capital was the city of Krujë, the region in which the town of Arbanon originally was located and from which the principality got its name. It seems that this toponym has survived continuously since antiquity in this area. This suggests that probably the toponym \"Arbanon\" has derived from the ancient city of \"Albanopolis\".\n\nIn Latin documents the territory was known as Arbanum and later as \"Albaniae\". It appears in Bulgarian chronicles as \"Arbanas\". In medieval Serbian sources, the toponym of the country underwent linguistic metathesis and was rendered as Raban and Rabanski for the people. This is a typical metathesis in Slavic languages, for example the island of \"Arba\" in Croatia now is known as Rab. However, in later Serbian references the ethnonym for Albanians would appear as \"Arbanasi\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Albanians, during the Middle Ages, referred to their country as \"Arbëria\" () and called themselves \"Arbëreshë\" (). In the Balkans, a similar term is still used today by the Vlachs, who call the Albanians in their language \"Arbineshi\".\n\nThe medieval ethnonym \"Arbanitai\" and its corresponding modern ethnonym \"Arvanites\" have the same etymology as \"Albanians\", being derived from the stem \"Alb-\" by way of a rhotacism, \"Alb-\" → \"Arb-\" (based on the root *\"alban\"- and its rhotacized variant *\"arban\"-). In fact, the term Arvanitis (Ἀρβανίτης) [singular form] was established in modern Greek language from the original name Alvanitis (Άλβανίτης), who in return derived from \"Alvanos\" (Ἀλβανος). Compare the rhotacism of \"alb-\" into \"arv-\" in the Neapolitan dialect of Italy.\n\nAlbania as the name of Caucasian Albania, a state and historical region of eastern Caucasus, that existed on the territory of present-day republic of Azerbaijan and partially southern Dagestan.\n\nHowever, unlike the names of the other two European countries, this name was an exonym given to them by the Romans, as no one knew what these inhabitants called themselves. Compare also the land in Caucasus called Iberia, and the Iberian peninsula in Europe.\n\nThe Udi people and their language, the Udi language, are descendants of the ancient people of Caucasian Albania.\n\nAlba, a Gaelic name for Scotland, may be related to the Greek name of Britain Albion, Latinized as \"Albania\" during the High Medieval period, and later passed into Middle English as Albany. Some recent scholarship has however connected it with one of the early names of Ireland, \"Fodla\", which is taken to mean (land of the) \"going down\" (of the Sun), in contrast to Alba which means (land of the) \"rising\" (of the Sun). This is consistent with one of the ancient emblems of Scotland consisting of a rising sun crossing the horizon, a symbol laden with much significance.\n\nAlbion (Ancient Greek: Ἀλβίων) is the oldest known name of the island of Great Britain. Today, it is still sometimes used poetically to refer to the island. The name for Scotland in the Celtic languages is related to Albion: Alba in Scottish Gaelic, Albain in Irish, Nalbin in Manx and Alban in Welsh, Cornish and Breton. These names were later Latinised as Albania and Anglicised as Albany, which were once alternative names for Scotland. New Albion and Albionoria (\"Albion of the North\") were briefly suggested as possible names of Canada during the period of the Canadian Confederation.\n\nAlbany is the capital of the U.S. state of New York and the seat of Albany County. The name originates from the Scottish Duke of Albany, whose title comes from the Gaelic name for Scotland Alba.\n\nWhen New Netherland was captured by the English in 1664, they changed the name Beverwijck to Albany, in honor of the Duke of Albany. This was a Scottish title given since 1398, generally to the second son of the King of Scots. Albany is one of the oldest surviving European settlements from the original thirteen colonies and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "315193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315193", "title": "Common Sense Revolution", "text": "Common Sense Revolution\n\nThe phrase Common Sense Revolution (CSR) has been used as a political slogan to describe conservative platforms with a main goal of reducing taxes while balancing the budget by reducing the size and role of government. It has been used in places such as Australia and the U.S. state of New Jersey in the 1990s. This article deals with the \"Common Sense Revolution\" as it was under Ontario Premier Mike Harris, and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario from 1995 to 2002.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1985, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party held uninterrupted power in Ontario, under Red Tory premiers such as Leslie Frost, John Robarts, and Bill Davis. In 1985, this era of Conservative Premiers (termed the Big Blue Machine by observers) came to an end when the minority government of Davis' successor, Frank Miller, was defeated in the legislature and in the subsequent provincial election when the Ontario Liberal Party formed a minority government and the Liberal leader, David Peterson, was sworn in as premier. The PC party was again defeated in the 1987 election that gave Peterson a majority government.\n\nIn 1990, a junior cabinet minister from Miller's former government, Mike Harris, won the leadership of the party which was widely interpreted as a move to the political right, as Harris defeated the more centrist Dianne Cunningham. Harris immediately set about crafting a new image for himself and the party. In his first election in 1990, he branded himself \"the tax fighter\". He strongly opposed an unpopular photo-radar program introduced by the Liberal government and attacked it as a revenue grab. Despite his party's third place showing in the election (which was won by NDP leader Bob Rae), Harris had managed to improve the party standing in the legislature and bring some attention to his plan. After the 1990 election, Harris and his advisors (including prominent Ontario Tories Tony Clement, then President of the party, Leslie Noble, Alister Campbell and Tom Long) set to work creating a more comprehensive reform package to present to the province. The result was the CSR.\n\nThe CSR reform package was markedly libertarian in nature, closely mirroring the platforms of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s.\n\nThe central tenets of the CSR were tax reduction, balancing the budget, reducing the size and role of government, and an emphasis on individual economic responsibility (often summarized by an opposition to government hand-outs). Among other things Harris promised to reduce personal income tax rates by 30% and balance the provincial budget at the same time (which had reached a record $10 billion deficit under the NDP).\n\nThe CSR was specifically tailored as a reform document. It was presented as a radical change to the status quo of provincial government business, which was widely seen to be poorly managed and inefficient. Indeed, the opening words of the document were: \"The people of Ontario have a message for their politicians — government isn't working anymore. The system is broken.\"\n\nWhen Bob Rae called the 1995 election, most political commentators were sure that Liberal leader Lyn McLeod would end up taking the premier's job. However, this prediction proved rather premature.\n\nSticking to the contents of the CSR, Harris fought a campaign focused on simple, easily communicated messages. Specifically, he consistently delivered the party's promises to lower taxes and reduce the number of people on Ontario's social assistance program. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris' performance in the televised leader's debate. Rather than get caught up in the debate between McLeod and Rae, Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey CSR points, virtually ignoring all questions asked of him by his opponents. Another major contributing factor was a focussed advertising campaign which stuck to 3 key policy elements - \"Work for Welfare, Scrap the Quota Law (Affirmative Action) and Tax Cuts for Jobs — Common Sense for a Change\". Harris and the PC's won a majority government in the election, winning 82 of the province's 130 seats.\n\nHarris was committed to implementing the CSR platform almost in its entirety. Over several years, income taxes were cut as much as 30%. Spending cuts in \"low priority areas\" allowed government spending to be constrained with the exception of health care, where government spending rose each year the PCs were in office (from $17.6B in 1994/95 to $27.6B in 2003/04). Welfare reforms (including reductions in welfare payments to 'able-bodied citizens' through the division of the former Welfare program into the Ontario Disability Support Program and the Workfare program, which required able-bodied citizens to work for support) contributed to a reduction of welfare consumption in Ontario. With economic growth in North America generally strong, Ontario over the next five years outperformed every Canadian province except oil-rich Alberta, every US State and in fact, every OECD nation. This strong growth, (which supporters say is at least in part likely correlated with the favourable economic impact of cuts in marginal tax rates) allowed Harris to eliminate briefly the $11 billion annual deficit he had inherited from previous Premiers David Peterson and Bob Rae. Although the provincial budget was indeed balanced for the last several years of Harris's own time in office, his successor and former deputy Ernie Eves left office with a $5 billion deficit.\n\nHarris' interest in reforming the political structure of cities dated back to his time in opposition when he led the \"Mike Harris Task Force on Bringing Common Sense to Metro\" (Toronto), on January 5, 1995. This in many ways was designed to counter Premier Bob Rae's government Task Force on the Greater Toronto Area, chaired by Anne Golden. When the final report (called the 'Golden Report') was released in 1996, it called for a GTA-tier of local government and for inter-municipal service agencies (based on a similar model to that of Metro Toronto government).\n\nThe net effect of the Golden Report was that it countered the Mike Harris pledge of \"less government.\" The creation of a larger organizing body for the region ran counter to his party's advocacy of smaller government. Harris had felt that politicians, in particular lower level city councillors, were problematic to his party, and prevented free enterprise. The plan for reduced government might have emulated Margaret Thatcher's approach that eliminated democratically elected upper-tier city and metropolitan region governments, replacing them with a collection of more politically amenable appointed special-purpose bodies dominated by patronage. \"See Greater London Council\".\n\nWhile many suburban municipalities grew rapidly during Harris' first term (1995–1999), some, such as Opposition member Bud Wildman, have argued that the net effect of many CSR policies was to transfer wealth from urban to suburban areas and to refocus services to commuters and suburbs. In a highly controversial move, the City of Toronto was merged with the five surrounding cities of Metropolitan Toronto to form a new single-tier \"megacity\" (a term coined by the local media). The Harris government saw the megacity as a cost-cutting measure. The fact that the merger took place in Toronto, a region with a lower proportion Conservative MPPs, further polarized the debate on the merit of the merger. Some municipalities, particularly Toronto, also complained that the government was \"downloading\" the costs of services that the province had formerly paid for onto local city and municipal governments.\n\nLong before the merger, in October 1996, a focus group conducted by Angus Reid for the government warned Municipal Affairs Minister Al Leach that there would be \"considerable public resistance\" to the creation of a unified Toronto. Leach would go on to blame local mayors and community groups for the opposition, going on to be quoted in the same article as saying: \"In the end, it became a cause célèbre for all of the issues that the government was bringing forward on its agenda\".\n\nOne of the loudest opponents to the new city was former Toronto mayor John Sewell who led the action group Citizens for Local Democracy.\n\nIn April 1997 the government introduced Bill 103 (City of Toronto Act). The Ontario New Democratic Party filibustered the legislation by proposing a series of amendments, each of which required the government to consult the residents of a specific street in the city before implementing the amalgamation. One street, Cafon Court in Etobicoke, had its amendment successfully passed when government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, although the Tories later voted to strike the Cafon amendment.\n\nThe round-the-clock fight at Queen's Park lasted 10 days before the legislation was finally passed on April 21. On January 1, 1998, the new single-tier City of Toronto came into existence, superseding the former two-tier structure of Metropolitan Toronto, and the constituent cities of Toronto, York, North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough and the Borough of East York.\n\nOther controversial municipal amalgamations took place during Harris' second term, including in Ottawa, Hamilton, Greater Sudbury and Kawartha Lakes. Unlike the Toronto amalgamation, however, these all involved large rural areas in addition to the primary urban core. Controversy over the amalgamations remains a significant political issue in some of these cities.\n\nAttempting to build on the success of the CSR content and messaging strategy for the 1999 election, Harris and the Ontario Tories branded their new policy document the \"Blueprint\" (Blue being the official colour of the party). The Blueprint followed the same theoretical framework as its predecessor, yet was tempered for a much different political environment. In 1995 the message had been \"reform\" and \"revolution\", but after four years of conservative government, the message became a balance between stability and emphasizing that there was still \"much left to do\". Though not as popular as the CSR, the Blueprint was part of a successful re-election campaign, allowing Harris to win another majority government.\n\nHarris resigned as premier in 2002, and was succeeded by Ernie Eves. Through a variety of factors, including dissatisfaction with the effects of the government's platform policies, deterioration of municipal services after downloading, the Walkerton Tragedy during the CSR, and Eves' handling of the Northeast Blackout, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election by Dalton McGuinty and the Ontario Liberal Party.\n\nMunicipal amalgamation led to a reduction in the number of municipalities in Ontario from 850 to 443 and the number of elected municipal officials by 23%, but resulted in an increase in the number of municipal employees by 39% from 1996 to 2011. Per thousand residents, there were 15.8 municipal employees in 1990 and 20.9 in 2010. Part of this resulted from an increase in services by the larger municipalities, or replacement of volunteer staff with full-time staff such as for firefighting services. Other contributing factors were the downloading of services from provincial jurisdiction to municipalities, such as social assistance, public housing and public health. The remaining increase resulted from wage increases associated with amalgamation and an increase in administrative employment, such as hiring more clerks and treasurers. Amalgamated municipalities increased employees at twice the rate of those that were not restructured.\n\n"}

Conservation activities include preventive conservation, examination, documentation, research, treatment, and education. This field is closely allied with conservation science, curators and registrars.\n\nConservation of cultural heritage involves protection and restoration using \"any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible.\" Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with art collections and museums and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.\n\nThe scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical stewardship.\n\nConservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:\n\nOften there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.\n\nIn order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the stakeholder, the values and meaning of the work, and the physical needs of the material.\n\nCesare Brandi in his \"Theory of Restoration\", describes restoration as \"the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future\".\n\nSome consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, but more ancient examples include the work of Cassiodorus.\n\nThe care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment. Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as Michael Faraday began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. Louis Pasteur carried out scientific analysis on paint as well. However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the United Kingdom of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1877. The society was founded by William Morris and Philip Webb, both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of John Ruskin. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.\nConservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 Friedrich Rathgen became the first chemist to be employed by a Museum, the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin (Royal Museums of Berlin). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898. The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by Arthur Pillans Laurie, academic chemist and Principal of Heriot-Watt University from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by William Holman Hunt. In 1924 the chemist Dr Harold Plenderleith began to work at the British Museum with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation \"profession\" in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations. This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the London Underground tunnels during the First World War. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and conservation science.\n\nIn the United States, the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the Fogg Art Museum, and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. Rutherford John Gettens was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with George L. Stout, the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.\n\nGeorge T. Oliver, of Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston\n(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for relining paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937. Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.\n\nThe focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC) was incorporated under British law in 1950 as \"a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds.\" The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as Cesare Brandi have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of preventive conservation. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by Garry Thomson CBE, and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978. Thomson was associated with the National Gallery in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.\n\nThe conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of applied ethics. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:\n\n\nConservation OnLine provides resources on ethical issues in conservation, including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.\n\nAs well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.\n\nMany cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and exposure to visible light and ultraviolet radiation. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, watercolour paintings usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of pigments.\n\nCollections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.\n\nA principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.\n\nOne of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession and is now considered by many to be \"a fuzzy concept.\" Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.\n\nAn example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the Sistine Chapel.\n\nConservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as microscopes, spectrometers, and various x-ray regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.\n\nHeritage Preservation, in partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections, which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:\n\nIn October 2006, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a governmental department, authored a document: \"Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums\". This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.\n\nThe document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:\n\n\nThe conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the Institute of Conservation (ICON) published their response under the title \"A Failure of Vision\". It had the following to say:\n\nConcluding: \n\nFurther to this the ICON website summary report lists the following specific recommendations:\n\n\nIn November 2008, the UK-based think tank Demos published an influential pamphlet entitled \"It's a material world: caring for the public realm\", in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:\n\nTraining in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an apprenticeship, whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.\n\nThe University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an intern.\n\nConservation of cultural heritage is an interdisciplinary field as conservators have backgrounds in the fine arts, sciences (including chemistry, biology, and materials science), and closely related disciplines, such as art history, archaeology, studio art, and anthropology. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.\n\nWithin the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the American Institute for Conservation who advise \"Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum\".\n\nIn France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). \n\nSocieties devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.\n\nThe built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the United States. Preservation Virginia, founded in Richmond in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.\n\nToday, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.\n\nThese organizations exist to \"support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage\".\n\nThis involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal lists of international cultural heritage documents:\n"}
{"id": "6059486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6059486", "title": "Cultural depictions of spiders", "text": "Cultural depictions of spiders\n\nThroughout history, spiders have been depicted in popular culture, mythology and in symbolism. From Greek mythology to African folklore, the spider has been used to represent a variety of things, and endures into the present day with characters such as Shelob from \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Spider-Man from the eponymous comic series. It is also a symbol of mischief and malice for its toxic venom and the slow death it causes, which is often seen as a curse. In addition, the spider has inspired creations from an ancient geoglyph to a modern steam-punk spectacle. Spiders have been the focus of fears, stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries.\n\nThe spider has symbolized patience and persistence due to its hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for its prey to become ensnared. Numerous cultures attribute the spider's ability to spin webs with the origin of spinning, textile weaving, basketry, knotwork and net making. Spiders are associated with creation myths because they seem to weave their own artistic worlds. Philosophers often use the spider's web as a metaphor or analogy; and today, terms such as the \"Internet\" or \"World Wide Web\" evoke the inter-connectivity of a spider web.\n\nThe spider, along with its web, is featured in mythological fables, cosmology, artistic spiritual depictions, and in oral traditions throughout the world since ancient times.\n\nUttu, the ancient Sumerian goddess of weaving, was envisioned as a spider spinning her web. According to the myth of \"Enki and Ninsikila\", she was the daughter of the water god Enki. After being warned by Enki's wife Ninhursag that he would attempt to seduce her, Uttu ensconced herself inside her web, but agreed to let Enki in after he promised to marry her and give her fresh produce as a marriage gift. After giving Uttu the produce, Enki intoxicated her with beer and raped her. Ninhursag heard Uttu's screams and rescued her, removing Enki's semen from her vagina and planting it in the ground to produce eight previously-nonexistent plants.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, the spider was associated with the goddess Neith in her aspect as spinner and weaver of destiny, this link continuing later through the Babylonian Ishtar and the Greek Arachne, who was later equated as the Roman goddess Minerva.\n\nA notable ancient legend from the Western canon that explains the origin of the spider comes from the Greek story of the weaving competition between Athena the goddess, and Arachne, sometimes described as a princess. This story may have originated in Lydian mythology; but the myth, briefly mentioned by Virgil in 29 BC, is known from the later Greek mythos after Ovid wrote the poem \"Metamorphoses\" between the years AD 2 and 8. The Greek \"arachne\" (αράχνη) means \"spider\", and is the origin of Arachnida, the spiders' taxonomic class.\nThis myth tells of Arachne, the daughter of a famous Tyrian purple wool dyer in Hypaepa of Lydia. Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving. Eventually, she began to consider herself to be a greater weaver than the goddess Athena herself, and challenged the goddess to a weaving contest to prove her superior skill. Athena wove the scene of her victory over Poseidon that had earned her the patronage of Athens, while Arachne wove a tapestry featuring many episodes of infidelity among the Gods of Olympus, which angered Athena. The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride. In a final moment of anger, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom with her shuttle and cursed Arachne to live with extreme guilt. Out of sadness, Arachne soon hanged herself. Taking pity on her, Athena brought her back to life transformed as a spider, using the poison aconite; \"—\"and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web\".\"\n\nThe scholar Robert Graves proposed Ovid's tale may have its roots in the commercial rivalry between the Athenian citizenry of Greece and that of Miletus in Asia Minor, which flourished around 2000 BC. In Miletus, the spider may have been an important figure; seals with spider emblems have been recovered there.\n\nIn African mythology, the spider is personified as a creation deity Anansi, and as a trickster character in African traditional folklore. There are many variations of the name including Kwaku Ananse of the Ashanti in West Africa (his original name) and anglicized as Aunt Nancy (or Sister Nancy) in the West Indies and some other parts of the Americas.\nStories of Ananse became such a prominent and familiar part of Ashanti oral culture that the word Anansesem—\"spider tales\"—came to embrace all kinds of fables. This fed into the \"Anansi toree\" or \"spider tales\"; stories that were brought over from Africa and told to children of Maroon people and other Africans in the diaspora. These tales are allegorical stories that teach a moral lesson.\n\nNorth American cultures have traditionally depicted spiders. The Native American Lakota people's oral tradition also includes a spider-trickster figure, which is known by several names. As chronicled in the legend of \"The \"Wasna\" (Pemmican) Man and the Unktomi (Spider)\", a man encounters a hungry spider family, and the hero Stone Boy is tricked out of his fancy clothes by Unktomi, a trickster spider figure. The spider is also present as the deity Iktomi, which is occasionally depicted in this form. In Native American mythology, the spider is also seen in the legend about the birth of the constellation Ursa Major. The constellation was seen as seven men transformed into stars and climbing to paradise by unrolling a spider's web. The Hopi have the creation myth of Spider Grandmother (KokyAngwuti). In this story, Spider Grandmother thought the world into existence through the conscious weaving of her webs. Spider Grandmother also plays an important role in the creation mythology of the Navajo, and there are stories relating to Spider Woman in the heritage of many Southwestern native cultures as a powerful helper and teacher.\n\nThe South American Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped nature; they placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art. The people of the Nazca culture created expansive geoglyphs, including a large depiction of a spider on the Nazca plain in southern Peru. The purpose or meaning of the so-called \"Nazca lines\" is still uncertain. An adobe spider-god temple of the Cupisnique culture was discovered in the Lambayeque Region of Peru. It is part of the Ventarron temple complex and is known as Collud. The Cupisnique spider deity was associated with hunting nets, textiles, war, and power. One image depicts spider deities holding nets filled with decapitated human heads.\n\nSpiders are depicted in Indigenous Australian art, in rock and bark paintings, and for clan totems. Spiders in their webs are associated with a sacred rock in central Arnhem Land on the Burnungku clan estate of the Rembarrnga/Kyne people. Their totem design is connected with a major regional ceremony, providing a connection with neighboring clans also having spider totems in their rituals. \"Nareau\", the Lord Spider, created the universe, according to the traditional Cosmology of Oceania's Kiribati islanders of the Tungaru archipelago (Gilbert Islands); similarly, \"Areop-Enap\" (\"Old Spider\") plays an important part in the creation myth of the traditional Nauru islanders of Micronesia. In the Philippines, there is a Visayan folk tale version of \"The Spider and the Fly\" which explains why the spider hates the fly.\n\nThe \"Tsuchigumo\" (translated as \"Earth spiders\") of Japan, is a mythical, supernatural creature faced by the legendary Minamoto no Raiko. Depending on the version of the story, the \"Tsuchigumo\" was able to take the visage of either a boy or a woman. In one version, while on a search for a mythical giant skull, Minamoto is lured to a house and placed in an illusion created by a \"Tsuchigumo\" in the guise of a young boy. However, after suspecting foul play, Minamoto breaks this illusion by striking out at him with his sword. Minamoto then discovers himself as actually being covered in a spider's web, and after tracking him down, learns that the boy is in reality, a giant spider \"Tsuchigumo\".\n\nAnother Japanese mythological spider figure is the \"Jorōgumo\" (\"prostitute spider\") which is portrayed as being able to transform into a seductive woman. In some instances, the \"Jorōgumo\" attempts to seduce and perhaps marry passing samurai. In other instances she is venerated as a goddess dwelling in the Jōren Falls who saves people from drowning. Her name also refers to a golden orb-spider species \"Nephila clavata\" (\"Jorō-gumo\", or Jorō spider).\n\nAn Islamic oral tradition holds that during the Hijra, the journey from Mecca to Medina, Muhammad and his companion Abu Bakr were being pursued by Quraysh soldiers, and they decided to take refuge in the Cave of Thawr. The tale goes on to say that Allah commanded a spider to weave a web across the opening of the cave. After seeing the spider's web, the Quraysh passed the cave by, since Muhammad's entry to the cave would have broken the web. Since then, it has been held in many Muslim traditions that a spider, if not holy, is at least to be respected. A similar story occurs in the Jewish tradition, where it is David who is being chased by King Saul. David hides in a cave, and Saul and his men do not bother to search the cave because, while David was hiding inside, a spider had spun a web over the mouth of the cave.\n\nThe 10th-century Saint Conrad of Constance is sometimes represented as a bishop holding a chalice with a spider. According to this story, while he was celebrating Easter Mass, a spider fell into the chalice. Ignoring the commonly-held belief of the time that all or most spiders were poisonous; as a token of faith, Conrad nevertheless drank the wine with the spider in it.\n\nFor King Robert the Bruce of Scotland, the spider is depicted as an inspirational symbol, according to an early 14th-century legend. The legend tells of Robert the Bruce's encounter with a spider during the time of a series of military failures against the English. One version tells that while taking refuge in a cave on Rathlin Island, he witnesses a spider continuously failing to climb its silken thread to its web. However, due to perseverance the spider eventually succeeds, demonstrating that, \"if at first you don't succeed, try, try and try again\". Taking this as being symbolic of hope and perseverance, Bruce came out of hiding and eventually won Scotland's independence.\n\nIn the Vedic philosophy of India, the spider is depicted as hiding the ultimate reality with the veils of illusion. Indra's net is used as a metaphor for the Buddhist concept of interpenetration, which holds that all phenomena are intimately connected. Indra's net has a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, and each jewel is reflected in all of the other jewels.\n\nAs related in the book, \"Vermeer's Hat\" by historian Timothy Brook:\n\nThe epic poem \"Metamorphoses\", written by Ovid two millennia ago, includes the metamorphosis of Arachne. This was retold in Dante Alighieri's depiction as the half-spider Arachne in the 2nd book of his \"Divine Comedy\", \"Purgatorio\". Considered as the earliest known work of science fiction in Western literature, the 2nd century satirical novel, \"A True Story\" by Lucian of Samosata includes a battle between the People of the Moon and the People of the Earth featuring giant spiders.\n\nIn the 15th century, the French king Louis XI acquired the nickname \"the universal spider\" (\"l'universelle aragne\"), from Georges Chastelain, a chronicler of the dukes of Burgundy, referring to the king's tendency to implement schemes and plans during his contention with Burgundy and the following conflicts with Charles the Bold. In the 16th-century Chinese folk novel, Wu Cheng'en's \"Journey to the West\", the buddhist monk Tang Sanzang's odyssey includes being trapped in a spider's cave and bound by beautiful women and many children, who are transformations of spiders.\n\nThe spider gained an evil reputation from the 1842 Biedermeier novella by Jeremias Gotthelf, \"The Black Spider\". In this allegorical tale which was adapted to various media, the spider symbolizes evil works and represents the moral consequences of making a pact with the devil.\n\nAtlach-Nacha is the creation of Clark Ashton Smith and first appeared in his short story \"The Seven Geases\" (1934). Atlach-Nacha resembles a huge spider with an almost-human face. In the story, Atlach-Nacha is the reluctant recipient of a human sacrifice given to it by the toad-god Tsathoggua.\n\nSpiders recur in themes for works by J. R. R. Tolkien. Tolkien included giant spiders in his 1937 book \"The Hobbit\" where they roamed Mirkwood attacking and sometimes capturing the main characters. The character of Ungoliant is featured as a spider-like entity, and as a personification of Night from his earliest writings. In \"The Lord of the Rings\", the creature’s daughter Shelob is encountered as Frodo and Sam move through the mountain pass of Cirith Ungol. Shelob was featured in the film adaption of the last book of the \"Lord of the Rings\" series. Although described as giant spiders, Tolkien gave them fictional attributes such as compound eyes, beaks and the spinning of black webs. He also resurrected the Old English words \"cob\" and \"lob\" for \"spider\".\n\nThe 1952 children's novel \"Charlotte's Web\" written by E. B. White, is notable in its portrayal of the spider in a positive manner as a heroine rather than an object of fear or horror.\n\nMore recently, giant spiders have featured in books such as the 1998 fantasy novel \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" by J. K. Rowling. This book was later followed by a motion picture of the same name, using the giant spider Aragog from the novel as a supporting character and pet of grounds keeper, Hagrid. In \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", a book about many of the creatures within the Harry Potter universe, these giant spiders are also known as Acromantulas.\nThe spider is also found in modern children's tales. The nursery rhymes \"Itsy Bitsy Spider\" and \"Little Miss Muffet\" have spiders as focal characters. The poem \"The Spider and the Fly\" (1829) by Mary Howitt is a cautionary tale of seduction and betrayal which later inspired a 1949 film and a 1965 Rolling Stones song, each sharing the same title, as well as a 1923 cartoon by Aesop Fables Studio.\n\nThe poet Walt Whitman describes a ballooning spider in his 1868 poem, \"A Noiseless Patient Spider\":\n\n<poem>\nA patient spider,\nI mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated ;\nMark'd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,\nIt launch'd forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself ;\nEver unreeling them—ever tirelessly speeding them.\n\nAnd you O my soul where you stand,\nSurrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,\nCeaselessly musing, venturing, throwing,—seeking the spheres to con-\n    nect them ;\nTill the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold ;\nTill the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.\n\n</poem>\nIn graphic novels, spiders are often adapted by superheroes or villains as their symbols or alter egos due to the arachnid's strengths and weaknesses. One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the Marvel comic book hero Spider-Man. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in movies and various other media. In addition to Spider-Man, the Marvel universe includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including Spider-Woman, Spider-Girl, the Scarlet Spider, Venom, Araña, Black Widow, and Tarantula. The DC Comics universe also include characters named Spider Girl and Tarantula.\n\nMany other comic book, manga and anime characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as Black Spider from the Batman universe; in the Pokémon franchise, Spinarak and Ariados, Joltik and Galvantula, and Dewpider and Araquanid, are all variously based on spiders. In the \"Static Shock\" series, Anansi the Spider takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga Kuroshitsuji, one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spider-like qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga \"The Saga of Darren Shan\", the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe Ghost in The Shell manga by Masamune Shirow prominently features spider-like, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called Fuchikoma (evolving into the Tachikoma, Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapons platforms are used by the members of Section 9 to aid in their various missions.\nIn the Monster Musume manga by Okayado the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgemental they were of\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind,\nshe now lives with him.\n\nSpiders have been present for many decades both in film and on television, predominantly in the horror genre. Those who suffer from arachnophobia, an acute fear of spiders, become particularly horrified. The spider web is used as a motif to adorn dark passageways, depicting the recesses of the unknown.\n\nSpider themes are featured in early film history. In Fritz Lang's 1919 and 1920 \"The Spiders\" adventure series, a spider is the calling-card for \"The Spiders\" criminal organization. \"Pan Si Dong\" (1927), 盘丝洞, (\"The Cave of the Silken Web\") was a film adaptation of the classic tale of Xuánzàng's encounter from a chapter of the 16th century Great Classical Novel, \"Journey to the West\", and was remade as a 1967 Hong Kong cinema production.\n\nMany horror films have featured the spider, including 1955's \"Tarantula\", exploiting America's fear of atomic radiation during the nuclear arms race, the 1975 low-budget cult film \"The Giant Spider Invasion\", and \"Kingdom of the Spiders\", a 1977 film starring William Shatner, depicting the consequence of hungry spiders deprived of their natural food supply due to pesticides.\n\nThe fear of spiders culminates in \"Arachnophobia\", a 1990 movie in which spiders multiply in large numbers. On the other hand, a person who admires spiders is referred to as an \"arachnophile\"; such as Virginia, a demented orphan who likes to play deadly spider games in the black comedy horror B movie, \"Spider Baby\".\n\nThe Godzilla franchise includes a giant spider kaiju named Kumonga (\"Spiga\" in English versions), first appearing in 1967's \"Son of Godzilla\". The 1999 film \"Wild Wild West\" features a giant mechanical spider. Experiments with spiders in space tend to go horribly wrong, as with a DNA experiment on board a NASA space shuttle in the 2000 film \"Spiders\", or mutant spiders from a derelict Soviet space station in the 2013 film \"Spiders 3D\". Before there were \"Snakes on a Plane\" (2006), there were spiders on a plane in \"\" (1977). Radiation and spiders once again combine to wreak havoc in the 2002 film spoof \"Eight Legged Freaks\", this time due to nuclear waste.\n\nSeveral books featuring spiders have been adapted to film, including \"\" featuring Shelob and \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" with Aragog the Acromantula. Charlotte's positive portrayal of a spider character can be seen in two full-length feature versions of \"Charlotte's Web\". The first \"Charlotte's Web\" was a Hanna-Barbera musical animation released in 1973, followed by a live-action 2006 film version of the original story. Furthermore, spider characters have crawled out of the pages of comic books and onto the big screen, most notably the \"Spider-Man\" film adaptations.\n\nIn Ingmar Bergman's 1961 Swedish film adaptation \"Through a Glass Darkly\", the psychotic Karin believes she has an encounter with God as a spider. Surreal spider imagery, symbolism and themes are featured prominently in the 2013 psychological thriller \"Enemy\"; director Denis Villeneuve's film adaptation of the novel \"The Double\" by José Saramago.\n\nOn television, the 1990 miniseries \"Stephen King's It\" is based on his novel \"It\", where the true form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown resembles a monstrous spider. The character Kamen Rider Leangle from the 2004 Japanese TV show \"Kamen Rider Blade\" has a motif based on the onigumo spider. The plot of the 2018 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Arachnids in the UK\" revolves around an infestation of giant spiders that has occurred as the result of a scientific experiment.\n\nThe Rolling Stones adapted themes from Mary Howitt's poem in their 1965 song \"The Spider and the Fly\". Released in 1966, \"Boris the Spider\" was the first song written by John Entwistle for The Who, and became a staple of their live concerts. \"Spiderwebs\" became a hit for No Doubt in 1995. Alice Cooper's 2008 concept album, \"Along Came a Spider\" is about a fictitious serial killer known as 'Spider', who wraps his victims in silk and cuts off one of their legs in order to create his own eight-legged arachnoid.\n\nInformation technology terms such as the \"web spider\" (or \"web crawler\") and the World Wide Web imply the spider-like connection of information accessed on the Internet.\n\nA dance, the tarantella, refers to the spider \"Lycosa tarantula\".\n\nGiant spider sculptures (11 feet tall and 22 feet across) described as \"looming and powerful protectresses, yet are nurturing, delicate, and vulnerable\" and a \"favorite with children\" have been found in Washington DC, Denver CO, and elsewhere. Even larger sculptures are found in places like Ottawa and Zürich. These sculptures, two series of six by Louise Bourgeois, can be seen at the National Gallery of Art, Denver Art Museum, London's Tate Modern and in a few other select sculpture gardens. The larger series is titled \"Maman\" and the other simply titled \"Spider\". One \"Spider\" sold at a Christie's auction house for over $10 million.\n\nA four-day performance art spectacle in Liverpool (September 2008) featured \"La Princesse\" by the French performance art company La Machine. This giant steam-punk spider climbed walls, stalked the streets and sprayed unwary citizens while in search of a nest.\n\nGiant spiders appear in several role-playing games, such as Lolth, the Spider Queen of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", and the first edition of \"\", where spiders are described as being \"of staggering size—perhaps 15 feet around—with great furred body.\" In video games, spiders or spider-shaped foes are common, such as the \"Metroid\" series where the trilogy's antagonist, Metroid Prime, has a spider-like Metroid as her primary physical form. This trilogy also includes the Ing, antagonists of \",\" whose warrior forms resemble five-legged spiders. \"Atlach-Nacha\" is an H-game centered on a spider demon disguising herself as a human. In \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, giant spiders are a frequent foe. In particular, \"Ocarina of Time\" features large spiders named Skulltulas, and \"Twilight Princess\" has an enormous spider boss. A spider-like creature named Muffet is featured in the 2015 video game Undertale.\n\nIn the Lego toyline Bionicle series, the Visorak horde is a species consisting of six spider-like breeds. They are created by the Brotherhood of Makuta to conquer islands; they possess mutagenic venom and spin sticky green webs. In the Transformers franchise, Tarantulas and Blackarachnia are both Predacons that turn into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes other Transformers and she is capable of spinning webs.\n\nNotable athletes with spider nicknames include Olympic skier \"Spider\" Sabich, so named by his father due to his long, thin arms and legs as a baby,\nand UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson \"The Spider\" Silva who was dubbed \"Brazil's Spiderman\" by an announcer who thought he looked like a superhero in the ring. Spider mascots are associated with the Cleveland Spiders baseball team and the San Francisco Spiders hockey team.\n\nThe widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of spiders during sleep in one's life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart, snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.\n\nHuntsman spiders are large and swift, often eliciting arachnophobic reactions from susceptible people, and are the subject of many superstitions, exaggerations and myths. The \"banana spider\" myth claims that the Huntsman spider lays its eggs in banana flower blossoms, resulting in spiders inside the tip of bananas, waiting to terrorize an unsuspecting consumer. This is supposed to explain why monkeys allegedly peel bananas from the \"wrong\" end.\n\nAccording to another urban legend, daddy long legs \"(Pholcidae)\" have potent venom, but their fangs are too short to deliver the poison. This myth might have arisen due to its similarity in appearance with the Brown recluse spider. In a 2004 episode of Discovery Channel's \"MythBusters\", it was shown that host Adam Savage survived a bite from the spider.\n\nA modern myth depicts a young woman who found out that her beehive hairdo was infested with Black widow spiders.\n\n\"The Spider Bite\" legend emerged in Europe in the late 1970s. In most versions of this tale, a young vacationing female sunbather is bitten on the cheek by a spider. After seeking medical attention for the resultant swelling, hundreds of tiny spiders are discovered emerging from her lanced wound, which causes the victim to go insane.\n\nAn email hoax describes the attacks by the South American Blush Spider in public toilets. The alleged spider's scientific name is \"Arachnius gluteus\", where \"arachnius\" is a made-up word intended to mean \"spider\". and \"gluteus\" is a reference to \"buttocks\" (\"cf\": gluteus maximus). The hoax spider shares some characteristics with the two-striped telamonia \"(Telamonia dimidiata)\", and there is an updated version of the hoax using that name for the spider's species, with the rest of the text left unchanged, except for details such as locations. This hoax began in 1999 and has since spread to social media where it continues to circulate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "73439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73439", "title": "Duck Amuck", "text": "Duck Amuck\n\nDuck Amuck is an American surreal animated cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and produced by Warner Bros. Cartoons. The short film was released in early 1953 by The Vitaphone Corporation, the short subject division of Warner Bros., as part of the \"Merrie Melodies\" series. It stars Daffy Duck, who is tormented by a seemingly sadistic, initially unseen animator, who constantly changes Daffy's locations, clothing, voice, physical appearance and even shape, much to Daffy's aggravation and rage. Pandemonium reigns throughout the cartoon as Daffy attempts to steer the action back to some kind of normality, only for the animator to either ignore him or, more frequently, to over-literally interpret his increasingly frantic demands. In the end, the tormenting animator is revealed to be Bugs Bunny.\n\nIn 1994, it was voted #2 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field, losing only to \"What's Opera, Doc?\", also made by Chuck Jones and also written by Michael Maltese. It remains one of the most notable Warner Bros. animations, and has been inducted into the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nThe short was included on the \"\" DVD box set (with optional audio commentary by Michael Barrier), \"The Essential Daffy Duck\" DVD box set, and the \"\" Blu-ray box set. The short inspired the 2007 Nintendo DS game \"\".\n\nThe cartoon's title sequence and opening scene suggest Daffy Duck is to star as a musketeer, and he appears, boldly engaging in an action scene with a fencing foil. As he thrusts the foil and advances, the background abruptly disappears, leaving a plain white screen. Confused by this, Daffy turns to the animator and asks him to complete the scenery. However, instead of a castle from the original scene, the animator paints a farm scene. Daffy returns and starts to repeat his musketeer opening, but quickly notices the different background. He walks off screen and returns dressed as a farmer, while singing a version of \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\", but a few seconds later, the scene segues into an Arctic backdrop; Daffy changes into winter clothes and skies through the snow (to \"Jingle Bells\") and into a Hawaiian setting. Still dutifully, but impatiently, going through the changes, Daffy returns in Hawaiian garb. After a couple of bars of \"Aloha 'Oe (Farewell To Thee)\" on ukulele, Daffy ends up back in the plain white background.\n\nWhile Daffy tries to reason with the animator that cartoons should have scenery, he becomes completely erased and, upon asking where he is, he gets redrawn as a cowboy with a guitar. Daffy tries to play it but there is nothing but silence. Using a sign, he requests sound and is granted various non-guitar sound effects. Daffy also finds himself generating random sound effects when he tries to speak, and finally regains his voice when he becomes enraged and shouts angrily at the animator. (\"AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED IN ALL MY LIFE!\")\n\nRegaining his composure, Daffy demands some new scenery and is given an amateurish line-art cityscape background in pencil. Daffy asks for color, prompting the animator to slap various colors and patterns all over him (\"NOT ME, YOU SLOP ARTIST!!\"). All but Daffy's face is erased and, upon asking where the rest of him has gone, he is redrawn as a bizarre mismatched animal with a \"screwball\" flag on its tail. As Daffy walks off (wondering to himself if he weren't living up to his contract and if he hasn't been keeping himself trim), he becomes aware of not feeling quite like himself; the animator creates a mirror and, upon seeing his hideous self, Daffy once again bursts out in anger (\"EEK! You know better than that!\"). Everything is erased and Daffy is redrawn this time as a sailor. He begins to sing \"The Song of the Marines\" as the animator draws an ocean scene with an island in the background, but draws nothing under Daffy, resulting in him falling into the ocean and surfacing on the island. When he requests a closeup, the screen contracts around him, at which he screams, and the camera zooms up uncomfortably close to his angry bloodshot eyes. He walks away muttering a sarcastic thanks to the animator.\n\nAs Daffy tries once again to negotiate with the animator to have an understanding, the screen frame falls on him. After failing to keep the frame up with a stick, Daffy goes ballistic and rips apart the black background. Now at the end of his rope, Daffy demands, \"Let's get this picture started\", so the camera does an iris-out to black, followed by a \"The End\" slide, which a frustrated Daffy pushes off camera, screaming, \"NO, NO!\" as he does so. Daffy suggests that he and the animator go their separate ways and (hoping, against hope, that nothing further will happen) begins a dance routine which is quickly interrupted when the film runs out of alignment, resulting in two Daffys on the screen. They argue with each other and almost start a fight, but one Daffy is erased just as the other throws a punch.\n\nThe animator then turns Daffy into a pilot and draws him into an airplane. The duck excitedly flies around until a mountain is drawn in his path. The plane crashes off-screen, leaving Daffy with nothing but the plane's steering wheel and windshield. He \"bails\" out of the plane's remains and floats downward with his parachute which is replaced with an anvil. Crashing to the ground, a disoriented Daffy hammers the anvil while dizzily reciting \"The Village Blacksmith\". The animator changes the anvil into an artillery shell which explodes after a few more hammer strikes. Daffy finally snaps and angrily demands that the animator reveal himself; they do, but not before drawing a door around Daffy and closing it on him. The camera pulls back and reveals the guilty party to be Bugs Bunny at a drawing table, who turns around and says to the audience: \"Ain't I a stinker?\"\n\n\nAccording to director Chuck Jones, this film demonstrated for the first time that animation can create \"characters\" with a recognizable personality, independent of their appearance, milieu, or voice. Although Bugs Bunny (who declares \"Ain't I a stinker?\") is revealed to be the unseen animator, Jones comments that the ending was just for comedic value: Jones (the director) is speaking to the audience directly, asking \"Who is Daffy Duck anyway? Would you recognize him if I did \"this\" to him? What if he didn't live in the woods? Didn't live anywhere? What if he had no voice? No face? What if he wasn't even a duck anymore?\" In all cases, Daffy is still Daffy; not all cartoon characters can claim such distinctive personality.\n\n\"Duck Amuck\" is included in the compilation film \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie,\" along with other favorite Chuck Jones cartoons including \"What's Opera, Doc?\"\n\nMel Blanc performed the voices. It was directed by Chuck Jones with a story by Michael Maltese. The film contains many examples of self-referential humor, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nIn 1999 the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. This was the second of three animated shorts by Jones to receive this honor (the others are 1957's \"What's Opera, Doc?\" and 1955's \"One Froggy Evening\"). Jones has the distinction of being the only director () with three animated shorts in the registry.\n\nThe cartoon's plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, \"Rabbit Rampage\" (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator (Elmer Fudd). A similar plot was also included in the episode \"Duck's Reflucks\" of \"Baby Looney Tunes,\" in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. It is done once again with Daffy tormenting Bugs in the \"New Looney Tunes\" episode \"One Carroter in Search of an Artist\" (for this reason, this version has garnered the alternative name \"Rabbit Rampage II\" among series fans) with the technology updated and the pencil and paintbrush replaced by a digital pen.\n\nIn issue #94 of the \"Looney Tunes\" comic, Bugs Bunny gets his back at Daffy Duck by making him the victim, in switching various movie roles, from Duck Twacy in \"Who Killed Daffy Duck\",\" a video game character, and a talk show host, and they always wind up with Daffy starring in \"Moby Dick\" (the story's running gag). After this, Bugs comments, \"Eh, dis guy needs a new agent.\"\n\n\n\"The Village Blacksmith\" by Longfellow\n"}
{"id": "1241597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1241597", "title": "Enigma (2001 film)", "text": "Enigma (2001 film)\n\nEnigma is a 2001 espionage thriller film directed by Michael Apted from a screenplay by Tom Stoppard. The script was adapted from the novel \"Enigma\" by Robert Harris, about the Enigma codebreakers of Bletchley Park in the Second World War.\n\nAlthough the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the Katyn massacre is highlighted. It was the last film scored by John Barry.\n\nThe story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the Second World War was at its height. The cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, have a problem: the Nazi U-boats have changed one of their code reference books used for Enigma machine ciphers, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval signals intelligence. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the \"Shark\" cipher once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.\n\nThe film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.\n\nMr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an MI5 agent, Wigram (Jeremy Northam), who plays cat and mouse with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.\n\nBut someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.\n\nThe film was shot on location in England, Scotland and the Netherlands, with Bletchley Park mansion substituted by Chicheley Hall. Other locations include the Great Central Railway, Loughborough and Tigh Beg Croft, near Oban, Scotland. Interiors were filmed at Elstree Film Studios.\n\nThe film was produced by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones. Jagger makes a cameo appearance as an RAF officer at a dance. He also lent the film's design department a four-rotor Enigma encoding machine he owned to ensure the historical accuracy of one of the props. The festivities around the London premiere of the film are shown in the 2001 documentary \"Being Mick\".\n\nCritical reviews were largely positive, but there was criticism of the largely fictional storyline, which neither mentions the real codebreaker, Alan Turing, nor gives due credit to the Polish cryptanalysis foundation, the Biuro Szyfrów (Cipher Bureau). The film holds a 'fresh' 72% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading, 'The well-crafted, twist-filled Enigma is a thinking person's spy thriller.' Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" compared the film to works by Alfred Hitchcock, and remarked that, 'Overall, \"Enigma\" plays fair and square while generating suspense with its twisty plot. And while it requires a generous suspension of disbelief to accept a few action-hero gestures by the deeply troubled Jericho, Scott is persuasive and compelling enough as his complex character to drive the narrative.'\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars and said, 'What I like about the movie is its combination of suspense and intelligence. If it does not quite explain exactly how decryption works (how could it?), it at least gives us a good idea of how decrypters work, and we understand how crucial Bletchley was—so crucial its existence was kept a secret for 30 years.' On the other end, Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" was far less impressed, saying, 'The legend of how the British cracked the almighty Enigma must have sounded, on paper, like a nifty mathematical thriller—a historic WarGames set at the formative moment of the computer age. On screen, however, Enigma plays as if the scriptwriter, Tom Stoppard, and the director, Michael Apted, were themselves cryptographers; they seem to be making hunt-and-peck stabs at how to translate a tale of arcane numeric formulas into drama.'\n\nThe film and, by association, the book have attracted criticism for their portrayal of the Polish role in Enigma decryption. The historian Norman Davies argues that in the film the fictitious traitor turns out to be Polish, but only slight mention is made of the contributions of prewar Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologists to Allied Enigma decryption efforts, but historically, the only known traitor active at Bletchley Park was British spy John Cairncross, who passed crucial secrets to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe film hints that Dougray Scott’s character the brilliant Cambridge mathematician Thomas Jericho is the main code-breaker at Bletchley, equating him with Alan Turing, the original creator of the British Bombe, with the words of Mr Wigram, played by Jeremy Northam:\n“But what if someone tells them just how we do do it? Your thinking machine, clackity-clack, day and night, programmed with a menu, thanks to your big brain, that reduces the odds to just a few million-to-one until it locks on to the winning combination. There goes the war…”\nOf course Jericho is a totally fictional character, given that Turing was homosexual and only had a platonic relationship with his short-lived fiancé Joan Clarke, who knew about his sexual orientation. In reality it was unlikely that Turing was involved in code-breaking the Naval four-rotor Enigma Shark in 1943. Notes by Tony Sale do not mention Turing as the “someone in Bletchley Park [who] realised that Short Weather Signals were sent in the three wheel mode” and explained “the Central Met. Station had collated the U-Boat and other reports, [and] they broadcast a general synoptic in their own Met. Code”, which used the standard International Met. Code further encoded using bigram tables, as discovered by Mr Archer from the Met. section of Bletchley Park. According to Hugh Alexander, from June 1943 Joan Clarke, Mahon, Pendered and Noskwith, were responsible for the whole of the cryptographic work until the end of the war. Strangely Joan Clarke is not present in the film as none of the team of cryptanalysts are female.\n\nIn the film Cave, from Naval Intelligence, played by Matthew Macfadyen, mentioned Fasson and Grazier gave their lives to rescue the code books from a sinking submarine. There were actually three men who retrieved the books: First Lieutenant Anthony Fasson, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and 16-year old Tommy Brown from the canteen. Fasson and Grazier did drown while attempting to retrieve electrical equipment from U Boat U-559 (which Cave describes as its four-rotor enigma) on 30 October 1942, while Brown survived only to die in a house fire during shore-leave before the end of the war. Fasson and Grazier were awarded the George Cross posthumously and Brown was awarded the George Medal. Fictional character Cave states he was completing his last posting on a destroyer, in November ’42, when the books were acquired.\n\nThere are historical records of the break in the ability of the British to decode the Naval enigma from 10 to 19 March 1943 when the third edition of the weather short signal codebook was deployed.\n\nThe Katyn massacre, revealed after the discovery of mass graves of 4,500 Polish officers as depicted in the film, is a historical atrocity committed by Stalinist Russia in 1940. There is no evidence that details of the mass graves were intercepted by British intelligence, although it is possible. The first announcement of the discovery was broadcast by Radio Berlin on 13 April 1943.\n\n\n"}

Evans & Company as a 419-page hardback book containing 440 quotations and sources. The book examines the history of fascism and based on the growth of big business and big government describes possible political scenarios for a future United States. According to a 1981 review in the journal \"Social Justice\", the book is described as \"timely\" on a subject requiring serious consideration and is about the dangers of fascism, focusing primarily on the United States, but being aware that monopoly capitalism needs to be understood internationally since capitalism \"is not a national mode of production\".\n\nIn 2016, the book prompted the following response right after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States: \"The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they'll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show. [...] That’s how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over\".\n\nAccording to Jason Epstein, editor, publisher and book reviewer for \"The New York Review of Books\", \"\"Friendly Fascism\" [...] reflects what seems to be a widespread feeling among liberals as well as conservatives that democracy in America has played itself out: that soon Americans won’t be able to govern themselves\". According to Gaddis Smith, professor emeritus of history at Yale University and an expert on American foreign relations, the book is an \"insightful lament over the growth of centralized power by business and government in alliance under the direction of faceless managers who [...] are replacing democracy with a form of benevolent fascism\". Writing on behalf of \"Eclectica Magazine\", reviewer Dale Wharton comments that the book offers \"faint hope of averting neofascism\", but as a possible offset suggests raising aspirations, notably by \"setting forth clear lofty goals, broad enough to embrace a great majority\". Help may come from insiders since \"bubbling upward from all levels of the Establishment are longings for fulfilling employment disconnected from consumer exploitation, environmental degradation, or militarism\". \n\nReviewer Dennis Phillips notes in the \"Australian Journal of Law & Society\" that Gross wrote \"Friendly Fascism\" before Ronald Reagan had become President of the United States, but Reagan's United States, presumed in part to be a result of neofascist techniques described in the book, had \"proven Bertram Gross to be an amazingly astute prophet . [...] The evidence for this [in the book] is stunning\".

This often resulted in long delays in web page loading, where the user had to wait for each attempted IPv6 connection to time out before the IPv4 connection was tried. These timeouts ranged from being near-instantaneous in the best cases, to taking anywhere between four seconds to three minutes. \n\nIPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a solved problem for almost all practical purposes, following improvements at both the transport and application layers. \n\nAs of May 2011, IPv6 brokenness as measured by instrumenting a set of mainstream Norwegian websites was down to ~0.015%, most of which was caused by older versions of Mac OS X which would often prefer non-working IPv6 connectivity when it was not justified. \nThis behavior was fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.5, and is likely to decline further as Mac OS X 10.6.5 and subsequent versions roll out to a wider audience. However, there was no upgrade path for PowerPC-based Macs.\n\nThe main remaining problem for Mac OS X was the presence of rogue routers, such as wrongly configured Windows Internet Connection Sharing devices pretending to have IPv6 connectivity, while 6to4 tunneled IPv6 traffic is blocked at a firewall. Another problem was pre-10.50 versions of Opera.\n\nFollowing World IPv6 Day in July 2011, there were reports of a substantial reduction in IPv6 brokenness as a result of that experiment. In the year following the trial, but prior to the World IPv6 Launch date, brokenness levels were reported to have risen slowly back upwards again towards 0.03%.\n\nGoogle, a major provider of services on the Internet, experimented with using a type of DNS whitelisting on a per-ISP basis to prevent this until the World IPv6 Launch. In the DNS whitelisting approach, ISPs are determined from DNS lookup source IP addresses by correlating them with network prefixes derived from routing tables. There is an IETF draft entitled \"IPv6 AAAA DNS Whitelisting Implications\" that describes the issues around whitelisting. AAAA records are only sent to ISPs that can demonstrate that they are providing reliable IPv6 to their customers. Other ISPs are sent only A records, thus preventing users from attempting to connect over IPv6. \n\nNumerous concerns were been raised about the practicality of DNS whitelisting as a long-term large-scale solution, such as scalability and maintenance issues relating to the maintenance of large numbers of bilateral agreements. In 2010, several of the major web service providers met to discuss pooling their DNS whitelisting information in an attempt to avoid these scaling problems.\n\nIt appears that no major content providers eventually ended up using the whitelisting approach, given that all that had previously declared an interest began serving AAAA records to generic DNS queries following World IPv6 Launch Day. Google now provides AAAA records to all DNS servers except for those on a limited list of subnets which Google excludes from AAAA record service.\n\nAs of 2017, IPv6 brokenness is now generally regarded as a non-problem. This is due to two factors: firstly, IPv6 transport is much improved, so that the underlying error rate is much reduced, and secondly, that common applications such as web browsers now use fast fallback methods such as the \"Happy Eyeballs\" algorithm to select whichever protocol works best. Some operating system vendors have rolled fast fallback algorithms into their higher-level network stack APIs, thus making the solution available for all programs that use those APIs to make connections.\n\n\n"}

The performance was supposed to be an exhibition of scientific experiments; however, Lichtenberg considered it to be a magic show. He was angered by the alleged deception and posted the following satire in order to persuade people to avoid the performance. As a result of the extravagant claims that were posted, Philadelphia left Göttingen without giving any exhibitions.\n\nThe Avertissement reads as follows:\n\n\"Warning\"\n\nAll fanciers of supernatural physics will, by this poster, be made known that a few days ago, the world-famous magician Philadelphus Philadelphia, who has been mentioned by Cardanus in his book on the nature of the supernatural by calling him the envy of Heaven and Hell, has arrived here on the ordinary mail coach, although it would have been equally easy for him to have come through the air. He is the same person who, in 1482, in an open marketplace in Venice, cast a coil of twine into the air and climbed up until he was no longer seen. Beginning on the ninth of January of this year, he will present, openly and secretly, to the public's eyes, his one-Thaler tricks in the local department store. The tricks will improve every week until he finally arrives at the 500 Louis d'Or tricks, among which are those that can be said, without boasting, to surpass the wonderful itself, and be even, so to say, virtually impossible. He had the graciousness to perform these same tricks to great applause before all of the high potentates in all four parts of the world. He even performed in the fifth part of the world a few weeks ago for her majesty Queen Oberea of Tahiti.\n\nHe can be seen here every day, at all hours, except not on Mondays and Thursdays, when he expels melancholy thoughts at the venerable Congress of his countrymen in Philadelphia. Also, not from 11 a.m. to 12 noon because he is engaged in Constantinople, and not from 12 noon to 1 p.m., when he lunches.\n\nFrom the one-Thaler, common, everyday tricks, we want to indicate some, but not the best. Rather, we'll refer to those that can be described in a few words.\n\n1) He removes, without leaving the room, the weather cock from the St. Jacobi church (Göttingen) and sets it on top of the St. Johannis church (Göttingen). On the other hand, he puts the flag from the St. Johannis church on the St. Jacobi church. After they have been there for a few minutes, he brings them back to their proper places. Note: everything is done without magnets, through mere speed.\n\n2) He takes two ladies from the audience, positions them with their heads on the table and lets them turn their legs upward. Then, he pushes them so that they, with unbelievable speed, twist themselves like curls, without damage to their head dress or the respectability of the alignment of their dresses, to the greatest satisfaction of all present.\n\n3) He takes six half-ounces of the best arsenic, grinds it, and cooks it in two cans of milk. He then treats it to the ladies. As soon as they become sick, he gives them two or three spoonfuls of melted lead to drink. The audience then becomes cheerful and breaks out in laughter.\n\n4) He takes an axe and strikes a bonnet with it. The bonnet falls to the ground as though it is dead. On the ground, he gives it a second blow. The bonnet then rises immediately and asks, in a general way: \"What music is that?\" In other respects, it is in as good condition as before.\n\n5) He gently extracts teeth from three or four ladies, puts the teeth in a bag, and lets the audience carefully shake them. Then he loads them into a small cannon and fires it at the aforementioned ladies. After this, they all have their teeth again, pure and white.\n\n6) A metaphysical trick. He shows that something actually can be and not be at the same time. This requires great preparation and expense, but he performs it for only one Thaler in honor of the University of Göttingen.\n\n7) He takes all of the watches, rings, and jewels, as well as gold cash when it is required, from the audience who is present. He then issues everyone an I.O.U.. After this, he throws everything in a suitcase and travels with it to Kassel. Eight days later, each person tears up their I.O.U.. After it is torn, the watches, rings, and jewelry reappear. He has earned much money with this trick.\n\nNote: This week, he is still in the upper room of the department store. But, in the future, he will be high in the free air over the fountain in the market place. There, whoever pays nothing will see nothing.\n\nGöttingen\n\nJanuary 7, 1777\n\nPhilosopher Arthur Schopenhauer made reference to the sixth trick in his discussion of Kant's description of the antinomy (conflict of laws) of pure reason (\"Critique of Pure Reason\", A406).

An ancient story is when Zeus was at war against Cronus and the Titans, he released his brothers, Hades and Poseidon, along with the Cyclopes. In turn, the Cyclopes gave Zeus the thunderbolt as a weapon, which was near the beginning of Zeus himself. The thunderbolt became a popular symbol of Zeus and continues to be today. He used the thunderbolt to destroy Kayla the goddess.\n\nIn Slavic mythology the highest god of the pantheon is Perun, the god of thunder and lightning.\n\nPērkons/Perkūnas is the common Baltic god of thunder, one of the most important deities in the Baltic pantheon. In both Latvian and Lithuanian mythology, he is documented as the god of thunder, rain, mountains, oak trees and the sky.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and the sound of thunder comes from the chariot he rides across the sky. The lightning comes from his hammer Mjölnir.\n\nIn Finnish mythology, Ukko (engl. \"Old Man\") is the god of thunder, sky and weather. The Finnish word for thunder is \"ukkonen\", derived from the god's name.\n\nIn Judaism, a blessing \"...He who does acts of creation\" is to be recited, upon sighting lightning. The Talmud refers to the Hebrew word for the sky, (\"Shamaim\") – as built from fire and water (\"Esh Umaim\"), since the sky is the source of the inexplicable mixture of \"fire\" and water that come together, during rainstorms. This is mentioned in various prayers and discussed in writings of Kabbalah.\n\nIn Islam, the Quran states: \"He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunder-bolts and smiteth with them whom He will.\" (Qur'an 13:12–13) and, \"Have you not seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it...\" (Quran, 24:43). The preceding verse, after mentioning clouds and rain, speaks about hail and lightning, \"...And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills.\"\n\nIn India, the Hindu god Indra is considered the god of rains and lightning and the king of the Devas.\n\nIn Japan, the Shinto god Raijin is considered the god of lightning and thunder. He is depicted as a demon who strikes a drum to create lightning.\n\nIn the traditional religion of the African Bantu tribes, such as the Baganda and Banyoro of Uganda, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. The Baganda specifically attribute the lightning phenomenon to the god Kiwanuka, one of the main trio in the Lubaale gods of the sea or lake. Kiwanuka starts wild fires, strikes trees and other high buildings, and a number of shrines are established in the hills, mountains and plains to stay in his favor. Lightning is also known to be invoked upon one's enemies by uttering certain chants, prayers, and making sacrifices.\n\nCeraunoscopy is divination by observing lightning or by listening to thunder. It is a type of aeromancy. People have also sought to control lightning by conducting rituals or casting spells.\n"}

It displays objects from the collections of the Musée du Louvre that are lent to the gallery on a medium- or long-term basis. The Louvre-Lens annex is part of an effort to provide access to French cultural institutions for people who live outside of Paris. Though the museum maintains close institutional links with the Louvre, it is primarily funded by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.\n\nBecause of criticism that French art and culture is limited to Paris, the Ministry of Culture and the Louvre Directorate launched a plan, in 2003, to build a Louvre satellite museum in one of the 22 Regions of France. Only the Nord pas de Calais applied for the museum and proposed six cities: Lille, Lens, Valenciennes, Calais, Béthune and Boulogne-sur-Mer. In 2004, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, then French Prime Minister, announced Lens as the recipient city.\n\nThe museum site was chosen in hopes of reversing the fortunes of the depressed Lens mining community, which was devastated by both World Wars and the Nazi occupation, and suffered multiple mining catastrophes including the Courrières mine disaster, the worst in European history, and a 1974 tragedy killing 42 miners. The last mine in Lens closed in 1986, which caused the unemployment rate to rise well above the French national average. \"France abandoned us when the coal stopped, and we became a ghost town\", said Pas-de-Calais president Daniel Percheron.\n\nOfficials took inspiration from the economic transformation of the Spanish industrial municipality Bilbao, which was caused, in part, by the construction of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao satellite (dubbed the \"Bilbao effect\", though some cautioned that the comparison is limited due to the much smaller population of Lens, and its lack of other tourist attractions.) Some Lens locals were critical of the project; they felt that the project to bring culture to their city was \"patronizing\". Other critics pointed out that the museum makes no attempt to address Lens's turbulent history or its current economic difficulties.\n\nA worldwide design contest was won by Japanese architectural firm SANAA in collaboration with New York firm Imrey Culbert, French landscape architect Catherine Mosbach, and museographer Studio Adrien Gardère. The construction company Eiffage was chosen to construct the Lens-based Louvre branch, ultimately costing 150 million Euro (£121.6 million). The Louvre-Lens Museum, SANAA + Imrey Culbert's first building in France, was awarded the \"Prix d'architecture de l'Equerre d'Argent\" for 2013.\n\nThe French government hopes that the location near the northern border of France will be a draw for English, Belgian, and German tourists. In addition, the Louvre-Lens is near several World War memorials, including the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, approximately 15 minutes from the Louvre-Lens.\n\nThe museum is built on a mining site that closed in the 1960s. The area is slightly elevated due to filling in of the mine. To make the building blend into the surrounding area, the architects designed a string of five low-profile structures; the central one is square with glass walls and the others are rectangular with polished, aluminum facades that gave a blurry reflection of the surroundings. Altogether, the museum is long and contains of exhibition space.\nThe design of a central building flanked by two wings mimics the Paris Louvre. The square, central building is the main reception area. It contains several curved glass rooms that contain a cafeteria, bookstore and museum boutique. To the east of the entry hall is the Galerie du Temps which houses approximately 200 items from the Paris Louvre collection. The items in the large, open hall are arranged chronologically, from 3,500 BC to the mid-19th century, regardless of style or country of origin. Beyond the Galerie du Temps is the Pavillon de Verre which exhibits works from neighboring museums. The building to the west of the entry hall is a gallery for temporary exhibits (the Exhibitions Temporaires) and, beyond that, an auditorium. \n\nThe Exhibitions Temporaires is dedicated to exhibits which last 3 months. The first exhibition, titled \"Renaissance\", included Leonardo da Vinci's recently restored \"The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.\" The second exhibit was dedicated to Rubens and included 170 of his works.\n\nOn Dec 4, 2012, President François Hollande, alongside first lady Valérie Trierweiler, the Minister of Culture Aurélie Filippetti, the director of Le Louvre Henri Loyrette, the mayor of Lens Guy Delcourt, and former prime ministers Lionel Jospin and Pierre Mauroy officially opened the Louvre-Lens. The following weekend, the museum welcomed its first visitors; three weeks after the opening, the museum welcomed its 100,000th visitor. In May 2013, during Long Night of Museums 2013, 500,000 visitors viewed the masterpieces displayed in the Louvre-Lens Museum. While visitors were anticipated for the first year (while admission was free), the year's final tally was approximately .\n\nOn Feb 7 2013, a woman vandalized a major masterpiece of the museum, \"Liberty Guiding the People\", writing \"AE911\" on it with a black marker, possibly a reference to a group calling itself \"Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth\".

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and was also known as Deacon Richard Hale House.\n\nConnecticut Landmarks operates the house a late 18th-century historic house museum, however, they are currently facing an investigation by the attorney general's office into their alleged neglect of the Homestead and its artifacts.\n\nNathan Hale was a spy for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. A graduate of Yale, he taught school for two years, first in East Haddam, then in New London.\n\nAfter being captured by the British, Hale reportedly gave a speech stating that his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.\n\nAfter he was hanged, his body was not returned and was never found. There is a monument to him in a cemetery in his hometown of Coventry, Connecticut.\n\nNathan Hale is Connecticut's state hero.\n\nDespite the name of the property, Nathan Hale never lived in the house that is named for him. As a child, he did live in a home that was located in the same spot. This house was razed by his parents in order to create a larger living space for the family.\n\nNews of Nathan's death came when his family grew concerned for his well-being. His brother traveled from Coventry to Old Saybrook to meet with the army and inquire about Nathan's whereabouts. He was informed that Nathan had been killed and was given a trunk of his belongings. This trunk is in the house.\nAfter the Hale family, the house was sold to a series of other families who used it as a private residence, and the story of Nathan Hale became forgotten as just another story of a fallen soldier. However, a Connecticut lawyer named George Dudley Seymour became fascinated by the story while living in New Haven and was instrumental in the effort to recognize Hale's efforts. After championing the cause of erecting a statue of Nathan Hale at Yale University, Seymour learned that the farm in Coventry, which had been owned by Nathan's father, the Reverend Deacon Richard Hale, was for sale and in disrepair. He purchased the property in 1914 and restored the house to its original dignity, furnishing it with Connecticut antiques and artifacts, including Nathan's trunk.\n\nIn addition, he purchased the property across the street. Named the Strong-Porter House, it was the home of Nathan's grandmother, and is also a museum and on the list of National Registered Historic Places.\n\nIn a further effort to recognize Nathan Hale's sacrifice, Seymour also convinced the federal government to print a Nathan Hale postage stamp in 1925. The stamp was designed by artist Bela Lyon Pratt, who also created the statue of Nathan at Fort Nathan Hale in New Haven.\n\nSeymour was of the belief that the homestead was haunted. According to a diary entry, he and a friend reportedly viewed the spirit of Reverend Deacon Hale through a window one rainy night. Also believed to be in residence is the spirit of Lydia Carpenter, a servant of the Hale family, and of Joseph Hale, Nathan's brother.\n\nMary Elizabeth Campbell Griffith, the widow of a former caretaker of the homestead, believed that the house might have been haunted by John and Sarah Hale, Nathan's brother and sister-in-law.\n\nSurrounding the house is the Nathan Hale State Forest, maintained by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\n\nNext to the house is a corn field that is planted every year. In October, friends of the Hale Homestead put on a haunted corn maze.\n\nIn front of the homestead is a triangular grassy plot of land containing maple trees planted by Nathan's nephew David Hale Junior in 1812. The area has come to be known as the Holy Grove, in part because neighbors used to hold prayer meetings there.\n\n\n"}

It sought to gather militants regardless of their political affiliation. A short-lived movement that was formed in 1962 and carried out numerous small skirmishes and actions culminating in a seven-month peak of militant actions in 1965, the ELN was largely scattered by the Peruvian Army by December 1965.\n\nThe group had a varied composition that grew to share a \"certain disdain of 'politics' and suspicion of any type of party organisation\", as well as a few discontent members from the Peruvian Communist Party. This new movement included some former members of the MIR youth branch.\n\nHector Bejar , one of the military commanders of the ELN, later summarised it as an attempt to create a \"free association of revolutionaries\" and \"an army which would draw combatants together regardless of their ideologies or political affiliations\". Following their collapse, Bejar remarked that one of their core mistakes had been not liaising and keeping communications open with larger revolutionary movements that could have supported them as they were attacked by the Peruvian Army; instead, they had opted to believe they could remain self-sufficient and rely on local recruits from the villages and plantations.\n\nIn 1962, the group considered itself under the leadership of Juan Pablo Chang Navarro.\n\n\nThe ELN formed mobile training groups, desiring to have professional guerrillas sent into the rugged terrain rather than untrained volunteers. Approximately fifty group members were also believed to be entering southern Peru from Bolivia, after receiving training in Cuba. The group received assistance from the Bolivian Rodolfo Saldaña, who left later that year to fight in Argentina.\n\nIn January 1963, a group led by the 21-year-old poet Javier Heraud and Alain Elias crossed through Bolivia, where they picked up weapons and entered southern Peru. Plagued by Leishmaniasis infection, however, the 15-member team decided to enter the city of Puerto Maldonado on May 15 to seek out medical supplies.\n\nAccording to one source, the local police were warned of the group's advance, and captured the six team members who had been sent to the city limits. According to other sources, the six militants had checked into the local hotel, and a police officer who heard about it went to the hotel to demand identifying documents from the youth. When they refused to show identification, other officers were called and escorted them towards the local prison; one of the guerrillas drew a gun and killed Sgt. Aquilino Sam Jara. The officers returned fire, wounding two of the militants as the others ran off hoping to escape capture. Either way, Elias, Abraham Lama and Pedro Morote were all captured within days of entering the town. Heraud was shot in the chest and killed while he drifted past the town in a dugout canoe. Hector Bejar was one of the few to escape, and it proved difficult for him to rebuild the militant group.\n\nIn 1965, when MIR announced they were beginning militant operations in response to the arrest of Hugo Blanco and the accession of the government of Fernando Belaunde Terry, the ELN was still not ready to begin operations, but felt pressured to become operational prematurely. It formed the \"Javier Heraud Brigade\" as their main column and moved into the densely forested foothills of San Miguel in April.\n\nIn June 1965, the ELN seized the Runateullo hacienda and destroyed the bridge on the Satipo highway that led to it, attacked a local mine, and assaulted the police station. The group also launched an ambush at Yahuarina, where 17 ELN militants attacked a group of Civil Guards, killing nine, wounding nine and taking twelve prisoners (who were later released). Government officials later claimed there was evidence that the dead had been tortured.\n\nThat summer, Guillermo Lobaton led a group of ELN militants who attacked an Army Ranger encampment, capturing weapons and supplies; it was this action which first publicised the name of the \"Javier Heraud Brigade\".\n\nOn September 25, 1965, the ELN led the seizure of the Chapi hacienda and execution of the two brothers who oversaw the plantation. The Carillo brothers, who owned the estate which extended over a large area of the La Mar Province, were alleged to have been cruel to their indentured and unpaid workers, frequently whipping and imprisoning them, and, in one January 1963 instance, to have strangled and beheaded a tenant farmer who objected to their seizure of his livestock. Following reports of the death of the brothers, the Civil Guard occupied the plantation to the jeers of the workers.\n\nIn October, following the overthrow of the Chapi hacienda, the Peruvian Army began a large counterattack aimed at wiping out the ELN. First sending a patrol disguised as militants asking local residents where they could find their comrades, the Army quickly rooted out sympathisers and collaborators. According to the ELN, the locals were tortured and executed.\n\nAs the group was encircled towards the end of 1965, membership dwindled until there were only 13 remaining guerrillas still hiding in the forests together.\n\nOn December 17, the army made substantial contact with the group near Tincoj and the ensuing firefight left three militants dead, including Edgardo Tello. Bejar and the remaining militants scattered into the forest and were unable to regroup as they fled the army's advance separately.\n\nNot every group member's fate is known. Juan Pablo Chang Navarro (known as \"El Chino\"), Jose Cabrera Flores (known as \"El Negro\") and Lucio Galvan (known as \"Eustaquio\") were all believed killed in 1967, fighting alongside Che Guevara in the Nancahuazu. Although one source suggests that Navarro survived, and actually tried to revive the militant movement in 1980 under the same name. Their remains are in the Che Guevara's memorial in Santa Clara, Cuba.\n\nAmerican ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson used the 1963 skirmish as evidence that Fidel Castro was destabilising the hemisphere, in an oral statement to Soviet ambassador Anatoliy F. Dobrynin.\n\nBejar was arrested when he fled to Lima to seek medical treatment due to leishamaniasis; authorities said they surprised him convalescing in a Lima residence. He served five years in prison for sedition before being pardoned by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, who took power in 1968, and requested that Bejar work on reforming land policies with the government.\n\nBejar collaborated with Velasco's Government, being part of SINAMOS, a Government institution for social participation. In the seventies, Bejar and former members of SINAMOS formed CEDEP (Centre for Development and Participation) and was part of the edition committee of 'Socialismo y Participacion' (Socialism and participation), a social sciences journal. Bejar was 'Socialismo y Participacion' editor until its final issue in 2001. Bejar works today as lecturer at San Marcos University. and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru. In 2012, he published 'Mito y Utopia: Relato Alternativo del origen Republicano del Peru' (Myth and Utopia: Alternative story of the Republican Origin of Peru).ACHEBE Ediciones, 2012.\n\n"}

It is located in Parkes, Canberra, ACT.\n\nThe National Library of Australia, while formally established by the passage of the \"National Library Act 1960\" (Cth), had been functioning as a national library rather than strictly a Parliamentary Library, almost since its inception.\n\nIn 1901, a Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was established to serve the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia. From its inception the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was driven to development of a truly national collection. In 1907 the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee under the Chairmanship of the Speaker, Sir Frederick William Holder defined the objective of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library in the following words:\n\nThe Library Committee is keeping before it the ideal of building up, for the time when Parliament shall be established in the Federal Capital, a great Public Library on the lines of the world-famed Library of Congress at Washington; such a library, indeed, as shall be worthy of the Australian Nation; the home of the literature, not of a State, or of a period, but of the world, and of all time.\nThe present library building was opened on 15 August 1968 by Prime Minister John Gorton. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Bunning and Madden. The foyer is decorated in marble, with stained-glass windows by Leonard French and three tapestries by Mathieu Matégot.\n\nIn 2012–13 the Library collection comprised 6,496,772 items, with an estimated additional 2,325,900 items held in the manuscripts collection. The Library's collections of Australiana have developed into the nation's single most important resource of materials recording the Australian cultural heritage. , and are actively sought and well represented—whether published in Australia or overseas.\n\nThe Library's collection includes all formats of material, from books, journals, websites and manuscripts to pictures, photographs, maps, music, oral history recordings, manuscript papers and ephemera.\n\nApproximately 92.1% of the Library's collection has been catalogued and is discoverable through the online catalogue.\n\nThe Library has digitized over 174,000 items from its collection (the 100,000th being http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3409117) and, where possible, delivers these directly across the Internet. The Library is a world leader in digital preservation techniques, and maintains an Internet-accessible archive of selected Australian websites called the Pandora Archive.\n\nThe Library collects material produced by Australians, for Australians or about the Australian experience in all formats—not just printed works—books, serials, newspapers, maps, posters, music and printed ephemera—but also online publications and unpublished material such as manuscripts, pictures and oral histories. A core Australiana collection is that of John A. Ferguson. The Library has particular collection strengths in the performing arts, including dance.\n\nThe Library's considerable collections of general overseas and rare book materials, as well as world-class Asian and Pacific collections which augment the Australiana collections.

The Library collects resources about all Asian countries in Western languages extensively, and resources in the following Asian languages: Burmese, Chinese, Persian, Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Manchu, Mongolian, Thai, Timorese, and Vietnamese.\n\nThe Library has acquired a number of important Western and Asian language scholarly collections from researchers and bibliophiles. These collections include:\n\n\nThe Asian Collections are searchable via the National Library's catalogue.\n\nThe National Library holds an extensive collection of pictures and manuscripts. The manuscript collection contains about 26 million separate items, covering in excess of 10,492 meters of shelf space (ACA Australian Archival Statistics, 1998). The collection relates predominantly to Australia, but there are also important holdings relating to Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and the Pacific. The collection also holds a number of European and Asian manuscript collections or single items have been received as part of formed book collections.\n\nThe Australian manuscript collections date from the period of maritime exploration and settlement in the 18th century until the present, with the greatest area of strength dating from the 1890s onwards. The collection includes a large number of outstanding single items, such as the 14th century Chertsey Cartulary, the journal of James Cook on the HM Bark Endeavour, inscribed on the Memory of the World Register in 2001, the diaries of Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills from the Burke and Wills expedition, and Charles Kingsford Smith's and Charles Ulm's log of the Southern Cross.\n\nA wide range of individuals and families are represented in the collection, with special strength in the fields of politics, public administration, diplomacy, theatre, art, literature, the pastoral industry and religion. Examples are the papers of Alfred Deakin, Sir John Latham, Sir Keith Murdoch, Sir Hans Heysen, Sir John Monash, Vance Palmer and Nettie Palmer, A.D. Hope, Manning Clark, David Williamson, W.M. Hughes, Sir Robert Menzies, Sir William McMahon, Lord Casey, Geoffrey Dutton, Peter Sculthorpe, Daisy Bates, Jessie Street, and Eddie Mabo and James Cook both of whose papers were inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001.\n\nThe Library has also acquired the records of many national non-governmental organisations. They include the records of the Federal Secretariats of the Liberal party, the A.L.P, the Democrats, the R.S.L., the Australian Inland Mission, the Australian Union of Students, The Australian Ballet, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust, the Australian Institute of Urban Studies, Australian Industries Protection League, the Australian Conservation Foundation, and the Australian Council of National Trusts. Finally, the Library holds about 37,000 reels of microfilm of manuscripts and archival records, mostly acquired overseas and predominantly of Australian and Pacific interest.\n\nThe National Library's Pictures collection focuses on Australian people, places and events, from European exploration of the South Pacific to contemporary events. Art works and photographs are acquired primarily for their informational value, and for their importance as historical documents.\n\nMedia represented in the collection include photographs, drawings, watercolours, oils, lithographs, engravings, etchings and sculpture/busts.\n\nThe large National Library building is home to various reading rooms and collections. On the ground floor is the Main Reading Room — this is where the bulk of the Library's Internet access terminals are located, and where wireless internet access is available. Services are also delivered on-site from the Newspaper & Family History zone on the ground floor, Special Collections Reading Room on the 1st floor, and Asian Collections on level 3.\n\nThe National Library of Australia provides a national leadership role in developing and managing collaborative online services with the Australian library community, making it easier for users to find and access information resources at the national level.\n\n\nThe National Library of Australia maintains a catalogue of the resources in its own collection which are available to the general public.\n\nTrove is an online library database aggregator, a centralised national service built with the collaboration of major libraries of Australia. Trove's most well known feature is the digitised collection of Australian newspapers. By June 2013 over 10 million digitised pages, or 100 million articles were accessible through Trove. Many of the NLA's resource discovery services have been fully integrated with Trove—meaning that several (such as \"music Australia\", \"pictures Australia\" and \"Australian newspapers\") are now accessible only through the site. Others (such as PANDORA and the ANBD) use Trove as their primary means of public access. The service is able to locate resources about Australia and Australians, which reaches many locations otherwise unavailable to external search engines.\n\n\n\n"}

The strip was drawn by (1913–1999) from 1950 to 1959.\n\nIt was initially released in the German magazine Quick.\n\nThe visual style of the comics is cartoony, but still realistic enough for the comic to be taken as a (at least mostly) serious detective comic. It is characterised by its unique style of humour, most of which derives from allusions to current political affairs in the Federal Republic of Germany of the 1950s.\n\nThe name Nick Knatterton is alluding to Nick Carter and Nat Pinkerton. Hist full name is Nikolaus Kuno Freiherr von Knatter. He was born in Kyritz (also called \"Kyritz an der Knatter\") to Casimir Kuno von Knatter and Corinna Pimpsberg.\n\nKnatterton always dresses in a Sherlock Holmes-style green plaid overcoat and cap, and smokes a pipe.\n\nHe is presented as the embodiment of a competent and effective private detective. He is not extraordinarily physically strong (although he keeps in good shape) and does not possess many fancy gadgets, but his mental capabilities, such as his power of deduction, his senses, his memory and knowledge of various topics, are incredibly good, to the point of caricature. As an example, Knatterton was once able to pinpoint his location after being thrown tied and blindfolded into the back of a van, thanks to memorising the entire map of the city and feeling the van's momentum with his body when turning corners.\n\nKnatterton's cases often involve wealthy aristocratic families with a public image to maintain. Many of the villains are recurring characters and acquainted with Knatterton and his clients, and they're usually good at heart, make up with their victims after being arrested, and everyone is happy at the end.\n\nFemale characters are often drawn as bombshells.\n\nA recurring location in the stories is the \"Alibi Bar\", a bar favoured by various shady characters. The handles on the bar's front door are shaped like section signs (\"§\"). In many stories, Knatterton has found out the real situation and been able to complete his deductions when visiting the \"Alibi Bar\", where he sometimes finds a wealthy family's teenage daughter and the man who stole her jewelry wrapped up in each other's arms.\n\nNick Knatterton's adventures were translated into many languages, and a television cartoon series was produced in 1978 by the creator's own studio. All 15 episodes of the show are available on DVD not only in Germany but also dubbed in Finland where it earned a Gold Record in three months. The show is narrated, with the narrator being in fact the only voice actor. Characters merely squeak when they are shown talking, and the narrator then explains what was said. Knatterton himself often voices out the conclusions of his deductions by saying \"Conclusion\" (German: \"(Ich) kombiniere!\", literally: \"I'm concluding!\"), followed by the conclusion itself. This has become a kind of catchphrase for him.\n\nThe comic has been adapted into two films:\n\n\n2007 and 2008 German based \"Der Audio Verlag\" published Nick Knatterton radio dramas in German.\n\n\n"}

Officially, ιt was semi-autonomous part of the broader National Liberation Front (EAM). In actual fact, it was not controlled by EAM, but directly by the Politburo of the KKE. It can be described as a paramilitary security force. It operated in the cities, and its purpose was the \"self-defense\" of the members of the National Liberation Front and its affiliated organizations from the German occupation authorities and the collaborationist government and its organs, the Police, the Gendarmerie (especially its notorious branch named as Special Security, expertised at the anti-communistic struggle) and the Security Battalions. It proved to be very successful in assassinating commanders of the Security Battalions and other armed governmental forces. However, it also became involved in political assassinations of political opponents of the then-Stalinist KKE on both ends of the political spectrum, such as Trotskyites and Archeio-Marxists. As a result, the activities of the OPLA are a subject of heated debate even today.\n\nThe organization was also active during the December 1944 events in Athens. Hundreds of executions of anti-communists took place in the vicinity of the ULEN refineries. Among the victims was also the well-known actress Eleni Papadaki.\n\nDuring the subsequent Greek Civil War, OPLA acted especially in Thessaloniki and Northern Greece in 1946–1947 (in these regions the name of the organization was Close Self-Defense, Στενή Αυτοάμυνα in Greek). One of its more notable later actions was the assassination of Justice Minister Christos Ladas (who had signed the execution of hundreds of communists) in Athens on 1 May 1948, by OPLA and KKE member Efstratios (Stratos) Moutsogiannis. In Macedonia and Epirus during the Civil War, the OPLA assassinated many high-ranking officers of the Greek Gendarmerie.\n\n"}

The movement is particularly strong in Latin America, where the left-wing Pink Tide has had an influence on politics in the region. According to Roger Merino examples of Post-neoliberal governments include the government of Evo Morales in Bolivia and the government of Rafael Correa in Ecuador. In the economic arena, the ideology advocates for the nationalization of numerous industries, and for the redistribution of wealth.\n\nThe idea of post-neoliberalism arose during the Pink Tide, where left-wing Latin American critics of neoliberalism like Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales were thrust into power in the 1990s and 2000s. While the ideas of post-neoliberalism aren't unique to Latin America, they are largely associated with the region.\n\nAccording to researchers, the election of Hugo Chavez as President of Venezuela in 1999 marked a definite start of the Pink Tide and post-neoliberal movement. Since then, Evo Morales, Néstor Kirchner, Rafael Correa, and numerous other leaders associated with the post-neoliberal movement were elected in Latin America.\n\nPost neoliberalism seeks to fundamentally change the role of the state in countries where the Washington Consensus once prevailed. To do this, many post-neoliberal leaders advocate for the nationalization of multiple industries, most notably the oil and gas industries and mining industries. Post-neoliberalism also advocates for the implementation of more numerous welfare benefits and more government action towards reducing poverty. Post neo-liberalism advocates for more state intervention in the economy, as seen in countries like Venezuela and Bolivia.\n\nPost-neoliberalism has drawn criticism from both the left and right of the political spectrum. Right-wing critics have claimed that post-neoliberalism is vague and populistic. They also claim that it harms international investment and economic development.\n"}

In 1768, Judge Nathaniel Ropes, Jr., purchased the house from Barnard's nephew. The Ropes family then inhabited the house until 1907, when the house was given to the Trustees of the Ropes Memorial for public benefit. \n\nAlthough altered through the years and then restored, the house looks much like its original form, with a symmetrical facade of two stories, three small pedimented gables through the roof, roof balustrade, and modillioned cornice.

The historic houses contain the collections and treasures of Philip Rosenbach and his younger brother Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach. The brothers owned the Rosenbach Company which became the preeminent dealer of rare books, manuscripts and decorative arts during the first half of the 20th century. Dr. Rosenbach in particular was seminal in the rare book world, helping to build libraries such as the Widener Library at Harvard, The Huntington Library and the Folger Shakespeare Library. In 2013, the Rosenbach became a subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation, but maintains its own board and operates independently of the public library system.\n\nThe Rosenbach documents a panorama of American and European culture through its vast historical, literary and artistic treasures.\n\nOn April 2, 2008, the Rosenbach received an official State Historical Marker by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in recognition of the lasting contributions of museum co-founder, Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach. The commission commemorated Dr. Rosenbach’s legacy as one of America’s greatest rare book dealers and his lasting contributions to Philadelphia and beyond with a marker in front of the museum, located at 2008-2010 Delancey Place Delancey Place (Philadelphia) in the city's historic Rittenhouse Square neighborhood.\nState Historical Marker Text:\n\"Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach\n\nAmong America’s most influential rare book dealers, he helped build many of the nation’s great libraries. He and his brother Philip established the Rosenbach to share their personal collection with the public. They lived on this block from 1926 to 1952.\"\nThe greater part of the house is furnished much as the Rosenbach brothers lived in it. The furniture is mainly 18th-century English with notable examples of the work of Chippendale, Vile, Adam, Hepplewhite and Sheraton. Other important pieces include an olivewood box with bronze doré mounts made for Charles II, an American recamier sofa with carving attributed to Samuel McIntire and a major Philadelphia highboy. A comprehensive collection of English silver and gold from the 17th and mid-18th centuries includes masterworks by Paul Storr, Hester Bateman and a choice group of items made for the British royal family. Over one thousand portrait miniatures are included in the collection, including one by Nicholas Hilliard of James I. Choice collections of 18th century porcelain, glass, paintings, drawings and sculpture are drawn upon to complete the furnishings.\n\nThe adjacent building, 2008 Delancey Place, was purchased by the foundation in January 1993 and allowed the museum to expand its facilities and exhibition space.\n\nThe Americana collection begins with accounts of early voyages and tales of exploration, which includes a copy of Antonio Pigafetta's account of Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe and rare tracts relating to the settlement of Virginia. The books are complemented, as is every other aspect of the collection, by manuscript material. This includes letters of Cortés, Pizarro and de Soto, including the 1532 letters of Cortés to the Council of the Indies seeking permission to form an expedition to explore the coast of California. The period of colonial settlement is well represented by early accounts and important religious tracts, particularly those relating to the various missions of the Indians, as well as a collection of Indian Captivity Tales.\n\nThe first three extant books printed in the western hemisphere are present in the Rosenbach's collections—Mexico 1543-44, Lima 1584-85, and the legendary Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in what is now the United States (Cambridge, Massachusetts 1661).\n\nThe American Revolution is documented with over one hundred letters written by George Washington, the original manuscript resolution of the Continental Congress, a superb collection of documents by signers of the Declaration of Independence, Commodore Barry's ship papers, which outline the beginnings of the American navy, and a set of Franklin's \"Poor Richard's Almanacs\", including the only known surviving copy of the 1733 first edition, first printing.\n\nThe period of western expansion is represented by early diaries and traveler's accounts, printed pocket guides and histories. Of particular importance is the material dealing with the Pacific Northwest, including diaries of the Oregon pioneers and the document signed by Andrew Johnson authorizing Seward to negotiate for the purchase of Alaska.\n\nMaterial from the Civil War is extensive. It consists of more than two hundred letters of Abraham Lincoln, one hundred and fifty war letters of Ulysses S. Grant, two of Robert E. Lee letters and the original Resolution signed by both houses of the United States Congress proposing the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery.\n\nChronologically this collection begins with a fine group of English literary manuscripts from the 15th century including Thomas Hoccleve's poems (1410) which contain a celebrated portrait of Chaucer. There is a major manuscript of the \"Canterbury Tales\" and a noble fragment of another illustrated version. A small and equally choice collection of books of the pre-Elizabethan and Elizabethan period is complemented by a collection of commonplace books. There is an extremely rare first edition of \"Pilgrim's Progress\" which was first owned by one of Bunyan's acquaintances from debtors' prison.\n\nThe majority of major British authors from the 18th century are represented by first editions of their more important works, and many of them by manuscript material as well. Some highlights are; Tonson's assignment copy of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", a group of Thomas Gray's letters, five leaves of the manuscript of James Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\" and the most extensive collection of Robert Burns manuscripts in existence.\n\nAs you enter into the 19th and 20th centuries the collection strengthens. There are manuscripts of Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Shelley and Keats (including a celebrated love letter to Fanny Brawne) and the only surviving fragment of Fitzgerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\". The Rosenbach also has a supreme Dickens collection extending from the earliest extant manuscript to a carte-de-viste photo signed on the day before his death. The collection also includes Dickens' manuscripts of \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and the \"Pickwick Papers\". Lewis Carroll is represented by over six hundred letters, early drawings, presentation books, photographs and his own first-edition copy of \"Alice in Wonderland\". Other manuscripts include the work of Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, Conan Doyle, Joseph Conrad and Dylan Thomas\n\nOne of the Museum's most valuable items is the handwritten manuscript of James Joyce's \"Ulysses.\" In honor of the work, the Museum hosts a Bloomsday celebration every year, including readings from excerpts of the book.\n\nAlso included at the Rosenbach is recreation of Marianne Moore's living room just as she lived in it. It was in this room that she lived and worked for more than forty years. Moore's complete library, with many personally inscribed and annotated books from her friends and contemporaries including Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot and Elizabeth Bishop, is part of the Rosenbach collections as well as all of her correspondence and drafts of her poetry and unpublished memoirs.\n\nFamed author and illustrator Maurice Sendak chose the Rosenbach to be the repository for his work in 1968-2014 thanks to shared literary and collecting interests. Sendak is the author and illustrator of \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and 108 other books. His collection of nearly 10,000 works of art, manuscripts, books and ephemera, has been the subject of many exhibitions at the Rosenbach and has been enjoyed by visitors of all ages. One of the most famous creators of contemporary children's books, Sendak’s work has challenged the norms of children's literature over time and continues to entrance both children and adults to this day. His innovative techniques and honest portrayal of childhood emotion are celebrated worldwide and have earned him several prestigious honors, including the Caldecott Book Medal (1964), the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal (1970), the National Medal of Arts (1996), a Library of Congress \"Living Legend\" medal (2000), and the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for Literature (2003). The Rosenbach presented \"There’s a Mystery There: Sendak on Sendak\" from May 6, 2008 through May 3, 2009. This major retrospective of over 130 pieces pulled from the museum’s vast Sendak collection – the biggest collection of “Sendakiana” in the world – was the largest and most ambitious exhibition of Sendak’s work ever created and featured original artwork, rare sketches, never-before-seen working materials and exclusive interview footage. The exhibition drew on a total of over 300 objects, with new works on display every four months, providing a unique experience with each set of illustrations.\n\nHis personal works were returned to his estate in 2014 and are now in the care of the Sendak Foundation. The Rosenbach is home to his rare book collection, which includes rare books by Herman Melville, Beatrix Potter, William Blake, and pop-up books by Lothar Meggendorfer.\n\nThe archive of book illustration contains many fine medieval illuminations and drawings by the great 18th-century French masters such as François Boucher, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean-Baptiste Le Prince and Hubert Gravelot.\n\n\n"}

While these common names may apply to several species, \"Squalus acanthias\" is distinguished by having two spines (one anterior to each dorsal fin) and lacks an anal fin. It is found mostly in shallow waters and further offshore in most parts of the world, especially in temperate waters. Spiny dogfish in the northern Pacific Ocean have recently been reevaluated and found to constitute a separate species, now known as \"Pacific spiny dogfish\", \"Squalus suckleyi\".\n\nThe spiny dogfish has dorsal fins, no anal fin, and dark green spots along its back. The caudal fin has asymmetrical lobes, forming a heterocercal tail.\nThe species name \"acanthias\" refers to the shark's two spines. These are used defensively. If captured, the shark can arch its back to pierce its captor. Glands at the base of the spines secrete a mild venom.\n\nMales mature at around 11 years of age, growing to in length; females mature in 18–21 years and are slightly larger than males, reaching . Both sexes are greyish brown in color and are countershaded. Males are identified by a pair of pelvic fins modified as sperm-transfer organs, or \"claspers\". The male inserts one clasper into the female cloaca during copulation.\n\nReproduction is aplacental viviparous, which was before called ovoviviparity. Fertilization is internal. The male inserts one clasper into the female oviduct orifice and injects sperm along a groove on the clasper's dorsal section. Immediately following fertilization, the eggs are surrounded by thin shells called \"candles\" with one candle usually surrounding several eggs. Mating takes place in the winter months with gestation lasting 22–24 months. Litters range between 2 and 11 but average 6 or 7.\n\nSpiny dogfish are bottom-dwellers. They are commonly found at depths of around , but have been found deeper than .\n\nLife span is estimated to be up to 100 years and their gestation period is 18 to 24 months, which may be the longest of any known animal.\n\nSpiny dogfish are consumed as human food in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Chile. The meat is primarily consumed in England, France, the Benelux countries and Germany. The fins and tails are processed into fin needles and are used in less expensive versions of shark fin soup in Chinese cuisine. In England this and other dogfish are sold in fish and chip shops as \"huss\", and it was historically sold as \"rock salmon\" until this term was outlawed by consumer legislation. In France it is sold as \"small salmon\" (\"saumonette\") and in Belgium and Germany it is sold as \"sea eel\" (\"zeepaling\" and \"Seeaal\", respectively). It is also used as fertilizer, liver oil, and pet food, and, because of its availability, cartilaginous skull, and manageable size, as a popular vertebrate dissection specimen, in both high schools and universities. Reported catches in 2000–2009 varied between 13,800 (2008) and 31,700 (2000) tonnes.\n\nBottom trawlers and sink gillnets are the primary equipment used to harvest spiny dogfish. In Mid-Atlantic and Southern New England fisheries, they are often caught when harvesting larger groundfish, classified as bycatch, and discarded. Recreational fishing accounts for an insignificant portion of the spiny dogfish harvest.\n\nThe Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance has sponsored an initiative which promotes local, sustainably caught use of the dogfish in restaurants and fish markets in the Cape Cod area of Massachusetts. The effort is funded by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and attempts to get the public to consume under utilized fish.\n\nOnce the most abundant shark species in the world, populations of \"Squalus acanthias\" have declined significantly. They are classified in the IUCN Red List of threatened species as Vulnerable globally and Critically endangered in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning stocks around Europe have decreased by at least 95%. This is a direct result of overfishing to supply northern Europe's taste for rock salmon, saumonette or zeepaling. Despite these alarming figures, very few management or conservation measures are in place for \"Squalus acanthias\". In EU waters, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has been in place since 1999, but until 2007 it only applied to ICES Areas IIa and IV. It was also set well above the actual weight of fish being caught until 2005, rendering it meaningless. Since 2009 a maximum landing size of has been imposed in order to protect the most valuable mature females. The TAC for 2011 was set at 0 tons, ending targeted fishing for the species in EU waters. It remains to be seen if populations will be able to recover.\n\nIn the recent past the European market for spiny dogfish has increased dramatically, which led to the overfishing and decline of the species. This drastic increase led to the creation and implementation of many fishery management policies placing restrictions on the fishing of spiny dogfish. However, since the species is a late maturing fish, it takes a while to rebuild the population.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the spiny dogfish to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\" In the same year, the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS; also known as the Bonn Convention) listed the species (Northern Hemisphere populations) under Annex I of its Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding.\n\nIn recent years however, the US has implemented fishing controls and opened up the fishery. The proposed quota for 2011 was with a trip limit of , an increase over past years in which the quota has ranged from to with trip limits from . In 2010, NOAA announced the Eastern US Atlantic spiny dogfish stocks to be rebuilt and in 2011 concerns about dogfish posing a serious predatory threat to other stocks resulted in an emergency amendment of the quota with nearly being added.\n\nAs a cartilaginous fish, shark tissues usually do not fossilize.\n\nSqualus acanthias fossils date back to the Miocene 11 MYA.\n\n"}
{"id": "242544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242544", "title": "Sports memorabilia", "text": "Sports memorabilia\n\nThe term sports memorabilia usually refers to a souvenir, memento, keepsake or token of remembrance that is directly connected to a famous athlete, sporting event or personality. These items are generally collected by fans that find sentimental and/ or monetary value of the item(s). There is no set parameter regarding the number of items, type of sport, or even the era that an item may reflect. A piece of certain kind may be considered a collectable item.\n\nItems that have been in direct contact with a famous athlete can have significant monetary value. Game used items such as the ball which Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run of the 1998 season sold for $3 million. The most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, a New York Yankees baseball jersey worn by Babe Ruth during the 1920 season, sold for $4,415,658 in 2012. In 2016, the ten most valuable sports cards and memorabilia sold for a record-setting combined $12,186,294.\n\nAutographed pieces of memorabilia are usually more valuable that non-autographed items. Items that have been personalized (i.e. \"To Mark,\" Best Wishes Travis,\" or \"Happy Birthday John\") can add sentimental value. Collectors who are interested in purchasing sports memorabilia often look for a certificate of authenticity. Several companies have developed systems to prove authenticity of game-used or autographed memorabilia, and collectors will generally seek out dealers that offer a lifetime, money-back, authenticity guarantee.\n\nThe value of a signed item will generally be relative to the profile of the signer and the scarcity of similar items. When a high-profile sports star dies, the value often rises as there will no longer be an opportunity to get more. For example, the death of Muhammad Ali in 2016 raised both demand and prices for signed Muhammad Ali memorabilia.\n\nIt could be said that collecting sports memorabilia goes back to the first decades of the 20th century, when many people would collect baseballs from baseball games and many asked Babe Ruth for autographs. As years passed and many other sports stars joined their sports, memorabilia collectors also began to broaden their horizons.\n\nWhen the NBA, MLB, NHL and NFL began selling their jerseys in stores during the 1980s, game used jerseys also became a hot item among sports memorabilia collectors. Former NBA player Dennis Rodman was famous for taking off his jerseys and throwing them to the stands after his games were over. Michael Jordan is probably the basketball player whose memorabilia is most sought after by collectors.\n\nThe highest price fetched for a football (soccer) match worn shirt is $224,000. The shirt belonged to the legendary Pelé, who wore it during the 1970 World Cup final in which Brazil went on to win. \n\nCollectors like to look back in time when they are finding sports memorabilia. Items such as John L. Sullivan and Jack Johnson fight posters have sold well before. There is also a boxing glove signed by Sullivan, Johnson, Ruth and many Hollywood stars and American Presidents that has sold for a lot of money before. This glove is now on display at the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nOther popular items in sports memorabilia are \"game-used\" items. Game used can refer to an item worn on the field during a game, worn during the pregame, or by a player on the bench. These can include jerseys, pants, caps, helmets, gloves, shoes, or even sunglasses. Game Used can also refer to bats, balls, turf, flags, or other items used by a player on in the stadium. In NASCAR, and other forms of automobile racing, the metal from the cars, the tires, the driver uniforms, and the crew uniforms are popular collectables. Concrete from the various racetracks are also popular. Trunks (shorts or pants), used by popular boxers such as Greg Haugen in boxing fights are also popular and sometimes sell for 100 dollars or more.\n\nIn Europe, football (soccer) memorabilia is the largest market, with high-profile players shirts, boots and photos in demand. Event programmes from rugby union and football (soccer) matches are also highly collectable.\n\n"}

It was first published in 1912 in the United States.\n\nCunningham was a civil engineer attached to the United States Navy throughout the latter years of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. A participant in the sport of fencing, he was the president of the Washington, D.C. Fencing Organization and in 1906 he wrote a Naval drill manual entitled \"Sabre and Bayonet\". In April 1912, Cunningham directed a large fencing tournament, featuring competitors from throughout New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. The first prize was a magnificent trophy called \"The Fighting Gaul\" which had been donated by the French Ambassador, Jules Jusserand.\n\n\"The Cane as a Weapon\", Cunningham’s second book, consisted of eighteen pages of text and twelve photographs. It is thought to be the only self-defense manual of its type to be produced in the United States during this period.\n\nAlthough several European authors had previously produced books and articles on the subject of self-defense with a walking cane, the Cunningham cane defense system was unique in several respects.\n\nOf the three basic guard positions that he advocates, two involve holding the cane with the tip pointed towards the ground. These positions have the advantage of appearing to be non-threatening and also make it difficult for an opponent to seize the defender’s weapon, unlike the more orthodox, fencing-based guards advocated by some other writers. They also serve as positions of invitation, exposing the defender’s head and torso to attack while providing the opportunity to counter such attacks with powerful, upward-sweeping parries.\n\nThe third basic guard position, which Cunningham refers to as the double-handed guard, was also featured in several previous works on cane defense. However, his system places an unusual emphasis upon this type of guard, stressing the augmented strength of attacks and defenses and the possibility of quick, snapping attacks and parries to be executed with either hand. Cunningham's advocacy of this position might have been due to his previous experience at bayonet fencing. The double-handed guard also facilitates powerful close-range jabs and \"bar strikes\" with the portion of the cane held between the defender’s hands.\n\nThe author pays special attention to the various different types of counter-attacks, defining the action of performing a cut or strike according to the direction, height, target and \"character\" of the action. The latter are defined as snap, half-arm, full-arm or swinging cuts. He also distinguishes between two types of \"stabbing\" blow with the cane, the jab and the thrust.\n\nThe Cunningham system is ambidextrous and the cane is frequently passed from hand to hand during the defensive sequences that are described and illustrated in the book. Defenses are generally in the form of counter-attacks to the assailant's weapon or to the weapon-wielding hand and targets for counter-attack include the head, throat, midsection, hands, elbows, knees and shins. Instructions are offered for self-defense against multiple opponents, grappling and boxing attacks as well as against attackers armed with knives and sticks.\n\nThe book also includes a series of thirty-seven written descriptions of defensive exercises.\n\nIn 2006, an expanded edition was published through lulu.com.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1713482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1713482", "title": "Women for Israel's Tomorrow", "text": "Women for Israel's Tomorrow\n\nWomen for Israel's Tomorrow () more commonly known as Women in Green, ) is an Israel non profit organization established in 1993 by Ruth and Michael Matar in response to the Oslo Accords. The organization is currently headed by Nadia Matar and Yehudit Katsover.\n\nThe organization is a grassroots movement of women and men, youth and adults, religious and non-religious - \"unified in their love for, dedication and faithfulness to the Land of Israel\". The group, which is a registered non-profit organization founded in 1993, is not affiliated with any political party, and has gained wide public support in Israel and abroad.\n\nThe more familiar name of the movement, Women in Green, is based on the green hats that the activists wore during the years of struggle and vigils against the Oslo Accords. \"The green hats symbolize the opposition to returning to the Green Line and transferring territories of the Land of Israel to foreign hands. 'The Land of Israel for the People of Israel' is the motto that has accompanied our movement ever since its founding.\"\n\nAccording to the group's website, the movement is \"dedicated to safeguarding our G-d-given Biblical homeland. We act out of the belief in the central role of the Land of Israel to the future of the Jewish People. 'Eretz Yisrael L'Am Yisrael' – 'the Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel' is our motto.\" Women in Green opposes a two-state solution, strongly opposes the return of land captured in the Six-Day War of 1967, and strongly supports Israeli settlement of those territories, which it proposes should be annexed. Women in Green also opposed Israeli military withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000.\n\nIn June 2014, on the same night it became known that the three abducted teens, Gilad Shaer, Eyal Yifrach and Naftali Frenkel had been murdered – members of Women in Green, together with residents of the area of Judea and with the support of the Gush Etzion Council, ascended to Abu Suda Forest, above the Gush Etzion Junction, only dozens of meters from the site of the abduction. There they established a nature preserve in memory of the youths –The Oz veGaon (Gilad Eyal and Naftali) Nature Preserve. The location has become an active tourism-educational site where visitors come from the entire country. Every Friday the Women in Green movement holds lectures, workshops and cultural events at the site.\n\nDuring the first two years of the nature preserve's establishment approximately 30,000 youths came to help prepare the site. They participated in removing rocks, thistles and weeds, and were instructed in self-defense. The parents of the abducted youths come often to the preserve, as well as politicians and public figures who support the site's development as a place of education, cultural events, family recreation and camping.\n\nIn recent years the movement has branched out to include The Sovereignty Campaign, a broad public relations campaign calling for the application of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The campaign was born in 2011 in response to what came to feel like a Sisyphean effort, continuously climbing and descending hill after hill, with no foreseeable end in sight. This caused the movement's leaders to see the necessity of branching out from the arena of settlement activity to the arena of diplomacy in order to protect Judea and Samaria. They no longer believed it was enough to merely say \"'No' to a Palestinian state\". The nationalist movement had to initiate its own plan of action. This sentiment gave rise to the Sovereignty Campaign: Israeli Sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.\n\nThis currently ongoing Sovereignty Campaign features billboards, conferences, lectures, parlor meetings, publication of manifestos and the production of the Sovereignty Journal, of which hundreds of thousands of copies are distributed in Hebrew and in English. The Sovereignty Journal includes articles, reports and interviews with political and public figures who call for implementing the vision of sovereignty as Israel's political vision.\n\nOne of Women in Green's yearly activities is the Annual Walk around the Walls of the Old City on the eve of Tisha B'Av. According to the findings of the Cairo Geniza, the custom of walking around the gates has its roots a thousand years ago. A Jew of the 19th century described the status: \"Our custom in the holy city of Jerusalem will be built and prepared to round the wall from the outside for all the intermediate days of Yom Tov, women and children, to fulfill the verse in Tehillim: Chapter 48 \"Walk about Zion, and go round about her; count the towers thereof. Mark ye well her ramparts, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.\", and it is the custom of Israel to be holy from previous years.\" The custom was renewed in 1994 and has been ongoing for 23 years. Thousands of people participate in the Walk, which includes speeches by Rabbis, politicians and public figures at the Lions' Gate and culminates at the Western Wall.\n\nFrom 1993 until 2005 the movement was led by Ruth Matar and her daughter-in-law Nadia Matar. During these years the movement focused its activities on vigils against the Oslo Accords, using public relations and educational activities to protest what the movement defined as relinquishing Israel's sovereign land. Public relation activities followed multiple approaches, including a weekly radio program that was broadcast by Arutz 7, in both Hebrew and English.\n\nIn 2003, Ruth and Nadia Matar, argued that \"[W]hat is needed is a determination to bring peace to this important area of the world, and there is nothing more logical and simple than to allow for a vibrant democratic Jewish State living peacefully with its neighbors.\" Those Arabs who wish to remain and live peacefully within a Jewish country would become citizens. They suggested offering monetary compensation to those Arabs who wanted to leave, many of whom came to Israel within the last 100 years. In this article, \"Transfer of Arabs is the Only Solution for Peace,\" they wrote: \"Fair payment can be made to those Arabs who agree to leave the Holy Land...Arabs who wish to remain can do so.\" They maintained that the United States and the E.U. could use the aid they provide (and political pressure) to help resettle Arabs, and that co-operation from surrounding Arab states would be required as well.\n\nWomen in Green's political activism extends to the United States, where it maintains several chapters, which hold vigils and fundraisers every year. An advertisement on its website for a protest scheduled for April 11, 2005, when Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon visited president George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, said:\n\nPassionately opposed to the Jewish expulsion from Gush Katif, in 2004 Nadia Matar compared the government's intention to remove Jews from Gaza to the involvement of the \"Judenrat\" (\"Jewish Council\") in Berlin in 1942, which, under orders from the German government expelled the Jewish community from that city. When Yonatan Bassi, the head of the department overseeing the civilian aspects of the withdrawal, sent a letter to the Jews of Gaza explaining the procedures for their evacuation she wrote to him and attached a copy of a 1942 letter sent by the \"Judenrat\" explaining the procedures for their evacuation. Matar stated:\n\nIn the summer of 2005, members of the Matar and Finkelstein families, co-founder of Women for Israel's tomorrow, moved in a shared caravan to Kfar Yam, in the Gush Katif settlement in Gaza. After that summer, the founders, Ruth and Michael Matar, ceased their activity for health reasons.\n\nIn 2005, Yehudit Katsover from Kiryat Arba-Hebron, a veteran activist for the Land of Israel, principal of the Teachers’ College in Kiryat Arba-Hevron, a branch of Efrata College, joined the group. Since then she has been leading Women in Green together with Nadia Matar.\n\nThe group added an element of practical activism, believing that this addition was necessary to strengthen the hold on all of the territories of the Land of Israel. Katsover and Matar focused the activities on parts of Area C (West Bank), where, according to their claim, the Palestinian Authority is attempting, with foreign funding, to seize lands belonging to the State of Israel.\n\nThe movement and its activists fought for the opening of the Walaja bypass road to allow access from the west to Gush Etzion, they restored the Jewish presence to the Shdema military camp between Har Homa and Tekoa and to Adurayim, which is south of Mount Hebron; they planted trees on state land in Netzer, which is between Alon Shvut and Elazar in order to prevent Arab take-over of these lands, and they organized activities to strengthen the Jewish presence on the Eitam Hill (Givat Eitam, in Hebrew), which is located in Efrat.\n\nThe group integrates its vigils and activities with cultural and educational activities such as concerts, exhibitions, lectures, lessons and more.\n\n\n\n"}
