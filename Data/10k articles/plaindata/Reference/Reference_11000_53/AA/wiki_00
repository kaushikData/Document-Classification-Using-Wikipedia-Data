He supports the Earth which he balances on a spinning pole. He receives an annual application of wild duck-oil to his muscles from a servant which brings relief to his muscles. The belief is that when all the ducks are hunted out, there will no longer be any duck-oil available in the world. At this point, Amala dies and the world topples off the pole and comes to an end.\n\nThe name Amala refers to his being very dirty and literally means “smoke hole.” Amala is said to be the youngest child in a family who is physically weak and lazy. He is made to sleep in the ashes and suffers mistreatment from everybody. In many variants of the myth, Amala sleeps in his urine. Late in his life he attains supernatural strength in secret and becomes a handsome, and powerful young man who performs many daring feats and turns savior and protector for his relatives against their enemies. The concluding feat of his life is to succeed a dying chief on an island in the Southwest sea in the task of holding the Earth up. The dying chief hears of Amala's various exploits and, impressed by his prowess, calls the hero. When Amala arrives, the chief hands over the long pole upon which the flat world revolves. Some versions of the myth state that the chief places the pole on Amala's chest, while some versions hold that the pole is held behind Amala's back. A servant relieves Amala's muscles with yearly application of spoonfuls of duck grease and wild-duck oil which help Amala to keep the world spinning.\n\nThere is a possibility that the myths about Amala and similar heroes of Native American mythology were influenced by the tales of Cinderella and Atlas - the titan who carries the world on his shoulder in Greek mythology, introduced into Native American culture from Europe. There is a similarity between Cinderella and Amala in that both sleep in ashes and both are abused by their tribe or family. The storyline of Amala - the despised member of the tribe who overcomes adversity and rises to be a hero among his people, may be a combination of elements of the downtrodden and derided hero or heroine, such as Cinderella, and the hero of the Atlas-type who dwells in the underworld.\n\n"}
{"id": "7766835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7766835", "title": "Anamorphism", "text": "Anamorphism\n\nIn category theory, the anamorphism (from the Greek \"upwards\" and \"form, shape\") of a coinductive type denotes the assignment of a coalgebra to its unique morphism to the final coalgebra of an endofunctor. These objects are used in functional programming as \"unfolds\". The categorical dual of the anamorphism is the catamorphism.\n\nIn functional programming, an anamorphism is a generalization of the concept of \"unfolds\" on coinductive lists. Formally, anamorphisms are generic functions that can corecursively construct a result of a certain type and which is parameterized by functions that determine the next single step of the construction.\n\nThe data type in question is defined as the greatest fixed point \"ν X . F X\" of a functor \"F\". By the universal property of final coalgebras, there is a unique coalgebra morphism \"A → ν X . F X\" for any other \"F\"-coalgebra \"a : A → F A\". Thus, one can define functions from a type \"A\" _into_ a coinductive datatype by specifying a coalgebra structure \"a\" on \"A\".\n\nAs an example, the type of potentially infinite lists (with elements of a fixed type \"value\") is given as the fixpoint \"[value] = ν X . value × X + 1\", i.e. a list consists either of a \"value\" and a further list, or it is empty. A (pseudo-)Haskell-Definition might look like this:\n\nIt is the fixed point of the functor codice_1, where:\n\nOne can easily check that indeed the type codice_2 is isomorphic to codice_3, and thus codice_2 is the fixed point.\n\nThe \"anamorphism\" for lists (then usually known as \"unfold\") would build a (potentially infinite) list from a state value. Typically, the unfold takes a state value codice_5 and a function codice_6 that yields either a pair of a value and a new state, or a singleton to mark the end of the list. The anamorphism would then begin with a first seed, compute whether the list continues or ends, and in case of a nonempty list, prepend the computed value to the recursive call to the anamorphism.\n\nA Haskell definition of an unfold, or anamorphism for lists, called codice_7, is as follows:\n\nWe can now implement quite general functions using \"ana\", for example a countdown:\n\nThis function will decrement an integer and output it at the same time, until it is negative, at which point it will mark the end of the list. Correspondingly, codice_8 will compute the list codice_9.\n\nAn anamorphism can be defined for any recursive type, according to a generic pattern, generalizing the second version of \"ana\" for lists.\n\nFor example, the unfold for the tree data structure\n\nis as follows\nTo better see the relationship between the recursive type and its anamorphism, note that codice_10 and codice_11 can be defined thus:\n\nThe analogy with codice_7 appears by renaming codice_13 in its type:\n\nWith these definitions, the argument to the constructor of the type has the same type as the return type of the first argument of codice_7, with the recursive mentions of the type replaced with codice_13.\n\nOne of the first publications to introduce the notion of an anamorphism in the context of programming was the paper \"Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire\", by Erik Meijer \"et al.\", which was in the context of the Squiggol programming language.\n\nFunctions like codice_16 and codice_17 are examples of anamorphisms. codice_16 takes a pair of lists, say ['a','b','c'] and [1,2,3] and returns a list of pairs [('a',1),('b',2),('c',3)]. codice_19 takes a thing, x, and a function, f, from such things to such things, and returns the infinite list that comes from repeated application of f, i.e. the list [x, (f x), (f (f x)), (f (f (f x))), ...].\n\nTo prove this, we can implement both using our generic unfold, codice_7, using a simple recursive routine:\n\nIn a language like Haskell, even the abstract functions codice_21, codice_22 and codice_7 are merely defined terms, as we have seen from the definitions given above.\n\nIn category theory, anamorphisms are the categorical dual of catamorphisms (and catamorphisms are the categorical dual of anamorphisms).\n\nThat means the following. \nSuppose (\"A\", \"fin\") is a final \"F\"-coalgebra for some endofunctor \"F\" of some category into itself.\nThus, \"fin\" is a morphism from \"A\" to \"FA\", and since it is assumed to be final we know that whenever (\"X\", \"f\") is another \"F\"-coalgebra (a morphism \"f\" from \"X\" to \"FX\"), there will be a unique homomorphism \"h\" from (\"X\", \"f\") to (\"A\", \"fin\"), that is a morphism \"h\" from \"X\" to \"A\" such that \"fin . h = Fh . f\".\nThen for each such \"f\" we denote by ana f that uniquely specified morphism \"h\".\n\nIn other words, we have the following defining relationship, given some fixed \"F\", \"A\", and \"fin\" as above:\n\n\nA notation for ana \"f\" found in the literature is formula_3. The brackets used are known as lens brackets, after which anamorphisms are sometimes referred to as \"lenses\".\n\n\n"}

The time period was limited from January 2000 to June 2016 (when the responses were completely collected). Each film listed in these responses were then given points based on their ranking. For instance, if a film was ranked at #1 in a critic's list, that film would get 10 points, whereas the one ranked at #10 would get 1 point.

The archive contains more than 50,000 fiction films, over 100,000 non-fiction titles, and around 625,000 television programmes. The majority of the collection is British material but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.\n\nThe BFI runs the BFI Southbank (formerly the National Film Theatre (NFT)) and London IMAX cinema, both located on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The IMAX has the largest cinema screen in the UK and shows popular recent releases and short films showcasing its technology, which includes 3D screenings and 11,600 watts of digital surround sound. BFI Southbank (the National Film Theatre screens and the Studio) shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical & specialised films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. The BFI also distributes archival and cultural cinema to other venues – each year to more than 800 venues all across the UK, as well as to a substantial number of overseas venues.\n\nThe BFI offers a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools. In late 2012, the BFI received money from the Department For Education to create the BFI Film Academy Network.\nThe BFI runs the annual London Film Festival along with and the youth-orientated Future Film Festival.\n\nThe BFI publishes the monthly \"Sight & Sound\" magazine as well as films on Blu-ray, DVD and books. It runs the BFI National Library (a reference library), and maintains the BFI Film & TV Database and Summary of Information on Film and Television (SIFT), which are databases of credits, synopses and other information about film and television productions. SIFT has a collection of about 7 million still frames from film and television.\n\nThe BFI has co-produced a number of television series featuring footage from the BFI National Archive, in partnership with the BBC, including \"The Lost World of Mitchell & Kenyon\", \"The Lost World of Friese-Greene\", and \"The Lost World of Tibet\".\n\nThe institute was founded in 1933. Despite its foundation resulting from a recommendation in a report on \"Film in National Life\", at that time the institute was a private company, though it has received public money throughout its history—from the Privy Council and Treasury until 1965 and the various culture departments since then.\n\nThe institute was restructured following the Radcliffe Report of 1948 which recommended that it should concentrate on developing the appreciation of filmic art, rather than creating film itself. Thus control of educational film production passed to the National Committee for Visual Aids in Education and the British Film Academy assumed control for promoting production. From 1952–2000, the BFI provided funding for new and experimental filmmakers via the BFI Production Board.\n\nThe institute received a Royal Charter in 1983. This was updated in 2000, and in the same year the newly established UK Film Council took responsibility for providing the BFI's annual grant-in-aid (government subsidy). As an independent registered charity, the BFI is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Privy Council.\n\nIn 1988, the BFI opened the London Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) on the South Bank. MOMI was acclaimed internationally and set new standards for education through entertainment, but subsequently it did not receive the high levels of continuing investment that might have enabled it to keep pace with technological developments and ever-rising audience expectations. The Museum was \"temporarily\" closed in 1999 when the BFI stated that it would be re-sited. This did not happen, and MOMI's closure became permanent in 2002 when it was decided to redevelop the South Bank site. This redevelopment was itself then further delayed.\n\nThe BFI is currently managed on a day-to-day basis by its chief executive, Amanda Nevill. Supreme decision-making authority rests with a chair and a board of up to 14 governors. The current chair is Josh Berger, who took up the post in February 2016. He succeeded Greg Dyke, who took office on 1 March 2008. Dyke succeeded the late Anthony Minghella (film director), who was chair from 2003 until 31 December 2007. The chair of the board is appointed by the BFI's own Board of Governors but requires the consent of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Other Governors are co-opted by existing board members when required (but if one of these is appointed Deputy Chair, that appointment is subject to ratification by the Secretary of State).\n\nThe BFI operates with three sources of income. The largest is public money allocated by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In 2011–12, this funding amounted to approximately £20m. The second largest source is commercial activity such as receipts from ticket sales at BFI Southbank or the BFI London IMAX theatre (£5m in 2007), sales of DVDs, etc. Thirdly, grants and sponsorship of around £5m are obtained from various sources, including National Lottery funding grants, private sponsors and through donations (J. Paul Getty, Jr. donated around £1m in his will following his death in 2003). The BFI is also the distributor for all Lottery funds for film (in 2011–12 this amounted to c.£25m).\n\nAs well as its work on film, the BFI also devotes a large amount of its time to the preservation and study of British television programming and its history. In 2000, it published a high-profile list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted for by a range of industry figures.\n\nThe delayed redevelopment of the National Film Theatre finally took place in 2007, creating in the rebranded \"BFI Southbank\" new education spaces, a gallery, and a pioneering mediatheque which for the first time enabled the public to gain access, free of charge, to some of the otherwise inaccessible treasures in the National Film & Television Archive. The mediatheque has proved to be the most successful element of this redevelopment, and there are plans to roll out a network of them across the UK.\n\nAn announcement of a £25 million capital investment in the Strategy for UK Screen Heritage was made by Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport at the opening night of the 2007 London Film Festival. The bulk of this money paid for long overdue development of the BFI National Archive facilities in Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.\n\nDuring 2009 the UK Film Council persuaded the government that there should only be one main public-funded body for film, and that body should be the UKFC while the BFI should be abolished. During 2010 the government announced that there would be a single body for film. Despite intensive lobbying (including controversially using public funding to pay public relations agencies to put its case) the UKFC failed to persuade the government that it should have that role and, instead, the BFI took over most of the UKFC's functions and funding from 1 April 2011, and the UKFC was subsequently abolished. Since then, the BFI has been responsible for all Lottery funding for film—originally in excess of £25m p.a., and currently in excess of £40m p.a.\n\nThe BFI Film Academy forms part of the BFI's overall 5-19 Education Scheme. The programme is being supported by the Department for Education in England who have committed £1m per annum funding from April 2012 and 31 March 2015. It is also funded through the National Lottery, Creative Scotland and Northern Ireland Screen.\n\nOn 29 November 2016 BFI announced that over 100,000 television programmes are to be digitised before the video tapes, which currently have an estimated five-to-six-year shelf life, become unusable. BFI aim to make sure that the television archive is still there in 200 years' time.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "751519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751519", "title": "Comparative statics", "text": "Comparative statics\n\nIn economics, comparative statics is the comparison of two different economic outcomes, before and after a change in some underlying exogenous parameter.\n\nAs a type of \"static analysis\" it compares two different equilibrium states, after the process of adjustment (if any). It does not study the motion towards equilibrium, nor the process of the change itself.\n\nComparative statics is commonly used to study changes in supply and demand when analyzing a single market, and to study changes in monetary or fiscal policy when analyzing the whole economy. Comparative statics is a tool of analysis in microeconomics (including general equilibrium analysis) and macroeconomics. Comparative statics was formalized by John R. Hicks (1939) and Paul A. Samuelson (1947) (Kehoe, 1987, p. 517) but was presented graphically from at least the 1870s.\n\nFor models of stable equilibrium rates of change, such as the neoclassical growth model, comparative dynamics is the counterpart of comparative statics (Eatwell, 1987).\n\nComparative statics results are usually derived by using the implicit function theorem to calculate a linear approximation to the system of equations that defines the equilibrium, under the assumption that the equilibrium is stable. That is, if we consider a sufficiently small change in some exogenous parameter, we can calculate how each endogenous variable changes using only the first derivatives of the terms that appear in the equilibrium equations.\n\nFor example, suppose the equilibrium value of some endogenous variable formula_1 is determined by the following equation:\n\nwhere formula_3 is an exogenous parameter. Then, to a first-order approximation, the change in formula_1 caused by a small change in formula_3 must satisfy:\n\nHere formula_7 and formula_8 represent the changes in formula_1 and formula_3, respectively, while formula_11 and formula_12 are the partial derivatives of formula_13 with respect to formula_1 and\nformula_3 (evaluated at the initial values of formula_1 and formula_3), respectively. Equivalently, we can write the change in formula_1 as:\n\nDividing through the last equation by d\"a\" gives the comparative static derivative of \"x\" with respect to \"a\", also called the multiplier of \"a\" on \"x\":\n\nAll the equations above remain true in the case of a system of formula_21 equations in formula_21 unknowns. In other words, suppose formula_23 represents a system of formula_21 equations involving the vector of formula_21 unknowns formula_1, and the vector of formula_27 given parameters formula_3. If we make a sufficiently small change formula_8 in the parameters, then the resulting changes in the endogenous variables can be approximated arbitrarily well by formula_30. In this case, formula_11 represents the formula_21×formula_21 matrix of partial derivatives of the functions formula_13 with respect to the variables formula_1, and formula_12 represents the formula_21×formula_27 matrix of partial derivatives of the functions formula_13 with respect to the parameters formula_3. (The derivatives in formula_11 and formula_12 are evaluated at the initial values of formula_1 and formula_3.) Note that if one wants just the comparative static effect of one exogenous variable on one endogenous variable, Cramer's Rule can be used on the totally differentiated system of equations formula_45.\n\nThe assumption that the equilibrium is stable matters for two reasons. First, if the equilibrium were unstable, a small parameter change might cause a large jump in the value of formula_1, invalidating the use of a linear approximation. Moreover, Paul A. Samuelson's correspondence principle states that stability of equilibrium has qualitative implications about the comparative static effects. In other words, knowing that the equilibrium is stable may help us predict whether each of the coefficients in the vector formula_47 is positive or negative. Specifically, one of the \"n\" necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for stability is that the determinant of the \"n\"×\"n\" matrix \"B\" have a particular sign; since this determinant appears as the denominator in the expression for formula_48, the sign of the determinant influences the signs of all the elements of the vector formula_49 of comparative static effects.\n\nSuppose that the quantities demanded and supplied of a product are determined by the following equations:\n\nwhere formula_52 is the quantity demanded, formula_53 is the quantity supplied, \"P\" is the price, \"a\" and \"c\" are intercept parameters determined by exogenous influences on demand and supply respectively, \"b\" < 0 is the reciprocal of the slope of the demand curve, and \"g\" is the reciprocal of the slope of the supply curve; \"g\" > 0 if the supply curve is upward sloped, \"g\" = 0 if the supply curve is vertical, and \"g\" < 0 if the supply curve is backward-bending. If we equate quantity supplied with quantity demanded to find the equilibrium price formula_54, we find that\n\nThis means that the equilibrium price depends positively on the demand intercept if \"g\" – \"b\" > 0, but depends negatively on it if \"g\" – \"b\" < 0. Which of these possibilities is relevant? In fact, starting from an initial static equilibrium and then changing \"a\", the new equilibrium is relevant \"only\" if the market actually goes to that new equilibrium. Suppose that price adjustments in the market occur according to\n\nwhere formula_57 > 0 is the speed of adjustment parameter and formula_58 is the time derivative of the price — that is, it denotes how fast and in what direction the price changes. By stability theory, \"P\" will converge to its equilibrium value if and only if the derivative formula_59 is negative. This derivative is given by\n\nThis is negative if and only if \"g\" – \"b\" > 0, in which case the demand intercept parameter \"a\" positively influences the price. So we can say that while the direction of effect of the demand intercept on the equilibrium price is ambiguous when all we know is that the reciprocal of the supply curve's slope, \"g\", is negative, in the only relevant case (in which the price actually goes to its new equilibrium value) an increase in the demand intercept increases the price. Note that this case, with \"g\" – \"b\" > 0, is the case in which the supply curve, if negatively sloped, is steeper than the demand curve.\n\nSuppose formula_61 is a smooth and strictly concave objective function where \"x\" is a vector of \"n\" endogenous variables and \"q\" is a vector of \"m\" exogenous parameters. Consider the unconstrained optimization problem formula_62.\nLet formula_63, the \"n\" by \"n\" matrix of first partial derivatives of formula_61 with respect to its first \"n\" arguments \"x\"...,\"x\".\nThe maximizer formula_65 is defined by the \"n\"×1 first order condition formula_66.\n\nComparative statics asks how this maximizer changes in response to changes in the \"m\" parameters. The aim is to find formula_67.\n\nThe strict concavity of the objective function implies that the Jacobian of \"f\", which is exactly the matrix of second partial derivatives of \"p\" with respect to the endogenous variables, is nonsingular (has an inverse). By the implicit function theorem, then, formula_65 may be viewed locally as a continuously differentiable function, and the local response of formula_65 to small changes in \"q\" is given by \nApplying the chain rule and first order condition,\n(See Envelope theorem).\n\nSuppose a firm produces \"n\" goods in quantities formula_72. The firm's profit is a function \"p\" of formula_72 and of \"m\" exogenous parameters formula_74 which may represent, for instance, various tax rates. Provided the profit function satisfies the smoothness and concavity requirements, the comparative statics method above describes the changes in the firm's profit due to small changes in the tax rates.\n\nA generalization of the above method allows the optimization problem to include a set of constraints. This leads to the general envelope theorem. Applications include determining changes in Marshallian demand in response to changes in price or wage.\n\nOne limitation of comparative statics using the implicit function theorem is that results are valid only in a (potentially very small) neighborhood of the optimum—that is, only for very small changes in the exogenous variables. Another limitation is the potentially overly restrictive nature of the assumptions conventionally used to justify comparative statics procedures.\n\nPaul Milgrom and Chris Shannon pointed out in 1994 that the assumptions conventionally used to justify the use of comparative statics on optimization problems are not actually necessary—specifically, the assumptions of convexity of preferred sets or constraint sets, smoothness of their boundaries, first and second derivative conditions, and linearity of budget sets or objective functions. In fact, sometimes a problem meeting these conditions can be monotonically transformed to give a problem with identical comparative statics but violating some or all of these conditions; hence these conditions are not necessary to justify the comparative statics. Stemming from the article by Milgrom and Shannon as well as the results obtained by Veinott and Topkis an important strand of operational research was developed called monotone comparative statics. In particular, this theory concentrates on the comparative statics analysis using only conditions that are independent of order-preserving transformations. The method uses lattice theory and introduces the notions of quasi-supermodularity and the single-crossing condition. The wide application of monotone comparative statics to economics includes production theory, consumer theory, game theory with complete and incomplete information, auction theory, and others.\n\n\n\n"}

Culture influences how people seek psychological help, their definitions of social structure, and coping strategies.\n\nResearch shows that cultural factors affect notions of perceived happiness. The current general literature discusses positive psychology into two categories: Western and Eastern. Cultural psychologist Richard Shweder argues that these factors help shape what people deem is good, moral, and virtuous. Westerners seek rewards on more of a physical plane, while Easterners seek to transcend the physical plane to a spiritual one. Western literature generally stresses autonomy, individuality, and personal satisfaction, while Eastern work generally focuses on harmony, collective cooperation, and group satisfaction.\n\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, anthropologists and psychologists used race and culture as factors that influence positive and negative behaviors and attitudes.{Snyder, Lopez, Pedrotti (2011). Positive psychology: The scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (2nd ed.)} This led to a culturally deficient perspective, used for some groups to assert dominance over others through eugenics. American psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Henry Goddard Hall were among some of the notable figures to adopt this view. By the mid 20th century, the dominant viewpoint was that culture did not predetermine life outcomes; instead differences were the consequence of environmental factors. The culturally different perspective holds that unique strengths can be highlighted within every culture.\n\nDavid Satcher was among the first to emphasize the influences of culture on mental health. Cultural differences occur both between and within nations. Social psychologists have supported the notion that humans are \"social animals\".\n\nPsychologists Charles R. Snyder, Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti identify two major influential western traditions – Athenian and Judeo-Christian – and four major eastern traditions – Confucianism (China), Taoism (China), Buddhism (Japan), and Hinduism (Southeast Asia) – relevant to positive psychology.\n\n\n\nJoshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. His analysis is based on his survey of the accounts of happiness and optimal functioning provided in Western as well as non-Western traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Sufism. These six major domains of difference are as follows:\n\n\nThere are different approaches within the field of positive psychology. With the support of numerous sources, Bacon presents the idea that there are two \"cultures\" in positive psychology, or two different ways to view the positive psychology construct of personal strengths: focus culture and balance culture. In focus culture, individuals are focused on developing and expressing their personal strengths. Balance culture is instead oriented towards balancing and bringing harmony within oneself and among others. Bacon argues that individuals ascribing to the focus culture will differ in their life experience and life path than those who believe in the balance culture. Bacon believes that the strengths can be categorized into these two cultures and goes into depth explaining why creativity is the prototypical strength in the focus culture and why wisdom represents an ideal strength in the balance culture. Rather than tying culture to a certain ethnic or cultural group, Bacon and others argues that there are two different cultures, or schools of thought, within positive psychology. These two cultures reflect a new way to categorize strengths (Bacon, 2005).\n\nThere are two main approaches to cross-cultural positive psychology. One perspective, termed 'culturally-free' believes that there are numerous human strengths that are valued universally, and that the pursuit of happiness is common across cultures. Proponents of this side view their approach as descriptive and objective, claiming its results \"transcend particular cultures and politics and approach universality\". The other approach views values as culturally embedded, meaning that cultural values of the researchers influence their work. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) takes this view and includes information throughout the manual to increase cultural sensitivity and further the awareness of a multicultural perspective in clinical practice. Some of the additional information includes insight into cultural differences in key symptoms of disorders, as well as suggestions on how to take cultural context into account during treatment.\n\nAlso, Western traditions fostered more individualistic societies while eastern traditions fostered more collectivistic societies. Individualistic cultures value the self above the group. Collectivistic cultures value the group above the individual.\nKey western values (Individualism)\n\nKey eastern values (Collectivism)\n\nThere are distinct differences between the thought processes used by Westerners and Easterners resulting in differing worldviews. For example, in seeking happiness, Westerners give priority to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" as well as goal-directed thinking. Easterners, on the other hand, may be more accepting in their situation, and put more weight on inner life balance. The virtue of harmony appears to be a pillar of Eastern culture.\n\nEdward C. Chang did a series of quantitative studies in order to showcase the importance of understanding the equivalence of traits and constructs across cultural groups. For example, Asian Americans were more pessimistic than Caucasians, but the two groups were not all that different on their levels of optimism.\n\nJoseph G. Ponterotto et al. have suggested that the ability to navigate and adapt to the increasingly diverse context of the world, is an important strength. People high on this are said to have \"multicultural personalities\". It adjusts for differences between cultures. Kristoffer G. van der Zee and Jan P. van Oudenhoven created the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), and identified five factors that describe personality style: cultural empathy, open-mindedness, emotional stability, initiative, and flexibility. This may correlate with enhanced well being.\n\nPsychology researcher Daphna Oyserman and her colleagues advocate for a less static view of separate cultures (East vs. West), and suggest exploring more dynamic ways explaining the ways in which these cultures operate. Different cultures can operate together, rather than being seen as conflicting (it is not \"me vs. we\").\n\nThere has been a recent effort by researchers to explore how concepts of Positive Psychology differ between cultures, as well as how culture influences how individuals view the good life.\n\nFor example, Snyder's chapter (2009) explores the way in which culture affects positive psychology. More specifically, Snyder acknowledges the fact that culture impacts individual's understanding of strengths and weaknesses. Snyder claims that it is important to understand the cross section of positive psychology and culture, because it allows one to not only understand people within a culture but it also enables one to appreciate people from different cultures. Snyder outlines two schools of thought in the positive psychology field that pertain to how we should view strengths within a cultural context: culture-free and the culturally embedded perspective. Those ascribing to the culture-free perspective believe that strengths are not affected by culture and that there are universal strengths. The culturally embedded perspective argues that one must take into account culture when one is considering strengths, because they believe strengths manifest themselves differently in different cultures (Snyder, 2009).\n\nDahlsgaard, Peterson, and Seligman's (2005) meta-analysis presents historical and psychological evidence supporting the contention that there are universal virtues that exist across cultures. They are courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These authors note that these virtues have been represented in ancient texts within Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and from Athenian scholars. Each of these core virtues was represented in these schools of thoughts and became entrenched in the societies and cultures that ascribe to these religions and belief systems. Thus, these core virtues of courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence are valued equally across these different cultures (Dahlsgaard et al., 2005).\n\nAnother virtue put forth by Seligman in attaining the good life is forgiveness. Previous researchers have not looked extensively at how forgiveness occurs in non-Western cultures, yet virtue is a very culturally embedded value. The research that has explored the virtue of forgiveness in non-Western cultures has found that there are not significant differences in overall levels of forgiveness, yet the reasons behind forgiving and the meaning of forgiveness varies between collectivist and individualistic cultures. For example, forgiveness in individualistic cultures is focused on a particular individual, while Eastern cultures see forgiveness in a broader, community context. Since forgiveness is a key virtue in positive psychology and a relevant topic in counseling, it is important to research forgiveness more thoroughly in a variety of cultures in order to better understand how different cultures view forgiveness.\n\nIn studies that highlight differences between Western and Eastern cultures, discrepancies in values and emotions have been found when comparing the United States and China. It is often concluded that people in Eastern cultures are less happy than those in Western cultures, but research indicates that there is more value placed on suffering and transcendence in Eastern cultures than in the United States. It is also commonly believed that there is less happiness experienced by people in Eastern cultures because there is less individuality, but Eastern cultures are socialized in a much more collectivist mindset and develop into adults that are more concerned with finding a place in one's community rather than standing out, as Americans are. These differences in particular indicate that there should be further research into cultural differences to avoid mistakes in classifying behavior and psychological functioning.\n\nKubokawa and Ottaway's literature review examines how emotions vary across culture, suggesting that applications of positive psychology need to adapt to different cultural contexts. The authors use self-criticism as an example: self-criticism is considered as detrimental to one's well-being in Western cultures, whereas collectivistic cultures value self-criticism as an important tool for personal growth, and consider it useful in aligning with societal norms (Heine et al., 2001). The authors also discuss a study conducted in Asian Americans and Caucasians that examined optimism and pessimism. The study found that while Asian Americans rated higher in pessimism than Caucasians, they did not differ in levels of depressive symptoms, indicating that the association between pessimism and depression might not apply in Asian cultures the way it does in Western cultures. In general, many negative emotions in Western cultures do not hold the same connotations in East Asian cultures, leading the authors to suggest that classification of certain emotions as positive and negative is not universal, and that research in positive psychology should cater to these cultural aspects.\n\nKubokawa and Ottaway also present research that discredits the cultural relevance of the Values in Action Classification of Strengths (VIA) created by Peterson and Seligman. Peterson and Seligman (2004) identified six universal characters strengths and virtues that are valued by all cultures: courage, justice, humanity, temperance, wisdom, and transcendence. These virtues in turn led them to create a subset of 24 strengths common to all cultures. However, Christopher and Hickinbottom (2008) argue that the VIA Classification of Strengths is an oversimplification of cultures, and that while the values might be similar across cultures, the meaning that Peterson and Seligman ascribed to them are Western-orientated and might not translate well into more collectivist cultures.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated that the good life, as defined by subjective well-being, is rooted in predominantly Western ways of thinking. But, throughout history, subjective well-being has often become less vital in comparison to the needs to the larger community. This change results in individuals feeling subjective well-being in response to the success of their community rather than from their individual experiences. For example, the people of Bali see life as having two realms, everyday life and the spiritual world. Due to this dichotomy, it is difficult to examine subjective well-being without considering both realms, which occurs when positive psychology uses Western ways of thinking about the world.\n\nAnother cultural difference in how one conceptualizes the good life can be seen in the beliefs of the Apsáalooke tribe, a Native American tribe in the US. Research has shown that for members of the Apsáalooke tribe, life satisfaction is deeply rooted in the belief that one's life is intertwined with others in their tribe. Due to this feeling of collectivity, satisfaction is taken from helping others. This example is just one of many in which other cultures differ in the concept of satisfaction from the concept of satisfaction in an individualistic culture.\n\nIn addition, a difference between collectivist and individualist cultures is the conceptualization of positive and negative emotions, including happiness. For example, research indicates that individualism moderates the relationship between hedonism and happiness, such that hedonism is more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic (vs collectivistic) cultures. In individualist cultures, individuals attempt to avoid negative emotions, but in Eastern communities, some negative emotions are viewed as a virtue. One example of this is that collectivist cultures value shame because they view it as an opportunity to better themselves. So, when Western conceptualizations are applied to Eastern cultures, researchers run the risk of psychological imperialism.\n\nHow does the culture of consumerism relate to positive psychology? Past research has shown that consumer culture and the pursuit of extrinsic goals leads to diminished well being, in comparison to pursuing intrinsic goals that lead to an increase in well-being. These findings not only occur in America, but the same results occurred in samples across a variety of countries, including Romania, Germany, Russia, Singapore, and South Korea. These countries represent both individualistic and collectivist cultures, which demonstrates that one possible universal in positive psychology across cultures is the importance of the pursuit of intrinsic goals.\n\nMaygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley identified specific cultural considerations that affect how practitioners should engage with concepts and theories in positive psychology within counseling settings. The literature review specifically addresses well-being, meaning, and hope.\n\nWell-being\n\nWealthy, individualistic cultures experience higher levels of social well-being than underprivileged, collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995). Self-esteem was also more predictive of life satisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Suh, Diner, Oishi, & Triadis, 1998).\n\nResearch suggest that searching for meaning is viewed more positively in interdependent culture: Steger, Kawabata, Shimai, and Otake (2008) found that when comparing Japan (example of interdependent culture) and the U.S. (example of independent culture), the Japanese sample was high in searching for meaning while the U.S. sample was higher in experiencing meaning. Additionally, the search for meaning in the Japanese sample was positively related to presence of meaning, unlike in the U.S. sample.\nResearch also indicates that national levels of globalization can moderate the relationship between \"thinking about the meaning of life\" and life satisfaction. That is, in more globalized cultures, this relationship is negative, whereas in less globalized cultures, this correlation is positive.\n\nMaygar-Moe, Owens, and Conoley argue that while previous research supports the idea that is hope is universally a positive expectancy variably, the cultivation of hope varies based on cultural makeup.\n\n\"European Americans\" – life satisfaction serves as a source of agentic hope and positive affect was found to be predictive of pathways of hope. Therefore, European Americans would benefit most from interventions that improve life satisfaction and positive affect (Chang & Banks, 2007).\n\n\"African Americans\" – lack of negative problem orientation was the strongest predictor for agentic, and positive problem orientation was the best predictor of pathways thinking. Therefore, African Americans would benefit best from interventions that simultaneously reduce a negative problem orientation and increase a positive problem orientation (Chang & Banks, 2007).\n\n\"Latinos\" – life satisfaction was the only predictor of pathways thinking, and rational problem solving was the best predictor of agentic thinking, therefore, Latinos would benefit most from interventions aiming to increasing rational problem solving and that would lead to higher life satisfaction (Chang & Banks, 2007).\n\n\"Asian Americans\" – positive problem orientation was the strongest predictor of pathways thinking, while positive affect was the strongest predictor of agentic thinking. Therefore, Asian Americans would benefit best from interventions that promote positive affect and a positive problem orientation (Chang & Banks, 2007).\n\nCulturally appropriate psychoeducational and counseling interventions would benefit from more empirical research on culturally embedded positive psychology. Cross-cultural studies would help with the application of psychological treatment and recovery, along with improving the general understanding of the psyche of diverse populations of people. This is not only important for the differences between Western and Eastern civilizations, but has implications for the various cultural and ethnic groups within the United States of America, a society that has been considered a \"melting pot\" and has grappled with these issues throughout history. One important aspect of American culture that should be addressed is that of consumerism. Since the negative effects of the culture of consumption transcends specific cultures, it can become a common theme across counseling practices of positive psychology to encourage pursuing intrinsic values and the good life, and avoid pursuing extrinsic goals and the \"goods\" life.\n\nIn addition, a culturally-embedded approach would allow professionals outside the mental health field to utilize methodology and concepts from psychology to motivate and help people. Specifically, employers in any field of business would be able to find techniques that are culturally appropriate for encouraging employees to be better engaged in their careers and to find meaning in their work. This can effectively be applied to the cultural network groups that many companies organize for employees, such as women's and African-Americans' networks, that allow for employees and employers to increase the understanding of perspectives and cultural sensitivity in the workplace.\n\nFurthermore, teachers and administrators would be better equipped to address issues in educational achievement and behavioral development amongst diverse groups of students. Since there is currently strong criticism of the public education system for the achievement gap amongst students based on race and socioeconomic status, it would be especially helpful for educational authorities to understand the disparities that students may face due to aspects of their background. Teachers would benefit from knowing how to better foster a love of learning, creativity, optimism, resilience, leadership, and teamwork in diverse groups of students in order to prepare students for achievement in the future. The concept of achievement is tied to the aforementioned topics for many children. When achievement seems possible for all students, regardless of their cultural backgrounds, they may be more likely to persistently pursue attaining it.\n\nVirtues and strengths are valued differently across cultures, which in turn means that attempts to build strengths using positive psychology within counseling settings can only be successful if they include important cultural considerations. For example, Chang (1996) found that Asian Americans reported higher levels of pessimism than Caucasians, however within that population pessimism was not found to contribute to depression and was associated with positive problem-solving strategies. This suggests that while pessimism is considered a weakness in some cultures, it might actually serve as a strength in others: defensive pessimism, for example, leads people to set lower expectations for themselves. This supports the idea that applications of positive psychology to cultivate strengths need to be altered to fit the clients' cultural backgrounds.\n\nIndividual differences in the way people experience positive and negative emotions affect study results in a way that makes sample and cohort differences less important than the studies stress. More specifically, the conception of the self is key in positive psychology, and cross cultural differences in the conception of the self make it difficult to generalize results. Those individual differences often account for much of the variations between groups, and are often not taken into account.\n\nThe first two problems converge for an even larger issue: the measurement of emotion is far from accurate. However, many studies and researchers use \"oversimple checklists and questionnaires without follow-up or exploration of their adequacy.\" Without in-depth explorations, the possibilities of finding observations about the flow of events in an emotional encounter is minimal. Thus, with very subjective results and the inadequacy to rule out other causal connections, the measurement of positive emotion itself is flawed.\n\nWith the cultural aspect of positive psychology, the problems largely consist of the definition of positive emotions and notions of a positive life. Many of the ideals that are associated with a positive psychology are notions that are deeply ingrained within Western cultures, and do not necessarily apply to all groups of people. In relation to the previous point about measuring positive emotion, many of the social conditions in emotion measurement are ignored.\n\n\"Positive psychology is doomed to being narrow and ethnocentric as long as its researchers remain unaware of the cultural assumptions underlying their work.\" A large part of the literature debates whether positive psychology is innately culture-free or culture-embedded. Those who advocate culture-free positive psychology state that happiness is a universal trait, whereas advocates of culture-embedded positive psychology believe that the cultural context reach happiness differently, depending on their culture.\n\nNonstandardized measurements of emotion are also due to the fact that pleasant hedonic experiences are expressed in very different ways across cultural groups, hindering researchers' ability to choose universal terms that will accurately describe these experiences without completely disregarding their cultural context. For example, Mesquita and Frijda (1992) argue that the word for \"happiness\" not only changes across languages, it also describes a different emotional experience. In English, happiness refers to a \"high arousal, exuberant experience,\" while its equivalent in Hindi, \"sukhi, \"refers to a low-arousal experience of peace and happiness, and in Kenya, for the Kipsigis, \"happiness\" is a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This makes it challenging for researchers to study positive psychology across cultures, as different interpretations of these terms could lead to invalid assumptions about specific emotions.\n\n\n"}

It followed the brief Ordinance of Secession that had been issued on December 20. The declaration is a product of a convention organized by the state's government in the month following the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President, where it was drafted in a committee headed by Christopher Memminger. The declaration stated the primary reasoning behind South Carolina's declaring of secession from the U.S., which was described as \"increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery\".\n\nAn official secession convention met in South Carolina following the November 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery into U.S. territories. On December 20, 1860, the convention issued an ordinance of secession announcing the state's withdrawal from the union. The ordinance was brief and legalistic in nature, containing no explanation of the reasoning behind the delegates' decision:\n\nThe convention had previously agreed to draft a separate statement that would summarize their justification and gave that task to a committee of seven members comprising Christopher G. Memminger (considered the primary author), F. H. Wardlaw, R. W. Barnwell, J. P. Richardson, B. H. Rutledge, J. E. Jenkins, and P. E. Duncan. The document they produced, the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, was adopted by the convention on December 24.\n\nThe opening portion of the declaration outlines the historical background of South Carolina and offers a legal justification for its secession. It asserts that the right of states to secede is implicit in the Constitution and this right was explicitly reaffirmed by South Carolina in 1852. The declaration states that the agreement between South Carolina and the United States is subject to the law of compact, which creates obligations on both parties and which revokes the agreement if either party fails to uphold its obligations.\n\nThe next section asserts that the government of the United States and of states within that government had failed to uphold their obligations to South Carolina. The specific issue stated was the refusal of some states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act and clauses in the U.S. Constitution protecting slavery and the federal government's perceived role in attempting to abolish slavery. \n\nThe next section states that while these problems had existed for twenty-five years, the situation had recently become unacceptable due to the election of a President (this was Abraham Lincoln although he is not mentioned by name) who was planning to outlaw slavery. In reference to the failure of the northern states to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, South Carolina states the primary reason for its secession: \n\nThe final section concludes with a statement that South Carolina had therefore seceded from the United States of America and was thus, no longer bound by its laws and authorities.\n\nWhile later claims have been made after the war's end that the South Carolinian decision to secede was prompted by other issues such as tariffs and taxes, these issues were not mentioned at all in the declaration. The primary focus of the declaration is the perceived violation of the Constitution by northern states in not extraditing escaped slaves (as the U.S. Constitution required in Article IV, Section 2) and actively working to abolish slavery (which South Carolinian secessionists saw as Constitutionally guaranteed and protected). The main thrust of the argument was that since the U.S. Constitution, being a contract, had been violated by some parties (the northern abolitionist states), the other parties (the southern slave-holding states) were no longer bound by it. Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas offered similar declarations when they seceded, following South Carolina's example.\n\nThe declaration does not make a simple declaration of states' rights. It asserts that South Carolina was a sovereign state that had delegated only particular powers to the federal government by means of the U.S. Constitution. It furthermore protests other states' failure to uphold their obligations under the Constitution. The declaration emphasizes that the Constitution explicitly requires states to deliver \"person(s) held in service or labor\" back to their state of origin.\n\nThe declaration was the second of three documents to be officially issued by the South Carolina Secession Convention. The first was the Ordinance of Secession itself. The third was \"The Address of the people of South Carolina, assembled in Convention, to the people of the Slaveholding States of the United States\", written by Robert Barnwell Rhett, which called on other slave holding states to secede and join in forming a new nation. The convention resolved to print 15,000 copies of these three documents and distribute them to various parties.\n\nThe declaration was seen as analogous to the U.S. Declaration of Independence from 1776, however, it omitted the phrases that \"all men are created equal\", \"that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\", and \"consent of the governed\". Professor and historian Harry V. Jaffa noted this omission as significant in his 2000 book, \"A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War\":\n\nJaffa states that South Carolina omitted references to human equality and consent of the governed, as due to their racist and pro-slavery views, secessionist South Carolinians did not believe in those ideals:\n\n\n"}

Many of these were commissioned by government departments to offer information on matters of public health and safety, personal finance, and on historical and cultural subjects. The Institute also produced numerous educational 'filmstrips' for use in the classroom by teachers. Also notable is a series of films recording the highlights of All-Ireland Hurling and Football Finals between 1947 and 1979.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Church influence within the NFI had declined, and in 1982, the decision was made to delete references to the Vigilanti Cura from the articles of association to reflect the now secular nature of the Institute, and to rename the organisation as the Irish Film Institute (IFI). While it was clear that the Irish Film Institute was no longer concerned with the morals of its audience, education through (and about) film was still a significant part of its remit: an education department was developed with the aim of bringing a broader and deeper experience of cinema to audiences of all ages and abilities, from primary school children to senior citizens.\n\nAt this time of reinvention and reinvigoration, a campaign to create the Irish Film Centre (IFC) as a home for the Institute and other organisations dealing with film culture got underway, and an 18th-century Quaker Meeting House was acquired in the regenerated area of Temple Bar in Dublin. The Irish Film Centre (which is still home to the IFI) was opened in Eustace Street on 23 September 1992 by the then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. In the two decades since its move to Eustace Street, the IFI has become one of the busiest and most dynamic arts organisations in the country, engaging with audiences nationally and internationally.\n\nAside from providing the IFI with a centrally located public space with (then) two cinemas, a film shop and café bar, the new venue allowed the Institute to develop other aspects of its activities in addition to its main exhibition programme, such as the education, festivals and retrospective programmes. The location also provided the IFI Irish Film Archive with custom-built storage and research facilities, thereby ensuring that it was recognised as an essential part of the IFI, safeguarding its collections and increasing public access to its holdings.\n\nThe IFI has had many homes over the years and has seen a radical transformation in its ethos since its foundation; however, a commitment to and love of cinema have always been central to its mission. In 2009, the IFI underwent an extensive redevelopment, supported by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism ACCESS II Scheme, which expanded its facilities to include a third cinema and new archive research facilities, allowing it to have ever more ambitious aims for itself and its audiences, while remaining dedicated to achieving its core objectives: Preserve, Exhibit and Educate.\n\nThe IFI runs annual festival, including IFI Family Festival (August), IFI Docfest (September), IFI Horrorthon (October), IFI French Film Festival (November), Kinopolis – Polish Film Festival;(December)\n\nThe IFI Irish Film Archive acquires, preserves and makes available Ireland's moving image heritage, working to ensure that Ireland's rich and varied film history, both amateur and professional, is protected and accessible for the benefit of current and future generations. Film reels, digital materials and document collections are held in custom- built, climate- controlled vaults designed for the long- term storage of archival materials. \n\nNamed in honour of Tiernan MacBride in recognition of his contribution to the Irish film industry, the Library holds one of the largest collections of film related publications in Ireland. The collection includes a wide range of books, journals, and reports covering both international and Irish cinema. The Library’s collections are reference only, researchers, students, teachers, filmmakers and members of the public are all welcome to use the Library. \n\nIFI International provides Irish film programming services for cultural exhibitors worldwide. Drawing on the collections of the IFI Irish Film Archive and liaising with Irish film directors, producers and distributors, IFI International provides access for cultural exhibitors to new and classic Irish cinema. distributing archival and cultural cinema to international venues and has programmed work in New York’s MoMA and Lincoln Centre, New Dehli, Moscow, Brussels and Poland, to name a few.\n\nSupported by Culture Ireland, IFI International works with over 100 exhibition partners in more than 40 countries annually to strategically develop a global audience for Irish film culture. Irish film programmes are presented in contexts which enhance understanding of Irish cinema and which provide new routes for audiences who may be unfamiliar with Irish culture.\n\nThe IFI also provides a venue for debate and acts as a meeting place for a variety of groups. A series of public interviews has brought many international filmmakers and actors to IFI audiences over the years, including John Woo, Peter Greenaway, Dennis Hopper, Atom Egoyan, Sydney Pollack, Tim Roth, Joel Schumacher, Juliette Binoche, John C. Reilly, U2's Larry Mullen Jr. and Claude Miller. Evening courses offer opportunities to explore everything from Indian cinema and America independents to Spanish film, with lectures following each screening. Throughout the month, the IFI offers a wide range of activities and special screenings, including: The IFI Film Club (post-screening discussion), The Bigger Picture (A film chosen by a guest as a notable film canon), Wild Strawberries (morning screenings for the senior audiences), IFI Family (family-friendly films), Irish Focus (monthly showcase of new Irish film, often followed by a Q&A with filmmakers), Archive at Lunchtime (free archive screenings), Feast Your Eyes (dinner club screenings), Mystery Matinee (a surprise film each month), From the Vaults (a film from the archives) Afternoon Talks, Monthly Must-See Cinema, Experimental Film Club and others. \nFilms from the IFI Irish Film Archive are subsequently restored and released on DVD over the years, including Seoda, GAA Gold, GAA Hurling Gold, GAA Football Gold, Irish Destiny, The O’Kalem Collection.\n\nIn 2009, the IFI improved its facilities, including the introduction of digital sound, larger screens in each cinema, and the installation of Ireland's only functioning 70mm projection system in Cinema 1. The IFI is the only cinema in the country screening films in all possible formats – from Digibeta, DVD, Blu-ray and DCP, to 8, 16, 35 or 70mm. It also screens film in 3D.\n\nThe IFI operates a model of cultural enterprise, using core Arts Council subsidy to procure diverse income streams which are then invested back into our core activities to maximise the impact to the public of Arts Council funding. The Arts Council's support of the IFI generates significant returns to the State, both economically and culturally. In 2010 the IFI used public subsidy of €800,000 to run a cultural organisation that employs 60 people and has an annual turnover of just over €3 million.\n\nPresident Michael D. Higgins is the honorary Patron of the IFI. \n\nThere are three cinemas: Cinema 1 has a capacity of 258; Cinema 2 holds 106 people; and Cinema 3 seats 58. They are wheelchair accessible and support the use of hearing aids.\n\nIFI Film Shop stocks a wide selection of literature about Irish cinema, as well as Irish and world films on video and DVD.\n\n"}

The other section, which is more commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, is known as the \"Suwen\" 素問 (\"Basic Questions\").\n\nNo version of the \"Lingshu\" prior to the 12th century has survived. Most scholars presume that the original title of the \"Lingshu\" was either \"Zhenjing\" 鍼經 [\"Classic of Acupuncture\" or \"Needling Canon\"] or \"Jiujuan\" 九卷 [\"Nine Fascicles\"]. They base this conclusion on the following evidence:\n\nAll current editions of the \"Lingshu\" are based on Shi Song's edition from 1155. The earliest extant edition was made in 1339 and 1340, under the Yuan dynasty, by a publishing house called the Gulin shutang 古林書堂.

The Gulin shutang edition was the earliest known joint edition of \"Lingshu\" and \"Suwen\".\n\nMany practitioners through the ages have believed that the name \"Lingshu\" reflected the complex esoteric nature of the writings.

The popularity of his social undertakings is demonstrated by hundreds of publications presently in the phase of being catalogued.\nMario Borrelli fits with the definition of organic intellectual according to Gramsci’s terminology: his historical and social studies mark the most significant stages of his life but especially his work in society.\nEditor and Director of Lo Scugnizzo, media outlet of La Casa dello Scugnizzo (The House of the Urchins), he harboured multiple interests other than that for the social sciences. He was author of autobiographies, poems, scripts and educational projects until the 80’s when he principally narrowed down his interests to peace research and education.\nHis works still remain partly unpublished.\nThe documents and articles indicated below can only partly be found in Italian and foreign libraries, while the entire collection of publications is stored in his private archive of the Borrelli-West family, which continues to spend time and dedication to the catalogueing of Mario Borrelli’s main biographies and especially of his rich historical and critical production.\nIt should be stressed that the list of documents and publications indicated below, although representative of Mario Borrelli’s works, is by no means complete.\n\nMario Borrelli was already popular in Anglophile countries since the 50’s thanks to the biographical novel Children of the Sun written by Morris West, in which his undertakings as priest-street urchin had been celebrated as an example of heroism and Christianity.\nWhen, in 1963, he wrote together with A. Thorne his first autobiography, A Street Lamp and the Stars, it was with the aim to share with his trustees, around the world, both the story behind the foundation of the Casa dello Scugnizzo (House of the Urchins) and the spirit with which he continued to welcome and raise so many maladapted children.\nIn 1967, Un Prete nelle Baracche, was inspired by the diary he had kept between 1962–63, the first years he had spent in the slums of Naples, where the street urchins most commonly came from.\n\n\nArchivist paleographer in education and researcher at the Archive of the Padri Girolamini Library in Naples, Mario Borrelli produced several bibliographic works.\nFrom 1961, he published essays and articles of social and humanitary relevance such as L’Archivio del Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo (details below).\nThe volumes dedicated to the Cardinal Cesare Baronio and to the Neapolitan Oratory gave a significant contribution to the Neapolitan studies of the 15th-century.\n\n\n\nThe works on social administration are the result of the years M. Borrelli spent at the London School of Economics to obtain a Master in Social Administration.\nFrom the socio-political analysis of the sub-proletarian reality of Naples (1973) to the basic concepts for a comunitary action on the urban underclass (1974) we find the basic principles, which inspired M. Borrelli in all his activities at the Materdei Community Centre.\nIn addition, between 1969 and 1978, his idea of a participative democracy was a guideline for all his actions of social intervention among the people of the lower classes of the Neapolitan population: the CCM (Materdei Community Centre) worked for the awareness of the underclass taking inspiration from the method of Paulo Freire.\nExtremely interesting are the essays focused on the relationship between school and capitalistic development in Italy (1972) e Italian compulsory schooling and mental retardation (1978).\n\n\nIn 1977, Mario Borrelli was among the founders of IPRI (Italian Peace Research Institute) and soon afterwards became a member of PEC, Peace Education Commission, within IPRA (International Peace Research Association).\nHis essays on peace education were aimed at finding a paradigm that would consider peace education an autonomous science in the same way as peace research.\nHis most famous essay was Integration Between Peace Research, Peace Education and Peace Action, which was presented at the IPRA General Conference that took place in Oaxtapec, Mexico in 1977, a milestone for many researchers interested in peace education.\n\n\n\nOutside of the body of works by Mario Borrelli is a list of the most important contributions (biographies, essays, magazine articles) written by others on the life and work of Mario Borrelli.\n\n\n\n"}

He was Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at Trinity College, Oxford, for more than forty years, a long-serving officer of arms, and Lord Mayor of Oxford 1970–71.\nMaclagan was born in London and educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. He graduated from Christ Church with a first class degree in 1935, and was awarded the Gladstone Memorial Exhibition. After two years as a lecturer at Christ Church, he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1939 (the last Fellow to be so elected before the outbreak of World War II). At both Winchester and Oxford he was a member of the Officer Training Corps; and he served as President of the Oxford University Archaeological Society.\n\nIn February 1941, Maclagan was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 16th/5th Lancers, Royal Armoured Corps. He spent much of the war in staff and intelligence jobs: for a period he was in Cairo, but he was subsequently posted to Military Operations in the War Office in London, where his proficiency in Italian and Serbo-Croat stood him in good stead. He ultimately reached the rank of major.\n\nIn 1946, Maclagan returned to Trinity College, where he remained as Fellow and Tutor in Modern History until his retirement in 1981. For many years he shared teaching duties with the early modern scholar John Phillips Cooper (1920–1978). He held various college offices (including Dean, Librarian, Senior Tutor, Vice-President, and steward of the Senior Common Room); was Senior Proctor for the University in 1954–5; and he also served as Senior Librarian (1960–70) and Trustee (1970–99) of the Oxford Union.\n\nOutside the University, he served as a university-appointed alderman on Oxford City Council, and held the offices of Sheriff in 1964–5, and Lord Mayor in 1970–71. He served as Chairman of the Oxford Diocesan Advisory Committee, 1961–85; and as Master of the Scriveners' Company, 1988–9.\n\nHe had lifelong interests in heraldry and genealogy, and served both as a private officer of arms and at the College of Arms in London. He began his heraldic career in 1948 with an appointment as Slains Pursuivant of Arms, and held that office until 1970. This appointment was made by the Chief of the Name and Arms of Hay after the resurgence of private armorial officers following World War II.\n\nIn 1953 Maclagan was made an Officer Brother of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and served as a Gold Staff Officer at the Coronation and as a Green Staff Officer at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. In 1970, he was appointed Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary at the College of Arms. He held this post for 10 years until his promotion to the office of Richmond Herald on 14 July 1980. Maclagan held this last office until his retirement in 1989, at the age of 75.\n\nOn his retirement from Trinity in 1981, a portrait of Maclagan in his herald's tabard by Paul Brason was commissioned by the Trinity Society and presented to the College: it is now hung in the screens passage to the College dining hall.\n\nMaclagan was characterised by his obituary-writer in \"The Times\" as an antiquary, rather than an historian. Patric Dickinson, in the \"Independent\", called him \"the quintessential Oxford don – a scholar of the old school, erudite, antiquarian and stylish\", who \"seemed to have strayed from an earlier age\". He had an eclectic range of historical interests spanning all periods (particularly, but far from exclusively, in the fields of genealogy, heraldry and bibliography); he was more concerned with arcane detail, for which he had a remarkable memory, than with grand narrative; and he tended to pursue topics and projects which appealed to him, rather than those which might advance his career. All this meant that he published less than he might have done. \n\nHe was a proficient linguist, fluent in Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian and Serbo-Croat, and with some knowledge of Arabic. His first book, in 1949, was a translation of part of the Venerable Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation\".\n\nMany of his core interests were genealogical. He had a longstanding expertise in the history of the medieval Anglo-Norman family of de Clare, although little of this came to print. His principal foray into modern history was a well-received biography of a kinsman (through his mother), the first Earl Canning, who was Governor-General of India during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and first Viceroy of India. He is best known to students of royal and noble genealogies and royal families as co-author (with Jiří Louda, who compiled and drew the tables, while Maclagan wrote the text) of the best-selling \"Lines of Succession\", first published in 1981, and subsequently reprinted and revised on several occasions.\n\nHe was also interested in Byzantine history, and in 1968 published a history of Constantinople. For many years he spent part of his summer vacation as a popular lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nHe was a keen bibliophile, and built up an extensive collection of rare books. In 1960 he published an edition of Bishop Richard de Bury's \"Philobiblon\", one of the earliest studies of librarianship. He was a meticulous indexer: his biography of Canning was awarded the Society of Indexers' Wheatley Medal in 1962; and in 1988 he compiled the index for Francis Jones's \"Catalogue of Welsh Manuscripts in the College of Arms\".\n\nMichael Maclagan was the son of Sir Eric Maclagan (1879–1951), for many years director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His mother, Helen Elizabeth Lascelles (10 October 1879 – 19 October 1942), who married Eric Maclagan on 8 July 1913, was a granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Harewood: she was a sister of Sir Alan \"Tommy\" Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI and a second cousin once removed to the 7th Earl of Harewood who married Mary, Princess Royal, only daughter of King George V and sister to King George VI. \n\nMaclagan's paternal grandfather was the Most Reverend William Dalrymple Maclagan (1826–1910), Archbishop of York from 1891 to 1908, and the cleric who had crowned Queen Alexandra in 1902. His paternal grandmother, second wife of the Archbishop, was the Honourable Augusta Anne Barrington (1836–1915), daughter of the 6th Viscount Barrington. (Augusta Maclagan had money settled upon her when she married Maclagan, then Bishop of Lichfield, in 1878: about half her money was settled on her son Eric when he married in 1913, giving him and his wife a considerable degree of financial independence.)\n\nThrough both his mother and his paternal grandmother, Maclagan thus had connections to several British aristocratic families. The Honourable Augusta Maclagan was a great-granddaughter of the 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne; thus making her grandson Michael Maclagan a distant kinsman to the Queen.\n\nMaclagan was twice married. His first marriage in 1939 to a cousin, Brenda Alexander, was dissolved by divorce in 1946. His second marriage in 1949 to Jean Elizabeth Brooksbank Garnett lasted almost 54 years; she died on 3 August 2003. He died ten days later on the day of her funeral. Maclagan had a son by his first marriage, and a son (who died, aged 26, in 1984) and two daughters by his second marriage.\n\n\n\n"}

She watches over spinning and weaving, shearing of sheep, and protects women in childbirth. Mokosh is the Great Mother.\n\nMokoš was the only female deity whose idol was erected by Vladimir the Great in his Kiev sanctuary along with statues of other major gods (Perun, Hors, Dažbog, Stribog, and Simargl).\n\nMokosh probably means moisture. According to Max Vasmer, her name is derived from the same root as Slavic words \"mokry\", 'wet', and \"moknut(i)\", 'get wet'. Or to dive deeply into something. She may have originated in the northern Finno-Ugric tribes of the Vogul, who still have the divinity \"Moksha\".\n\nMokoš was one of the most popular Slavic deities and the great earth Mother Goddess of East Slavs and Eastern Polans. She is a wanderer and a spinner. Her consorts are probably both the god of thunder Perun and his opponent Veles. In saying, the former Katičić follows Ivanov and Toporov (1983) without further corroborating their claim. Katičić also points to the possibility that as goddess Vela she is the consort of Veles, and might even be interpreted as another form of the polymorph god Veles himself. Mokosh is also the mother of the twin siblings Jarilo and Morana.\n\nArcheological evidence of Mokosh dates back to the 7th century BC. As late as the 19th century, she was worshipped as a force of fertility and the ruler of death. Worshipers prayed to Mokosh-stones or breast-shaped boulders that held power over the land and its people.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Mokosh is still popular as a powerful life giving force and protector of women. Villages are named after her. She shows up in embroidery, represented as a woman with uplifted hands and flanked by two plow horses. Sometimes she is shown with male sexual organs, as the deity in charge of male potency.\n\nA key myth in Slavic mythology, is the divine battle between the thunder god Perun and his opponent the god Veles. Some authors and the original researchers Ivanov and Toporov believe, the abduction of Mokosh causes the struggle,\n\nAccording to Boris Rybakov, in his 1987 work \"Paganism of Ancient Rus\", Mokosh is represented on one of the sides of the Zbruch Idol.\n\nDuring Christianization of Kievan Rus' there were warnings issued against worshipping Mokoš. She was replaced by the cult of the Virgin Mary and St. Paraskevia.\n\nTraces of Mokosh are today well preserved in the various toponyms of Slavic countries. In Slovenia her name has been preserved in a village called Makoše in the vicinity of Ribnica, historically known as Makoša or Makoš, and also in the River Mokoš in the Prekmurje region. In Croatia, near the Rieka lies the village of Mokošica, and near Dubrovnik the village Makoše, and also the suburb areas of Nova and Stara Mokošica. A village near Zagreb is also called Mokos. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, near the village Ravno is located a hill called Mukušina. South of Mostar lies the hill Mukoša.\n\n"}

{"id": "699208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699208", "title": "National Treasure (film)", "text": "National Treasure (film)\n\nNational Treasure is a 2004 American adventure film produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was written by Jim Kouf and the Wibberleys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Jon Turteltaub. It is the first film in the \"National Treasure\" film series and stars Nicolas Cage, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha and Christopher Plummer.\n\nCage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptologist searching for a lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork and other artifacts that was accumulated into a single massive stockpile by looters and warriors over many millennia starting in Ancient Egypt, later rediscovered by warriors who form themselves into the Knights Templar to protect the treasure, eventually hidden by American Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War. A coded map on the back of the Declaration of Independence points to the location of the \"national treasure,\" but Gates is not alone in his quest. Whoever can steal the Declaration and decode it first will find the greatest treasure in history.\n\n\"National Treasure\" was released worldwide on November 19, 2004. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing over $347 million worldwide.\n\nA sequel, titled \"\", was released in December 2007.\n\nBenjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, cryptologist, and treasure hunter. As a child, his grandfather, John Adams Gates, told him of a story that Charles Carroll of Carrollton passed on a secret to their ancestor in 1832 of a fabled treasure taken from ancient empires throughout history that was discovered by the Knights Templar and later protected by the Freemasons. The treasure would eventually be hidden in America by the Founding Fathers. The clue leading to the treasure is the phrase \"The secret lies with Charlotte\". While Ben is convinced by the story, his skeptical father dismisses it as nonsense.\n\nThirty years later, Ben leads an expedition with Ian Howe, and his friend, Riley Poole, a computer expert, to find the \"Charlotte\", a ship lost in the Arctic, which holds the first clue to finding the national treasure. After hard fought efforts, they find a meerschaum pipe, which has a clue in the form of a riddle, implying that the next clue is on the Declaration of Independence. When Ian suggests they steal the it, Ben opposes, causing a fight to ensue, resulting in a massive fire fueled by gunpowder, and the group split in two. Ian and his men escape the ship while Ben and Riley take cover just before the ship explodes.\n\nBen and Riley return to Washington D.C. and report the potential theft of the Declaration to the FBI and Dr. Abigail Chase of the National Archives, but both dismiss their claim. Ben decides to steal the document himself from the Archives' preservation room during a gala event. Obtaining Abigail's fingerprints, Ben successfully obtains the Declaration, but is spotted by Ian's group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the gift shop, but has to buy the Declaration when the clerk mistakes it for a souvenir copy; having not enough cash in hand at the time, Ben pays for it with a credit card. Abigail, suspecting something is astray, pursues Ben and takes back the document. Ian kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a souvenir copy of Declaration. FBI Agent Sadusky begins tracking Ben down, using Ben's credit card information.\n\nUnable to return home, the trio go to Patrick's house. Patrick tries to convince Ben that the treasure is a myth, but Ben dismisses this. The trio then study the Declaration and discover an Ottendorf cipher written in invisible ink. With the help of lemon juice and some heat from the hair dryer, they find out that the hidden cypher refers to the Silence Dogood letters written by Benjamin Franklin. Patrick formerly owned them, but donated them to the Franklin Institute. Using a school boy to acquire the letters' key words, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell once stood. Unfortunately, Ian and his men question the school boy and pursue the new lead. Following the point on the opposite wall of the bell house where the shadow casted at exactly 2:22 pm on the same day, Ben finds a hidden cache containing a pair of glasses with multiple colored lenses invented by Benjamin Franklin, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveals a clue pointing to the symbol of Trinity Church which is located on Wall Street and Broadway in New York City.\n\nThe group is chased by Ian's associates. Ben is arrested by the FBI, while Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian. However, Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, arranging a meeting at the USS Intrepid, where they help Ben evade the FBI.\n\nIan returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has kidnapped Patrick as a hostage. They go inside Trinity Church where they sit and study the back of the Declaration of Independence using the different lenses resulting in the discovery of an underground passage known as Parkington Lane but it appears to lead to a dead end lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is referencing the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, pointing Ian to the Old North Church in Boston. Ian leaves Gates trapped in the chamber to die, heading for Boston. Patrick reveals the clue was a fake, then enters the treasure room using the clues they gathered on their journey, but it seems looted. After a heart to heart between Ben and Patrick, they find a notch which the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, then escape through a back exit. Ben contacts Sadusky, who is actually a Freemason, surrendering the Declaration and the treasure's location in exchange for clemency. Ian is later arrested when Ben tips the FBI off.\n\nLater, Ben and Abigail have started a relationship. Meanwhile, Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder's fee for the treasure but accepted a much smaller amount of only 1%, which still has netted them all significant wealth. At the end, Riley drives away in a Ferrari .\n\n\nAdditionally, David Dayan Fisher appears as Shaw, Stewart Finlay-McLennan as Powell, Oleg Taktarov as Victor Shippen, and Stephen Pope as Phil McGregor (all four being Ian's henchmen); Annie Parisse, Mark Pellegrino, Armando Riesco, and Erik King play agents Johnson, Dawes, Hendricks, and Colfax, respectively. Jason Earles portrays Thomas Gates.\n\nEarly 1999, it was revealed that Jon Turteltaub was developing \"National Treasure\" based upon an idea developed by Oren Aviv and Charles Segars two years earlier, with the script penned by Jim Kouf. By 2001, the project was relocated to Touchstone Pictures.\nIn May 2003, Nicolas Cage was cast as lead in the film. New drafts were written by nine scribers, including Cormac and Marianne Wibberley, E. Max Frye and Jon Turteltaub. By October, Sean Bean was cast.\n\n\"National Treasure\" was filmed primarily in Washington, New York, Philadelphia and Utah. Most scenes were filmed on location, with the exceptions of the Independence Hall scene, which was filmed at the replica of Independence Hall at Knott's Berry Farm, and the Arctic scene, which was filmed in Utah.\n\n\"National Treasure\" earned $11 million on its opening day in the United States, ahead of Paramount & Nickelodeon's \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\" (which earned $9,559,752). It grossed a combined total of $35,142,554 during its opening weekend, on 4,300 screens at 3,243 theaters, averaging $11,648 per venue, again ahead of \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\". The film had the best opening weekend for a Disney film released in November, until it was surpassed by \"Chicken Little\" in 2005. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. In Japan \"National Treasure\" bested out the double-billing \"MegaMan NT Warrior: Program of Light and Dark\" and \"Duel Masters: Curse of the Deathphoenix\" by grossing $11,666,763 in its first week. The film closed on June 2, 2005 with its domestic gross being $173,008,894 while earning $174,503,424 internationally. Worldwide, \"National Treasure\" grossed over $347,512,318, against a budget of $100 million.\n\n\"National Treasure\" received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom lauded it as a fun, straightforward family adventure, while others ridiculed its numerous implausibilities and unbelievable plot twists. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 44%, based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"National Treasure\" is no treasure, but it's a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 39 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2/4 stars, calling it \"so silly that the Monty Python version could use the same screenplay, line for line.\" Academic David Bordwell has expressed a liking for the film, placing it in the tradition of 1950s Disney children's adventure movies, and using it as the basis for an essay on scene transitions in classical Hollywood cinema.\n\nA special collector's edition, two-disc DVD set of the movie was released on December 18, 2007. The set features deleted scenes and bonus content.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Blu-ray Disc versions of \"National Treasure\" and its sequel, \"National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets\", on May 20, 2008.\n\nAlthough the DVD commentary stated that there were no plans for a sequel, the film's box office gross of an unexpected $347.5 million worldwide warranted a second film, which was given the green light in 2005. \"\" was released on December 21, 2007.\n\nIn 2008, director Jon Turteltaub said that the filmmaking team will take its time on another \"National Treasure\" sequel. In October 2013, Turteltaub confirmed that the studio, himself, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the actors all want to do the third film, saying: \"We want to do the movie, Disney wants to do the movie. We're just having the damnedest time writing it. I'll bet that within two years, we'll be shooting that movie. I'd say we're about half-way there.\" In May 2016, Nicolas Cage confirmed the film was still in the writing process, and in July 2018, Turtletaub reiterated that a script for a possible third film was \"close\" but Disney still wasn't completely sold by the idea.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "341861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341861", "title": "Oromo language", "text": "Oromo language\n\nOromo ( ) is an Afroasiatic language spoken in the Horn of Africa. It is the most widely spoken language in the family's Cushitic branch. Forms of Oromo are spoken as a first language by more than 40 million Oromo people and neighbouring peoples in Ethiopia and by an additional half million in parts of northern and eastern Kenya. It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries such as South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Sudan. Oromo is a dialect continuum; not all varieties are mutually intelligible.\n\nThe native name for the Oromo language is \"Afaan Oromoo\", which translates to \"mouth (language) of Oromo\" and ``afaan oromoo´´ is an official language in Ethiopia.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" (2015) divides the Oromo macrolanguage into four languages\n\nIt is divided into five languages in the ISO 639-3 listing:\n\nBlench (2006) concurs, dividing Oromo into four languages:\n\nSome of the varieties of Oromo have been examined and classified.\n\nAbout 85 percent of Oromo speakers live in Ethiopia, mainly in Oromia Region. In addition, in Somalia there are also some speakers of the language. In Kenya, the Ethnologue also lists 722,000 speakers of Borana and Orma, two languages closely related to Ethiopian Oromo. Within Ethiopia, Oromo is the language with the largest number of native speakers.\n\nWithin Africa, Oromo is the language with the fourth most speakers, after Arabic (if one counts the mutually unintelligible spoken forms of Arabic as a single language and assumes the same for the varieties of Oromo), Swahili, and Hausa.\n\nBesides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language. See, for example, the Omotic-speaking Bambassi and the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Kwama in northwestern Oromiyaa.\n\nBefore the Ethiopian Revolution of 1974, publishing or broadcasting in Oromo was very limited. The few works that had been published, most notably Onesimos Nesib's and Aster Ganno's translation of the Bible from the late nineteenth century, were written in the Ge'ez alphabet, as was the 1875 New Testament produced by Krapf. Following the 1974 Revolution, the government undertook a literacy campaign in several languages, including Oromo, and publishing and radio broadcasts began in the language. All Oromo materials printed in Ethiopia at that time, such as the newspaper \"Bariisaa, Urjii\" and many others, were written in the traditional script.\n\nPlans to introduce Oromo language instruction in the schools, however, were not realized until the government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was overthrown in 1991, except in regions controlled by the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). With the creation of the regional state of Oromia under the new system of ethnic federalism in Ethiopia, it has been possible to introduce Oromo as the medium of instruction in elementary schools throughout the region (including areas where other ethnic groups live speaking their languages) and as a language of administration within the region. Since the OLF left the transitional Ethiopian government in the early 1990s, the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization (OPDO) continued developing Oromo in Ethiopia.\n\nOromo is written with a Latin alphabet called Qubee which was formally adopted in 1991. Various versions of the Latin-based orthography had been used previously, mostly by Oromos outside of Ethiopia and by the OLF by the late 1970s (Heine 1986). With the adoption of Qubee, it is believed more texts were written in the Oromo language between 1991 and 1997 than in the previous 100 years. In Kenya, the Borana and Waata also use Roman letters but with different systems.\n\nThe Sapalo script was an indigenous Oromo script invented by Sheikh Bakri Sapalo (also known by his birth name, Abubaker Usman Odaa) in the years following Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and used underground afterwards. The Arabic script has also been used intermittently in areas with Muslim populations.\n\nWithin Kenya there has been radio broadcasting in Oromo (in the Borana dialect) on the Voice of Kenya since at least the 1980s. The Borana Bible in Kenya was printed in 1995 using the Latin alphabet, but not using the same spelling rules as in Ethiopian Qubee. The first comprehensive online Afaon Oromo dictionary was developed by the Jimma Times Oromiffa Group (JTOG) in cooperation with SelamSoft. Voice of America also broadcasts in Oromo alongside its other horn of Africa programs. Oromo and Qubee are currently utilized by the Ethiopian government's state radios, TV stations and regional government newspaper.\n\nLike most other Ethiopian languages, whether Semitic, Cushitic, or Omotic, Oromo has a set of ejective consonants, that is, voiceless stops or affricates that are accompanied by glottalization and an explosive burst of air. Oromo has another glottalized phone that is more unusual, an implosive retroflex stop, \"dh\" in Oromo orthography, a sound that is like an English \"d\" produced with the tongue curled back slightly and with the air drawn in so that a glottal stop is heard before the following vowel begins. It is retroflex in most dialects, though it is not strongly implosive and may reduce to a flap between vowels. One source describes it as voiceless .\n\nOromo has the typical Eastern Cushitic set of five short and five long vowels, indicated in the orthography by doubling the five vowel letters. The difference in length is contrastive, for example, \"hara\" 'lake', \"haaraa\" 'new'. Gemination is also significant in Oromo. That is, consonant length can distinguish words from one another, for example, \"badaa\" 'bad', \"baddaa\" 'highland'.\n\nIn the Qubee alphabet, letters include the digraphs \"ch, dh, ny, ph, sh.\" Gemination is not obligatorily marked for digraphs, though some writers indicate it by doubling the first element: \"qopphaa'uu\" 'be prepared'. In the charts below, the International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for a phoneme is shown in brackets where it differs from the Oromo letter. The phonemes appear in parentheses because they are only found in recently adopted words. Note that there have been minor changes in the orthography since it was first adopted: () was originally rendered , and there has been some confusion among authors in the use of and in representing the phonemes and , with some early works using for and for and even for different phonemes depending on where it appears in a word. This article uses consistently for and for .\n\nOnly the penultimate or final syllable of a root can have a high tone, and if the penultimate is high, the final must also be high; this implies that Oromo has a pitch-accent system (in which the tone need be specified only on one syllable, the others being predictable) rather than a tone system (in which each syllable must have its tone specified), although the rules are complex (each morpheme can contribute its own tone pattern to the word), so that \"one can call Oromo a pitch-accent system in terms of the basic lexical representation of pitch, and a tone system in terms of its surface realization.\" The stressed syllable is perceived as the first syllable of a word with high pitch.\n\nLike most other Afroasiatic languages, Oromo has two grammatical genders,\nmasculine and feminine, and all nouns belong to either one or the other.\nGrammatical gender in Oromo enters into the grammar in the following ways:\n\nExcept in some southern dialects, there is nothing in the form of most nouns that indicates their gender. A small number of nouns pairs for people, however, end in \"-eessa\" (m.) and \"-eettii\" (f.), as do adjectives when they are used as nouns: \"obboleessa\" 'brother', \"obboleettii\" 'sister', \"dureessa\" 'the rich one (m.)', \"hiyyeettii\" 'the poor one (f.)'. Grammatical gender normally agrees with natural gender for people and animals; thus nouns such as \"Abbaa\" 'father', \"Ilma\" 'son', and \"sangaa\" 'ox' are masculine, while nouns such as \"haadha\" 'mother' and \"intala\" 'girl, daughter' are feminine. However, most names for animals do not specify biological gender.\n\nNames of astronomical bodies are feminine: \"aduu\" 'sun', \"urjii\" 'star'. The gender of other inanimate nouns varies somewhat among dialects. \n\nOromo has singular and plural number, but nouns that refer to multiple entities are not obligatorily plural.: \"nama\" \"man\" \"namoota\" \"people\", \"nama shan\" \"five men\" \"namoota shan\" \"five people\". Another way of looking at this is to treat the \"singular\" form as unspecified for number.\n\nWhen it is important to make the plurality of a referent clear, the plural form of a noun is used. Noun plurals are formed through the addition of suffixes. The most common plural suffix is \"-oota\"; a final vowel is dropped before the suffix, and in the western dialects, the suffix becomes -ota following a syllable with a long vowel: \"mana\" 'house', \"manoota\" 'houses', \"hiriyaa\" 'friend', \"hiriyoota\" 'friends', \"barsiisaa\" 'teacher', \"barsiiso(o)ta\" 'teachers'. Among the other common plural suffixes are \"-(w)wan\", \"-een\", and \"-(a)an\"; the latter two may cause a preceding consonant to be doubled: \"waggaa\" 'year', \"waggaawwan\" 'years', \"laga\" 'river', \"laggeen\" 'rivers', \"ilma\" 'son', \"ilmaan\" 'sons'.\n\nOromo has no indefinite articles (corresponding to English \"a\", \"some\"), but (except in the southern dialects) it indicates definiteness (English \"the\") with suffixes on the noun: \"-(t)icha\" for masculine nouns (the \"ch\" is geminated though this is not normally indicated in writing) and \"-(t)ittii\" for feminine nouns. Vowel endings of nouns are dropped before these suffixes: \"karaa\" 'road', \"karicha\" 'the road', \"nama\" 'man', \"namicha\"/\"namticha\" 'the man', \"haroo\" 'lake', \"harittii\" 'the lake'. Note that for animate nouns that can take either gender, the definite suffix may indicate the intended gender: \"qaalluu\" 'priest', \"qaallicha\" 'the priest (m.)', \"qallittii\" 'the priest (f.)'. The definite suffixes appear to be used less often than \"the\" in English, and they seem not to co-occur with the plural suffixes.\n\nOromo noun has a citation form or base form that is used when the noun is the object of a verb, the object of a preposition or postposition, or a nominal predicative.\n\nA noun may also appear in one of six other grammatical cases, each indicated by a suffix or the lengthening of the noun's final vowel. The case endings follow plural or definite suffixes if these appear. For some of the cases, there is a range of forms possible, some covering more than one case, and the differences in meaning among these alternatives may be quite subtle.\n\nIn most languages, there is a small number of basic distinctions of person, number, and often gender that play a role within the grammar of the language. Oromo and English are such languages. We see these distinctions within the basic set of independent personal pronouns, for example, English \"I\", Oromo \"ani\"; English \"they\", Oromo \"isaani\" and the set of possessive adjectives and pronouns, for example, English \"my\", Oromo \"koo\"; English \"mine\", Oromo \"kan koo\". In Oromo, the same distinctions are also reflected in subject–verb agreement: Oromo verbs (with a few exceptions) agree with their subjects; that is, the person, number, and (singular third person) gender of the subject of the verb are marked by suffixes on the verb. Because these suffixes vary greatly with the particular verb tense/aspect/mood, they are normally not considered to be pronouns and are discussed elsewhere in this article under verb conjugation.\n\nIn all of these areas of the grammar—independent pronouns, possessive adjectives, possessive pronouns, and subject–verb agreement—Oromo distinguishes seven combinations of person, number, and gender. For first and second persons, there is a two-way distinction between singular ('I', 'you sg.') and plural ('we', 'you pl.'), whereas for third person, there is a two-way distinction in the singular ('he', 'she') and a single form for the plural ('they'). Because Oromo has only two genders, there is no pronoun corresponding to English \"it\"; the masculine or feminine pronoun is used according to the gender of the noun referred to.\n\nOromo is a subject pro-drop language. That is, neutral sentences in which the subject is not emphasized do not require independent subject pronouns: \"kaleessa dhufne\" 'we came yesterday'.\nThe Oromo word that translates 'we' does not appear in this sentence, though the person and number are marked on the verb \"dhufne\" ('we came') by the suffix \"-ne\". When the subject in such sentences needs to be given prominence for some reason, an independent pronoun can be used: \"nuti kaleessa dhufne\" 'we came yesterday'.\n\nThe table below gives forms of the personal pronouns in the different cases, as well as the possessive adjectives. For the first person plural and third person singular feminine categories, there is considerable variation across dialects; only some of the possibilities are shown.\n\nThe possessive adjectives, treated as separate words here, are sometimes written as noun suffixes. In most dialects there is a distinction between masculine and feminine possessive adjectives for first and second person (the form agreeing with the gender of the modified noun). However, in the western dialects, the masculine forms (those beginning with \"k-\") are used in all cases. Possessive adjectives may take the case endings for the nouns they modify: \"ganda kootti\" 'to my village' (\"-tti\": locative case).\n\nAs in languages such as French, Russian, and Turkish, the Oromo second person plural is also used as a polite singular form, for reference to people that the speaker wishes to show respect towards. This usage is an example of the so-called T-V distinction that is made in many languages. In addition, the third person plural may be used for polite reference to a single third person (either 'he' or 'she').\n\nFor possessive pronouns ('mine', 'yours', etc.), Oromo adds the possessive adjectives to \"kan\" 'of': \"kan koo\" 'mine', \"kan kee\" 'yours', etc.\n\nOromo has two ways of expressing reflexive pronouns ('myself', 'yourself', etc.). One is to use the noun meaning 'self': \"of(i)\" or \"if(i)\". This noun is inflected for case but, unless it is being emphasized, not for person, number, or gender: \"isheen of laalti\" 'she looks at herself' (base form of \"of\"), \"isheen ofiif makiinaa bitte\" 'she bought herself a car' (dative of \"of\").\n\nThe other possibility is to use the noun meaning 'head', \"mataa\", with possessive suffixes: \"mataa koo\" 'myself', \"mataa kee\" 'yourself (s.)', etc.\n\nOromo has a reciprocal pronoun \"wal\" (English 'each other') that is used like \"of/if\". That is, it is inflected for case but not person, number, or gender: \"wal jaalatu\" 'they like each other' (base form of \"wal\"), \"kennaa walii bitan\" 'they bought each other gifts' (dative of \"wal\").\n\nLike English, Oromo makes a two-way distinction between proximal ('this, these') and distal ('that, those') demonstrative pronouns and adjectives. Some dialects distinguish masculine and feminine for the proximal pronouns; in the western dialects the masculine forms (beginning with \"k-\") are used for both genders. Unlike in English, singular and plural demonstratives are not distinguished, but, as for nouns and personal pronouns in the language, case is distinguished. Only the base and nominative forms are shown in the table below; the other cases are formed from the base form as for nouns, for example, \"sanatti\" 'at/on/in that' (locative case).\nAn Oromo verb consists minimally of a stem, representing the lexical meaning of the verb, and a suffix, representing tense or aspect and subject agreement. For example, in \"dhufne\" 'we came', \"dhuf-\" is the stem ('come') and \"-ne\" indicates that the tense is past and that the subject of the verb is first person plural.\n\nAs in many other Afroasiatic languages, Oromo makes a basic two-way distinction in its verb system between the two tensed forms, past (or \"perfect\") and present (or \"imperfect\" or \"non-past\"). Each of these has its own set of tense/agreement suffixes. There is a third conjugation based on the present which has three functions: it is used in place of the present in subordinate clauses, for the jussive ('let me/us/him, etc. V', together with the particle \"haa\"), and for the negative of the present (together with the particle \"hin\"). For example, \"deemne\" 'we went', \"deemna\" 'we go', \"akka deemnu\" 'that we go', \"haa deemnu\" 'let's go', \"hin deemnu\" 'we don't go'. There is also a separate imperative form: \"deemi\" 'go (sg.)!'.\n\nThe table below shows the conjugation in the affirmative and negative of the verb \"beek-\" 'know'. The first person singular present and past affirmative forms require the suffix \"-n\" to appear on the word preceding the verb or the word \"nan\" before the verb. The negative particle \"hin\", shown as a separate word in the table, is sometimes written as a prefix on the verb.\n\nFor verbs with stems ending in certain consonants and suffixes beginning with consonants (that is, \"t\" or \"n\"), there are predictable changes to one or the other of the consonants. The dialects vary a lot in the details, but the following changes are common.\n\nVerbs whose stems end in two consonants and whose suffix begins with a consonant must insert a vowel to break up the consonants since the language does not permit sequences of three consonants. There are two ways this can happen: either the vowel \"i\" is inserted between the stem and the suffix, or the final stem consonants are switched (an example of metathesis) and the vowel \"a\" is inserted between them. For example, \"arg-\" 'see', \"arga\" 'he sees', \"argina\" or \"agarra\" (from \"agar-na\") 'we see'; \"kolf-\" 'laugh', \"kolfe\" 'he laughed', \"kolfite\" or \"kofalte\" 'you (sg.) laughed'.\n\nVerbs whose stems end in the consonant ' (which may appear as \"h\", \"w\", or \"y\" in some words, depending on the dialect) belong to three different conjugation classes; the class is not predictable from the verb stem. It is the forms that precede suffixes beginning with consonants (\"t\" and \"n\") that differ from the usual pattern. The third person masculine singular, second person singular, and first person plural present forms are shown for an example verb in each class.\n\nThe common verbs \"fedh-\" 'want' and \"godh-\" 'do' deviate from the basic conjugation pattern in that long vowels replace the geminated consonants that would result when suffixes beginning with \"t\" or \"n\" are added: \"fedha\" 'he wants', \"feeta\" 'you (sg.) want', \"feena\" 'we want', \"feetu\" 'you (pl.) want', \"hin feene\" 'didn't want', etc.\n\nThe verb \"dhuf-\" 'come' has the irregular imperatives \"koottu\", \"koottaa\". The verb \"deem-\" 'go' has, alongside regular imperative forms, the irregular imperatives \"beenu\", \"beenaa\".\n\nAn Oromo verb root can be the basis for three derived voices, passive, causative, and autobenefactive, each formed with addition of a suffix to the root, yielding the stem that the inflectional suffixes are added to.\n\nThe voice suffixes can be combined in various ways. Two causative suffixes are possible: \"ka'-\" 'go up', \"kaas-\" 'pick up', \"kaasis-\" 'cause to pick up'. The causative may be followed by the passive or the autobenefactive; in this case the \"s\" of the causative is replaced by \"f\": \"deebi'-\" 'return (intransitive)', \"deebis-\" 'return (transitive), answer', \"deebifam-\" 'be returned, be answered', \"deebifadh-\" 'get back for oneself'.\n\nAnother derived verbal aspect is the frequentative or \"intensive,\" formed by copying the first consonant and vowel of the verb root and geminating the second occurrence of the initial consonant. The resulting stem indicates the repetition or intensive performance of the action of the verb. Examples: \"bul-\" 'spend the night', \"bubbul-\" 'spend several nights', \"cab-\" 'break', \"caccab-\" 'break to pieces, break completely'; \"dhiib-\" 'push, apply pressure', \"dhiddhiib-\" 'massage'.\n\nThe infinitive is formed from a verb stem with the addition of the suffix \"-uu\". Verbs whose stems end in \"-dh\" (in particular all autobenefactive verbs) change this to \"ch\" before the suffix. Examples: \"dhug-\" 'drink', \"dhuguu\" 'to drink'; \"ga'-\" 'reach', \"ga'uu\" 'to reach'; \"jedh-\" 'say', \"jechu\" 'to say'. The verb \"fedh-\" is exceptional; its infinitive is \"fedhuu\" rather than the expected \"fechuu\". The infinitive behaves like a noun; that is, it can take any of the case suffixes. Examples: \"ga'uu\" 'to reach', \"ga'uuf\" 'in order to reach' (dative case); \"dhug-\" 'drink', \"dhugam-\" 'be drunk', \"dhugamuu\" to be drunk', \"dhugamuudhaan\" 'by being drunk' (instrumental case).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15929501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15929501", "title": "Performance per watt", "text": "Performance per watt\n\nIn computing, performance per watt is a measure of the energy efficiency of a particular computer architecture or computer hardware. Literally, it measures the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every watt of power consumed. This rate is typically measured by performance on the LINPACK benchmark when trying to compare between computing systems.\n\nSystem designers building parallel computers, such as Google's hardware, pick CPUs based on their (other than Green500) performance per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself.\n\nThe performance and power consumption metrics used depend on the definition; reasonable measures of performance are FLOPS, MIPS, or the score for any performance benchmark. Several measures of power usage may be employed, depending on the purposes of the metric; for example, a metric might only consider the electrical power delivered to a machine directly, while another might include all power necessary to run a computer, such as cooling and monitoring systems. The power measurement is often the average power used while running the benchmark, but other measures of power usage may be employed (e.g. peak power, idle power).\n\nFor example, the early UNIVAC I computer performed approximately 0.015 operations per watt-second (performing 1,905 operations per second (OPS), while consuming 125 kW). The Fujitsu FR-V VLIW/vector processor system on a chip in the 4 FR550 core variant released 2005 performs 51 Giga-OPS with 3 watts of power consumption resulting in 17 billion operations per watt-second. This is an improvement by over a trillion times in 54 years.\n\nMost of the power a computer uses is converted into heat, so a system that takes fewer watts to do a job will require less cooling to maintain a given operating temperature. Reduced cooling demands makes it easier to quiet a computer. Lower energy consumption can also make it less costly to run, and reduce the environmental impact of powering the computer (see green computing).\nIf installed where there is limited climate control, a lower power computer will operate at a lower temperature, which may make it more reliable. In a climate controlled environment, reductions in direct power use may also create savings in climate control energy.\n\nComputing energy consumption is sometimes also measured by reporting the energy required to run a particular benchmark, for instance EEMBC EnergyBench. Energy consumption figures for a standard workload may make it easier to judge the effect of an improvement in energy efficiency.\n\nPerformance (in operations/second) per watt can also be written as operations/watt-second, or operations/joule, since 1 watt = 1 joule/second.\n\nFLOPS per watt is a common measure. Like the FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second) metric it is based on, the metric is usually applied to scientific computing and simulations involving many floating point calculations.\n\n, the Green500 list rates the two most efficient supercomputers highest those are both based on the same manycore accelerator PEZY-SCnp Japanese technology in addition to Intel Xeon processors both at RIKEN, the top one at 6673.8 MFLOPS/watt; and the third ranked is the Chinese-technology Sunway TaihuLight (a much bigger machine, that is the ranked 2nd on TOP500, the others are not on that list) at 6051.3 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nIn June 2012, the Green500 list rated BlueGene/Q, Power BQC 16C as the most efficient supercomputer on the TOP500 in terms of FLOPS per watt, running at 2,100.88 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nOn 9 June 2008, CNN reported that IBM's Roadrunner supercomputer achieves 376 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nIn November 2010, IBM machine, Blue Gene/Q achieves 1,684 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nAs part of Intel's Tera-Scale research project, the team produced an 80 core CPU that can achieve over 16,000 MFLOPS/watt. The future of that CPU is not certain.\n\nMicrowulf, a low cost desktop Beowulf cluster of four dual-core Athlon 64 X2 3800+ computers, runs at 58 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nKalray has developed a 256-core VLIW CPU that achieves 25,000 MFLOPS/watt. Next generation is expected to achieve 75,000 MFLOPS/watt.\n\nAdapteva has announced the Epiphany-V, a 1024-core 64-bit RISC processor intended to achieve 75 GFLOPS/Watt.\n\nUS Patent 10,020,436, July 2018 claims three intervals of 100, 300, and 600 GFLOPS/Watt.\n\nThe Green500 list ranks computers from the TOP500 list of supercomputers in terms of energy efficiency, typically measured as LINPACK FLOPS per watt.\n\n, an Appro International, Inc. Xtreme-X supercomputer (\"Beacon\") topped the Green500 list with 2499 LINPACK MFLOPS/W. Beacon is deployed by NICS of the University of Tennessee and is a GreenBlade GB824M, Xeon E5-2670 based, eight cores (8C), 2.6 GHz, Infiniband FDR, Intel Xeon Phi 5110P computer.\n\n, the Eurotech supercomputer Eurora at Cineca topped the Green500 list with 3208 LINPACK MFLOPS/W. The Cineca Eurora supercomputer is equipped with two Intel Xeon E5-2687W CPUs and two PCI-e connected NVIDIA Tesla K20 accelerators per node. Water cooling and electronics design allows for very high densities to be reached with a peak performance of 350 TFLOPS per rack.\n\n, the L-CSC supercomputer of the Helmholtz Association at the GSI in Darmstadt Germany topped the Green500 list with 5271 MFLOPS/W and was the first cluster to surpass an efficiency of 5 GFLOPS/W. It runs on Intel Xeon E5-2690 Processors with the Intel Ivy Bridge Architecture and AMD FirePro S9150 GPU Accelerators. It uses in rack watercooling and Cooling Towers to reduce the energy required for cooling.\n\n, the Shoubu supercomputer of RIKEN outside Tokyo Japan tops the Green500 list with 7032 MFLOPS/W. The top three supercomputers of the list use PEZY-SC accelerators (GPU-like that use OpenCL) by PEZY Computing with 1024 cores each and 6-7 GFLOPS/W efficiency.\n\nGraphics processing units (GPU) have continued to increase in energy usage, while CPUs designers have recently focused on improving performance per watt. High performance GPUs may draw large amount of power and hence, intelligent techniques are required to manage GPU power consumption. Measures like 3DMark2006 score per watt can help identify more efficient GPUs. However that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use, where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks.\n\nWith modern GPUs, energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved. GPU designs are usually highly scalable, allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card, or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel. Peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate. Consequently, performance per watt of a GPU design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design.\n\nSince GPUs may also be used for some general purpose computation, sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to CPUs, such as FLOPS per watt.\n\nWhile performance per watt is useful, absolute power requirements are also important. Claims of improved performance per watt may be used to mask increasing power demands. For instance, though newer generation GPU architectures may provide better performance per watt, continued performance increases can negate the gains in efficiency, and the GPUs continue to consume large amounts of power.\n\nBenchmarks that measure power under heavy load may not adequately reflect typical efficiency. For instance, 3DMark stresses the 3D performance of a GPU, but many computers spend most of their time doing less intense display tasks (idle, 2D tasks, displaying video). So the 2D or idle efficiency of the graphics system may be at least as significant for overall energy efficiency. Likewise, systems that spend much of their time in standby or soft off are not adequately characterized by just efficiency under load. To help address this some benchmarks, like SPECpower, include measurements at a series of load levels.\n\nThe efficiency of some electrical components, such as voltage regulators, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power used may increase with temperature. Power supplies, motherboards, and some video cards are some of the subsystems affected by this. So their power draw may depend on temperature, and the temperature or temperature dependence should be noted when measuring.\n\nPerformance per watt also typically does not include full life-cycle costs. Since computer manufacturing is energy intensive, and computers often have a relatively short lifespan, energy and materials involved in production, distribution, disposal and recycling often make up significant portions of their cost, energy use, and environmental impact.\n\nEnergy required for climate control of the computer's surroundings is often not counted in the wattage calculation, but it can be significant.\n\nSWaP (space, wattage and performance) is a Sun Microsystems metric for data centers, incorporating energy and space:\n\nWhere performance is measured by any appropriate benchmark, and space is size of the computer.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Others describe it as looking like monkey or langur, Most agree this ghost is ugly and cannot climb trees, which is unusual in nature. It is believed that the \"Phi Kong Koi\" will suck blood from the toes of the sleeping traveler in the jungle; travelers should keep the feet together or cross their feet when sleeping to protect themselves.\n\nThe name \"Phi Kong Koi\" has several sources. \"Phi\" means ghost in Thai language; some people use the term \"Phi Pong\" (ผีโป่ง) or \"Phi Pong Kang\" (ผีโป่งค่าง; Mineral lick ghost.) The word \"Koi\" or \"Koy\" (กอย), as defined by the Royal Institute Dictionary means, \"An ethnic group have black skin, curly hair is in the Malay Peninsula, also known as Sakai.\"\n\nLuang Pu Waen Suciṇṇo (former abbot of Wat Doi Mae Pang, Chiang Mai province) said that when he traveled in the jungle in Khammouane, Laos, with Luang Pu Tue Ajala Thamฺmo, they fought with many Phi Kong Koi at night. He described the \"Phi Kong Koi\" as being shaped like children of about 13–14 years old. They were thin with a bulging belly, dark brown skin, dark hair, and a chubby nose. They were armed with a small crossbows or arrows and shouted \"Koi\". Luang and fellow travelers were mediating, which protected them from the \"Phi Kong Koi\". At dawn, the \"Phi Kong Koi\" surrendered and invited both of them to their home. \n\nSome have suggested, based on this story, that the \"Phi Kong Koi\" are really the \"Kha Ra Dae\" (ข่าระแด) an ethnic group. This indicates that in the above story, they were hunting and possibly killing intruding humans and taking the meat to eat.\n\nIn the faith of Tai Dam people in Nong Sung District, Mukdahan province, they believe that \"Phi Kong Koi\" is a long-haired, very small (childlike) woman with a backwards foot.

{"id": "1583733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1583733", "title": "Philippine Declaration of Independence", "text": "Philippine Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Philippine Declaration of Independence (Filipino: \"Pagpapahayag ng Kasarinlan ng Pilipinas\") was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 in Cavite II el Viejo (present-day Kawit, Cavite), Philippines. With the public reading of the \"Act of the Proclamation of Independence of the Filipino People\" (; ), Filipino revolutionary forces under General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the sovereignty and independence of the Philippine Islands from the colonial rule of Spain.\n\nIn 1896, the Philippine Revolution began. In December 1897, the Spanish government and the revolutionaries signed a truce, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, requiring that the Spanish pay the revolutionaries 800,000 pesos and that Aguinaldo and other leaders go into exile in Hong Kong. In April 1898, at the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Commodore George Dewey aboard the U.S.S. \"Olympia\" sailed into Manila Bay leading the Asiatic Squadron of the U.S. Navy. On May 1, 1898, the United States defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay. Emilio Aguinaldo decided to return to the Philippines to help American forces defeat the Spaniards. The U.S. Navy agreed to transport him back aboard the USS \"McCulloch\", and on May 19, he arrived in Cavite.\n\nIndependence was proclaimed on June 12, 1898 between four and five in the afternoon in Cavite at the ancestral home of General Emilio Aguinaldo some south of Manila. The event saw the unfurling of the Flag of the Philippines, made in Hong Kong by Marcela Agoncillo, Lorenza Agoncillo, and Delfina Herboza, and the performance of the \"Marcha Filipina Magdalo\", as the national anthem, now known as \"Lupang Hinirang\", which was composed by Julián Felipe and played by the \"San Francisco de Malabon\" marching band.\n\nThe Act of the Declaration of Independence was prepared, written, and read by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista in Spanish. The Declaration was signed by 98 people, among them a United States Army officer who witnessed the proclamation. The final paragraph states that there was a \"stranger\" (\"stranger\" in English translation—\"extranjero\" in the original Spanish, meaning \"foreigner\") who attended the proceedings, Mr. L. M. Johnson, described as \"a citizen of the U.S.A, a Colonel of Artillery\". Despite his prior military experience, Johnson had no official role in the Philippines.\n\nThe proclamation of Philippine independence was, however, promulgated on 1 August, when many towns had already been organized under the rules laid down by the Dictatorial Government of General Aguinaldo. 190 municipal presidents of different towns from 16 provinces—Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Bulacan, Bataan, Infanta, Morong, Tayabas, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Mindoro, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, La Union and Zambales—ratified the Proclamation of Independence in Bacoor, Cavite. \n\nLater at Malolos, Bulacan, the Malolos Congress modified the declaration upon the insistence of Apolinario Mabini who objected to that the original proclamation essentially placed the Philippines under the protection of the United States.\n\nThe declaration was never recognized by either the United States or Spain. Later in 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War.\n\nThe Philippine Revolutionary Government did not recognize the treaty or American sovereignty, and subsequently fought and lost a conflict with the United States originally referred to by the Americans as the \"Philippine Insurrection\" but now generally and officially called the Philippine–American War, which ended when Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by U.S. forces, and issued a statement acknowledging and accepting the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. This was then followed on July 2, 1902, by U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root telegraphing that the insurrection the United States had come to an end and that provincial civil governments had been established everywhere except those areas inhabited by Moro tribes. Pockets of resistance continued for several years.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the United States granted independence to the Philippines on 4 July 1946 via the Treaty of Manila. July 4 was observed in the Philippines as \"Independence Day\" until August 4, 1964 when, upon the advice of historians and the urging of nationalists, President Diosdado Macapagal signed into law Republic Act No. 4166 designating June 12 as the country's \"Independence Day\". June 12 had previously been observed as \"Flag Day\" and many government buildings are urged to display the Philippine Flag in their offices.\n\nThe Declaration is currently housed in the National Library of the Philippines. It is not on public display but can be viewed with permission like any other document held by the National Library.\n\nDuring the Philippine–American War, the American government captured and sent to the United States about 400,000 historical documents. In 1958, the documents were given to the Philippine government along with two sets of microfilm of the entire collection, with the U.S. Federal Government keeping one set.\n\nSometime in the 1980s or 1990s the Declaration was stolen from the National Library. As part of a larger investigation into the widespread theft of historical documents and a subsequent public appeal for the return of stolen documents, the Declaration was returned to the National Library in 1994 by historian and University of the Philippines professor Milagros Guerrero, who mediated the return of the documents.\n\nThe Act of the Proclamation of the Independence of the Filipino People (; ) is part of a long line of declarations of independence including the United States Declaration of Independence. It includes a list of grievances against the Spanish government stretching back to Ferdinand Magellan's arrival in 1521 and confers upon \"our famous Dictator Don Emilio Aguinaldo all the powers necessary to enable him to discharge the duties of Government, including the prerogatives of granting pardon and amnesty.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144182", "title": "Plurality opinion", "text": "Plurality opinion\n\nA plurality opinion is in certain legal systems the opinion from a group of judges, often in an appellate court, in which no single opinion supports a majority of the court. The plurality opinion did not receive the support of more than half the justices, but received more support than any other opinion, excluding those dissenting from the holding of the court.\n\nIn \"Marks v. United States\", 430 U.S. 188 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States explained how the holding of a case should be viewed where there is no majority supporting the rationale of any opinion: “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” \"Marks\", 430 U.S. at 193.\n\nThat requires lower courts to look at all opinions to determine which is the most narrow compared to others. This opinion will be called the controlling opinion, and can be a mere concurrence, not the plurality.\n\nThe \"Marks Rule\" has raised the following schools of thought regarding the appropriate basis for determining the holding in such fractured cases: (a) the narrowest analysis essential to the result derived from a combination of all concurring opinions, (\"Pedcor Mgmt. Co. Welfare Benefit Plan v. Nations Pers. of Tex., Inc.\", 343 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir. 2003)); (b) the concurring opinion offering the narrowest rationale, (\"e.g. Horn v. Thoratec Corp.\", 376 F.3d 163, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2004)); or (c) only those parts of the concurring opinions which overlap and arrive at the same result. For example, if one follows the first interpretation, then the holding in the case should be viewed as the narrowest rationale supported by all of the concurring opinions read together as though it were a single majority opinion, and where there is a conflict, the opinion based on the narrowest ground governs. Followers of the second rationale would find the concurring opinion offering the narrowest analysis to be the holding. Whereas, under the third interpretation, only the rationale(s) common to all concurring opinions which arrive at the same result(s) (and to the exclusion of all other rationales) is considered the holding.\n\nA good example of a plurality opinion can be found in the Supreme Court's decision in \"Crawford v. Marion County Election Board\", 553 U.S. 181 (2008). In considering whether Indiana's voter identification law passed constitutional muster, three justices believed the proper analysis was to apply the balancing approach laid down in \"Anderson v. Celebrezze\", 460 U.S. 780 (1983). Three other justices agreed with the outcome of the \"Anderson\" approach, but believed the proper analysis was to apply the rule in \"Burdick v. Takushi\", 504 U.S. 428 (1992), which \"forged \"Anderson\"'s amorphous 'flexible standard' into something resembling an administrable rule.\" Regardless of the approach used, a reading of the opinions together results in a holding that \"neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure\" is constitutional so long as the burden imposed by the regulation is minimal or not severe.\n\n"}
{"id": "355908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355908", "title": "Poor Richard's Almanack", "text": "Poor Richard's Almanack\n\nPoor Richard's Almanack (sometimes \"Almanac\") was a yearly almanac published by Benjamin Franklin, who adopted the pseudonym of \"Poor Richard\" or \"Richard Saunders\" for this purpose. The publication appeared continually from 1732 to 1758. It sold exceptionally well for a pamphlet published in the American colonies; print runs reached 10,000 per year.\n\nFranklin, the American inventor, statesman, and publisher, achieved success with \"Poor Richard's Almanack\". Almanacks were very popular books in colonial America, offering a mixture of seasonal weather forecasts, practical household hints, puzzles, and other amusements. \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" was also popular for its extensive use of wordplay, and some of the witty phrases coined in the work survive in the contemporary American vernacular.\n\nThe \"Almanack\" contained the calendar, weather, poems, sayings and astronomical and astrological information that a typical almanac of the period would contain. Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the \"Almanack\" from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's aphorisms and proverbs, many of which live on in American English. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, with a dash of cynicism.\n\nIn the spaces that occurred between noted calendar days, Franklin included proverbial sentences about industry and frugality. Several of these sayings were borrowed from an earlier writer, Lord Halifax, many of whose aphorisms sprang from, \"... [a] basic skepticism directed against the motives of men, manners, and the age.\" In 1757, Franklin made a selection of these and prefixed them to the almanac as the address of an old man to the people attending an auction. This was later published as \"The Way to Wealth\", and was popular in both America and England.\n\nFranklin borrowed the name \"Richard Saunders\" from the seventeenth-century author of \"Rider's British Merlin\", a popular London almanac which continued to be published throughout the eighteenth century. Franklin created the Poor Richard persona based in part on Jonathan Swift's pseudonymous character, \"Isaac Bickerstaff\". In a series of three letters in 1708 and 1709, known as the Bickerstaff papers, \"Bickerstaff\" predicted the imminent death of astrologer and almanac maker John Partridge. Franklin's Poor Richard, like Bickerstaff, claimed to be a philomath and astrologer and, like Bickerstaff, predicted the deaths of actual astrologers who wrote traditional almanacs. In the early editions of \"Poor Richard's Almanack\", predicting and falsely reporting the deaths of these astrologers—much to their dismay—was something of a running joke. However, Franklin's endearing character of \"Poor\" Richard Saunders, along with his wife Bridget, was ultimately used to frame (if comically) what was intended as a serious resource that people would buy year after year. To that end, the satirical edge of Swift's character is largely absent in Poor Richard. Richard was presented as distinct from Franklin himself, occasionally referring to the latter as his printer.\n\nIn later editions, the original Richard Saunders character gradually disappeared, replaced by a Poor Richard, who largely stood in for Franklin and his own practical scientific and business perspectives. By 1758, the original character was even more distant from the practical advice and proverbs of the almanac, which Franklin presented as coming from \"Father Abraham,\" who in turn got his sayings from Poor Richard.\n\nFranklin published the first \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" on December 28, 1732, and continued to publish new editions for 25 years, bringing him much economic success and popularity. The almanack sold as many as 10,000 copies a year. In 1735, upon the death of Franklin's brother, James, Franklin sent 500 copies of \"Poor Richard's\" to his widow for free, so that she could make money selling them.\n\nOne of the appeals of the \"Almanack\" was that it contained various \"news stories\" in serial format, so that readers would purchase it year after year to find out what happened to the protagonists. One of the earliest of these was the \"prediction\" that the author's \"good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds\" would die on October 17 of that year, followed by the rebuttal of Mr. Leeds himself that he would die, not on the 17th, but on October 26. Appealing to his readers, Franklin urged them to purchase the next year or two or three or four editions to show their support for his prediction. The following year, Franklin expressed his regret that he was too ill to learn whether he or Leeds was correct. Nevertheless, the ruse had its desired effect: people purchased the \"Almanack\" to find out who was correct. (Later editions of the \"Almanack\" would claim that Leeds had died and that the person claiming to be Leeds was an impostor; Leeds, in fact, died in 1738, which prompted Franklin to applaud the supposed impostor for ending his ruse.)\n\nFor some writers the content of the \"Almanack\" became inextricably linked with Franklin's character—and not always to favorable effect. Both Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville caricatured the \"Almanack\"—and Franklin by extension—in their writings, while James Russell Lowell, reflecting on the public unveiling in Boston of a statue to honor Franklin, wrote:\n... we shall find out that Franklin was born in Boston, and invented being struck with lightning and printing and the Franklin medal, and that he had to move to Philadelphia because great men were so plenty in Boston that he had no chance, and that he revenged himself on his native town by saddling it with the Franklin stove, and that he discovered the almanac, and that a penny saved is a penny lost, or something of the kind.\n\nThe \"Almanack\" was also a reflection of the norms and social mores of his times, rather than a philosophical document setting a path for new-freedoms, as the works of Franklin's contemporaries, Jefferson, Adams, or Paine were. Historian Howard Zinn offers, as an example, the adage \"Let thy maidservant be faithful, strong, and homely\" as indication of Franklin's belief in the legitimacy of controlling the sexual lives of servants for the economic benefit of their masters.\n\nAt least one modern biographer has published the claim that Franklin \"stole\", not borrowed, the name of Richard Saunders from the deceased astrologer-doctor. Franklin also \"borrowed—apparently without asking—and adapted the title of an almanac his brother James Franklin was publishing at Newport: \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" (itself appropriated from a seventeenth-century almanac published under the same title in London)\".\n\nLouis XVI of France gave a ship to John Paul Jones who renamed her after the \"Almanack's\" author—\"Bonhomme Richard\", or \"Good man Richard\" (the first of several US warships so named). Napoleon Bonaparte considered the \"Almanack\" significant enough to translate it into Italian, along with the Pennsylvania State Constitution (which Franklin helped draft), when he established the Cisalpine Republic in 1797. The \"Almanack\" was also twice translated into French, reprinted in Great Britain in broadside for ease of posting, and was distributed by members of the clergy to poor parishioners. It was the first work of English literature to be translated into Slovene. It was translated in 1812 by Janez Nepomuk Primic (1785–1823).\n\nThe \"Almanack\" also had a strong cultural and economic impact in the years following publication. In Pennsylvania, changes in monetary policy in regard to foreign expenses were evident for years after the issuing of the \"Almanack\". Later writers such as Noah Webster were inspired by the almanac, and it went on to influence other publications of this type such as \"The Old Farmer's Almanac\".\n\nNumerous farmer's almanacs trace their format and tradition to \"Poor Richard's Almanack;\" the Old Farmer's Almanac, for instance, has included a picture of Franklin on its cover since 1851.\n\nThe prefaces to the \"Almanack\" are also reprinted in:\n\n"}

{"id": "42549239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42549239", "title": "Revolutionary socialism", "text": "Revolutionary socialism\n\nRevolutionary socialism is the socialist doctrine that social revolution is necessary in order to bring about structural changes to society. More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from capitalism to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the working class so that the state is directly controlled or abolished by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests. Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism and orthodox Marxists believe that it is inevitable but not predetermined.\n\nRevolutionary socialism encompasses multiple political and social movements that may define \"revolution\" differently from one another. These include movements based on orthodox Marxist theory, such as De Leonism, impossibilism, and Luxemburgism; as well as movements based on Leninism and the theory of vanguardist-led revolution, such as Maoism, Marxism–Leninism, and Trotskyism. Revolutionary socialism also includes non-Marxist movements, such as those found in anarchism, revolutionary syndicalism, and democratic socialism.\n\nIt is used in contrast to the reformism of social democracy and other evolutionary approaches to socialism. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform. Revolutionary socialism also exists in contrast to the concept of small revolutionary groups seizing power without first achieving mass support, termed Blanquism.\n\nIn \"The Communist Manifesto\", Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote: \n\nTwenty-four years after \"The Communist Manifesto\", Marx and Engels admitted that in developed countries \"labour may attain its goal by peaceful means\". Marxist scholar Adam Schaff argued that Marx, Engels and Lenin have expressed such view \"on many occasions\". By contrast, the Blanquist view emphasised the overthrow by force of the ruling elite in government by an active minority of revolutionaries, who then proceed to implement socialist change, disregarding the state of readiness of society as a whole and the mass of the population in particular for revolutionary change.\n\nIn 1875, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) published a somewhat reformist Gotha Program, which was attacked by Marx in \"Critique of the Gotha Program\", where he reiterated the need for dictatorship of the proletariat. The reformist viewpoint was introduced into Marxist thought by Eduard Bernstein, one of the leaders of the SPD. From 1896 to 1898, Bernstein published a series of articles entitled \"Probleme des Sozialismus\" (\"Problems of Socialism\"). These articles led to a debate on revisionism in the SPD and can be seen as the origins of a reformist trend within Marxism.\n\nIn 1900, Rosa Luxemburg wrote \"Social Reform or Revolution\", a polemic against Bernstein's position. The work of reforms, Luxemburg argued, could only be carried on \"in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution\". In order to advance society to socialism from the capitalist 'social form', a social revolution will be necessary:\nVladimir Lenin attacked Bernstein's position in his \"What Is To Be Done?\" When Bernstein first put forward his ideas, the majority of the SPD rejected them. The 1899 Congress of the SPD reaffirmed the Erfurt programme as did the 1901 congress. The 1903 congress denounced \"revisionist efforts\".\n\nOn 4 August 1914, the SPD members of the Reichstag voted for the government's war budget while the French and Belgium socialists publicly supported and joined their governments. The Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915, attended by Lenin and Leon Trotsky, saw the beginning of the end of the uneasy coexistence of revolutionary socialists and reformist socialists in the parties of Second International. The conference adopted a proposal by Trotsky to avoid an immediate split with the Second International. At first opposed to it, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.\n\nIn December, 1915 and March, 1916, eighteen Social Democratic representatives, the Haase-Ledebour Group, voted against war credits and were expelled from the Social Democratic Party. Liebknecht wrote \"Revolutionary Socialism in Germany\" in 1916, arguing that this group was not a revolutionary socialist group despite their refusal to vote for war credits, further defining in his view what was meant by a revolutionary socialist.\n\nMany revolutionary socialists argue that the Russian Revolution of October 1917 led by Lenin and Trotsky follows the revolutionary socialist model of a revolutionary movement of the immense majority. By contrast, the October revolution is portrayed as a putsch or coup d'état along the lines of Blanquism.\n\nRevolutionary socialists, particularly Trotskyists, argue that the Bolsheviks only seized power as the expression of the mass of workers and peasants, whose desires are brought into being by an organised force—the revolutionary party. Marxists such as Trotskyists argue that Lenin did not advocate seizing of power until he felt that the majority of the population, represented in the soviets, demanded revolutionary change and no longer supported the reformist government of Alexander Kerensky established in the earlier revolution of February 1917: \n\nFor these Marxists, the fact that the Bolsheviks won a majority (in alliance with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries) in the second all-Russian congress of Soviets—democratically elected bodies—which convened at the time of the October revolution, shows that they had popular support of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the vast majority of Russian society.\n\nIn his pamphlet \"Lessons of October\", first published in 1923, Trotsky argued that military power lay in the hands of the Bolsheviks before the October Revolution was carried out, but this power was not used against the government until the Bolsheviks gained mass support.\n\nThe mass of the soldiers began to be led by the Bolshevik party after the July days of 1917 and followed only the orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of Trotsky in October (also termed the Revolutionary Military Committee in Lenin's collected works). Yet Trotsky only mobilised the Military Revolutionary Committee to seize power on the advent of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on 25 October 1917.\n\nFollowing the October Revolution, the Communist International (also known as the Third International) was founded. This International became widely identified with communism, but also defined itself in terms of revolutionary socialism. However, in 1938 Trotskyists formed the Fourth International because they thought that the Third International was lost to Stalinism—this latter International became identified with revolutionary socialism.\n\nEmerging from the Communist International, but critical of the post-1924 Soviet Union, the Trotskyist tradition in Western Europe and elsewhere uses the term \"revolutionary socialism\". For instance, in 1932 the first issue of the first Canadian Trotskyist newspaper, \"The Vanguard\", published an editorial intitled \"Revolutionary Socialism vs Reformism\". Today, many Trotskyist groups advocate \"revolutionary socialism\" as opposed to reformism and are considered—and consider themselves—\"revolutionary socialists\". Luxemburgism is another revolutionary socialist tradition.\n\n"}

{"id": "193608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193608", "title": "Shahnameh", "text": "Shahnameh\n\nThe Shahnameh ( \"Šāhnāmah\" , \"The Book of Kings\", also transliterated \"Shahnama\"), is a long epic poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between c. 977 and 1010 CE and is the national epic of Greater Iran. Consisting of some 50,000 \"distichs\" or couplets (two-line verses), the \"Shahnameh\" is the world's longest epic poem written by a single poet. It tells mainly the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. Modern Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and the greater region influenced by the Persian culture (such as Georgia, Armenia, Turkey and Dagestan) celebrate this national epic.\n\nThe work is of central importance in Persian culture and Persian language, regarded as a literary masterpiece, and definitive of the ethno-national cultural identity of Iran. It is also important to the contemporary adherents of Zoroastrianism, in that it traces the historical links between the beginnings of the religion and the death of the last Sassanid ruler of Persia during the Muslim conquest which brought an end to the Zoroastrian influence in Iran.\n\nFerdowsi started writing the \"Shahnameh\" in 977 AD and completed it on 8 March 1010. The \"Shahnameh\" is a monument of poetry and historiography, being mainly the poetical recast of what Ferdowsi, his contemporaries, and his predecessors regarded as the account of Iran's ancient history. Many such accounts already existed in prose, an example being the Abu-Mansuri Shahnameh. A small portion of Ferdowsi's work, in passages scattered throughout the \"Shahnameh\", is entirely of his own conception.\n\nThe \"Shahnameh\" is an epic poem of over 50,000 couplets, written in early Modern Persian. It is based mainly on a prose work of the same name compiled in Ferdowsi's earlier life in his native Tus. This prose \"Shahnameh\" was in turn and for the most part the translation of a Pahlavi (Middle Persian) work, known as the \"Xadāynāmag\" (\"Book of Kings\"), a late Sassanid compilation of the history of the kings and heroes of Persia from mythical times down to the reign of Khosrau II (590–628). The \"Xadāynāmag\" contained historical information on the later Sassanid period, but it does not appear to have drawn on any historical sources for the earlier Sassanid period (3rd to 4th centuries). Ferdowsi added material continuing the story to the overthrow of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the middle of the 7th century.\n\nThe first to undertake the versification of the Pahlavi chronicle was Abu-Mansur Daqiqi, a contemporary of Ferdowsi, poet at the court of the Samanids, who came to a violent end after completing only 1,000 verses. These verses, which deal with the rise of the prophet Zoroaster, were afterward incorporated by Ferdowsi, with acknowledgment, in his own poem. The style of the \"Shahnameh\" shows characteristics of both written and oral literature. Some claim that Ferdowsi also used Zoroastrian \"nasks\", such as the now-lost \"Chihrdad,\" as sources as well.\n\nMany other Pahlavi sources were used in composing the epic, prominent being the Kārnāmag-ī Ardaxšīr-ī Pābagān, which was originally written during the late Sassanid era and gave accounts of how Ardashir I came to power which, because of its historical proximity, is thought to be highly accurate. The text is written in the late Middle Persian, which was the immediate ancestor of Modern Persian. A great portion of the historical chronicles given in \"Shahnameh\" is based on this epic and there are in fact various phrases and words which can be matched between Ferdowsi's poem and this source, according to Zabihollah Safa.\n\nAccording to one account of the sources, a Persian named Dehqan in the court of King Anushehrawan Dadgar had composed a voluminous book in prose form, known as \"Khoday Nameh\". After the fall of the Iranian Empire, \"Khoday Nameh\" came into the possession of King Yaqub Lais and then the Samani king Nuh ordered the poet Daqiqi to complete it, but Daqiqi was killed by his slave. Ferdowsi obtained the book through a friend.\n\nThe \"Shahnameh\" provides a poetic account of the prehistory and history of Iran, beginning with the creation of the world and the introduction of the arts of civilization (fire, cooking, metallurgy, law), and ending with the Islamic Conquest of Persia. The work is not precisely chronological, but there is a general movement through time. Some of the characters live for hundreds of years but most have normal life spans. There are many \"shāhs\" who come and go, as well as heroes and villains, who also come and go. The only lasting images are those of Greater Persia itself, and of a succession of sunrises and sunsets, no two ever exactly alike, yet illustrative of the passage of time.\n\nThe work is divided into three successive parts: the \"mythical\", \"heroic\", and \"historical\" ages.\n\nFather Time, a Saturn-like image, is a reminder of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.\n\nIt is only in the characterizations of the work's many figures, both male and female, that Zoroaster's original view of the human condition comes through. Zoroaster emphasized human free will. All of Ferdowsi's characters are complex; none is an archetype or a puppet. The best characters have flaws, and the worst have moments of humanity.\n\nTraditional historiography in Iran has claimed that Ferdowsi was grieved by the fall of the Sassanid Empire and its subsequent rule by \"Arabs\" and \"Turks\". The \"Shahnameh\", the argument goes, is largely his effort to preserve the memory of Persia's golden days and transmit it to a new generation so that they could learn and try to build a better world. Although most scholars have contended that Ferdowsi's main concern was the preservation of the pre-Islamic legacy of myth and history, a number of authors have formally challenged this view.\n\nThis portion of the \"Shahnameh\" is relatively short, amounting to some 2,100 verses or four percent of the entire book, and it narrates events with the simplicity, predictability, and swiftness of a historical work.\n\nAfter an opening in praise of God and Wisdom, the \"Shahnameh\" gives an account of the creation of the world and of man as believed by the Sassanians. This introduction is followed by the story of the first man, Keyumars, who also became the first king after a period of mountain dwelling. His grandson Hushang, son of Sīyāmak, accidentally discovered fire and established the Sadeh Feast in its honor. Stories of Tahmuras, Jamshid, Zahhāk, Kawa or Kaveh, Fereydūn and his three sons Salm, Tur, and Iraj, and his grandson Manuchehr are related in this section.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the \"Shahnameh\" is devoted to the age of heroes, extending from Manuchehr's reign until the conquest of Alexander the Great (Eskandar). This age is also identified as the kingdom of Keyaniyan, which established a long history of heroic age in which myth and legend are combined. The main feature of this period is the major role played by the Saka or Sistānī heroes who appear as the backbone of the Persian Empire. Garshāsp is briefly mentioned with his son Narimān, whose own son Sām acted as the leading paladin of Manuchehr while reigning in Sistān in his own right. His successors were his son Zāl and Zal's son Rostam, the bravest of the brave, and then Farāmarz.\n\nAmong the stories described in this section are the romance of Zal and Rudāba, the Seven Stages (or Labors) of Rostam, Rostam and Sohrab, Sīyāvash and Sudāba, Rostam and Akvān Dīv, the romance of Bijan and Manijeh, the wars with Afrāsīyāb, Daqiqi's account of the story of Goshtāsp and Arjāsp, and Rostam and Esfandyār.\n\nA brief mention of the Arsacid dynasty follows the history of Alexander and precedes that of Ardashir I, founder of the Sassanid Empire. After this, Sassanid history is related with a good deal of accuracy. The fall of the Sassanids and the Arab conquest of Persia are narrated romantically.\n\nFerdowsi did not expect his readers to pass over historical events indifferently, but asked them to think carefully, to see the grounds for the rise and fall of individuals and nations; and to learn from the past in order to improve the present, and to better shape the future. Ferdowsi stresses his belief that since the world is transient, and since everyone is merely a passerby, one is wise to avoid cruelty, lying, avarice, and other evils; instead one should strive for justice, honor, truth, order, and other virtues. \n\nThe singular message that the \"Shahnameh\" of Ferdowsi strives to convey is the idea that the history of the Sassanid Empire was a complete and immutable whole: it started with Keyumars, the first man, and ended with his fiftieth scion and successor, Yazdegerd III, six thousand years of history of Iran. The task of Ferdowsi was to prevent this history from being lost to future Persian generations.\n\nAccording to Jalal Khaleghi Mutlaq, the \"Shahnameh\" teaches a wide variety of moral virtues, like worship of one God; religious uprightness; patriotism; love of wife, family and children; and helping the poor.\n\nThere are themes in the Shahnameh that were viewed with suspicion by the succession of Iranian regimes. During the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah, the epic was largely ignored in favor of the more obtuse, esoteric and dryly intellectual Persian literature. Historians note that the theme of regicide and the incompetence of kings embedded in the epic did not sit well with the Iranian monarchy. Later, there were Muslim figures such as Dr. Ali Shariati, the hero of Islamic reformist youth of the 1970s, who were also antagonistic towards the contents of the Shahnameh since it included verses critical of Islam. These include the line: \"tofu bar to, ey charkh-i gardun, tofu!\" (spit on your face, oh heavens spit!), which Ferdowsi used as a reference to the Muslim invaders who despoiled Zoroastrianism. \n\nAfter the \"Shahnameh\", a number of other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere of the Persian language. Without exception, all such works were based in style and method on the \"Shahnameh\", but none of them could quite achieve the same degree of fame and popularity.\n\nSome experts believe the main reason the Modern Persian language today is more or less the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 years ago is due to the very existence of works like the \"Shahnameh\", which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the \"Shahnameh\" itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the \"Shahnameh\" in their works.\n\nIt is claimed that Ferdowsi went to great lengths to avoid any words drawn from the Arabic language, words which had increasingly infiltrated the Persian language following the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. Ferdowsi is even quoted:\nFerdowsi followed this path not only to preserve and purify the Persian language, but also as a stark political statement against the Arab conquest of Persia. This assertion has been called into question by Mohammed Moinfar, who has noted that there are numerous examples of Arabic words in the \"Shahnameh\" which are effectively synonyms for Persian words previously used in the text. This calls into question the idea of Ferdowsi's deliberate eschewing of Arabic words.\n\nThe \"Shahnameh\" has 62 stories, 990 chapters, and some 50,000 rhyming couplets, making it more than three times the length of Homer's \"Iliad\", and more than twelve times the length of the German \"Nibelungenlied\". According to Ferdowsi himself, the final edition of the \"Shahnameh\" contained some sixty thousand distichs. But this is a round figure; most of the relatively reliable manuscripts have preserved a little over fifty thousand distichs. Nezami-e Aruzi reports that the final edition of the \"Shahnameh\" sent to the court of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni was prepared in seven volumes.\n\nThe Shirvanshah dynasty adopted many of their names from the \"Shahnameh\". The relationship between Shirwanshah and his son, Manuchihr, is mentioned in chapter eight of Nizami's \"Leili o Majnoon\". Nizami advises the king's son to read the \"Shahnameh\" and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.\n\nAccording to the Turkish historian Mehmet Fuat Köprülü:\n\nShah Ismail I (d.1524), the founder of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, was also deeply influenced by the Persian literary tradition, particularly by the \"Shahnameh\", which probably explains the fact that he named all of his sons after \"Shahnameh\" characters. Dickson and Welch suggest that Ismail's \"Shāhnāmaye Shāhī\" was intended as a present to the young Tahmāsp. After defeating Muhammad Shaybāni's Uzbeks, Ismāil asked Hātefī, a famous poet from Jam (Khorasan), to write a \"Shahnameh\"-like epic about his victories and his newly established dynasty. Although the epic was left unfinished, it was an example of \"mathnawis\" in the heroic style of the \"Shahnameh\" written later on for the Safavid kings.\n\nThe \"Shahnameh\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s influence has extended beyond the Persian sphere. Professor Victoria Arakelova of Yerevan University states:\n\nJamshid Sh. Giunashvili remarks on the connection of Georgian culture with that of \"Shahnameh\":\n\nFarmanfarmaian in the \"Journal of Persianate Studies\":\n\nDespite some popular belief, the Turanians of \"Shahnameh\" (whose sources are based on Avesta and Pahlavi texts) have no relationship with the ethno-linguistic group Turk today. The Turanians of \"Shahnameh\" are an Iranian people representing Iranian nomads of the Eurasian Steppes and have no relationship to the culture of the Turks. Turan, which is the Persian name for the areas of Central Asia beyond the Oxus up to the 7th century (where the story of the \"Shahnameh\" ends), was generally an Iranian-speaking land.\n\nAccording to Richard Frye, \"The extent of influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own ancient history as well as that of Iran... The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history.\"\n\nTurks, as an ethno-linguistic group, have been influenced by the \"Shahnameh\" since advent of Saljuqs. Toghrul III of Seljuqs is said to have recited the \"Shahnameh\" while swinging his mace in battle. According to Ibn Bibi, in 618/1221 the Saljuq of Rum Ala' al-Din Kay-kubad decorated the walls of Konya and Sivas with verses from the \"Shahnameh\". The Turks themselves connected their origin not with Turkish tribal history but with the Turan of \"Shahnameh\". Specifically in India, through the \"Shahnameh\", they felt themselves to be the last outpost tied to the civilized world by the thread of Iranianism.\n\nFerdowsi concludes the \"Shahnameh\" by writing:\n\nAnother translation of by Reza Jamshidi Safa: \nThis prediction of Ferdowsi has come true and many Persian literary figures, historians and biographers have praised him and the \"Shahnameh\". The \"Shahnameh\" is considered by many to be the most important piece of work in Persian literature.\n\nWestern writers have also praised the \"Shahnameh\" and Persian literature in general. Persian literature has been considered by such thinkers as Goethe as one of the four main bodies of world literature. Goethe was inspired by Persian literature, which moved him to write his \"West-Eastern Divan\". Goethe wrote:\n\n\"Sargozasht-Nameh\" or biography of important poets and writers has long been a Persian tradition. Some of the biographies of Ferdowsi are now considered apocryphal, nevertheless this shows the important impact he had in the Persian world. Among the famous biographies are:\n\n\nFamous poets of Persia and the Persian tradition have praised and eulogized Ferdowsi. Many of them were heavily influenced by his writing and used his genre and stories to develop their own Persian epics, stories and poems:\n\n\nMany other poets, e.g. Hafez, Rumi and other mystical poets, have used imageries of \"Shahnameh\" heroes in their poetry.\n\nThe \"Shahnameh\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s impact on Persian historiography was immediate and some historians decorated their books with the verses of Shahnameh. Below is sample of ten important historians who have praised the \"Shahnameh\" and Ferdowsi:\n\n\nIllustrated copies of the work are among the most sumptuous examples of Persian miniature painting. Several copies remain intact, although two of the most famous, the Houghton Shahnameh and the Great Mongol Shahnameh, were broken up for sheets to be sold separately in the 20th century. A single sheet from the former was sold for £904,000 in 2006. The Baysonghori Shahnameh, an illuminated manuscript copy of the work (Golestan Palace, Iran), is included in UNESCO's \"Memory of the World Register\" of cultural heritage items.\n\nThe Mongol rulers in Iran revived and spurred the patronage of the Shanameh in its manuscript form. The \"Great Mongol\" or Demotte Shahnameh, produced during the reign of the Ilkhanid Sultan Abu Sa'id, is one of the most illustrative and important copies of the \"Shahnameh\".\n\nThe Timurids continued the tradition of manuscript production. For them, it was considered \"de rigueur\" for the members of the family to have personal copies of the epic poem. Consequently, three of Timur’s grandsons—Bāysonḡor, Ebrāhim Solṭān, and Moḥammad Juki—each commissioned such a volume. Among these, the Baysonghor Shahnameh commissioned by Ḡīāṯ-al-Dīn Bāysonḡor is one of the most voluminous and artistic \"Shahnameh\" manuscripts.\n\nThe production of illustrated \"Shahnameh\" manuscripts in the 15th century remained vigorous during the Qarā-Qoyunlu or Black Sheep (1380–1468) and Āq Qoyunlu or White Sheep (1378–1508) Turkman dynasties. Many of the extant illustrated copies, with more than seventy or more paintings, are attributable to Tabriz, Shiraz, and Baghdad beginning in about the 1450s–60s and continuing to the end of the century.\n\nThe Safavid era saw a resurgence of \"Shahnameh\" productions. Shah Ismail I used the epic for propaganda purposes: as a gesture of Persian patriotism, as a celebration of renewed Persian rule, and as a reassertion of Persian royal authority. The Safavids commissioned elaborate copies of the \"Shahnameh\" to support their legitimacy. Among the high points of \"Shahnameh\" illustrations was the series of 250 miniatures commissioned by Shah Ismail for his son's Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp. Two similar cycles of illustration of the mid-17th century, the Shahnameh of Rashida and the Windsor Shahnameh, come from the last great period of the Persian miniature.\n\nIn honour of the \"Shahnameh\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s millennial anniversary, in 2010 the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge hosted a major exhibition, called \"Epic of the Persian Kings: The Art of Ferdowsi’s \"Shahnameh\"\", which ran from September 2010 to January 2011. The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC also hosted an exhibition of folios from the 14th through the 16th centuries, called \"Shahnama: 1000 Years of the Persian Book of Kings\", from October 2010 to April 2011.\n\nIn 2013 Hamid Rahmanian illustrated a new English translation of Shanameh (translated by Ahmad Sadri) using images from various pictures of old manuscripts of the book to create new imagery.\n\nScholarly editions have been prepared of the \"Shahnameh\". An early edition was prepared in 1829 in India by T. Macan. It was based on a comparison of 17 manuscript copies. Between 1838 and 1878, an edition appeared in Paris by French scholar J. Mohl, which was based on a comparison of 30 manuscripts. Both editions lacked critical apparatuses and were based on secondary manuscripts dated after the 15th century; much later than the original work. Between 1877 and 1884, the German scholar J. A. Vullers prepared a synthesized text of the Macan and Mohl editions, but only three of its expected nine volumes were published. The Vullers edition was later completed in Tehran by the Iranian scholars S. Nafisi, Iqbal, and M. Minowi for the millennial jubilee of Ferdowsi, held between 1934 and 1936.\n\nThe first modern critical edition of the \"Shahnameh\" was prepared by a Russian team led by E. E. Bertels, using the oldest known manuscripts at the time, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, with heavy reliance on the 1276 manuscript from the British Museum and the 1333 Leningrad manuscript, the latter of which has now been considered a secondary manuscript. In addition, two other manuscripts used in this edition have been so demoted. It was published in Moscow by the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in nine volumes between 1960 and 1971.\n\nFor many years, the Moscow edition was the standard text. In 1977, an early 1217 manuscript was rediscovered in Florence. The 1217 Florence manuscript is one of the earliest known copies of the \"Shahnameh\", predating the Moghul invasion and the following destruction of important libraries and manuscript collections. Using it as the chief text, Djalal Khaleghi-Motlagh began the preparation of a new critical edition in 1990. The number of manuscripts that were consulted during the preparation of Khaleghi-Motlagh edition goes beyond anything attempted by the Moscow team. The critical apparatus is extensive and a large number of variants for many parts of the poem were recorded. The last volume was published in 2008, bringing the eight-volume enterprise to a completion. According to Dick Davis, professor of Persian at Ohio State University, it is \"by far the best edition of the \"Shahnameh\" available, and it is surely likely to remain such for a very long time\".\n\nThe only known Arabic translation of the Shahnameh was done in c. 1220 by al-Fath bin Ali al-Bondari, a Persian scholar from Isfahan and at the request of the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus Al-Mu'azzam Isa. The translation is \"Nathr\" (unrhyming) and was largely forgotten until it was republished in full in 1932 in Egypt, by historian Abdelwahhab Azzam. This modern edition was based on incomplete and largely imprecise fragmented copies found in Cambridge, Paris, Astana, Cairo and Berlin. The latter had the most complete, least inaccurate and well-preserved Arabic version of the original translation by al-Bondari.\n\nThere have been a number of English translations, almost all abridged. James Atkinson of the East India Company's medical service undertook a translation into English in his 1832 publication for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland, now part of the Royal Asiatic Society. Between 1905 and 1925, the brothers Arthur and Edmond Warner published a translation of the complete work in nine volumes, now out of print. There are also modern incomplete translations of the \"Shahnameh\": Reuben Levy's 1967 prose version (later revised by Amin Banani), and another by Dick Davis in a mixture of poetry and prose which appeared in 2006.

Dr. Bahman Sohrabji Surti, assisted by Marzban Giara, published between 1986 and 1988 the first detailed and complete translation of the \"Shahnameh\" from the original Persian verse into English prose, in seven volumes. \n\nThere are various translations in French and German.

That was a different kind of measuring, no weekly charts, just the total number of repeats at the end of the year. In 2013 a new technology by international standards was introduced, measuring both Slovenian and international music with weekly singles charts.\n\nPresently three charts are published:\n\nIn three categories: year-end number-one song, year-end best charted domestic song and number-one (pre)xmas week song.\n\nAfter 309 weeks since chart was established \n\nSAZAS gives \"SloTop50 Bum Award\" only to domestic artists who hit the peak chart position in first week of airplay:\n\n"}

{"id": "211399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211399", "title": "Structural induction", "text": "Structural induction\n\nStructural induction is a proof method that is used in mathematical logic (e.g., in the proof of Łoś' theorem), computer science, graph theory, and some other mathematical fields. It is a generalization of mathematical induction over natural numbers, and can be further generalized to arbitrary Noetherian induction. Structural recursion is a recursion method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary mathematical induction.\n\nStructural induction is used to prove that some proposition \"P\"(\"x\") holds for all \"x\" of some sort of recursively defined structure, such as\nformulas, lists, or trees. A well-founded partial order is defined on the structures (\"subformula\" for formulas, \"sublist\" for lists, and \"subtree\" for trees). The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the minimal structures, and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure \"S\", then it must hold for \"S\" also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of well-founded induction, which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all \"x\".)\n\nA structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: \"base cases\" handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion. Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out. The \"length\" and ++ functions in the example below are structurally recursive.\n\nFor example, if the structures are lists, one usually introduces the partial order '<' in which \"L\" < \"M\" whenever list \"L\" is the tail of list \"M\". Under this ordering, the empty list [] is the unique minimal element. A structural induction proof of some proposition then consists of two parts: A proof that \"P\"([]) is true, and a proof that if \"P\"(\"L\") is true for some list \"L\", and if \"L\" is the tail of list \"M\", then \"P\"(\"M\") must also be true.\n\nEventually, there may exist more than one base case, and/or more than one inductive case, depending on how the function or structure was constructed. In those cases, a structural induction proof of some proposition then consists of: \nAn ancestor tree is a commonly known data structure, showing the parents, grandparents, etc. of a person as far as known (see picture for an example). It is recursively defined:\n\nAs an example, the property \"An ancestor tree extending over \"g\" generations shows at most persons\" can be proven by structural induction as follows:\nHence, by structural induction, each ancestor tree satisfies the property.\n\nAs another, more formal example, consider the following property of lists:\n\nHere ++ denotes the list concatenation operation, and L and M are lists.\n\nIn order to prove this, we need definitions for length and for the concatenation operation. Let (h:t) denote a list whose head (first element) is \"h\" and whose tail (list of remaining elements) is \"t\", and let [] denote the empty list. The definitions for length and the concatenation operation are:\n\nOur proposition is that EQ is true for all lists \"M\" when \"L\" is . We want to show that is true for all lists . We will prove this by structural induction on lists.\n\nFirst we will prove that \"P\"([]) is true; that is, EQ is true for all lists \"M\" when \"L\" happens to be the empty list []. Consider EQ:\n\nSo this part of the theorem is proved; EQ is true for all \"M\", when \"L\" is [], because the left-hand side and the right-hand side are equal.\n\nNext, consider any nonempty list . Since is nonempty, it has a head item, x, and a tail list, xs, so we can express it as (x:xs). The induction hypothesis is that EQ is true for all values of \"M\" when \"L\" is \"xs\":\n\nWe would like to show that if this is the case, then EQ is also true for all values of \"M\" when = (x:xs). We proceed as before:\n\nThus, from structural induction, we obtain that P(L) is true for all lists L.\n\nJust as standard mathematical induction is equivalent to the well-ordering principle, structural induction is also equivalent to a well-ordering principle. If the set of all structures of a certain kind admits a well-founded partial order, then every nonempty subset must have a minimal element. (This is the definition of \"well-founded\".) The significance of the lemma in this context is that it allows us to deduce that if there are any counterexamples to the theorem we want to prove, then there must be a minimal counterexample. If we can show the existence of the minimal counterexample implies an even smaller counterexample, we have a contradiction (since the minimal counterexample isn't minimal) and so the set of counterexamples must be empty.\n\nAs an example of this type of argument, consider the set of all binary trees. We will show that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of interior nodes. Suppose there is a counterexample; then there must exist one with the minimal possible number of interior nodes. This counterexample, \"C\", has \"n\" interior nodes and leaves, where . Moreover, \"C\" must be nontrivial, because the trivial tree has and and is therefore not a counterexample. \"C\" therefore has at least one leaf whose parent node is an interior node. Delete this leaf and its parent from the tree, promoting the leaf's sibling node to the position formerly occupied by its parent. This reduces both \"n\" and by 1, so the new tree also has and is therefore a smaller counterexample. But by hypothesis, \"C\" was already the smallest counterexample; therefore, the supposition that there were any counterexamples to begin with must have been false. The partial ordering implied by 'smaller' here is the one that says that \"S\" < \"T\" whenever \"S\" has fewer nodes than \"T\".\n\n\nEarly publications about structural induction include:\n"}
