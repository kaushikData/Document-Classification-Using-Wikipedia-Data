The lower part and the left arm were dug up east of the Parthenon in 1882 and the upper part was discovered west of the Erechtheion in 1886. Parts of the calf followed. The face is damaged, especially the nose, and the lower right arm is missing, as is the front of the feet on the plinth. The kore was originally located in the Athena sanctuary on the acropolis and is now kept in the Acropolis Museum The statue is 201 cm high, excluding the plinth.\n\nThe Kore has chest-length hair, which only partially survives. The hair at the front is gathered into tight curls, while the rest of the hair falls in locks, fanning out over the shoulders and back. She wears a crown in her hair. Like all archaic korai, the sculpture has a clear axis and stares directly at the viewer. She wears a chiton and himation. The latter seems to be tied over the left arm, pinned at the top with a fibula and falling below in omega-folds. With the left hand the image gathers the chiton, causing the characteristic drapery. The conspicuously empty eye-holes must have been inlaid with another material, likely glass - a rather rare feature in marble statues of this period.\n\nFragments of a Pentelic marble statue base in the form of a capital were found in the Perserschutt in the same excavation as the statue fragments. This base was first connected with the statue by Franz Studniczka, a conclusion which has been largely accepted, though some still doubt. An inscription on the base name the donor Nearchos and the sculptor Antenor son of Eumares. It reads:\n\nThe surviving at the beginning of the second line is generally restored as and the donor identified with the attested potter Nearchos from the second quarter of the sixth century BC or with an unknown potter of the same name, perhaps a son or uncle of the known Nearchos. It has sometimes been doubted that a simple artesan could be the donor of such a votive statue and alternative restorations of the inscription have been suggested. On the other hand it was quite possible in the 6th century to gain a significant fortune through craftworks and other donations are known from potters and vase painters on the Acropolis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12656870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12656870", "title": "Black Volga", "text": "Black Volga\n\nBlack Volga () refers to an urban legend widespread in Poland, Hungary, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Mongolia, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s. It was about a black (or in some versions red) Volga limousine that was allegedly used to abduct people, especially children. According to different versions, it was driven by priests, nuns, Jews, vampires, satanists or Satan himself. The car is described as having white wheel rims, white curtains or other white elements.\n\nChildren were kidnapped to use their blood as a cure for rich Westerners or Arabs suffering from leukemia; other variants used organ theft as the motive, combining it with another famous legend about kidney theft by the KGB. The legend surfaced again in the late 20th century, with a BMW or Mercedes car taking the Volga's place, sometimes depicted with horns instead of wing mirrors. In this version, the driver would ask passers-by for the time and kill them when they approached the car to answer. In another version of the legend, the victim would die at the same time a day later. Many suspect that the story was circulated by the Polish secret police in order to detract validity from stories of real kidnappings by the government.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "87070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87070", "title": "Bronko Nagurski", "text": "Bronko Nagurski\n\nBronislau \"Bronko\" Nagurski (November 3, 1908 – January 7, 1990) was a Canadian-born American football player in the National Football League (NFL), renowned for his strength and size. Nagurski was also a successful professional wrestler, recognized as a multiple-time World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nNagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at the University of Minnesota from 1927 to 1929, selected a consensus All-American in 1929 and inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in its inaugural year of 1951. His professional career with the Chicago Bears also made him an inaugural inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nNagurski was born in Rainy River, Ontario, Canada, of Ukrainian and Polish descent, and his family moved to International Falls, Minnesota, when he was age five. His parents, \"Mike\" and Michelina Nagurski, were immigrants, from Western Ukraine (region called kresy where many ethnicities lived together (Halychyna/Galicia). Young Bronislau grew up working on his parents' farm and sawmill, delivering groceries for his father's grocery store and in his teens laboring at nearby timbering operations, growing into a powerfully muscular six-footer.\n\nNagurski was discovered and signed by University of Minnesota head coach Clarence Spears, who drove to International Falls to meet another player. On the outside of town, he watched Nagurski out plowing a field without assistance. According to legend, Spears asked directions and Bronko lifted his plow and used it to point. He was signed on the spot to play for the Golden Gophers. Spears admitted he concocted the story on his long drive back to the university in Minneapolis.\n\nLegends aside, on his first day of practice Spears decided to test Nagurski in the \"Nutcracker\" drill, where a defensive player had to take on two blockers and try to tackle a following ball carrier. On the first drill two All-Big Ten linemen and Herb Joesting charged at Bronko, who promptly split the blockers and drove the big fullback into a blocking dummy. Spears sent in three more players, blew his whistle and watched Bronko produce the same explosive results and after a third try with the same conclusion realized what a super player he had recruited.\n\nNagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at Minnesota from 1927 to 1929. In 1929, after posting 737 rushing yards, he was a consensus All-American at fullback, and despite playing fewer games at the position also made some All-American teams at tackle. The pre-eminent sportswriter of the day, Grantland Rice, listed him at the two positions in picking his 1929 All-America team. Rice later wrote, \"Who would you pick to win a football game - 11 Jim Thorpes - 11 Glen Davises - 11 Red Granges - or 11 Bronko Nagurskis? The 11 Nagurskis would be a mop-up. It would be something close to murder and massacre. For the Bronk could star at any position on the field, with of authority to back him up.\"\n\nHis greatest collegiate game was against Wisconsin in the season finale in 1928. Wearing a corset to protect cracked vertebrae, he recovered a Badger fumble deep in their territory, then ran the ball six straight times to score the go-ahead touchdown. Later in the same game, he intercepted a pass to seal the victory.\n\nDuring his three varsity seasons at Minnesota, the Gophers went and won the Big Ten Conference championship in 1927. Nagurski was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951.\n\nNagurski turned professional to play for the Chicago Bears from 1930 to 1937. At and , he was a formidable presence, and in his day he was a dominant force, helping the Bears win several division titles and two NFL championships.\n\nNagurski has the largest recorded NFL Championship ring size at 19½ and wore a size-8 helmet. He was probably the largest running back of his time, bigger than most linemen of the day, often dragging multiple tacklers with him. In a time when players were expected to play on both sides of the ball, he was a standout defensive lineman as well playing a ranging tackle or \"The Monster.\" After an injury, instead of sitting on the bench, he would sometimes be put in as an offensive tackle. In a 1984 interview with \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Paul \"Dr. Z\" Zimmerman, when asked what position he would play if he were coming up in the present day, he said, \"I would probably be a linebacker today. I wouldn't be carrying the ball 30 or 35 times a game.\"\n\nA time-honored and perhaps apocryphal story about Nagurski is a scoring gallop that he made against the Washington Redskins, knocking two linebackers in opposite directions, stomping a defensive back and crushing a safety, then bouncing off the goalposts and cracking Wrigley Field's brick wall. On returning to the huddle for the extra point try, he reportedly said: \"That last guy hit me awfully hard.\"\n\nOnce in a game against the Packers, the Bears prepared to punt, and Green Bay's Cal Hubbard went to Red Grange and said: \"I promise not to try to block the kick, Red, but get out of the way so I can get a shot at that Polack.\" Grange, glad not to try to block Hubbard for once, obliged. Cal tore through the line, slammed into Nagurski and bounced off. Rising slowly, he turned to Grange and said: \"Hey, Red, don't do me any more favors.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1932 season, the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans were tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold its first playoff game. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at Chicago Stadium, which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9–0. In the fourth quarter of the 1932 game, the Bears scored on a controversial touchdown: Carl Brumbaugh handed the ball off to fullback Nagurski, who pulled up and threw to Red Grange in the end zone for the score. The Spartans argued that Nagurski did not drop back five yards before passing to Grange, but the touchdown stood. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the 1933 season, with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (instead of the previous five yards behind).\n\nDuring World War II, professional football teams were short of players and in 1943 Bronko Nagurski returned to the Bears for one season. He scored a touchdown in the Bears' championship victory against the Washington Redskins, served one season as backfield coach for UCLA in 1944 and finally returned to wrestling until his retirement in 1960.\n\nDuring his football career, he built a second athletic career as a professional wrestler and became a major box-office attraction. Tony Stecher, brother of former world champion Joe Stecher, introduced Nagurski to wrestling in 1933 and became his manager. Nagurski defeated Tag Tagerson in his ring debut. Hitting his peak in the late 1930s, Nagurski won a limited version of the world championship by defeating Dean Detton on June 29, 1937. But he finally achieved full recognition with his first National Wrestling Association world title by defeating Lou Thesz on June 23, 1939. Losing the title to Ray Steele on March 7, 1940, he regained it from Steele one year later on March 11, 1941, but lost it three months later to Sandor Szabo on June 5, 1941.\n\n\nNagurski married his childhood sweetheart Eileen Kane on December 28, 1936. The couple had a child Christmas Day 1937, whom they named after his father. Nagurski's son, Bronko Nagurski Jr., played football at the University of Notre Dame and become an all-star with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League.\n\nAfter his retirement from wrestling, he returned home to International Falls and opened a service station. A local legend claims that Nagurski had the best repeat business in town because he would screw customers' gas caps down so tight after filling their tanks that no one else in town could unscrew them. He retired from that in 1978, at the age of seventy, and lived out a quiet life on the shores of Rainy Lake on the Canada–U.S. border. In January 1984, Nagurski performed the coin toss at Super Bowl XVIII in Tampa, Florida, with Washington Redskins quarterback and co-captain Joe Theismann calling the toss on behalf of his team's co-captains and the captains of the opposing Los Angeles Raiders.\n\nIn 1990, he died in International Falls and is buried at its Saint Thomas Cemetery.\n\nNagurski was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a charter member on September 7, 1963. At the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities house of his fraternity, Sigma Chi, Nagurski's jersey and Significant Sig recognition certificate are on display. After his death, the town of International Falls honored him by opening the Bronko Nagurski Museum in Smokey Bear Park.\n\n\"Sports Illustrated\" named Nagurski one of the four greatest athletes in Minnesota state history; the other three were Dave Winfield, Kevin McHale, and Joe Mauer. In 1993, the Football Writers Association of America created the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, awarded annually to the best defensive player in college football. Notable winners include Warren Sapp, Charles Woodson, Terrell Suggs, Champ Bailey and Derrick Johnson. In 1999 Nagurski was selected by \"Sports Illustrated\" as a starting defensive tackle for their \"NCAA Football All-Century Team\". The other starting defensive tackle on that list was Rich Glover. In 2007, Nagurski was ranked No. 17 on ESPN's Top 25 Players In College Football History list.\n\nIn 1999, he was ranked No. 35 on \"The Sporting News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking foreign-born player. In 2000, he was voted the second-greatest Minnesotan sportsman of the 20th century by the sportswriters of the \"Star Tribune\", coming in behind only Minnesota Twins Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett.\n\nA fictionalized eyewitness account of Nagurski's 1943 comeback is the subject of a dramatic monologue in the 2001 film version of \"Hearts in Atlantis.\" The film's screenwriter, William Goldman, repeated much of this rendition from his earlier account of the same story in his novel \"Magic.\"\n\nIn 2009, Nagurski was an honorary team captain, represented by his son, Bronko Nagurski Jr., at the opening game of TCF Bank Stadium. His home town International Falls high school nickname is the Broncos in his honor.\n\nA legendary tale of Nagurski's physical toughness says that he charged through a group of defenders and ended up hitting the wall at Wrigley Field. On returning to the bench, he told Coach Halas, \"That last guy gave me quite a lick!\"\n\n"}

The schooner is now preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. She is one of the last survivors of the sailing schooners in the West coast lumber trade to San Francisco from Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. She was designated a National Historic Landmark on 13 November 1966.\n\nThis ship is used for many class field trips.\n\n\"C.A. Thayer\" was built by Danish-born Hans Ditlev Bendixsen in his shipyard, located across the narrows of Humboldt Bay from the city of Eureka in Northern California. Bendixsen also built the \"Wawona\" (1897) which was dismantled in 2009. The \"C.A. Thayer\" was named for Clarence A. Thayer, a partner in the San Francisco-based E.K. Wood Lumber Company.\n\nBetween 1895 and 1912, \"C.A. Thayer\" usually sailed from E.K. Wood's mill in Grays Harbor, Washington, to San Francisco. But she also carried lumber as far south as Mexico, and occasionally even ventured offshore to Hawaii and Fiji.\n\n\"C.A. Thayer\" is typical of the sort of three-masted schooners often used in the west coast lumber trade. She is in length and has a cargo capacity of . She carried about half of her load below deck, with the remaining lumber stacked high on deck. In port, her small crew of eight or nine men were also responsible for loading and unloading the ship. Unloading was an average day's work.\n\nWith the increase in the use of steam power for the lumber trade, and after sustaining serious damage during a gale, \"C.A. Thayer\" was retired from the lumber trade in 1912, and converted for use in the Alaskan salmon fishery.\n\nEarly each April from 1912 to 1924, \"C.A. Thayer\" sailed from San Francisco for Western Alaska. On board she carried gillnet boats, bundles of barrel staves, tons of salt, and a crew of fishermen and cannery workers. She then spent the summer anchored at a fishery camp such as Squaw Creek or Koggiung. While there, the fishermen worked their nets and the cannery workers packed the catch on shore. \"C.A. Thayer\" returned to San Francisco each September, carrying barrels of salted salmon.\n\nVessels in the salt-salmon trade usually laid up during the winter months, but when World War I inflated freight rates, \"C.A. Thayer\" carried Northwest fir and Mendocino redwood to Australia. These off-season voyages took about two months each way. Her return cargo was usually coal, but sometimes hardwood or copra.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, \"C.A. Thayer\" made yearly voyages from Poulsbo, Washington, to Alaska's Bering Sea cod-fishing waters. In addition to supplies, she carried upwards of thirty men north, including fourteen fishermen and twelve \"dressers\" (the men who cleaned and cured the catch). At about 4:30am each day, the fishermen launched their Grand Banks dories over the rails, and then fished standing up, with handlines dropped over both sides of their small boats. When the fishing was good, a man might catch 300-350 cod in a five-hour period.\n\nAfter a decade-long, Depression-era lay-up in Lake Union, the U.S. Army purchased \"C.A. Thayer\" from J.E. Shields for use in the war effort. In 1942, the Army removed her masts and used \"Thayer\" as an ammunition barge in British Columbia. After World War II, Shields bought his ship back from the Army, fitted her with masts once again, and returned her to codfishing. Her final voyage was in 1950.\n\nThe State of California purchased \"C.A. Thayer\" in 1957. After preliminary restoration in Seattle, Washington, a volunteer crew sailed her down the coast to San Francisco. The San Francisco Maritime Museum performed more extensive repairs and refitting, and opened \"C.A. Thayer\" to the public in 1963. The vessel was transferred to the National Park Service in 1978, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1984.\n\nAfter 40 years as a museum ship, \"C.A. Thayer\" has again been restored, a restoration which took three years from 2004, and which resulted in her temporary removal from her berth at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Approximately 80% of the ship's timbers were replaced with new timbers matching the original wood. The ship sailed back to the Hyde Street Pier on 12 April 2007.\n\nIn Nov. 2016 she was moved to Alameda to be painted, get new booms and gaffs, and have three masts and a bowsprit installed by the Bay Ship and Yacht Company. She returned to the Hyde Street Pier in Feb. 2017. In 2017 she will be rigged with a new set of sails.\n\n\n"}

The manuscript is the first major chronicle of the Teutonic Order in Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, completed some 100 years after the conquest of the crusaders into the Baltic region. It is a major source for information on the Order's battles with Old Prussians and Lithuanians.\n\nThe chronicle is written in Latin and consists of four volumes. The first volume gives the background of the Order and its crusades in Outremer. The second volume narrates how the Order arrived to the Prussian land, while the third volume details wars with Old Prussians and other Baltic tribes. The fourth volume provides a historical context of other contemporary events in the world. The chronicle has an addendum of another 20 chapters dealing with events of 1326-1330. It might also have been written by Peter of Dusburg. The chronicle is based on local monastery annals, chronicles, reports and narrations which Peter \"considered reliable\". Peter had access to the Grand Masters' archive in Marienburg and witnessed some events himself.\n\nThe chronicle contains some ethnographic data about the Old Prussians, the indigenous people conquered by the Order. It provides numerous chapters in the styles of religious visions, miracles, and hagiography, aimed at the glorification of the mission of the Order. The war against pagans is sacred and all knights who perish go to heaven. Peter takes no interest in domestic policy of the Order; he does not describe cities, trade, or colonization. Rather the chronicle describes minor raids and clashes with great detail. While narratives of events and battles are considered to be reliable, ethnographic data is ideologically charged. As a priest Peter tried to teach the reader. Pagan Prussians and Lithuanians are presented as a moral example.

It is the eighth installment of the \"X-Men\" film series and the first standalone \"Deadpool\" film. Directed by Tim Miller from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the film stars Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano and Brianna Hildebrand. In the film, Wilson—as the antihero Deadpool—hunts down the man who gave him mutant abilities and caused his scarred physical appearance.\n\nDevelopment of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, before he went on to play the character in \"\" in 2009. Reese and Wernick were hired for a spinoff in 2010. They worked with Reynolds to adapt the character more faithfully (including his fourth wall breaking) after the portrayal in \"Wolverine\" was criticized for not doing so. Miller was hired in 2011 marking his directorial debut. An enthusiastic response to leaked test footage he created with Reynolds led to a green-light from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began in early 2015, and filming took place in Vancouver, Canada, from March to May of that year. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CG character Colossus.\n\n\"Deadpool\" was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an unconventional marketing campaign. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $783 million against a $58 million budget, breaking numerous records: it became the highest-grossing R-rated film, the highest-grossing \"X-Men\" film, and the ninth-highest-grossing 2016 film. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, and its action sequences. Some detractors criticized the plot as formulaic as well as the sheer number of jokes in the film. It also received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Awards and two Golden Globe nominations. A sequel, \"Deadpool 2\", was released in May 2018.\n\nWade Wilson is a dishonorably discharged special forces operative working as a mercenary when he meets Vanessa, a prostitute. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.\n\nA mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures the cancer but leaves Wilson severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the now-burning laboratory.\n\nWilson survives and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her he is alive fearing her reaction to his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend Weasel, Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name \"Deadpool\" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. He questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals his whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway. He kills everyone but Ajax, and demands the cure from him but the X-Man Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead interrupt him. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the X-Men. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasel's bar where he learns of Vanessa.\n\nAjax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him. They battle Angel Dust and several soldiers while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the collapsing ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again but is overpowered. He reveals there is no cure and, despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills him. He promises to try to be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry with Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.\n\n\nStefan Kapičić provides the voice of Colossus, an X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel. Writer Rhett Reese called him \"a great foil to Deadpool because he's very self-serious and goody-two-shoes\". Director Miller changed the character drastically from his previous film appearances, where he was portrayed by Daniel Cudmore. Miller felt the Cudmore version, which he described as \"[t]hat dude with the shiny skin\", was \"not fucking Colossus.\" He wanted the character to be seven-and-a-half feet tall. Andre Tricoteux stood in for a CG version of Colossus on set, and Kapičić was cast to give the character an \"authentic Russian accent\" like he has in the comics.\n\nLeslie Uggams portrays Blind Al, an elderly blind woman and Deadpool's roommate. Uggams said that Al has \"been through British Intelligence, she's done all kinds of wild and crazy things ... she's old, but she's feisty.\" Uggams added that Al has a \"love/hate\" relationship with Deadpool. Karan Soni appears as Dopinder, a taxi driver who befriends Deadpool, and Jed Rees portrays a recruiter for Ajax. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios. They did not give permission for him to be used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the Hydra organization are not referenced in the film. He is explained instead as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Hugh Jackman, who portrayed Wolverine in the \"X-Men\" film series, was very supportive of \"Deadpool\" and it making fun of himself and his character. He is seen in the film on a \"People\" magazine Sexiest Man Alive cover.\n\nArtisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on Marvel Comics' characters, including Deadpool. By February 2004, writer and director David S. Goyer and Ryan Reynolds were working on a Deadpool film at New Line Cinema. They had worked together on the Marvel film \"\". Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei\". New Line executive Jeff Katz, who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role, championed the idea. However, there were rights issues with 20th Century Fox and their \"X-Men\" films, and the project did not move forward.\n\nBy March 2005, Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool. The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the 2009 film \"\", with Reynolds cast in the part. His role was expanded during the film's production. Katz was an executive at Fox at that point, and said that \"Deadpool\" was \"nicely set up to be explored in his own way\" in a future film. The film's portrayal deviates from the original comic character, \"imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut\". Deadpool apparently dies in the film, though a post-credits scene showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release. After the successful opening weekend of \"Wolverine\", Fox officially began development on \"Deadpool\", with Reynolds attached to star and \"X-Men\" producer Lauren Shuler Donner involved. The spinoff was set to ignore the \"Wolverine\" version of Deadpool and return to the character's roots with a slapstick tone and a \"propensity to break the fourth wall\".\n\nRhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010. Reynolds, who worked closely with them, said they were chosen because, \"Tonally, they got it. They just [understood \"Deadpool\"] right off the bat.\" By that June, Robert Rodriguez had been asked to direct the film. He confirmed this a month later, saying he had been sent a \"really good\" script and was considering taking on the project. By October he was no longer interested in it, and Adam Berg was being looked at to direct the film. In April 2011, Tim Miller was hired after working on the visual effects for some of the \"X-Men\" films, in part because of his work creating animated short films. These included the Academy Award-winning \"Gopher Broke\" and a DC Universe Online trailer which was \"epic and cinematic, everything [Fox wanted] their comic book movies to be\". Miller would make his directorial debut with the film, while Reynolds closed a deal with Fox to produce the film.\n\nReynolds's \"Green Lantern\" superhero film was released later in 2011 and was \"a disaster\". This tainted the \"Deadpool\" project. Fox executives were already concerned about its R-rated content. After several meetings the studio agreed the film could not be reconfigured for a more traditional PG-13 rating, and gave Miller \"a low-six-figure budget\" to produce some test footage. He created the footage using CGI at his animation company Blur Studio in 2012, with Reynolds voicing Deadpool. The footage did not convince Fox to green-light the film. After the successful May release of Marvel's \"The Avengers\", Reese and Wernick thought \"Deadpool\" might be approved as an already developed superhero film. Fox was actually even more doubtful about the script, however, and began exploring ways to include Deadpool in an \"Avengers\"-esque team-up film. At different times during development, James Cameron and David Fincher, both friends of Miller, read the film's script and championed the project to Fox executives.\nThe test footage was leaked online in July 2014, and was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response. That September, Fox gave \"Deadpool\" a release date of February 12, 2016. Production was set to begin in March 2015, with Simon Kinberg joining as producer. Reynolds attributed Fox's green-lighting of the film entirely to the leak. He, Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so. He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted, Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films.\n\nReese and Wernick wrote a draft of the script each year before completing the film, with around 70 percent of the first draft ending up in the final film. Reese described Reynolds as \"the keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years ... if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path, or if it doesn't feel like Deadpool, he catches it.\" The writers did not want the film to be an origin story, but Reynolds disagreed. They settled on a \"modern\" Deadpool story as well as the origin story connected by Deadpool's narration and fourth wall breaking. This helped to balance the darker origin story with the cartoon-like Deadpool scenes. It also allowed the opening fight sequence to be extended through the first half of the film (with the origin story told throughout), saving money on additional fight scenes. This fight sequence labeled the \"Twelve Bullets Fight\" reimagines the original test footage. Once the origin story is told, Deadpool uses a \"fast-forward button\" to return the audience to the present day.\n\nIn October 2014, Kinberg confirmed that \"Deadpool\" would be set in the same shared universe as the \"X-Men\" films, but would \"stand independently\". The writers wanted a traditional X-Man in the film as a foil to Deadpool and felt Colossus was a character who had not been explored much in previous films. Miller wanted \"more superhero stuff\", instead of \"just Deadpool and a lot of guns\". The character Negasonic Teenage Warhead was added as a trainee X-Man mentored by Colossus. She was chosen for her name from the list of comic characters available for use by Fox. The characters Garrison Kane, Wyre, and Sluggo were included in the script at one point, but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons. Cannonball and Tar Baby were also considered. These villains were replaced by a single character, Angel Dust. The Cable character was also set to appear, but was eventually pushed to a potential sequel so this film could \"get Deadpool on his feet\" first.\n\nThe writers worked to keep the script's pop-culture references up-to-date throughout its development. Kinberg confirmed the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\". It also includes jokes at the expense of \"Green Lantern\". While Miller felt it was okay for audience members not to understand all of the film's jokes, he wanted to avoid anything targeted specifically at comic fans. He was not in favor of any joke the audience \"needs to look up on the internet\" after the movie ends. The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986), where the title character of that film breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the parody scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home. He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel. After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as combination of \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994), a description the writers felt was accurate.\n48 hours before the film received the official green-light from Fox, the studio cut its budget by $7–$8 million, down to $58 million. This forced a last minute re-write that saw about nine pages cut from the 110-page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase at the end of the Twelve Bullets Fight and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having to shoot a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, \"It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, but I think it really made the movie pace nicely.\"\n\nIn January 2015, T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein were in talks to appear in the film, Miller as \"an additional comic voice\" and Skrein as a villain. A month later, Fox was testing actresses to portray the female lead, including Morena Baccarin, Taylor Schilling, Crystal Reed, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Sarah Greene and Jessica De Gouw. Gina Carano was cast as Angel Dust, and Miller was confirmed for an unspecified role. Baccarin was cast as Deadpool's love interest before the end of February. Colossus actor Daniel Cudmore said he would not be reprising the role for \"Deadpool\", and declined an offer to provide reference for a CG version of the character to be voiced by another actor.\n\nAn immediate focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit. Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions were hired to create the costume. Shinkle noted that \"comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique\", and he tried to balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave it a slimmer, \"quintessential Deadpool\" look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume. Reynolds explained, \"we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That's hard to accomplish and a feat, but we're just so happy with how this came out.\" The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind. The mask's eye areas were removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without having to change the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI. Visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed this on the suit's fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to \"get into the gutters and the cracks ... [so when] the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt.\" Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.\n\nMiller wanted Deadpool's scarred appearance to make him appear \"fucking horrible\" to justify his anger. Makeup designer Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics \"he's everything from a rotten corpse to a guy with a couple of lines on his face\". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as \"disfigured\" but also wanted him to be \"kind of charming and iconic\". He wanted to avoid comparisons with Freddy Krueger and looked to \"Sin City\" (2005) for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds's head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply Reynold's full-body makeup. Corso described the makeup for the rest of the film's characters as \"pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 23, 2015, in Vancouver, Canada, under the working title \"Wham!\". Filming took place at North Shore Studios and on location around the city. The production hired over 2,000 locals as actors, extras and crew members. T. J. Miller and Baccarin were revealed to be playing Weasel and Vanessa, respectively. Skrein confirmed he was in the film, playing Ajax. Newcomer Brianna Hildebrand was cast as Negasonic Teenage Warhead.\n\nTim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng wanted the film to look \"grittier and less clean and glossy\" than other superhero films. They decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in post-production to give the images texture. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, and Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. The film's exterior scenes have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with \"unpredictable\" weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks and shot rain or shine before their permit expired. Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep a consistent look. Production designer Sean Haworth, who had specific ideas for the sets, also worked closely with Miller. The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were constructed to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI. A gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with many digital elements. The final sequence was filmed in a naval yard dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.\nWhen Fox was unwilling to pay Reese and Wernick to be on set every day, Reynolds paid their salaries. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, \"every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot\", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators were free to change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the film's stunt coordinators; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors. Skrein worked \"nonstop\" to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds \"has a photographic memory; he'd do something three or four times and remember it very well.\" A lot of the film's jokes were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. For example, Reese said Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic. Instead Reynolds improvised the line on set, \"You know it's funny how I only see the two of you here. It's like the studio couldn't afford any more X-Men.\" This was based in truth and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos' favorite line. Filming ended on May 29.\n\nLeslie Uggams said that she was in the film in July 2015, portraying Blind Al. Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays \"The Recruiter\", and \"did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet\". Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film, with Andre Tricoteux cast to provide motion reference on set for the role along with the voice. In December, the voice of Colossus was recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.\n\nAs soon as editor Julian Clarke began selecting shots for the film, they were color graded by EFILM's Tim Stipan to ensure they all matched. Stipan colored the characters slightly differently. He gave Deadpool a \"dark, modern touch\" and Colossus a \"particular vibrancy and substance\". Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed. He cut down other scenes with fewer jokes, such as Wilson being tortured, as they were \"too much\". It would take the audience \"too long to recover [and] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie.\" During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. Clarke decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones.\n\nOne sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons and replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis. In its new context the scene implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.\n\nBecause of the animation required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded the lines in an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of \"Wolverine\" star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart at that point in the \"X-Men\" timeline. This became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.\n\nDigital Domain (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, Weta Digital, Rodeo FX and Luma Pictures produced \"Deadpool\"s visual effects. Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing a film that looked like others made with bigger budgets. Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed, noting that Miller held off working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots that would not be used. Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots—700 more than originally planned. 800 of them were completed in the last four weeks of production.\nColossus's movements were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux had been unable to move athletically because of the platform shoes he wore on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking \"chromey\", visiting a metal company to look at samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges which could be moved separately to keep them perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool was used by all the FX vendors. His mask was animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics. This helped balance out the \"chinwag\" coming through the bottom of the mask as Reynolds's acted. Fully Replacing Deadpool's head was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital warped each shot based on facial references from Reynolds and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes instead. This was called an \"ingenious 2D-ish solution\".\n\nAtomic Fiction created a freeway environment for the Twelve Bullets Fight, with a backdrop based on Detroit, Chicago, and Vancouver. They also created the vehicles used in the sequence. These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles, which move through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car. The amusing titles include \"Directed by an overpaid tool\" and \"Produced by asshats\". Reynolds, Miller, and the writers came up with their own credits hoping to set the tone for the film.\n\nLuma contributed the film's blood and gore using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes. When Deadpool cuts off his own hand, DD did not want to be \"outdone\" by Luma and had \"buckets of blood pouring out\". Luma created the regrowing hand, inspired by the hand of a fetus. When Deadpool breaks both his hands, DD went through 20 or 30 different versions of what broken fingers could look like. For Deadpool's initial scarring from the warehouse fire, Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot-eaten meat. The company added a CG penis to Reynolds in this sequence, which visual effects supervisor Wayne Brinton said, \"you don't even notice [but] when it wasn't there it looked really weird\". Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene.\n\nThe vendors all collaborated for the final battle sequence, which takes place in the wreckage of a helicarrier. Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created most of the Colossus effects until he is damaged when Blur Studio took over; DD created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed matte paintings for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool. Negasonic's abilities were the only \"supernatural effect-sy thing\" in the film, and were based on fuel-air explosives and solar flares to try ground them in reality. Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea. This helped to expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and the wider Marvel Universe. To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for \"Deadpool\" was designed to be \"as different as possible from the one in \"The Avengers\"\". Additionally, a French animation artist with a \"unique style\" created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.\n\nTom Holkenborg announced in October 2015 that he would compose the score for \"Deadpool\". Noting that Deadpool only makes pre-1990 musical references, Holenborg decided to use sounds from the 1980s in the movie's main theme, such as those of an Oberheim and a Synclavier . Several songs were written in to Reese and Wernick's script to be used in the film. Some of these ultimately did not work as intended. For example, the sex montage with Wilson and Vanessa was to play out to Frank Sinatra's version of \"It Was a Very Good Year\" in the script, but this was changed to Neil Sedaka's \"Calendar Girl\" during editing. A soundtrack album featuring Holkenborg's score and the songs heard in the film was released digitally on February 12, 2016, and physically on March 4 through Milan Records.\n\nThe marketing budget for \"Deadpool\" was limited so Reynolds worked closely with Fox's domestic marketing chief Marc Weinstock to use the Internet to their advantage and come up with cheaper, \"Deadpool-based\" ways to market the film. This included unique trailers, unconventional billboards, promotional tie-ins with Super Bowl L and Viacom and an extensive social media presence. Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign. Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a process similar to that used by Weta Digital for the film. Emma Grey Ellis at Wired.com described the campaign as \"crazy and unrelenting\" with Deadpool waging \"a relentless marketing siege of every platform you would think of—and some you didn’t.\" Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly \"the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema\". HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed the campaign's success to Reynolds, and to Fox for embracing the film's R rating.\n\n\"Deadpool\"s world premiere was held at the Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, before its initial theatrical release in Hong Kong the next day. This was followed by releases in 49 other markets over the next few days, including the United States on February 12. The movie was released in several formats, including IMAX, DLP, premium large formats, and D-Box.\n\nKinberg explained that unlike the previous \"X-Men\" films, \"Deadpool\" is \"a hard R. It's graphic. Nothing is taboo. You either commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing kind of movie or you don't.\" China forbid the film's release because of this. Though R-rated American films are often \"cleaned-up\" for release there, it was decided that doing so was impossible without affecting the plot. It was not released in Uzbekistan after theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because of its age restriction and how it violated the country's societal norms. \"Deadpool\" received seven \"general cuts\" to obtain approval for release in India. Despite being blocked in China during this initial release, \"Deadpool\" eventually premiered in the country during the 2018 Beijing International Film Festival, which ran over a week from April 15–22. The original version of the film played at the festival without any edits being made specifically for Chinese censors.\n\n\"Deadpool\" was released for digital download on April 26, 2016, moved up from the physical home media release, which came on May 10. The latter release, for Blu-ray and DVD, included behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and two audio commentaries: one by Tim Miller and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld, and another by Reynolds, Reese, and Wernick. On November 7, Fox re-released the film and its special features on Blu-ray for the holiday season, as \"Deadpool's Holiday Blu-ray package\". The film was re-released again in April 2018 in a \"Deadpool\" Two Year Anniversary Edition Blu-ray package, with collectible covers as well as \"stickers, car decals, temporary tattoos and a set of paper dolls\". A 4K UHD Steelbook version was also released exclusively through Best Buy featuring original artwork.\n\n\"Deadpool\" grossed $363.1 million in the United States and Canada and $420 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $783.1 million, against a budget of $58 million. It broke numerous records with its opening weekend gross across the world, and went on to become the highest-grossing R-rated film and the highest-grossing \"X-Men\" film, as well as the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $322 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the second-most profitable release of 2016. When discussing potential reasons for the film's surprise success, the site highlighted its marketing campaign.\n\nAt the end of January 2016, the film was projected to earn $55–60 million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canada. Fox's rivals projected the film to earn closer to $80 million. It ultimately opened at No. 1, making $132.4 million for the weekend, and $152.2 million over the long Presidents' Day weekend. Trying to explain this surprise, Fox's domestic distribution chief Chris Aronson said \"it's hard to comp and predict. You're doing something that's never been done. It's like you throw the rulebook out the window.\" The weekend included $12.7 million from Thursday preview showings on February 11, $47.5 million on its opening day, $42.5 million on February 13, and $42.6 million on February 14, as well as $19.8 million on February 15 to end the long weekend. These were all day-of-the-week records for R-rated films and days in February for Thursday through Monday. $16.8 million of this came from IMAX screens, a record opening weekend for R-rated films and February releases in that format. \"Deadpool\" earned an additional $55 million in its second weekend. This kept it at No. 1, and made it the fastest R-rated film to cross $200 million, doing so in nine days. It became the highest-grossing \"X-Men\" film and R-rated comic book superhero film the next day. It remained in the No. 1 position for its third week, but fell behind \"Zootopia\" and \"London Has Fallen\" the following week. \"Deadpool\"s domestic run ended on June 17, after 126 days, with $363.1 million. This was shortly after it became the highest-grossing R-rated film worldwide. The film's U.S. audience, across its whole run, was 59% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic, 12% African-American, and 8% Asian. It was also 62% male, and had an average age of 35.\n\nThe film was released in 80 markets around the world, many of them in its first week. This included the United Kingdom, France, and Australia on its first day, February 9, where it was the No. 1 film and broke several records. The film also opened well in Asian countries, notably Taiwan—where Reynolds had traveled for promotion and made the \"central hub\" of South East Asia for the film—and Hong Kong, where the film had the biggest Chinese New Year single day ever. It went on to gross $132.2 million for its international opening weekend, which included $9 million from IMAX showings breaking opening weekend records for February releases and R-rated films in that format in several markets. It was the No. 1 film in all markets where it was released over the weekend, except Poland and Malaysia where it was No. 2 behind local films \"Planet Single\" and \"The Mermaid\", respectively. The film broke the record for biggest opening weekend in Russia and Thailand, and set records for biggest R-rated film and February opening weekends in several other markets. It remained No. 1 for the international box office in its second weekend, making an additional $84.7 million from 77 markets. The film made No. 1 debuts in 17 new countries, including Korea, Spain, and Italy, and maintained its No. 1 position in countries like the UK, Germany, and Brazil. Its South East Asia performance was compared favorably to bigger superhero films like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"\" (both 2014). \"Deadpool\" was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend, before falling to No. 3 behind \"Ip Man 3\" and \"Zootopia\" in its fourth. \"Deadpool\" opened in its final market, Japan, in June, and was the No. 1 film there, with a $6.5 million opening weekend.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 317 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting \"Deadpool\" subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining—and decidedly non-family-friendly—results.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. PostTrak reported an average positive score of 97%, with 45% of filmgoers saying the film exceeded their expectations.\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" scored \"Deadpool\" three-and-a-half out of four, calling it a \"voraciously self-aware comedy\" and the first R-rated Marvel film \"with real teeth\". He praised the film's attitude and tone, Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character and the film's action scenes. \"TheWrap\"s Alonso Duralde said \"Deadpool\" \"shouldn't work, but it absolutely does\", feeling that it successfully balanced comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence. Calvin Wilson at the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" also gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, saying it was \"smart, sexy, and outrageous\", but that it would not work without Reynolds. \"The Guardian\"s Peter Bradshaw gave the film four out of five calling it \"neurotic and needy—and very entertaining\", comparing it to \"Kick-Ass\" (2010) and \"Kill Bill\" (2003). He did feel the film's villains were underused. Writing for Uproxx, Drew McWeeny described it as \"the world's most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon\", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast. \"Variety\"s Justin Chang said the film is \"terribly arch and juvenile [but] also startlingly effective\", praising Reynolds's performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying \"out of the way of his script and his star\". Todd McCarthy at \"The Hollywood Reporter\" felt the film took a while to get going, \"but once it does, \"Deadpool\" drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos\".\n\n\"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers said the film \"goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness\", but the \"junky feel is part of its charm\". He praised the cast, particularly Reynolds as well as Tim Miller's action sequences. At \"The Boston Globe\", Tom Russo gave the film three stars. He criticized the \"featherweight\" plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was \"born to play\" Deadpool. Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for \"Entertainment Weekly\", saying it \"doesn't have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story\" but makes up for that with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film and is \"a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously\". Tasha Robinson at \"The Verge\" felt there was too much juvenile humor. She noted the film was did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material. David Edelstein of \"Vulture\" said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains and noted the \"gratifyingly twisty\" structure. Manohla Dargis at \"The New York Times\" was not impressed with the listing of the film's genre cliches in the opening credits before they were used. She highlighted the \"human\" elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did \"more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again\". IndieWires Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B-', praising its style, and Reynolds's Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on \"numbing\" violence and un-original swearing and nudity.\n\nWriting for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Kenneth Turan said that \"Deadpool\" \"gets off to a fun start\" but the character \"eventually wears out his welcome\". He noted that though the film has a complicated narrative, it is masking a conventional Marvel origin story. Turan did highlight the film's romantic element and Baccarin's performance. Jonathon Pile of \"Empire\" gave the film three out of five, saying the number of jokes \"will soon numb you to their impact\" He called the film a fun alternative to other superhero films. Robbie Collin at \"The Daily Telegraph\" also gave the film three out of five, saying it is not \"the future of superhero movies\" calling it \"an enjoyably obnoxious detour\". He felt some of the film's jokes about superhero cliches were out of date by the time the film was released. \"The San Francisco Chronicle\"s Mick LaSalle did not appreciate the humor, fourth wall breaking, or violence. He concluded the film is \"bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it's just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema's future\".\n\n\"Deadpool\" has received many awards and nominations, recognizing the film as a whole, as well as: the cast's performance, particularly Reynolds as Deadpool; several technical areas, including the film's makeup, sound, and visual effects; and the film's unconventional marketing campaign. It was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, four Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two), a Directors Guild of America Award, five Empire Awards, seven Golden Trailer Awards (winning two), a Hugo Award, two Key Art Awards for marketing (winning both), eight MTV Movie Awards (winning two), a Producers Guild of America Award, four People's Choice Awards (winning two), three Saturn Awards (winning one), six Teen Choice Awards (winning two) and a Writers Guild of America Award.\n\nAfter being nominated for awards such as the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, \"Deadpool\" was considered a serious contender by commentators for several Academy Awards, despite its content and tone. This included potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and after its Producers Guild of America nomination, Best Picture. When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been \"snubbed\". Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that while the film \"earned a solid thumbs up from most\", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any \"depth or related subversion of its genre\". He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters' have against superhero films; the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who did not seem to be expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the number of other films in contention, as \"2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies\". A variant cover for Marvel Comics' \"X-Men Gold\" #1, with art by Ron Lim and released in April 2017, references \"Deadpool\"s Oscar snub.\n\nBefore \"Deadpool\"s success, R-rated, comic-based films considered successful were \"300\" (2006) and \"Watchmen\" (2009), which earned about half the opening weekend gross of successful PG-13 superhero films. \"Kick-Ass\", a film tonally similar to \"Deadpool\", made even less with a $19.8 million opening. Many reasons were given why \"Deadpool\" went on to be more successful than these, including the popularity of the Marvel brand and Reynolds's performance. Tom Huddleston, Jr. wrote for \"Fortune\" that \"Deadpool\" was proof to Hollywood that R-rated films can be as successful as PG-13 films, \"particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film is true to its source material\".\n\nA Hollywood executive, not involved with the film, felt it succeeded because it \"has a self-deprecating tone that's riotous. It's never been done before. It's poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?\" James Gunn, director of Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", rejected this saying \"Deadpool\" was a success because \"it's original, it's damn good ... and it wasn't afraid to take risks\". Gunn hoped studios would learn \"the right lesson\" from the film and not just try to make more films like \"Deadpool\". After Fox's \"Logan\" (2017) also became a success, \"Forbes\" Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was \"appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes\", but \"too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work\". Graeme McMillan of the \"The Hollywood Reporter\" concurred, adding, \"Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?\"\n\nIn March 2017, a Warner Bros. executive said that an R-rated DC Extended Universe film could \"absolutely\" happen, while Sony Pictures began developing an R-rated adaptation of the character Venom with a smaller budget, inspired by Fox's success with \"Deadpool\" and \"Logan\". In June, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said in response to the successes that, though that company was not planning any R-rated films for its Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"it's not out of the question\". After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Marvel films like \"Deadpool\", potentially under a \"Marvel-R\" brand, \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\".\n\nBefore \"Deadpool\"s release, Fox green-lit a sequel with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay. The involvement of Reynolds and Tim Miller was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon in April, but at the end of October, Miller left the film over \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds. The next month, David Leitch signed on to replace Miller for the sequel. Leitch first made a short film, \"No Good Deed\", which was written by Reese and Wernick and played in front of \"Logan\". \"Deadpool 2\" was released on May 18, 2018, with Baccarin, T. J. Miller, Uggams, Hildebrand, and Kapičić all returning. Josh Brolin joined them as Cable. The film explores the team X-Force, which includes Deadpool and Cable. In March 2017, Reese said that a future film focused on that group would be separate from \"Deadpool 3\", \"so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [\"X-Force\"] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [\"Deadpool 3\" is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small.\" After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney.\n\n"}

The principal advantage to the borrower is that it immediately releases him/her from most or all of the personal indebtedness associated with the defaulted loan. The borrower also avoids the public notoriety of a foreclosure proceeding and may receive more generous terms than he/she would in a formal foreclosure. Another benefit to the borrower is that it hurts his/her credit less than a foreclosure does. Advantages to a lender include a reduction in the time and cost of a repossession, lower risk of borrower revenge (metal theft and vandalism of the property before sheriff eviction), and additional advantages if the borrower subsequently files for bankruptcy.\n\nIf there are any junior liens a deed in lieu is a less attractive option for the lender. The lender will likely not want to assume the liability of the junior liens from the property owner, and accordingly, the lender will prefer to foreclose in order to clean the title.\n\nIn order to be considered a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the indebtedness must be secured by the real estate being transferred. Both sides must enter into the transaction \"voluntarily\" and in \"good faith\". The settlement agreement must have total consideration that is at least equal to the fair market value of the property being conveyed. Sometimes, the lender will not proceed with a deed in lieu of foreclosure if the outstanding indebtedness of the borrower exceeds the current fair value of the property; in other cases, a lender will agree since it will likely end up with the property anyway through the costly foreclosure process.\n\nBecause of the requirement that the instrument be voluntary, lenders will often not act upon a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless they receive a written offer of such a conveyance from the borrower that specifically states that the offer to enter into negotiations is being made voluntarily. This will enact the parol evidence rule and protect the lender from a possible subsequent claim that the lender acted in bad faith or pressured the borrower into the settlement. Both sides may then proceed with settlement negotiation.\nThe Home Equity Theft Prevention Act in New York has created some confusion regarding this frequently-used method of settlement. It is unclear whether HETPA applies to deeds in lieu of foreclosure since there is no clear exclusion as there is for a referee's deed, for example. The 2-year right of rescission is not a risk that banks or title insurers are comfortable with, especially given the complexities of compliance, so many banks and title insurers in New York are not willing to work with deeds in lieu.\n\n\n"}

The importance of the operation lies in its historical significance as the first large-scale copper mining and smelting operation in the British Islands which was well-documented. New smelting techniques were introduced which were allowed the treatment of argentiferous copper sulphide ores and the more complex lead-copper-silver ores from Caldbeck.\n\nMining started at Caldbeck in June 1566 but was soon discontinued and was not resumed until 1568, when work continued under the supervision of the Hochstetter family until around 1630, and then was not resumed until around 1695.

Formerly, HBMS (for His or Her Britannic Majesty's Ship) was also used.\n\nSubmarines in Her Majesty's service also use the prefix \"HMS\", standing for \"Her Majesty's Submarine\". The Royal Yacht \"Britannia\", which was a commissioned ship in the Royal Navy, was known as HMY \"Britannia\".

{"id": "9004976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9004976", "title": "History of the Encyclopædia Britannica", "text": "History of the Encyclopædia Britannica\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" has been published continuously since 1768, appearing in fifteen official editions. Several editions have been amended with multi-volume \"supplements\" (3rd, 5th/6th), consisted of previous editions with added supplements (10th, and 12th/13th) or undergone drastic re-organizations (15th). In recent years, digital versions of the \"Britannica\" have been developed, both online and on optical media. Since the early 1930s, the \"Britannica\" has developed several \"spin-off\" products to leverage its reputation as a reliable reference work and educational tool.\n\nEncyclopedias of various types had been published since antiquity, beginning with the collected works of Aristotle and the \"Natural History\" of Pliny the Elder, the latter having 2493 articles in 37 books. Encyclopedias were published in Europe and China throughout the Middle Ages, such as the \"Satyricon\" of Martianus Minneus Felix Capella (early 5th century), the \"Speculum majus\" (\"Great Mirror\") of Vincent of Beauvais (1250), and \"Encyclopedia septem tomis distincta\" (\"A Seven-Part Encyclopedia\") by Johann Heinrich Alsted (1630). Most early encyclopedias did not include biographies of living people and were written in Latin, although some encyclopedias were translated into English, such as \"De proprietatibus rerum (On the properties of things)\" (1240) by Bartholomeus Anglicus. However, English-composed encyclopedias appeared in the 18th century, beginning with \"Lexicon technicum, or A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" by John Harris (two volumes, published 1704 and 1710, respectively), which contained articles by such contributors as Isaac Newton. Ephraim Chambers wrote a very popular two-volume \"Cyclopedia\" in 1728, which went through multiple editions and awakened publishers to the enormous profit potential of encyclopedias. Although not all encyclopedias succeeded commercially, their elements sometimes inspired future encyclopedias; for example, the failed two-volume \"A Universal History of Arts and Sciences\" of Dennis de Coetlogon (published 1745) grouped its topics into long self-contained treatises, an organization that likely inspired the \"new plan\" of the \"Britannica\". The first encyclopedia to include biographies of living people was the 64-volume \"Grosses Universal-Lexicon\" (published 1732–1759) of Johann Heinrich Zedler, who argued that death alone should not render people notable.\n\nThe \"Britannica\" was the idea of Colin Macfarquhar, a bookseller and printer, and Andrew Bell, an engraver, both of Edinburgh. They conceived of the \"Britannica\" as a conservative reaction to the French \"Encyclopédie\" of Denis Diderot (published 1751–1766), which was widely viewed as heretical. Ironically, the \"Encyclopédie\" had begun as a French translation of the popular English encyclopedia, \"Cyclopaedia\" published by Ephraim Chambers in 1728. Although later editions of Chambers' \"Cyclopaedia\" were still popular, and despite the commercial failure of other English encyclopedias, Macfarquhar and Bell were inspired by the intellectual ferment of the Scottish Enlightenment and thought the time ripe for a new encyclopedia \"compiled upon a new plan\".\n\nNeeding an editor, the two chose a 28-year-old scholar named William Smellie who was offered 200 pounds sterling to produce the encyclopedia in 100 parts (called \"numbers\" and equivalent to thick pamphlets), which were later bound into three volumes. The first number appeared on 6 December 1768 in Edinburgh, priced sixpence or 8 pence on finer paper. The \"Britannica\" was published under the pseudonym \"A Society of Gentlemen in Scotland\", possibly referring to the many gentlemen who had bought subscriptions. By releasing the numbers in weekly instalments, the \"Britannica\" was completed in 1771, having 2,391 pages. The numbers were bound in three equally sized volumes covering A–B, C–L, and M–Z; an estimated 3,000 sets were eventually sold, priced at 12 pounds sterling apiece.\nThe 1st edition also featured 160 copperplate illustrations engraved by Bell. Three of the engravings in the section on midwifery, depicting childbirth in clinical detail, were sufficiently shocking to prompt some readers to tear those engravings out of the volume.\n\nThe key idea that set the \"Britannica\" apart was to group related topics together into longer essays, that were then organized alphabetically. Previous English encyclopedias had generally listed related terms separately in their alphabetical order, rather like a modern technical dictionary, an approach that the \"Britannica's\"' management derided as \"dismembering the sciences\". Although anticipated by Dennis de Coetlogon, the idea for this \"new plan\" is generally ascribed to Colin Macfarquhar, although William Smellie claimed it as his own invention.\n\nSmellie wrote most of the first edition, borrowing liberally from the authors of his era, including Voltaire, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson. He later said:\n\nThe vivid prose and easy navigation of the first edition led to strong demand for a second. Although this edition has been faulted for its imperfect scholarship, Smellie argued that the \"Britannica\" should be given the benefit of the doubt:\n\nSmellie strove to make \"Britannica\" as usable as possible, saying that \"utility ought to be the principal intention of every publication. Wherever this intention does not plainly appear, neither the books nor their authors have the smallest claim to the approbation of mankind\".\n\nThe first edition was reprinted in London, with slight variants on the title page and a different preface, by Edward and Charles Dilly in 1773 and by John Donaldson in 1775. On the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the 1st edition, Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. published a facsimile of the 1st edition, even including \"age spots\" on the paper. This has been periodically reprinted and is still part of Britannica's product line.\n\nAfter the success of the first edition, a more ambitious second edition was begun in 1776, with the addition of history and biography articles. Smellie declined to be editor, principally because he objected to the addition of biography. Macfarquhar took over the role himself, aided by pharmacist James Tytler, M.A., who was known as an able writer and willing to work for a very low wage. Macfarquhar and Bell rescued Tytler from the debtors' sanctuary at Holyrood Palace, and employed him for seven years at 17 shillings per week. Tytler wrote many science and history articles and almost all of the minor articles; by Robert Burns' estimate, Tytler wrote over three-quarters of the second edition. Compared to the 1st edition, the second had five times as many long articles (150), including \"Scotland\" (84 pages), \"Optics\" (132 pages), and \"Medicine\" (309 pages), which had their own indices. The second edition was published in 181 numbers from 21 June 1777 to 18 September 1784; these numbers were bound into ten volumes dated 1778–1783, having 8,595 pages and 340 plates again engraved by Andrew Bell. A pagination error caused page 8000 to follow page 7099. Most of the maps of this edition (eighteen of them) are found in a single 195-page article, \"Geography\".\n\nThe second edition improved greatly upon the 1st, but is still notable for the large amount of now-archaic information it contained. For example, \"Chemistry\" goes into great detail on an obsolete system of what would now be called alchemy, in which earth, air, water and fire are named elements containing various amounts of phlogiston. Tytler also describes the architecture of Noah's Ark in detail (illustrated with a copperplate engraving) and, following Bishop Ussher, includes a remarkably precise chronology for the Earth, beginning with its creation on 23 October 4004 B.C. and noting that the Great Flood of 2348 B.C. lasted for exactly 777 days. The 2nd edition also reports a cure for tuberculosis:\n\nand a somewhat melancholy article on \"Love\" that persisted in the \"Britannica\" for nearly a century (until its 9th edition):\n\nLike the first edition, the second was sold in sections by subscription at the printing shop of Colin MacFarquhar. When finished in 1784, complete sets were sold at Charles Elliot's book shop in Edinburgh for 10 pounds, unbound. Over 1,500 copies of the second edition were sold this way by Elliot in less than one year, making the second edition enough of a financial success that a more ambitious third edition was begun a few years later.\n\nThe long period of time during which this edition was written makes the later volumes more updated than the earlier ones. Volume 10, published in 1783 after the Revolutionary War was over, gives in the entry for Virginia: \"Virginia, late one of the British colonies, now one of the United States of North America...\" but the entry in Volume 2 for Boston, published in 1778, states, \"Boston, the capital of New England in North America, ...The following is a description of this capital before the commencement of the present American war.\"\n\nThe causes of the Revolution are outlined concisely by Tytler in the article \"Colonies\" thus:\n\nA 204-page appendix, written in 1784, is found at the end of Vol. 10. It does not have its own title page, but merely follows with pagination continuing from 8996 to 9200. The appendix introduces articles on Entomology, Ichthyology, Weather, Hindus (spelled Gentoos), and others, and contains many new biographies, including one of Captain James Cook. It curiously contains 25 new pages on Air, which give very little new information about air itself, but mainly cover hot air ballooning, one of Tytler's hobbies. The first page of the supplement begins with the words \"Appendix containing articles omitted and others further explained or improved, together with corrections of errors and of wrong references.\" The appendix also includes 10 plates, namely CCCXIV to CCCXXIII.\n\nThe third edition was published from 1788 to 1797 in 300 weekly numbers (1 shilling apiece); these numbers were collected and sold unbound in 30 parts (10 shilling, sixpence each), and finally in 1797 they were bound in 18 volumes with 14,579 pages and 542 plates, and given title pages dated 1797 for all volumes. Macfarquhar again edited this edition up to \"Mysteries\" but died in 1793 (aged 48) of \"mental exhaustion\"; his work was taken over by George Gleig, later Bishop Gleig of Brechin (consecrated 30 October 1808). James Tytler again contributed heavily to the authorship, up to the letter M. Andrew Bell, Macfarquhar's partner, bought the rights to the \"Britannica\" from Macfarquhar's heirs.\n\nNearly doubling the scope of the 2nd edition, Macfarquhar's encyclopedic vision was finally realized. Recruited by Gleig, several illustrious authorities contributed to this edition, such as Dr. Thomas Thomson, who introduced modern chemical nomenclature in a chart appended to the Chemistry article, and would go on to re-write that article in the 1801 supplement (see below), and John Robison, Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who wrote several well-regarded articles on sciences then called natural philosophy. The third edition established the foundation of the \"Britannica\" as an important and definitive reference work for much of the next century. This edition was also enormously profitable, yielding 42,000 pounds sterling profit on the sale of roughly 10,000 copies. The 3rd edition began the tradition (continued to this day) of dedicating the \"Britannica\" to the reigning British monarch, then King George III; calling him \"the Father of Your People, and enlightened Patron of Arts, Sciences and Literature\", Gleig wished\n\nThe 3rd edition is also famous for its bold article on \"Motion\", which erroneously rejects Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation. Instead, Dr. Gleig, or more likely, James Tytler, wrote that gravity is caused by the classical element of fire. He seems to have been swayed by William Jones' \"Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy\" (1762), which in turn was based on John Hutchinson's MA thesis, \"Moses' Principia\", which was written in 1724 but rejected by Oxford University. Nevertheless, Gleig was sanguine about the errors of the 3rd edition, echoing William Smellie's sentiment in the 1st edition quoted above:\n\nThe first \"American\" encyclopedia, \"Dobson's Encyclopædia\", was based almost entirely on the 3rd edition of the \"Britannica\" and published at nearly the same time (1788–1798), together with an analogous supplement (1803), by the Scottish-born printer, Thomas Dobson. The first United States copyright law was passed on 30 May 1790—although anticipated by Section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution (ratified 4 March 1789)—but did not protect foreign publications such as the \"Britannica\". Unauthorized copying of the \"Britannica\" in America was also a problem with the 9th edition (1889). Unlicensed copies were also sold in Dublin by James Moore under the title, \"Moore's Dublin Edition, Encyclopædia Britannica\"; this was an exact reproduction of the \"Britannica\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 3rd edition. By contrast, Dobson's work had various corrections and amendments for American readers.\n\nA two-volume supplement to the third edition was published in 1801, having 1,624 pages and 50 copperplates by D. Lizars. A revised edition was published in 1803. This supplement was published by a wine-merchant, Thomas Bonar, the son-in-law of the \"Britannica's\" owner Andrew Bell; unfortunately, the two men quarreled and they never spoke for the last ten years of Bell's life (1799–1809). Bonar was friendly to the article authors, however, and conceived the plan of paying them as well as the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.\n\nThe \"Britannica\" explicitly positioned itself as a conservative publication in reaction to the radical French \"Encyclopédie\" of Diderot published between 1751 and 1766. In the royal dedication penned on 10 December 1800, Dr. Gleig elaborated on the editorial purpose of the \"Britannica\"\n\nThe fourth edition was begun in 1800 and completed in 1810, comprising 20 volumes with 16,033 pages and 581 plates engraved by Andrew Bell. As with the 3rd edition, in which title pages were not printed until the set was complete, and all volumes were given title pages dated 1797, title pages for the 4th edition were sent to bookbinders in 1810, dated that year for all volumes. The editor was Dr. James Millar, a physician, who was good at scientific topics but criticized for being \"slow & dilatory & not well qualified\". The mathematical articles of Prof. Wallace were widely praised in the 4th edition. Overall, the 4th edition was a mild expansion of the 3rd, from 18 to 20 volumes, and was updated in its historical, scientific, and biographical articles.\n\nSome of the long articles were entirely re-written for the 4th edition. For example, the 56-page \"Botany\" of the 3rd edition was replaced in the 4th with a 270-page version by moving all the individual plant articles into one. Conversely, the 53-page \"Metallurgy\" of the 3rd was removed, and replaced by the note \"see Gilding, Parting, Purifying, Refining, Smithery.\" The article \"Chemistry,\" which was 261 pages long in the 3rd, written by James Tytler, and had been re-written in that edition's supplement as a 191-page treatise by Thomas Thomson, appears in the 4th edition as an entirely new 358-page article, which, according to the preface to the 5th edition, was authored by Millar himself. The new treatise was necessary because the copyright to the supplement to the 3rd, which included Thomson's excellent treatise, was not owned by Britannica. (Thomson would much later author the article for the 7th edition). The article \"Electricity\", 125 pages in the 3rd edition, was completely re-written for the 4th edition and was 163 pages. By contrast, the 125-page \"Metaphysics\" of the 3rd was largely unchanged for the 4th, and the 306-page \"Medicine\" of the 3rd was only superficially edited in the 4th and of roughly equal length. (Medicine had been a similar 302 pages in the 2nd edition). The 79-page \"Agriculture\" of the 3rd was entirely and excellently re-written, and is 225 pages, for the 4th edition. Sixty pages of new information were added onto the end of \"America,\" which grew to 138 pages, with an index and new maps. \"Entomology\" was expanded from 8 pages and one plate in the 3rd edition to 98 pages and 4 plates in the 4th, with a 3-page index. Human \"Physiology\" was entirely re-written, and went from 60 pages to 80, with an index. \"Physics,\" on the other hand, is unchanged from the 3rd.\n\nIn addition, some long articles appear for the first time in the 4th edition. \"Geology\" is new, even though the word had been coined in 1735. Accordingly, the 3rd edition's 30-page entry \"Earth,\" as well as its 24-page article \"Earthquake,\" and the geological sections of its article \"Natural History\", were dropped, as these topics are found in the 4th edition's newly written article, which is 78 pages long and has its own index. For other examples, the 4th edition has a 96-page article \"Conchology\", which listing does not appear in the 3rd or its supplement, and \"Erpetology\", 60 pages long in the 4th edition, with a 3-page index, is a new listing as well. After \"Science\" is a new 24-page article \"Amusements In Science\", which is a virtual Mr. Wizard for the opening of the 19th century.\n\nThe majority of copy in the 4th edition, however, is unchanged from the 3rd. Large blocks of text were carried over, line-by-line, unchanged in their typesetting, with some minor editing here and there. For example, the \"Boston\" article in the 3rd edition contains the sentence, \"The following is a description of this capital before the commencement of the present American war.\" This line is exactly as it had appeared in the 2nd edition, which was written during the war. (The war had been over for years when the 3rd edition was published). In the 4th edition, the word \"present\" was replaced with \"late,\" the rest of the article remaining entirely unchanged.\n\nThe copyright of the material in the supplement to the 3rd edition was held by Thomas Bonar, who asked 20,000 pounds sterling for it, which Bell declined. The supplemental material was licensed for the fourth edition for 100 pounds, but this copyright issue remained a problem through the 6th edition and the material was not used. The supplements had to be purchased separately.\n\nAndrew Bell died in 1809, one year before the 4th edition was finished. In 1815, his heirs began producing the fifth edition but sold it to Archibald Constable, who finished it; Dr. Millar was again the editor. Completed in 1817, the fifth edition sold for 36 pounds sterling (\"2011: £\") and consisted of 20 volumes with 16,017 pages and 582 plates. In 1816, Bell's trustees sold the rights to the \"Britannica\" for 14,000 pounds to Archibald Constable, an apprentice bookseller, who had been involved in its publication from 1788. To secure the copyrights for the 3rd edition supplement, Constable gave Bonar a one-third stake in the \"Britannica\"; after Bonar's death in 1814, Constable bought his rights to the \"Britannica\" for 4,500 pounds sterling.\n\nBeing a reprint of the 4th, set in the same type, Encyclopædia Britannica's 5th edition was one of the last publications in the English language to use the long s in print. The long s started being phased out of English publications shortly after the turn of the 19th century, and by 1817 it was archaic. The Supplement To The Fifth edition, (see below), as well as the 6th edition, used a modern font with a short s.\n\nWhile the 6th volume of the 5th edition was being printed, Constable became owner of Britannica, as well as Bonar's 3rd edition supplements. Legal disputes over the copyright of the 3rd edition supplements continued, however, and for this reason a new supplement was written by Constable's company, which was completed in 1824.\n\nAfter securing sole-ownership rights in December 1816, Constable began work on a supplement to the 5th edition, even before the fifth edition had been released (1817). The supplement was completed in April 1824, consisting of 6 volumes with 4933 pages, 125 plates, 9 maps, 3 \"dissertations\" and 160 biographies, mainly of people who had died within the preceding 30 years.\n\nThis supplement contained a rudimentary form of an index, listing the 669 articles in alphabetical order at the end of volume six, by volume but not page number, but it did not contain any sort of cross referencing. The index was called \"Table of the Articles and Treatises Contained in This Work\" and was 9 pages long. It was nothing to be compared to a typical encyclopedia index, such as the ones found at the end of the seventh and further editions of Britannica.\n\nThis supplement had remarkably illustrious contributors. Constable was friends with Sir Walter Scott, who contributed the \"Chivalry\" article. To edit the supplement, Constable hired Macvey Napier, who recruited other eminent contributors such as Sir Humphry Davy, Jean-Baptiste Biot, John Stuart Mill, William Hazlitt, David Ricardo, and Thomas Malthus. Peter Mark Roget, compiler of the famous Roget's Thesaurus and a former secretary of the Royal Society, contributed the entry for physiology. Thomas Young's article on Egypt included the translation of the hieroglyphics on the Rosetta Stone.\n\nThe supplement was compiled, for the first five volumes, at a pace which would have given it more than the 6 volumes it eventually would consist of; the alphabet from A-M was put into those five. It was apparently rushed to completion with volume 6, which contained the rest of the alphabet, viz:\n\n\nConstable also produced the sixth edition, which was completed in May, 1823. It was published in 40 half-volume parts, priced 16 shillings in boards (32 pounds for the set). The editor was Charles Maclaren. The 6th edition was a reprint of the 5th with a modern typeface. It even used the preface to the 5th edition, dated December 1, 1817, as its own. Only the short page, \"Advertisement To The Sixth Edition\", which was bound in volume 1 after the forward and dated January, 1822, set it apart. In that advertisement, it is claimed that some geographical articles would be updated, and that the articles in the supplement to the 3rd edition would be inserted into the encyclopedia in their proper alphabetical places. Although the advertisement claimed that these articles would be included in this manner, they were not, and the author of the preface to the 7th edition states that none of this material entered the main body until that edition, and even gives a list of the articles which were.\n\nAlmost no changes were made to the text, it was basically a remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are virtually the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the long s, which had gone out of style, from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.\n\nThe Supplement to the 5th edition was finished in 1824, and was sold with those sets, as well as with sets of the 6th edition, to be delivered at its completion. This supplement curiously was started during the production of the 5th edition but was not finished until after the 6th was completed. It also was sold as a unit for owners of the 4th edition, and became known as \"Supplement to the 4th, 5th and 6th edition.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Constable went bankrupt on 19 January 1826 and the rights to the \"Britannica\" were sold on auction; they were eventually bought on 16 July 1828 for 6150 pounds sterling by a partnership of four men: Adam Black (a publisher), Alexander Wight (a banker), Abram Thomson (a bookbinder) and Thomas Allen, the proprietor of the \"Caledonian Mercury\". Not long after, Black bought out his partners and ownership of the \"Britannica\" passed to the Edinburgh publishing firm of A & C Black.\n\nBritannica by the 6th edition was in some regards hopelessly out of date. The supplement to the 3rd edition contained updates which were not included in it, and which had become dated themselves anyway, the 4th edition expanded the text somewhat but revised very little, and the 5th and 6th were just reprints of the 4th. The supplement to the 4th/5th/6th edition addressed the issue of updates in a clumsy way, often referring back to the encyclopedia, essentially making the reader look everything up twice. What was needed was a completely new edition from the ground up. This was to be accomplished with the magnificent 7th edition.\n\nThe 7th edition was begun in 1827 and published from March 1830 to January 1842, although all volumes have title pages dated 1842. It was a new work, not a revision of earlier editions, although some articles from earlier editions and supplements are used. It was sold to subscribers in monthly \"parts\" of around 133 pages each, at 6 shilling per part, with 6 parts combined into 800 page volumes for 36 shillings. The promise was made in the beginning that there would be 20 volumes, making the total £36 for the set. Volume 1 was only 5 parts, entirely made up of dissertations. Volume 2, in 6 parts, was the beginning of alphabetical listings. The 12th part, another dissertation, was ready in 1831, and would have been the first part of volume 3, but the publishers put it into a separate volume at 12 shillings. In total the subscribers wound up paying for 127 parts (£38, two shillings).\n\nIt was edited by Macvey Napier, who was assisted by James Browne, LLD. It consisted of 21 numbered volumes with 17,101 pages and 506 plates. It was the first edition to include a general index for all articles, a practice that was maintained until 1974. The index was 187 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered thin volume, or was bound together with volume I. Many illustrious contributors were recruited to this edition, including Sir David Brewster, Thomas de Quincey, Antonio Panizzi and Robert Stephenson. James Wilson did all of Zoology, Dr. Hampden did all of Greek philosophy, and William Hosking contributed the excellent article Architecture. Thomas Thomson, who wrote Chemistry for the 3rd edition supplement 40 years earlier, was recruited to write that article again for the 7th edition. Mathematical diagrams and illustrations were made from woodcuts, and for the first time in Britannica's history, were printed on the same pages as the text, in addition to the copperplates.\n\nThe 7th edition, when complete, went on sale for £24 per set. However, Adam Black had invested over £108,766 in its production: £5,354 for advertising, £8,755 for editing, £13,887 for 167 contributors, £13,159 for plates, £29,279 for paper, and £19,813 for the printing. In the end, roughly 5,000 sets were sold but Black considered himself well-rewarded in intellectual prestige.\n\nTitle pages for all volumes were printed in 1842 and delivered with the completed set. An index to the entire set was created that year as well, and was the first of its kind for Britannica. Being only 187 pages long, it did not warrant its own volume, and was sent to bookbinders with instructions to include it at the beginning of volume 1, the dissertations volume, which had been printed in 1829. This same arrangement would also be used for the 8th edition, but not the 9th.\n\nThe 8th edition was published from 1853 to 1860, with title pages for each volume dated the year that volume was printed. It contained 21 numbered volumes, with 17,957 pages and 402 plates. The index, published in 1861, was 239 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered 22nd volume, or was bound together with volume I, the dissertations volume. Four of these dissertations were carried over from the 7th edition, and two were new to the 8th. The five included in volume 1 of the 8th (1853) were authored by Dugald Stewart, James Mackintosh, Richard Whately, John Playfair, and John Leslie, in that order, with the Whately work being a new one. A sixth dissertation, by J.D. Forbes, was issued in 1856, in a separate quarto volume, \"gratis, along with Vol. XII\".\n\nThe alphabetical encyclopedia began at the beginning of volume 2. The price was reduced to 24 shillings per volume, cloth-bound. In addition to the Edinburgh sets, more sets were authorized by Britannica to the London publishers Simpkin, Marshall and Company, and to Little, Brown and Company of Boston.\n\nSince Macvey Napier died in 1847, Adam Black selected for its editor Dr. Thomas Stewart Traill, a professor of medical jurisprudence at Edinburgh University. When Dr. Traill fell ill, he was assisted by a young Scottish philosopher, John Downes. Black was able to hold costs to roughly £75,655. This edition began the tradition of a contributors' banquet to celebrate the edition's completion (5 June 1861).\n\nThe Eighth edition is a thorough revision, even more so than the Seventh. Some long articles were carried over from the 7th edition, but most were completely re-written, and new articles by illustrious contributors were added. In all, there were 344 contributors, including Lord Macaulay, Charles Kingsley, Robert Chambers, the Rev. Charles Merivale, Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker, Baron Robert Bunsen, Sir John Herschel, Professors Richard Owen, John Stuart Blackie and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). Photography is listed for the first time. This edition also featured the first American contributor to the \"Britannica\", Edward Everett, who wrote a 40,000-word hagiographic biography of George Washington\n\nThe consequences of reducing the costs of production of the 8th edition can be seen today in surviving sets. With only 402 plates, this edition has the fewest since the second edition, and far fewer woodcuts within the text pages were used than in the 7th edition. The maps are all reprinted from the 7th edition, even the ones that should have been updated. In the first few volumes, a sheet of onion-skin paper faces each plate, but after volume 6, they were eliminated. To save money, the end pages and covers were not marbled, as this was an expensive process. Finally, the end pages contain advertisements for other products sold by A & C. Black, such as atlases and travel guides, and advertisements encouraging subscribers to continue their enrollments.\n\nThe landmark ninth edition, often called \"the Scholar's Edition\", was published from January 1875 to 1889 in 25 volumes, with volume 25 the index volume. Unlike the first two Black editions, there were no preliminary dissertations, the alphabetical listing beginning in volume 1. Up to 1880, the editor, and author of the Foreword, was Thomas Spencer Baynes—the first English-born editor after a series of Scots—and W. Robertson Smith afterwards. An intellectual prodigy who mastered advanced scientific and mathematical topics, Smith was a professor of theology at the Free Church College in Edinburgh, and was the first contributor to the \"Britannica\" who addressed the historical interpretation of the Bible, a topic then already familiar on the Continent of Europe. Dr. Smith contributed several articles to the 9th edition, but lost his teaching position on 24 May 1881, due to the controversy his (ir)religious articles aroused; he was immediately hired to be joint editor-in-chief with Baynes.\n\nThe 9th and 11th editions are often lauded as high points for scholarship; the 9th included yet another series of illustrious contributors such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Lord Rayleigh, Algernon Charles Swinburne and William Michael Rossetti. Robert Louis Stevenson, then 25, contributed an article about Robert Burns that, being unenthusiastic, was never printed. There were roughly 1100 contributors altogether, a handful of whom were women; this edition was also the first to include a significant article about women (\"Women, Law Relating to\"). Evolution was listed for the first time, in the wake of Charles Darwin's writings, but the subject was treated as if still controversial, and a complete working of the subject would have to wait for the 11th edition. The 8th edition has no listing for the subject at all.\n\nCompared to the 8th edition, the 9th was far more luxurious, with thick boards and high-quality leather bindings, premier paper, and a production which took full advantage of the technological advances in printing in the years between the 1850s and 1870s. Great use was made of the new ability to print large graphic illustrations on the same pages as the text, as opposed to limiting illustrations to separate copperplates. Although this technology had first been used in a primitive fashion the 7th edition, and to a much lesser extent in the 8th, in the 9th edition there were thousands of quality illustrations set into the text pages, in addition to the plates. The 9th edition was a critical success, and roughly 8,500 sets were sold in Britain. A & C Black authorized the American firms of Charles Scribner's Sons of New York, Little, Brown and Company of Boston, and Samuel L. Hall of New York, to print, bind and distribute additional sets in the United States, and provided them with stereotype plates for text and graphics, specifications on the color and tanning quality of the leather bindings, etc., so the American-produced sets would be identical to the Edinburgh sets except for the title pages, and that they would be of the same high quality as the Edinburgh sets. Scribner's volumes and Hall volumes were often mixed together in sets by N.Y. distributors and sold this way as they were interchangeable, and such sets are still found this way. A total of 45,000 authorized sets were produced this way for the US market. Scribners' claimed U. S. copyright on several of the individual articles.\n\nIn spite of this, \"several hundred thousand\" cheaply produced bootlegged copies were also sold in the U.S., which still did not have copyright laws protecting foreign publications. Famous infringers of that era include the Philadelphian Joseph M. Stoddart, who employed a spy in the \"Britannica's\" own printshop, Neill and Company, in Edinburgh. The spy would steal the proofreader's copies and send them by fastest mail to the United States, allowing Stoddart to publish his version simultaneously with the \"Britannica\" and at nearly half the price ($5 versus $9 per volume). His right to do so was upheld in an infamous decision by Justice Arthur Butler who argued\n\nAnother successful infringer was Henry G. Allen, who developed a photographic reproduction method for the \"Britannica\" and charged only half as much as Stoddart ($2.50 per volume). Other people alleged to have copied the 9th edition included John Wanamaker and the Reverend Isaac Kaufmann Funk of the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia. Richard S. Pearle & Co. of Chicago photoengraved some sets in 1891, and added 3 volumes of \"American Revisions and additions,\" the first 2 in 1891 and the third in 1892. In 1893 they published sets with volumes 1–24 from the original Britannica, the 3 \"American\" volumes 25–27, and the index as Vol. 28. Some copies of this version say they were printed by Werner, also of Chicago, and from 1902 to 1907 Werner printed the commonly found \"New Werner Edition,\" of 30 volumes (24 volumes plus 5 \"New American Supplement\" volumes and a new index for all 29 volumes). In 1890, James Clarke published the \"Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica, Revised and Amended\" which was only 10 volumes, as was the 1895 Belford-Clark issue by the same name (Chicago).\n\nIn addition to American unauthorized copies, there were American supplements which were written to be appended to authorized copies of Britannica. The Hubbard Brothers of Philadelphia produced a 5-volume American supplement between 1882 and 1889, in quality leather bindings designed to match the authorized volumes in appearance. Of good scholarship, it contained biographies of Americans and geographies of US places, as well as other US interests not mentioned in the main encyclopedia.\n\nIn 1896, Scribner's Sons, which had claimed US copyright on many of the articles, obtained court orders to shut down bootlegger operations, some of whose printing plates were melted down as part of the enforcement. Publishers were able to get around this order, however, by re-writing the articles that Scribner's had copyrighted; for example, the \"United States\" article in Werner's 1902 unlicensed edition was newly written and copyrighted by R.S. Pearle.\n\nIn 1903, Saalfield Publishing published the \"Americanized\" Encyclopædia Britannica in 8 volumes with a 4 volume supplement (when the British edition had 24 volumes). The Encyclopædia Britannica Company had acquired all the rights to the encyclopedia in America. In addition, D. Appleton & Company claimed that the 4 volume supplement used material from \"Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography\". To avoid further litigation, the suit against Saalfield Publishing was settled in court \"by a stipulation in which the defendants agree not to print or sell any further copies of the offending work, to destroy all printed sheets, to destroy or melt the portions of the plates from which the infringing matter in the Supplement as it appears in the \"Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica\" has been printed, and to pay D. Appleton & Co. the sum of $2000 damages.\"\n\nHorace Everett Hooper was an American businessman, and a close associate of James Clarke, one of the leading American bootleggers. Hooper recognized the potential profit in the \"Britannica\" and, again in 1896, learned that both the \"Britannica\" and \"The Times\" of London were in financial straits. Hooper formed a partnership with Clarke, his brother George Clarke, and Walter Montgomery Jackson to sell the \"Britannica\" under the sponsorship of \"The Times\", meaning that \"The Times\" would advertise the sale and lend its respectable name. Hooper and his energetic advertising manager, Henry Haxton, introduced many innovative sales methods: full-page advertisements in \"The Times\", testimonials from celebrities, buying on installment plans, and a long series of so-called 'final offers'. Although the crass marketing was criticized as inappropriate to the \"Britannica's\" history and scholarship, the unprecedented profits delighted the manager of \"The Times\", Charles Frederic Moberly Bell, who assessed Hooper as \"a ranker who loved to be accepted as a gentleman. Treat him as a gentleman and one had no trouble with him; treat him as an essentially dishonest ranker and one got all the trouble there was to get.\" The American partnership sold over 20,000 copies of the \"Britannica\" in the United States (four runs of 5000), after which Hooper and Jackson bought out the two Clarke brothers in early 1900. A & C Black had moved to London in 1895 and, on 9 May 1901, sold all the rights to the \"Britannica\" to Hooper and Jackson, then living in London.\n\nThe sale of the \"Britannica\" to Americans has left a lingering resentment among some British citizens, especially when it is perceived that parochial American concerns are emphasized. For example, one British critic wrote on the centenary of the sale:\n\nAgain under the sponsorship of \"The Times\" of London, and with Adam & Charles Black in the UK, the new owners quickly produced an 11-volume supplement to the 9th edition; being 9 volumes of text, 25–33, a map volume, 34, which was 1 inch taller than the other volumes, and a new index, vol 35, also an inch taller than 25–33, which covered the first 33 volumes (the maps volume 34 had its own index). The editors were Hugh Chisholm, Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, Arthur T. Hadley and Franklin Henry Hooper, the brother of the owner Horace Hooper. Taken together, the 35 volumes were dubbed the \"10th edition\". The re-issue of the 9th edition under the moniker \"10th edition\" caused some outrage, since many articles of the 9th edition were over 25 years old. This led to the popular joke: \"\"The Times\" is behind the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" is behind the times.\"\n\nThe 1903 advertising campaign for the tenth edition was an onslaught of direct marketing: hand-written letters, telegrams, limited-time offers, etc.. The following quote, written in 1926, captures the mood\n\nAn excellent collection of prospectuses received by a single person (C. L. Parker) in that year has been preserved by the Bodleian Library (catalogued under #39899.c.1). The advertising was clearly targeted at middle and lower-middle-class people seeking to improve themselves. The advertising campaign was remarkably successful; over 70,000 sets were sold, bringing in over £600,000 pounds profit. When one British expert expressed surprise to Hooper that so many people would want an outdated encyclopedia, he replied, \"They didn't; I \"made\" them want it.\"\n\nEven after the Tenth edition was published, some American infringement companies were still printing thousands of copies of the Ninth without the supplements. See above. Some of these companies were adding their own \"Americanized\" supplements, but none of them reproduced the Tenth. Copyright violation did not end until shortly before the Eleventh edition came out.\n\nThe renowned eleventh edition of \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" was begun in 1903, and published in 1910–1911 in 28 volumes, with a one-volume Index. Edited by Hugh Chisholm in London and by Franklin Henry Hooper in New York, the 11th edition was the first to be published substantially at one time, instead of volume by volume. Its illustrious contributors are legion, including Baden Baden-Powell writing on kite-flying; Arthur Eddington on astronomy; Edmund Gosse on literature and Donald Tovey on music. Sometimes called the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", this edition is still highly regarded for its lucid explanations of scholarly subjects. Being in the public domain, the complete text is freely available online. The 11th edition retained the high scholarship and eminent contributors that marked the 9th edition, but tempered that scholarship with shorter, simpler articles that were more intelligible to lay-readers. Thus, the 9th and 11th editions had 17,000 and 40,000 articles, respectively, although they were roughly equivalent in size. This shift accommodated the American business strategy of popularizing the \"Britannica\" for a mass market, while still retaining its quality as a reference work. The high literary and scholarly level of the 11th edition is largely due to the zeal of its owner, Horace Everett Hooper, who held scholarship in high regard and spared no expense to make the 11th edition as excellent as possible.\n\nAfter a heated legal dispute and all-too-public corporate wrangling over ownership of the \"Britannica\" (1908–1909), Hooper bought out Walter Jackson, becoming the sole owner of the \"Britannica\". The public furor caused \"The Times\" to cancel its sponsorship contract with Hooper, feeling that the interests of the newspaper were not being served. After failing to win over Oxford University, Hooper managed to secure Cambridge University as a new sponsor; thus, the 11th edition was published initially by Cambridge University Press, and scholars from Cambridge University were allowed to review the text and veto any overly aggressive advertising. Perhaps because of this, the \"Britannica\" encountered financial difficulties, whereupon it was licensed to Sears Roebuck and Co. of Chicago, who issued a physically smaller but complete version known as the \"handy edition,\" with each volume almost pocket-sized. The owner of Sears, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, was friends with Horace Hooper and enthusiastic about the \"Britannica's\" promise; he single-handedly saved the \"Britannica\" from bankruptcy several times over the next fifteen years. Although Sears' handy set was successful in 1915–1916, sales dropped significantly when the United States entered World War I.\n\nThe 11th edition employed 35 named female contributors, out of 1500 total (2.3%). Although this was not much of an increase over the 10th edition (which named 37 female contributors out of 1800 total), it was heralded publicly as a major advance in recognizing the contributions of women in learned circles. However, the 11th edition did employ hundreds of women to write unsigned articles; some women, such as Irish medical expert Harriet Hennessy, even rose to be (uncredited) department editors.\n\nSales figures for the 11th edition were comparable to those of the 9th, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies including the unlicensed sets. Unlike the 9th, however, the 11th edition was not infringed, all sets being printed legitimately by Britannica. It can be seen that the 9th and 11th editions were massively better-sellers than previous editions. This is mainly due to the increase in population of, and sales in, the United States, which were mere colonies with low population when Britannica started out in 1768.\n\nThe poor sales of the war years brought the \"Britannica\" to the brink of bankruptcy. The CEO of Sears Roebuck, philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, was devoted to the mission of the \"Britannica\" and bought its rights on 24 February 1920 from his friend Horace Everett Hooper for $1.25 million. The \"Britannica's\" headquarters were moved to Chicago, where they have remained. In 1922, a 3-volume supplement to the eleventh edition was released that summarized the developments just before, during and after World War I; these three volumes, taken together with the eleventh edition of 1910, became known as the twelfth edition. The articles describing World War I and the political changes brought about by it took up a large portion of the supplement, but articles on such things as radio (still called wireless telephony) are informative. The editor of the supplement was Hugh Chisholm, who also had been the main editor of the eleventh edition, as well as the 1902 eleven-volume supplement to the ninth edition, known as the tenth edition. Horace Hooper died in 1922, a few weeks after the publication of the twelfth edition. This edition was a commercial failure, losing Sears roughly $1.75 million, after which Sears gave it back to Hooper's widow, Harriett Meeker Cox, and her brother, William J. Cox, who ran the company from 1923 to 1928.\n\nThe passage of a few years led to a better perspective on that era. In 1926, the \"Britannica\" released three new volumes covering the history of 1910–1926, which were intended to supplant those of the twelfth edition. Again taken together with the eleventh edition, the new volumes became known as the thirteenth edition, which maintained the \"Britannica's\" tradition of illustrious contributors: Harry Houdini, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Sigmund Freud, Henry Ford, Leon Trotsky, Ferdinand Foch, Gustav Stresemann, Thomas G. Masaryk and Elihu Root.\n\nIn 1928, Rosenwald bought back the rights to the \"Britannica\", leaving Cox as publisher. Cox argued forcefully for a new fourteenth edition, pointing out that the eleventh edition (the bulk of the twelfth and thirteenth editions) was badly out of date. Cox also tried to involve the University of Chicago in producing the \"Britannica\", even including a $1 million advance from Rosenwald as a temptation; however, the trustees of the University turned down his proposal, a choice they almost repeated a generation later under William Benton.\n\nBy 1926, the eleventh edition was beginning to show its age, and work on a new edition was begun. The editors were J. L. Garvin in London and Franklin Henry Hooper in New York. It has 24 volumes, reduced from 29 in the 11th edition, yet has 45,000 articles compared to 37,000. It has 15,000 illustrations, of which 1,500 are full plates. The 14th edition took three years to complete, at the then exorbitant cost of $2.5 million, all of it invested by Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck and Company. It was very different from the 11th edition, having fewer volumes and simpler articles, continuing the business strategy of popularizing the \"Britannica\" for the American mass market at the expense of its scholarship. The 14th edition also drew criticism for deleting information unflattering to the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless, the 14th also included many illustrious contributors, including eighteen Nobel laureates in science, such as Robert Millikan, Albert Abraham Michelson and Arthur Compton. More coverage was given to popular entertainment, with Gene Tunney writing on boxing, Lillian Gish on acting and Irene Castle on ballroom dancing. George Bernard Shaw contributed a well-regarded article on socialism. In all, there were roughly 3500 named contributors, of which roughly half were American. The 14th edition was again criticized for sexism, by a woman who wrote to editor Walter Yust that too many biographies were of men; Yust made a count and found that 6% of its 13,000 biographies were of women.\n\nThe 14th edition was published in September 1929, and had 23 volumes with a one-volume Index that also contained a complete atlas. Unfortunately, the Great Depression struck scarcely a month after the release of the 14th edition, and sales plummeted. Despite the unfailing support of the Sears Roebuck company, the \"Britannica\" almost went bankrupt over the next few years. Rosenwald died in 1932, and General Robert E. Wood took over; Cox was removed as publisher and the Secretary-Treasurer of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell was installed as the new President of the \"Britannica\".\n\nE. H. Powell identified and fixed a key vulnerability of \"Britannica\", namely, that its sales (and, hence, the company's income) fluctuated strongly over the life-cycle of an edition. After the release of a new edition, sales would generally begin strong, and decline gradually for 10–20 years as the edition began to show its age; finally, sales would drop off precipitously with the announcement that work had begun on a new edition, since few people would buy an obsolete encyclopedia that would soon be updated. These strong fluctuations in sales led to economic hardship for the \"Britannica\".\n\nTo address this problem, Powell suggested in 1933 the policy of continuous revision, with the goal of keeping the \"Britannica\" \"always timely and always salable\". The basic idea was to maintain a continuous editorial staff that would constantly revise the articles on a fixed schedule. Earlier encyclopedias did not maintain a continuous editorial staff, but rather assembled one just prior to beginning a new edition. Rather than releasing supplemental editions or volumes, new printings would be made every year with only enough copies made to cover the sales for that year. An analysis of the \"Britannica's\" articles suggested that roughly 75% required only occasional revising, whereas 25% required revision every 1–3 years. The articles were therefore divided into 30 classifications and a schedule for their revision worked out, such that every article would be checked at least twice a decade.\n\nPowell also conceived the \"Britannica's\" \"Book of the Year\", in which a single volume would be released every year covering the developments of the previous year, particularly in rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, culture and politics. The \"Book of the Year\" continues to be published even today. Powell also introduced the Library Research Service (1936), in which owners of the \"Britannica\" could write to have their personal questions researched and answered by the editorial staff.\n\nUnder Powell's leadership, the \"Britannica\" began to capitalize on its reputation by aggressively developing \"spin-offs\", such as the 12-volume \"Britannica Junior\" for children (published 1934, and revised to 15 volumes in 1947), the historical timeline \"The March of Man\" (published 1935, and edited by Albert Bushwell Hart, Isaac J. Cox and Lawrence H. Dawson), the \"Encyclopædia Britannica World Atlas\" (published 1942, and prepared by G. Donald Hudson) and \"10 Eventful Years\", a summary of the national and international events surrounding World War II (1937–1946).\n\nSears Roebuck published the \"Britannica\" until 1943. In 1941, Sears offered the rights to the \"Britannica\" as a gift to the University of Chicago. The story of this offer was recounted at the bicentennial banquet of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"\n\nThe University of Chicago declined the offer, viewing the mission of the university as not entirely consistent with a large commercial publishing house; however it continues even today to be involved in its production, offering editorial advice and allowing its name to be associated with the \"Britannica\". Thus, in 1943, the wealthy and powerful William Benton, a former U.S. senator and advertising executive, obtained exclusive control of the \"Britannica\", which he published until his death in 1973. His widow Helen Hemingway Benton continued to publish the \"Britannica\" until her own death in 1974. After their deaths, the Benton Foundation continued to manage the \"Britannica\" until it was sold to Jacqui Safra in 1996.\n\nDespite the policy of continuous revision, the 14th edition of the \"Britannica\" gradually became outdated. Beginning in the early 1960s, the failings of the 14th edition began to be collated and published by physicist Harvey Einbinder, culminating in his highly critical 390-page book, \"The Myth of the Britannica\" (1964). Goaded into action, the \"Britannica\" began to work on a new edition, the current 15th.\n\nThe 15th edition was produced over ten years at a cost of $32 million and released in 1974 in 30 volumes. The so-called \"New Encyclopædia Britannica\" (or \"Britannica 3\") had a unique three-part organization: a single \"Propædia\" (\"Primer for Education\") volume, which aimed to provide an outline of all known, indeed knowable, information; a 10-volume \"Micropædia\" (\"Small Education\") of 102,214 short articles (strictly less than 750 words); and a 19-volume \"Macropædia\" (\"Large Education\") of 4,207 longer, scholarly articles with references, similar to those of the 9th and 11th editions. The \"Micropædia\" and \"Macropædia\" articles are listed in alphabetical order; the 4,287 contributors to the \"Macropædia\" articles are identified scrupulously, but the \"Micropædia\" articles are generally anonymous and unreferenced.\n\nThis 15th edition had no general index, which had been a feature of the \"Britannica\" since its 7th edition; even in the 2nd edition, individual long articles had their own indices. The idea of Mortimer J. Adler was that the \"Propædia\" and the \"Micropædia\" could serve the role of an index. More generally, Dr. Adler felt that the \"Britannica\" should not merely serve as a reference work, but also aspire to be a categorization of \"omne scibile\" (everything knowable), to fulfill Francis Bacon's grand conception of epistemology. Thus, the \"Propædia\" was intended to be the road-map of all knowledge, within which every fact, technique, and theory could be organized. With this edition EB became the first encyclopedia that serves both functions of fact-checking and self-education.\n\nThe lack of an index and the unusual organization into \"two\" sets of alphabetically organized articles provoked much criticism. In a typical contemporary assessment, \"It is called the \"Micropædia\", for 'little knowledge,' and little knowledge is what it provides. It has proved to be grotesquely insufficient as an index, radically constricting the utility of the \"Macropædia.\"\" or, more laconically, \"This arrangement has nothing to recommend it except commercial novelty\". Most readers could not predict whether a given subject would be found in \"Micropædia\" or the \"Macropædia\"; the criteria by which the articles were sorted were not obvious even to scholars, despite Dr. Adler's claims that the sorting followed naturally from the \"Propædia's\" outline of all knowledge.\n\nIn 1985, the \"Britannica\" responded to reader requests by restoring the index as a two-volume set. The number of topics indexed by the \"Britannica\" has fluctuated from 500,000 (1985, the same as in 1954) to 400,000 (1989,1991) to 700,000 in the current 2007 print version. Presumably, this recent increase reflects the introduction of efficient electronic indexing, since the size of the encyclopedia has remained nearly constant at approximately 40 million words from 1954 to the present and far less than 40% of the encyclopedia has changed from 1985 to 2007.\n\nUnder the editorship of Philip W. Goetz, the 1985 version of the 15th edition introduced other major changes. The 4,207 articles of the first version \"Macropædia\" were combined into 674 longer articles; for example, the individual articles for each of the 50 U.S. states were merged into what became a 310-page article \"United States of America\". The \"Macropædia\" was also restricted somewhat from 19 volumes to the present 17 volumes. At the same time, the number of \"Micropædia\" volumes was increased from 10 to the present 12 volumes, although the number of articles was reduced from 102,214 to roughly 65,000. The strict 750-word limit was softened to allow articles of medium length, such as Internet, which almost fills one page. Superficially, the \"Propædia\"'s Outline of Knowledge was simplified for easier use. In reality, by breaking the intrinsic links between a topic in \"Propædia\" with its associated EB articles the intended function (or usefulness) of \"Propædia\" is hindered significantly. \n\nOn March 14, 2012, Britannica announced it would not be printing any more sets of its paper version, which accounted for less than 1 percent of its sales, and would instead focus on its DVD and on-line versions. It had not printed any new sets since 2010.\n\nBritannica Global Edition was printed in 2009. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller \"compact\" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain Macro- and Micropedia sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. It currently is out of print and sold out. The last printing was in 2011. The following is Britannica's description of the work:\n\nAfter ending publication of its print edition, which at the end supplied only 1% of the company's revenue, it hoped to transition to a CD or online version. Sales of both of these were disappointing — inability to compete with Wikipedia is mentioned — and insufficient to sustain Britannica's editorial enterprise. The editorial and information-gathering side has been shut down, and sales of the CD ended with the 2012 \"Ultimate Edition\". Is is no longer being produced or sold by Britannica, and its Web site now focuses on material for children, which was much more profitable than its traditional encyclopedia. Used copies of the CD are available, but the online version of the Britannica as known up to 2012 is not available in 2018 from any vendor.\n\nIn the 1980s Microsoft approached Britannica to collaborate on a CD-ROM encyclopedia, but the offer was declined. Senior managers at Britannica were confident in their control of the market and that their healthy profits would continue. At this time complete sets of the encyclopedia were priced between $1,500 and $2,200, and the product was considered part of a luxury brand with an impeccable reputation handed down from generation to generation. The management did not believe that a CD-ROM could adequately compete or supplement their business. Microsoft responded by using content from \"Funk & Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia\" to create what is now known as \"Encarta\".\n\nIn 1990 the \"Britannica's\" sales reached an all-time high of $650 million, but \"Encarta\", released in 1993, soon became a software staple with almost every computer purchase and the \"Britannica's\" market share plummeted. Britannica countered by offering a CD-ROM version of their product, although it could not generate the print version's $500–600 in sales commissions. Britannica decided to charge $995 for just the CD-ROM, while bundling a free disc with the print version, hoping that including the CD-ROM would persuade buyers to stay with the brand.\n\nIn 1994 an online version was launched, with subscriptions for sale for $2,000. By 1996 the price of the CD-ROM had dropped to $200, and sales had dropped to $325 million—about half of their 1990 levels. Only 55,000 hard copy versions were sold in 1994, compared with 117,000 in 1990, and sales later fell to 20,000. Facing financial pressure, Britannica was bought in 1996 by Swiss financier Jacob Safra for $135 million, a fraction of its book value. Safra introduced severe price-cutting measures to try to compete with \"Encarta\", even offering the entire reference free of charge for a time (around 18 months, from October 1999 to March 2001) on the Internet.\n\nCurrently, Britannica co-operates with Taiwan companies (遠流/智慧藏學習科技公司) to provide a Traditional Chinese-English bilingual version encyclopedia on internet according to the 2002 edition. It is the first bilingual product of Britannica.\n\nFormer editor-in-chief Robert McHenry believes that Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages in the market for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the second multimedia encyclopedia titled \"Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia\" as early as 1989 (the first one being the \"Academic American Encyclopedia\" published by Grolier), but did not launch \"Britannica CD\" until 1994, a year after Microsoft launched their \"Encarta\" encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance among senior management to fully embrace the new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from door-to-door selling of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products being driven by the desires of the sales personnel rather than market conditions and customer expectations.\n\n"}

{"id": "52214882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52214882", "title": "Islamization of Albania", "text": "Islamization of Albania\n\nThe Islamization of Albania occurred as a result of the Ottoman conquest of Albania during the late 14th century. The Ottomans through their administration and military brought Islam to Albania through various policies and tax incentives, trade networks and transnational religious links. In the first few centuries of Ottoman rule, the spread of Islam in Albania was slow and mainly intensified during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due in part to greater Ottoman societal and military integration, geo-political factors and collapse of church structures. It was one of the most significant developments in Albanian history as Albanians in Albania went from being a largely Christian (Catholic and Orthodox) population to one that is mainly Muslim (Sunni, Bektashi and some other sects), while retaining significant ethnic Albanian Christian minorities in certain regions. The resulting situation where Sunni Islam was the largest faith in the Albanian ethnolinguistic area but other faiths were also present in a regional patchwork played a major influence in shaping the political development of Albania in the late Ottoman period. Apart from religious changes, conversion to Islam also brought about other social and cultural transformations that have shaped and influenced Albanians and Albanian culture.\n\nAlbanians began converting to Islam when they became part of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century. Albania differs from other regions in the Balkans such as Bulgaria and Bosnia in that until the 1500s, Islam remained confined to members of the co-opted aristocracy and sparse military outpost settlements of Yuruks. Thus, actual conversion to Islam at first occurred mainly amongst the Christian elite, who retained some previous political and economic privileges, and the emerging class of timar or estate holders of the sipahis in the new Ottoman system.\n\nThese included aristocratic figures such as George Kastrioti (Skanderbeg) who while in the service of the Ottomans was a convert to Islam and later reverted to Christianity during the late 15th century northern Albanian uprising he initiated. In doing so, he also ordered others who had embraced Islam or were Muslim colonists to convert to Christianity or face death. Skanderbeg received military assistance from the Kingdom of Naples that sent in 1452 Ramon d’Ortafà who was appointed as viceroy of Albania and tasked with maintaining Catholicism among the local population from the spread of Islam. During the conflicts between Skanderbeg and Ottomans the various battles and raiding pushed Sultan Mehmet II to construct the fortress of Elbasan (1466) in the lowlands to counter resistance coming from the mountain strongholds. Prior to and after Skanderbeg's death (1468) parts of the Albanian aristocracy migrated to southern Italy with some number of Albanians to escape the Ottoman conquest whose descendants still reside in many villages they settled.\nEven long after the fall of Skanderbeg, large regions of the Albanian countryside frequently rebelled against Ottoman rule, often incurring large human costs, including the decimation of whole villages. In the 1570s, a concerted effort by Ottoman rulers to convert the native population to Islam in order to stop the occurrence of seasonal rebellions began in Elbasan and Reka, and a failed rebellion in 1596 among Catholics in the North preceded a series of heavy punitive measures that induced conversion to Islam. The peak of Islamization in Albania occurred much later than other Islamized or partially Islamized areas: 16th century Ottoman census data showed that sanjaks where Albanians lived remained overwhelmingly Christian with Muslims making up no more than 5% in most areas while during this period Muslims had already risen to large proportions in parts of Bosnia (Bosnia 46%, Herzegovina 43%, urban Sarajevo 100%), Northern Greece (Trikala 17.5%), urban Macedonia (Skopje and Bitola both at 75%) and Eastern Bulgaria (Silistra 72%, Chirmen 88%, Nikopol 22%). Later on, in the 19th century, when the process of Islamization had halted in most of the Balkans it continued to make significant progress in Albania, especially in the South.\n\nIn the early period of Ottoman rule the areas that form contemporary Albania were reorganised into an administrative unit named Sancak-i Arnavid or Sancak-i Arnavud. During the onset of Ottoman rule only prominent churches with significant symbolic meaning or cultural value of an urban settlement were converted into mosques. Most early mosques constructed in Albania were mainly built within fortresses for Ottoman garrisons at times by Ottoman Sultans during their military campaigns in the area like Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque in Shkodër, the Red Mosque in Berat and others.\n\nAs a rule, Ottoman rule largely tolerated Christian subjects but also discriminated against them, making them second-class citizens with higher taxes and various legal restrictions like being unable to take Muslims to court, have horses, have weapons, or have houses overlooking those of Muslims. While the Ottoman authorities were chronically suspicious of Catholicism, they largely allowed the Orthodox church to function unhindered, except during certain periods when the church was suppressed with expulsions of bishops and seizure of property and revenues. During the Ottoman period, most Christians as well as most Muslims employed a degree of syncretism, still practicing various pagan rites; many of these rites are best preserved among mystical orders like the Bektashi Order.\n\nThe Ottoman conquest of certain northern cities from the Venetians happened separately to the initial conquest of Albania from local feudal lords. Cities such as Lezhë fell in 1478, Shkodër during 1478–79 and Durrës in 1501 with the bulk of their Christian population fleeing. Over the course of the sixteenth century the urban populations of these cities became primarily Muslim. In the north, the spread of Islam was slower due to resistance from the Roman Catholic Church and the mountainous terrain which contributed to curb Muslim influence in the 16th century. The Ottoman conquest and territorial reorganisation of Albania though affected the Catholic church as ecclesiastical structures were decimated. In the 16th century, the sanjak of Shkodër was reported as having a Muslim population standing at 4.5% of the total, while Dukagjini (sparsely populated at the time) had 0% and Prizreni had 1.9%.\n\nCatholic Albanian rebellions, often in the context of Ottoman wars with Catholic powers of Venice and Austria in the seventeenth century resulted in severe reprisals against Catholic Albanians who had rebelled which accentuated conversion to Islam. In 1594, the Pope incited a failed rebellion among Catholic Albanians in the North, promising help from Spain. However the assistance did not come, and when the rebellion was crushed in 1596, Ottoman repression and heavy pressures to convert to Islam were implemented to punish the rebels. Steep decreases occurred during the 1630s-1670s where for example the number of Catholics in the diocese of Lezhë declined by 50%, whereas in the diocese of Pult Catholics went from being 20,000 to 4,045 adherents, with most converting to Islam and a few to Orthodoxy. In the aftermath of the Great Austro-Turkish War, when Albanian Catholic leaders Pjetër Bogdani and Toma Raspasani had rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause but Kosovo did not end up part of the Hapsburg empire, another round of harsh reprisals occurred and large numbers of Catholics and Serbs were reported to have fled north where it was reported that many Catholics \"died, some of hunger, others of disease\" around Budapest. After the flight of Serbs, the Pasha of Ipek (Albanian Peja, Serbian Pec) forced Catholic Albanians in the North to move to the now depopulated plains of Southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there.\n\nConversion among Catholics in communities of Northern Albania involved males outwardly embracing Islam, often to avoid payment of taxes and other social pressures which in the Ottoman system targeted men while females of the household remained Christian. Christian wives were sought by converted Muslim men to retain a degree of Catholicism in the household. In 1703 pope Clement XI, himself of Albanian heritage, ordered a synod of local Catholic bishops that discussed stemming conversions to Islam which also agreed to deny communion to crypto-Catholics in Albania who outwardly professed Islam. In Northern Albania, conflict with Slavs emerged as an additional factor toward conversion to Islam. Sharing the faith of Ottoman authorities allowed northern Albanians to become allies and equals in the imperial system and gain security against neighbouring Orthodox Slavs.\n\nIn some areas adjacent to the east of Northern Albania, Islam became the majority faith faster: for example, official Ottoman statistics of Nahiya of Tetova across the border with Macedonia (which had a mixed Albanian, Slavic Macedonian, and Turkish population) show Muslim families outnumbering Christian families for the first time in 1545, where there are 2 more Muslim families than Christian families, and 38 of the Muslim families had recently converted from Christianity, while in Opoja in Kosovo near Prizren, Muslims are shown to have the majority in 1591.\n\nConsisting of plains and being an in between area of northern and southern Albania, central Albania was a hub on the old Via Egnatia road that linked commercial, cultural and transport connections which were subject to direct Ottoman administrative control and religious Muslim influence. The conversion to Islam of most of central Albania has thus been attributed in large part to the role its geography played in the socio-political and economic fortunes of the region.\n\nThe official Ottoman recognition of the Orthodox church resulted in the Orthodox population being tolerated until the late 18th century, and the traditionalism of the church's institutions slowed the process of conversion to Islam amongst Albanians. The Orthodox population of central and south-eastern Albania was under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid, while south-western Albania was under the Patriarchate of Constantinople through the Metropolis of Ioannina. Differences between Christian Albanians of central Albania and archbishops of Ohrid led to conversions to Bektashi Islam that made an appeal to all while insisting little on ritual observance.\n\nIn the early 16th century the Albanian cities of Gjirokastër, Kaninë, Delvinë, Vlorë, Korçë, Këlcyrë, Përmet and Berat were still Christian and by the late 16th century Vlorë, Përmet and Himarë were still Christian, while Gjirokastër increasingly became Muslim. In the earlier parts of the 16th century, the sanjak of Elbasan was reported as having a 5.5% Muslim population, the highest at the time of all the Albanian-inhabited sanjaks. In 1570, a concerted effort by Ottoman authorities to convert the restive Christian populations of Elbasan and Reka began. In the area around Durrës, it was reported by a Greek traveler that there were no longer any Orthodox Christians due to Islamization. Conversion to Islam in cities overall within Albania was slow during the 16th century as around only 38% of the urban population had become Muslim. The city of Berat from 1670 onward became mainly Muslim and its conversion is attributed in part to a lack of Christian priests being able to provide religious services.\n\nIn the 16th century, the sanjaks of Vlora was found to be 1.8% Muslim while the sanjak of Ohrid was found to be 1.9%. It was mainly during the late eighteenth century however that Orthodox Albanians converted in large numbers to Islam due overwhelmingly to the Russo-Turkish wars of the period and events like the Russian instigated Orlov revolt (1770) that made the Ottomans view the Orthodox population as allies of Russia. As some Orthodox Albanians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, the Porte responded with and at times applied force to convert Orthodox Albanians to Islam while also implementing economic measures to stimulate religious conversion. By 1798 a massacre perpetrated against the coastal Orthodox Albanian villages of Shënvasil and Nivicë-Bubar by Ali Pasha, semi-independent ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina led to another sizable wave of conversions of Orthodox Albanians to Islam. In the 19th century, Albania as a whole, and especially Southern Albania, was notable as a rare region in the Ottoman Balkans where the Christian population was still losing considerable numbers of adherents to Islamization; the only other such region that showed similar decrease in the Christian population was Dobrudja.\n\nDuring this time conflict between newly converted Muslim Albanians and Orthodox Albanians occurred in certain areas. Examples include the coastal villages of Borsh attacking Piqeras in 1744, making some flee abroad to places such as southern Italy. Other areas such as 36 villages north of the Pogoni area converted in 1760 and followed it up with an attack on Orthodox Christian villages of the Kolonjë, Leskovik and Përmet areas leaving many settlements sacked and ruined. By the late eighteenth century socio-political and economic crises alongside nominal Ottoman government control resulted in local banditry and Muslim Albanian bands raided Greek, Vlach and Orthodox Albanian settlements located today within and outside contemporary Albania. Within Albania those raids culminated in Vithkuq, mainly an Orthodox Albanian centre, Moscopole (Albanian: Voskopojë, Greek: Moschopolis) mainly a Vlach centre, both with Greek literary, educational and religious culture and other smaller settlements being destroyed. Those events pushed some Vlachs and Orthodox Albanians to migrate afar to places such as Macedonia, Thrace and so on.\n\nSome Orthodox individuals, known as neo-martyrs, attempted to stem the tide of conversion to Islam amongst the Orthodox Albanian population and were executed in the process. Notable among these individuals was Cosmas of Aetolia, (died 1779) a Greek monk and missionary who traveled and preached afar as Krujë, opened many Greek schools before being accused as a Russian agent and executed by Ottoman Muslim Albanian authorities. Cosmas advocated for Greek education and spread of Greek language among illiterate Christian non-Greek speaking peoples so that they could understand the scriptures, liturgy and thereby remain Orthodox while his spiritual message is revered among contemporary Orthodox Albanians.\n\nOther conversions such as those in the region of Labëria occurred due to ecclesiastical matters when for example during a famine the local bishop refused to grant a break in the fast to consume milk with threats of hell. Conversion to Islam also was undertaken for economic reasons which offered a way out of heavy taxation such as the \"jizya\" or poll tax and other difficult Ottoman measures imposed on Christians while opening up opportunities such as wealth accumulation and so on. In times of conflict between Muslims and Christians, local interests such as protection of family predominated over fighting causing the Ottomans to refuse Muslim Albanians the bearing of arms as often Christian Albanians would convert to Islam to obtain the right to arms and then employ them against the Ottomans. Other multiple factors that led to conversions to Islam were the poverty of the Church, illiterate clergy, a lack of clergy in some areas and worship in a language other than Albanian. Additionally the reliance of the bishoprics of Durrës and southern Albania upon the declining Archbishopric of Ohrid, due in part to simony weakened the ability of Orthodox Albanians in resisting conversion to Islam.\n\nCrypto-Christianity also occurred in certain instances throughout Albania in regions such as Shpat amongst populations that had recently converted from Christian Catholicism and Orthodoxy to Islam. Gorë, a borderland region straddling contemporary north-eastern Albania and southern Kosovo, had a Slavic Orthodox population which converted to Islam during the latter half of the eighteenth century due to the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć (1766) and subsequent unstable ecclesiastical structures. Whereas starting from the seventeenth and increasing in the following centuries, the mainly Slavic Orthodox population of the now Albanian borderland central-eastern region of Gollobordë converted to Islam. The Romani people entered Albania sometime in the fifteenth century and those that were Muslim became part of local Muslim Ottoman society.\n\nIslam was closely associated with the state that made the Ottoman Empire an Islamic polity of which religious law coincided alongside state law with only Muslims having full civic rights while ethnic or national affiliations were disregarded. In the center and south by the end of the seventeenth century the urban centers had largely adopted the religion of the growing Muslim Albanian elite. The construction of mosques in Albania increased substantially from the 17th century onward with the advent of large numbers of Muslim Albanian converts. The Albanian old aristocratic ruling class converted to Islam to retain their lands. By the 18th century a class of local aristocratic Albanian Muslim notables had emerged. The existence of that class as pashas and beys during that period, having military employment as soldiers and mercenaries while also able to join the Muslim clergy played an increasingly important role in Ottoman political and economic life that became an attractive career option for many Albanians. Depending on their role, these people in Muslim Albanian society attained a respectable position as they performed administrative tasks and maintained security in urban areas and sometimes were rewarded by the Ottoman state with high ranks and positions. Albanians, as such were also represented in sizable numbers at the imperial Ottoman court. Alongside Christians though, many Muslim Albanians were poor and partially serfs that worked on the land of the emerging landowning Ottoman Albanian elite while others found employment in business, as artisans and in other jobs.\n\nSunni Islam was promoted and protected by Ottoman governors and feudal society that resulted in support and spread of dervish Sufi orders considered more orthodox in the Balkans region. Foremost of these were the Bektashi order who were considered Sunni by means of association with shared legal traditions, though viewed as Shiite by everyday Muslims due to esoteric practices such as revering Ali, Hassan, Husein and other notable Muslim figures. During Ottoman rule the Albanian population partially and gradually began to convert to Islam through the teachings of Bektashism in part to gain advantages in the Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army.\nMany Albanians were recruited into the Ottoman Devşirme and Janissary with 42 Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire being of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were Koca Davud Pasha, Hamza Kastrioti, Iljaz Hoxha, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha, Ali Pasha, Edhem Pasha, Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, Kara Mahmud Bushati and Ahmet Kurt Pasha. Within these contexts of serving in the military and as administrators, the relationship of Muslim Albanians with the Ottomans was at times one of cooperation and mutual advantage.\n\nBesides those associated with Sunni Islam, the Muslims of Albania during the Ottoman period belonged to several Sufi Orders. The Qadiri order spread within urban areas of the seventeenth century and was linked with guilds of urban workers while in the 18th century the Qadiri had spread into central Albania and in particular the mountainous Dibër region. The Qadiri contributed to the economic, and in the Dibër area, the socio-political milieu where they were based. The Halveti order who competed with the Bektashis for adherents and based in the south and northeast of Albania. Other Sufi orders were the Rufai and the Melami and so on. The most prominent of these in Albania were and still are the Bektashis, a mystic Dervish order belonging to Shia Islam that came to Albania during the Ottoman period, brought first by the Janissaries in the 15th century. The spread of Bektashism amongst the Albanian population though occurred during the 18th and mainly early 19th centuries, especially in the domains of Ali Pasha who is thought to have been a Bektashi himself. Sufi dervishes from places afar like Khorasan and Anatolia arrived, proselytized, gained disciples and in time a network of tekkes was established that became centres of Sufism in regions such as Skrapar and Devoll. Some of the most prominent tekkes in Albania were in settlements such as Gjirokastër, Melçan, Krujë and Frashër. Of the Bektashi order by the early 20th century Albanians formed a sizable amount of its dervishes outside the Balkans, even at the tekke of Sufi saint Haji Bektash in Anatolia and in Egypt. Sufi orders, in particular the Bektashis, associate Christian saints and their local shrines with Sufi holy men, creating a synthesis and syncretism of religious observance and presence. For Albanian converts to Islam, Bektashism with its greater religious freedoms and syncretism was viewed at times as a more appealing option than Sunni Islam. The Bektashi sect is considered heretical by conservative Muslims. Traditionally Bektashis are found in sizable numbers within southern Albania and to a lesser extent in central Albania, while the rest of the Muslim population belongs to Sunni Islam.\n\nThe Ottoman conquest also brought social, cultural and linguistic changes into the Albanian-speaking world. From the fifteenth century onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language. A corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script (aljamiado) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on. Prominent amongst these authors were Yahya bey Dukagjini, Haxhi Shehreti or \"bejtexhinj\" poets like Nezim Frakulla, Muhamet Kyçyku, Sulejman Naibi, Hasan Zyko Kamberi, Haxhi Ymer Kashari and others. Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements. Some settlements with the construction of buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Korçë, Tiranë and Kavajë. Meanwhile, older urban centres such as Berat attained mosques, hamams (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for poets, artists and scholarly pursuits. Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the Mirahori Mosque in Korçë (built 1495–96), Murad Bey Mosque in Krujë (1533–34), Lead Mosque in Shkodër (1773–74), Et'hem Bey Mosque in Tiranë (begun 1791–94; finished 1820–21) and others.\n\nConversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from \"Rum\" (Christian) to \"Muslim\" confessional communities within the Ottoman millet system that collectively divided and governed peoples according to their religion. The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like \"Arnavud\" (اروانيد) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records. In Ottoman Turkish, the country was referred to as \"Arnavudluk\" (آرناوودلق). Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym. The ethnic demonym \"Shqiptarë\", derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced \"Arbëresh/Arbënesh\" amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nIslam and the Ottoman legacy has also been a topic of conversation among wider Albanian society. Islam and the Ottomans are viewed by many Albanians as the outcome of \"jihad\", \"anti-Christian violence\", \"Turkification\" and within those discourses Albania's sociopolitical problems are attributed as the outcome of that legacy. Some members from the Muslim community, while deemphasizing the Ottoman past, have responded to these views by criticizing what they perceive as prejudice toward Islam. Among Albanian intellectuals and other notable Albanians in the wider Balkans, discussions and at times debates about Islam, its legacy and role within Albania have occurred. Within these discourses, controversial Orientalist, racist and biological terminology has been used by some Albanian intellectuals when discussing Islam, its legacy and contemporary role among Albanians. Prominent in those discussions were written exchanges in newspaper articles and books between novelist Ismail Kadare of Gjirokastër and literary critic Rexhep Qosja, an Albanian from the former Yugoslavia in the mid-2000s. Kadare asserted that Albania's future lay with Europe due to its ancient European roots and Christian traditions, while Qosja contended that Albanian identity was both a blend of Western (Christian) and Eastern (Islam) cultures and often adaptable to historical contexts. Piro Misha wrote that the Islamisation of Albanians during the 17th and 18th centuries as being \"two of the darkest centuries in the modern history of Albania\". Misha also maintained that due to that experience \"Albania was more influenced by Turco-Oriental culture than perhaps any other country in the region\", though he notes that Albanian Muslims were only Muslim group \"in European Turkey who made common cause with their Christian compatriots to fight against the government in Constantinople.\" \n\nIn a 2005 speech given in Britain by president, Alfred Moisiu referred to Islam in Albania as having a \"European face\", it being \"shallow\" and that \"if you dig a bit in every Albanian, he can discover his Christian core\". The Muslim Forum of Albania responded to those and Kadare's comments and referred to them as \"racist\" containing \"Islamophobia\" and being \"deeply offensive\". Following trends dating back from the communist regime, the post-communist Albanian political establishment continues to approach Islam as the faith of the Ottoman \"invader\". Academic Olsi Jazexhi has argued that contemporary Albanian politicians akin to the communists perceive \"Modernisation\" to mean \"De-Islamisation\", making Muslim Albanians feel alienated from their Muslim traditions instead of celebrating them and embracing their Ottoman heritage. Some Albanian writers have also claimed that the Albanian dedication to Islam was superficial and these arguments have been popular within the Orthodox and Catholic Albanian communities. In debates over Albanian school textbooks where some historians have asked for offensive content regarding Turks to be removed, some Christian Albanian historians countered angrily by referring to negative experiences of the Ottoman period and wanting Turkey to seek redress for the \"invasion\" of Albania and Islamisation of Albanians.\n\nThe official religious Christian and Muslim establishments and their clergy hold diverging views of the Ottoman period and conversion of Islam by Albanians. Both Catholic and the Orthodox clergy interpret the Ottoman era as a repressive one that contained anti-Christian discrimination and violence, while Islam is viewed as \"foreign\" challenging Albanian tradition and cohesion. The conversion to Islam by Albanians is viewed by both Catholic and Orthodox clergy as \"falsification\" of Albanian identity, though Albanian Muslims are interpreted as \"innocent victims\" of Islamisation. Albanian Sunni Muslim clergy however views the conversion of Albanians as a \"voluntary\" process, while sidelining religious controversies associated with the Ottoman era. Sufi Islam in Albania interprets the Ottoman era as promoting a distorted form of Islam that was corrupted within a Sunni Ottoman polity that persecuted them. Christian clergy consider Muslim Albanians as part of the wider Albanian nation and Muslim clergy do not express derision to people who did not become Muslim in Albania. Christian identities in Albania have been forged on being in a minority position, at times with experiences of discrimination they have had historically in relation to the Muslim majority. Meanwhile, Muslim clergy in Albania highlight the change of fortune the demise of the Ottoman Empire brought with the political empowerment of Balkan Christians making Muslims a religious minority in contemporary times.\n\nWithin scholarship in contemporary times, the conversion of Albanians and the legacy of Islam within Albania is a contested topic. Communist era and contemporary Albanian scholars with nationalist perspectives interpret the Ottoman period as negative and downplay the conversion to Islam as having had barely any benefits to Albanians in a socio-cultural and religious sense. In 1975, Hasan Kaleshi challenged these mainly \"negative\" views of the period of Islamization. Kaleshi, whose views were later supported by Elsie and Schmidt-Neke, stated that the Ottoman conquest and conversion to Islam by Albanians averted Hellenization and Slavification the same way that he argued that the Slavic invasions of the 6th century halted the romanization process of the progenitors of the Albanians. Kaleshi maintained that though recognised within the millet system as Muslims only, the partial Islamisation of the population halted the assimilation process occurring through churches and the influence of landlords of the Greeks, Latins and Slavs. Additionally the Islamisation of Albanians also resulted in the extension of the Balkan Albanian settlement area through either population movements or the assimilation of other Muslim non-Albanian elements during Ottoman rule. Kaleshi's thesis has over time been distorted by some Albanians who argue that Albanians converted to Islam with the aim of keeping their national and ethnic identity, instead of Albanian identity being preserved as a consequence of Islamisation and Ottoman rule; this has been called an \"inversion\" of Kaleshi's argument.\n\n"}

An example of a living document is an article in Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia that permits anyone to freely edit its articles, in contrast to \"dead\" or \"static\" documents, such as an article in a single edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nA living document may or may not have a framework for updates, changes, or adjustments. This type of document without proper context can change away from its original purpose through multiple uncontrolled edits. This can encourage open collaboration within the network, but in some cases there can also be stagnation if no one takes on the initiative of updating the work. One reason why initiative is not taken to update the document could come from a sense of ambiguity.\n\nHowever, a living document may evolve through successive updates, be expanded as needed, and serve a different purpose over time. Living documents are changed through revisions that may or may not reference previous iterative changes. The rate of document drift depends on the structure of the original document, or original intent of such document, or guidelines for modifying such document.\n\nIn Canadian law, this concept is called the \"living tree doctrine\" (French: \"théorie de l'arbre vivant\"). The 1929 case \"Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)\", which decided upon the right of women to sit in the Canadian Senate, was the first to establish this principle. The case was decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, whereupon Viscount Sankey wrote of the ruling: \nThe British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. The object of the Act was to grant a Constitution to Canada. Like all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention...\n\nTheir Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this Board—it is certainly not their desire—to cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal interpretation so that the Dominion to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, may be mistress in her own house, as the provinces to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in theirs.\n\nFrom this the approach was born what became known as the living tree doctrine which requires \"large and liberal\" interpretation, declaring a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.\n\nThe living tree principle was again expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Re: Same-Sex Marriage (2004), when it held that Parliament (as opposed to provincial legislatures) had the power to define marriage as including same-sex unions. It rejected claims that the constitutionally enumerated federal authority in matters of \"Marriage and Divorce\" could not include same-sex marriage because marriage as conceived in 1867 was necessarily opposite-sex:\n\nIn United States constitutional law, the Living Constitution, also known as loose constructionism, permits the Constitution as a static document to have an interpretation that shifts over time as the cultural context changes. The opposing view, originalism, holds that the original intent or meaning of the writers of the Constitution should guide its interpretation.\n\nIn business a living document may fall under corporate change management or be shared among a team. It may start as a draft that at some time graduates into general acceptance, or may originate as part of a formal documentation process. Regardless of the degree of formality, a living document needs rules or guidelines for its modification. Such guidelines allow — and should ideally encourage — the document's evolution over time. It is in this sense of \"growth\" that the document can be thought of as \"living.\"\n\nIn technology, living documents can be implemented using a wiki. Other common living document tools are Google Docs, Nextcloud Collabora, etc.\n\nLiving documents can also be implemented by using test tools such as \"HipTest\"\n\nLiving documentation is a key concept in Specification by example.\n\nIn pastoral theology the 'living document' refers to an individual person.\n\n\n"}

It is found in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic, from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Within some of its range, including the Irish Sea, this species comprises a significant commercial fishery.\n\nIt has a very large head which is broad, flat, and depressed; the rest of the body appears to be a mere appendage. The wide mouth extends all the way around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed teeth. These are inclined inwards, and can be closed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from the mouth.\n\nThe pectoral and pelvic fins are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, so the fish is able to walk along the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the sand or amongst seaweed. Around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed, a structure which, combined with the extraordinary faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish greatly in camouflaging itself in the places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. It has no scales.\n\nFemale anglers grow to a length of more than .\n\nThe fish has long filaments along the middle of its head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important to the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to attract other fish by means of its lure, and then to seize them with its enormous jaws. While it is considered probable that smaller fish are attracted in this way experiments have shown that the actions of the jaw is automatic and depends on contact of the prey with the tentacle. Its stomach is expandable and it is not unknown for these fish to swallow prey of their own size.\n\nThe spawn of the angler consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material wide and long drifting freely in the water. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The larvae are free-swimming and their pelvic fins are elongated into filaments.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40707518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40707518", "title": "Mongoose Gang", "text": "Mongoose Gang\n\nThe Mongoose Gang was a private army or militia which operated from 1970 to 1979 under the control of Sir Eric Gairy, the Premier and later Prime Minister of Grenada, and head of the Grenada United Labour Party. \n\nOfficially, Mongoose Gang members were called Special Reserve Police (S.R.P.) or Volunteer Constables. Therefore, the terms \"police aides\" and \"Mongoose Gang\" were sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably; although it should be added that the names of certain persons were unmistakably identified as members of the Mongoose Gang as distinct from also being police aides. At the 1975 Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the Breakdown of Law & Order, and Police Brutality in Grenada, Nugent David, a former Commissioner of Police, confirmed that a group of men known as the Mongoose Gang were among the police aides. To his knowledge, Moslyn Bishop and his brother Willie Bishop were reputedly leaders of the gang. \n\nAccording to David the police aides were under his jurisdiction because they assisted the police with their duties although they were not recruited normally as policemen who were required to undergo tests for educational and physical fitness; but they were paid through the office of the Commissioner. David said he did not know how or by whom the recruitment of police aides was done except that he knew the recruitment took place in St. George's and that after he assumed the post of acting commissioner of Police he heard from policemen that the men were selected by the Premier, Eric Gairy. As he understood the functions of the police aides, their main duties were guard duties and at times they assisted the police in searches, but they were subject to no discipline or control similar to that of the Police Force nor were any regulations ever made with respect to them. He added that in his knowledge none of the police aides was issued with firearms although he knew that some of them possessed and carried firearms on guard duty. \n\nThe Mongoose Gang was responsible for silencing critics, breaking up demonstrations and murdering opponents of the Gairy regime, including Rupert Bishop, the father of Maurice Bishop in January 1974. Maurice Bishop himself was beaten by members of the Mongoose Gang two months previously, in November 1973, and jailed. The violence of the Mongoose Gang and the Grenadian police became a more important factor than the state of the economy in generating unrest.\n\nIn November 1974, 10 months after Grenada's independence from Great Britain, Bishop's New Jewel Movement issued a People's Indictment calling for \"power to the people\" and declaring that \"the Gairy Government was born in blood, baptized in fire, christened with bullets, is married to foreigners, and is resulting in death to the people\".\n\nIn the 1976 Grenadian general election, the Grenada United Labour Party won nine of the 15 seats, whilst the opposition People's Alliance (a coalition of the New Jewel Movement, the Grenada National Party and the United People's Party) won the remainder. However, the elections were marred by fraud (and branded fraudulent by international observers), as the Mongoose Gang had been threatening the opposition. \n\nBy 1977 Gairy began receiving advice from General Augusto Pinochet of Chile on how to deal with civil unrest. His police and military also received \"counter insurgency\" training from the Pinochet regime. The New Jewel Movement retaliated by developing links with Fidel Castro and his Marxist government in Cuba.\n\nThe Mongoose Gang was used against protesters during the 1977 General Assembly of the Organization of American States hosted by Grenada.\n\nIn 1979, a rumour circulated that Gairy would use the Gang to eliminate leaders of the New Jewel Movement while he was out of the country.\nIn response, Bishop overthrew Gairy in March of that year while the latter was visiting the United States.\nThe Mongoose Gang then ceased to operate; the Gang's leader, Mosyln Bishop, a taxi driver, was subsequently sentenced later that year to fourteen years in prison for attempting to murder three people in November 1973.\n\nThe name 'Mongoose Gang' originated in the 1950s, when the local health officials sought to eliminate the mongoose as a pest, and paid people who brought in mongoose tails as proof of killing the animals. The men who were employed in such work became known as the 'mongoose-gang'. Later, the name shifted to refer to gangs of political thugs on Grenada.\nThe Mongoose Gang has often been compared to the Tonton Macoute of Haiti.\n\n"}

{"id": "198016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198016", "title": "Museum ship", "text": "Museum ship\n\nA museum ship, also called a memorial ship, is a ship that has been preserved and converted into a museum open to the public for educational or memorial purposes. Some are also used for training and recruitment purposes, mostly for the small number of museum ships that are still operational and thus capable of regular movement.\n\nSeveral hundred museum ships are kept around the world, with around 175 of them organised in the Historic Naval Ships Association though many are not naval museum ships, from general merchant ships to tugs and lightships. Many, if not most, museum ships are also associated with a maritime museum.\n\nRelatively few ships are preserved beyond their useful life, due to the high cost of maintaining them against the ravages of the elements. Most are broken up and sold for scrap, while a relative handful are sunk as naval target practice, scuttled to create artificial reefs, and so on. Some survive because of historical significance, but more often due to luck and circumstance. Since an old ship tied up at dockside, without attention, still decays and eventually sinks, the practice of recent years has been to form some sort of preservation society, solicit donations from governments or private individuals, organize volunteer labor from the enthusiasts, and open the restored ship to visitors, usually for a fee.\n\nThe restoration and maintenance of museum ships presents problems for historians who are asked for advice, and the results periodically generate some controversy. For instance, the rigging of sailing ships has almost never survived, and so the rigging plan must be reconstructed from various sources. Studying the ships also allows historians to analyze how life on and operation of the ships took place. Numerous scientific papers have been written on ship restoration and maintenance, and international conferences are held discussing the latest developments. Some years ago, the Barcelona Charter was signed by a variety of international owner organizations of traditional vessels, and provides certain accepted minimum criteria for the restoration and operation of traditional watercraft still in operation.\n\nAnother consideration is the distinction between a \"real\" museum ship, and a ship replica. As repairs accumulate over time, less and less of the ship is of the original materials, and the lack of old parts (or even \"appropriate\" work tools) may lead to the use of modern \"short-cuts\" (such as welding a metal plate instead of riveting it, as would be the case during the ships historical period). Visitors without historical background are also often unable to distinguish between a historical museum ship and a (more-or-less historically relevant) ship replica, which may serve solely as a tourist attraction.\n\nTypically the visitor enters via gangplank, wanders around on the deck, then goes below, usually using the original stairways, giving a sense of how the crew got around. The interior features restored but inactivated equipment, enhanced with mementos including old photographs, explanatory displays, pages from the ship's logs, menus, and the like. Some add recorded sound effects, audio tours or video displays to enhance the experience.\n\nIn some cases, the ships radio room has been brought back into use, with volunteers operating amateur radio equipment. Often, the callsign assigned is a variation on the original identification of the ship. For example, the submarine , which had the call NBQV, is now on the air as NB9QV. The World War II submarine , berthed at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, had the wartime call NJVT and is now on the air as NJ6VT. In other cases, such as , a distinctive call (in this case KH6BB) is used. This radio work not only helps restore part of the vessel, but also provides worldwide publicity for the museum ship.\n\nA number of the larger museum ships have begun to offer hosting for weddings, meetings, other events, and sleepovers, and on a few ships still seaworthy, cruises. In the United States, this includes s annual \"turnaround\", when the old ship is towed out into the harbor and brought back in facing the other way, so as to weather evenly. A place on the deck is by invitation or lottery only, and highly prized.\n\nMany consider the tourism appeal of an interesting old vessel on the city waterfront strong enough that any port city should showcase one or more museum ships. This may even include building a replica ship at great expense.\n\n\n\n"}

The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth's surface (in declination and Greenwich hour angle) at which the sun, moon, planets and first point of Aries is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected stars are specified relative to the first point of Aries.\n\nIn Great Britain, \"The Nautical Almanac\" has been published annually by HM Nautical Almanac Office, ever since the first edition was published in 1767.\nIn the United States, a nautical almanac has been published annually by the US Naval Observatory since 1852. It was originally titled \"American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\". Since 1958, the USNO and HMNAO have jointly published a unified nautical almanac, \"The Astronomical Almanac\" for use by the navies of both countries. Almanac data is now available online from the US Naval Observatory.\nAlso commercial almanacs were produced that combined other information. A good example would be Brown's — which commenced in 1877 – and is still produced annually, its early twentieth century subtitle being \"Harbour and Dock Guide and Advertiser and Daily Tide Tables\". This combination of trade advertising, and information \"by permission... of the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty\" provided a useful compendium of information. More recent editions have kept up with the changes in technology – the 1924 edition for instance had extensive advertisements for coaling stations. Meanwhile the Reeds Nautical Almanac, published by Adlard Coles Nautical, has been in print since 1932, and in 1944 was used by landing craft involved in the Normandy landings.\n\nThe \"Air Almanac\" of the United States and Great Britain tabulates celestial coordinates for 10-minute intervals for the use in aerial navigation. The Sokkia Corporation's annual \"Celestial Observation Handbook and Ephemeris\" tabulated daily celestial coordinates (to a tenth of an arcsecond) for the Sun and nine stars; it was last published for 2008.\n\nTo find the position of a ship or aircraft by celestial navigation, the navigator measures with a sextant the apparent height of a celestial body above the horizon, and notes the time from a marine chronometer. That height is compared with the height predicted for a trial position; the arcminutes of height difference is how many nautical miles the position line is from the trial position.\n\n\n"}

Packages bearing this mark contain hazardous material in a limited quantity that presents a limited hazard during transportation, due to its form, quantity, and packaging. \n\nConsumer commodity is a hazardous material that is packaged and distributed in a quantity and form intended or suitable for retail sale and designed for consumption by individuals for their personal care or household use purposes. This term can also include certain drugs or medicines. \n\nExamples of items classed ORM-D include:\n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 49 Part 171.8 defines a Consumer Commodity and those items with exceptions provided in the 172.101 table, of limited quantity, and conforming to the definition of \"Consumer Commodity\" may be marked and sent ORM-D. There are weight and volume restrictions for all ORM-D packages which vary by hazard class. For example, a gallon of a Class 3 flammable liquid PGII cannot be reclassified as ORM-D because it exceeds the limited quantity volume. However, a gallon of a Class 6, PGIII material is within the volume criteria for a Limited Quantity. That gallon can then be labeled as an ORM-D if it meets the definition of a substance that can be converted from a Limited Quantity to an ORM-D. \n\nIt is impossible to have an ORM-D that does not fit the criteria for a Limited Quantity. First an item is determined to be a Limited Quantity, and then it is determined if it can be reclassified further to become an ORM-D. If the item is able to be reclassified as ORM-D the proper shipping name is usually, but not always, \"Consumer Commodity\" as found in the 172.101 table. Other proper shipping names used for ORM-D material are Cartridges Small Arms and Cartridges Power Device. These products will no longer fall under one of the 9 hazard classes either, its \"Hazard Class or Division\" is now defined as \"ORM-D.\"\n\nMaterial marked \"ORM-D\" and shipped by surface transportation does not require hazardous shipping papers, simply an ORM-D and proper shipping name marking on the box. This marking can either be in the form of an ORM-D sticker, or written by hand. If written by hand the letters \"ORM-D\" must be enclosed by a rectangle. When transported by air, ORM-D shipments require an ORM-D-AIR marking and full hazardous shipping papers.\n\nBoth UPS Ground and FedEx Ground do not require a hazardous shipping contract to ship ORM-D packages except to Alaska and Hawaii. FedEx Ground does not transport ORM-D packages to Alaska or Hawaii. The United States Postal Service will accept ORM-D packages only for materials intended for domestic surface transportation.

{"id": "57311978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57311978", "title": "Old Ball", "text": "Old Ball\n\nOld Ball is a folk custom that existed in the Forest of Rossendale in Lancashire, north-western England during the nineteenth century. The tradition entailed the use of a hobby horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \"hooded animal\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.\n\nThe Lancashire Old Ball custom differs from other animal head traditions in Britain by being associated with Easter; most of the others were instead carried out at Christmas time. Demonstrating potential links to other regional traditions is the use of the name \"Ball\" for hobby horses in other areas. At Ashford and Little Hucklow in Derbyshire, the Old Horse tradition was recorded as using hobby horses named \"Ball\", while at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, the hobby horse was called \"Young Ball\".\n\nThe Old Ball tradition took place around Easter. The term \"Ball\" or \"Old Ball\" was the name of the hobby horse that featured in it. This hobby horse consisted of a horse skull affixed to a pole, with the bottom of glass bottles for eyes. The pole was carried by a man hidden beneath a sackcloth, and there was sometimes a tale affixed to the outfit.\n\nThe hobby horse was taken around by a group of about six men, who disguised themselves by blackening their faces or wearing masks. This group sang a song, although its lyrics and tune were not recorded. Old Ball itself would chase people in order to obtain money from them.\n\nThe southern point of the custom's distribution lies near the foothills of the Forest of Rossendale. It was also recorded in neighbourhoods of Blackburn and Burnley, near the northern margins of that forest about 15 to 20 miles north.\nAll of the settlements in which it was recorded were industrial towns; those in the south were mostly connected to cotton spinning, while the two in the north were associated with cotton weaving.\n\nRecorded accounts of the Old Ball tradition all come from the first three quarters of the nineteenth century.\n\nOld Ball was part of a wider \"hooded animal\" tradition that the folklorist E. C. Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. In South Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions — the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse — which take place not at Christmas time but on May Day.\nAlthough the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \"nation-wide craze\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\".\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1929, the museum is administered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2012, the museum re-opened after a three-year, $9 million renovation that brought the museum back to its original vision of displaying Rodin's works.\n\nThe Museum was the gift of movie-theater magnate Jules Mastbaum (1872–1926) to the city of Philadelphia. Mastbaum began collecting works by Rodin in 1923 with the intent of founding a museum to enrich the lives of his fellow citizens. Within just three years, he had assembled the largest collection of Rodin's works outside Paris, including bronze castings, plaster studies, drawings, prints, letters, and books. In 1926, Mastbaum commissioned French architects Paul Cret and Jacques Gréber to design the museum building and gardens. Unfortunately, the collector did not live to see his dream realized, but his widow, Etta Wedell Mastbaum honored his commitment to the city, and the Museum opened on November 29, 1929. Murals in the museum were executed by the painter Franklin C. Watkins.\n\nThe best-known of Rodin's works, \"The Thinker\" (1880–1882), sits outside the museum in the entry courtyard. Visitors once entered through a cast of \"The Gates of Hell\", located at the main entrance to the museum, which is no longer used. This massive 5.5-m-tall bronze doorway was originally created for the Museum of Decorative Arts (which was to have been located in Paris but never came into existence). Rodin sculpted more than 100 figures for these doors from 1880 until his death in 1917. This casting is one of the three originals; several others have been made since. Several of his most famous works, including \"The Thinker\", are actually studies for these doors which were later expanded into separate works.\n\nThe museum's several rooms house many more of the artist's works, including \"The Kiss\" (1886), \"Eternal Springtime\" (1884), \"The Age of Bronze\" (1875–76), and \"The Burghers of Calais\", a monument commissioned by the City of Calais in 1884.\n\n"}

The film is directed by Joshua Oppenheimer and co-directed by Christine Cynn and an anonymous Indonesian. \n\nIt is a Danish-British-Norwegian co-production, presented by Final Cut for Real in Denmark and produced by Signe Byrge Sørensen. The executive producers were Werner Herzog, Errol Morris, Joram ten Brink, and Andre Singer. It is a Docwest project of the University of Westminster. \n\n\"The Act of Killing\" won the 2013 European Film Award for Best Documentary, the Asia Pacific Screen Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It also won best documentary at the 67th BAFTA awards. In accepting the award, Oppenheimer asserted that the United States and the United Kingdom have \"collective responsibility\" for \"participating in and ignoring\" the crimes, which was omitted from the video BAFTA posted online. \n\nAfter a screening for US Congress members, Oppenheimer demanded that the US acknowledge its role in the killings.\n\nThe Indonesian government had responded negatively to the film. Its presidential spokesman on foreign affairs, Teuku Faizasyah, claimed that the film is misleading with respect to its portrayal of Indonesia.\n\nA companion piece to the film, \"The Look of Silence\", was released in 2014.\n\nThe film focuses on the perpetrators of the Indonesian killings of 1965–66 in the present day; ostensibly towards the communist community where almost a million people were killed. When Suharto overthrew Sukarno, the President of Indonesia, following the failed coup of the 30 September Movement in 1965, the gangsters Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry in Medan (North Sumatra) were promoted from selling black market movie theatre tickets to leading the most powerful death squad in North Sumatra. They also extorted money from the ethnic Chinese as the price for keeping their lives. Anwar is said to have personally killed 1,000 people.\n\nToday, Anwar is revered by the right wing of a paramilitary organization, Pemuda Pancasila, that grew out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers who are openly involved in corruption, election rigging and clearing people from their land for developers.\n\nInvited by Oppenheimer, Anwar recounts his experiences killing for the cameras, and makes scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings. The scenes are produced in the style of their favorite films: gangster, Western, and musical. Various aspects of Anwar and his friends' filmmaking process are shown, but as they begin to dramatize Anwar's own experiences, the fiction scenes begin to take over the film's form. Oppenheimer has called the result \"a documentary of the imagination\".\n\nSome of Anwar's friends state that the killings were wrong, while others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image.\n\nAfter Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, states that it was worse for the victims because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Anwar was only acting. Anwar then expresses doubts over whether or not he has sinned, tearfully saying he does not want to think about it. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and retches repeatedly while describing how he had killed people during the genocide. The dancers from the film's theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll.\n\nIn 2001, while conducting interviews for their 2003 film \"The Globalisation Tapes\", Oppenheimer and Cynn began delving into the Indonesian killings of 1965–66. After moving up the ranks of those involved with the killings, Oppenheimer's interviews led him to meet Anwar Congo in 2005. The film was shot mostly in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, between 2005 and 2011. After seeing an early preview of \"The Act of Killing\", filmmakers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris signed on as executive producers.\n\nThe name \"Anonymous\" appears 49 times under 27 different crew positions in the credits. These crew members still fear revenge from the death-squad killers.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the film's director's cut in 2013, a free BitTorrent Bundle of behind the scenes content was uploaded to the internet by the distributor.\n\n\"The Act of Killing\" received widespread acclaim from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.7/10 based on 136 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Raw, terrifying, and painfully difficult to watch, \"The Act of Killing\" offers a haunting testament to the edifying, confrontational power of documentary cinema.\" On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 89 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nNick Schager of \"The Village Voice\" called it a \"masterpiece.\" Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges called the film \"an important exploration of the complex psychology of mass murderers\" and wrote that \"it is not the demonized, easily digestible caricature of a mass murderer that most disturbs us. It is the human being.\" Award-winning filmmaker Ruhi Hamid said: \"It is the most extraordinary film I have ever seen. It actually turns around what we think of as documentaries. ...an extraordinary record of a horrendous part of Indonesian history.\"\n\nIn some quarters Oppenheimer has been accused of treating his subjects in bad faith. As far as their goal at the beginning was to glorify mass murder, Oppenheimer responds that could never have been his goal, therefore that side of them may have been betrayed. In an interview with \"The Village Voice\", Oppenheimer said: \"When I was entrusted by this community of survivors to film these justifications, to film these boastings, I was trying to expose and interrogate the nature of impunity. Boasting about killing was the right material to do that with because it is a symptom of impunity.\"\n\nAustralian National University Professor of Asian History and Politics Robert Cribb stated that the film lacks historical context. In reply, Oppenheimer said that \"the film is essentially not about what happened in 1965, but rather about a regime in which genocide has, paradoxically, been effaced [yet] celebrated – in order to keep the survivors terrified, the public brainwashed, and the perpetrators able to live with themselves... It never pretends to be an exhaustive account of the events of 1965. It seeks to understand the impact of the killing and terror today, on individuals and institutions.\"\n\nBradley Simpson, historian at the University of Connecticut and director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, states the \"brilliant Oscar-nominated film\" has prompted vigorous debate among Indonesians about the crimes and the need to hold responsible parties accountable, and suggests that it could have a similar effect in the United States, whose own role in the killings \"has never officially been acknowledged, much less accounted for, though some of the relevant documents have been made available to the public.\"\n\nAn Indonesian academic, Soe Tjen Marching, analyzed the film in relation to Hannah Arendt's theory of the banality of evil.\n\nThe primary subjects in the film, Anwar Congo and Herman Koto, have seen the film and neither feels deceived, according to Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer says that upon watching the film Anwar Congo \"started to cry...Tearfully, he told me: 'This is the film I expected. It's an honest film, a true film.' He said he was profoundly moved and will always remain loyal to it.\" Oppenheimer went on to say that in the call with Congo he also became down on himself saying \"There is nothing left for me to do in life but to die\". Oppenheimer seeing Congo so moved and almost ashamed for what he had done, said this to him. \"You're only 70 years old, Anwar. You might live another 25 years. Whatever good you do in those years is not undermined by the awful things in your past.\" He felt it may have been cliche, but he felt it was honest and all he could manage to say to Congo. A subsequent interview on Al Jazeera's program \"101 East\" revealed that Anwar had misgivings about the film and the negative reaction to it in Indonesia, which was causing problems for him. He confided these concerns directly to Oppenheimer in an apparent Skype conversation displayed within the program.\n\nIn 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by \"The Guardian\".\n\n\"The Act of Killing\" has been named as one of the best films of 2013 by various critics:\n\n\"The Act of Killing\" was ranked 19th among all documentaries ever made in a 2015 poll by the British Film Institute, as well as the 14th greatest film since 2000 in a 2016 critics' poll by BBC.\n\n"}

It was considered more dignified for nobility to be executed away from spectators, and Queens Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey were among the nobility beheaded here. Queen Victoria asked for information on the exact location where the executions took place and had some granite paving laid to mark the spot. However, it is unclear whether the location is indeed correct because other sources place it on the current parade ground between the White Tower and the entrance to the current Waterloo Barracks.\n\nTower Green is an open space located south of the Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula. Beheading in the privacy of the Tower Green was considered a privilege of rank; the executed were spared insults from jeering crowds, and the monarch was spared bad publicity. Other prisoners in the tower were executed in public on Tower Hill, just outside the fortress, or at Tyburn on the other side of the city. In the middle of the green is a small square plot paved with granite, which shows the site commonly believed to be the spot on which stood the scaffold on which private executions took place. The granite paving was specially created by order of Queen Victoria.\n\nThere is dispute that the memorial site is actually the scaffold site. It appears that there are sources that indicate that the site of the current memorial is merely a spot incorrectly pointed out to Queen Victoria, by an unknowing Yeoman Warder, when she inquired about the scaffold site during a visit to the Tower. Other sources describe Anne Boleyn's final walk to the scaffold, at a location on the current parade ground, between the White Tower and the entrance to the current Waterloo Barracks (not built until 1845).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the area was used as a burial ground. As a result of relaying the 19th century granite sett stones, shallow excavations of the foundations revealed remains of a building that sat on that site. Historic plans of the Tower of London show a building at the site of the Tower Green. It was demolished in 1684, but was rebuilt in 1685. It was removed once again soon thereafter. It appears that the building was used at the time as a guardhouse for the predecessors of the Yeomen Warders. The executions at the Tower Green were done inside this building to maintain the privacy of the nobles.\n\nThe following nobles are known to have been executed on the Tower Green:\n\n\nEach of these individuals was beheaded with an axe, except for Anne Boleyn who was beheaded with a sword. The bodies of all seven were buried in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula.\n\nIn addition to the seven listed above, there are three additional names listed on the memorial at Tower Green: Malcolm Macpherson, Samuel Macpherson and Farquhar Shaw. They were soldiers of the Black Watch Regiment from the Scottish Highlands who were convicted of mutiny, and were executed at the Tower on 19 July 1743 by a twelve-man firing squad composed of their fellow soldiers. \n\n"}

From the 1820s to 1859, it persisted as the medical expression of natural philosophy before the .\n\nAmongst its various definitions, transcendental anatomy has four main tenets:\n\nJohann Wolfgang Goethe was one of many naturalists and anatomists in the nineteenth century who was in search of an Ideal Plan in nature. In Germany, this was known as \"Urpflanze\" for the plant kingdom and \"Urtier\" for animals. He popularized the term \"morphology\" for this search. Transcendental anatomy first derived from the naturalist philosophy known as \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\nIn the 1820s, French anatomist Etienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786–1868) popularized the term \"transcendental anatomy\" to refer to the collective morphological of animal development. Synonymous expressions such as philosophical anatomy, higher anatomy, and transcendental morphology also arose at this time.\n\nSome advocates regarded transcendental anatomy as the ultimate explanation for biological structures, while others saw it as one of several necessary explanatory devices.\n\nTranscendental anatomists theorized that the bones of the skull were \"cranial vertebra\", or modified bones from the vertebrae. Owen ardently supported the theory as major evidence for his theory of homology.\n\nThe theory has since been discredited.\n"}

Popular with students in the United States, Canada and parts of Latin America from the 1970s to the 1990s, it featured sliding plastic rings (instead of standard snap-closed metal binder rings), folders, and pockets to keep schoolwork and papers, and a wrap around flap with a Velcro closure (originally a metal snap closure).\n\nTrapper Keepers usually had a theme, such as a cartoon, television show, or video game. Between 1988 and 1995, \"Designer Series\" Trapper Keepers featured abstract designs and later computer-generated images.\n\nThe Trapper Keeper was invented in the late 70's by E. Bryant Crutchfield, Director of New Ventures at the Mead Corporation. The binder got its name because it was sold in combination with pocket folders designed by Mead called \"Trappers\", which differed from other pocket folders in that the pockets' three sides connected with the bottom, outside edge, and top (as opposed to the bottom, outside edge, and spine) of the folders. This design prevented papers from falling out of the Trapper's pockets when it was closed. Trappers were three-hole punched so that they could be put in any 3-ring binder, including a Trapper Keeper. In August 1978, the Trapper Keeper was tested in Wichita, Kansas, and to the surprise of Crutchfield, it completely sold out. \n\nThree years after the Trapper Keeper was released, the design was tweaked to include a Velcro strap instead of the initial metal buckle. This design change allowed for easier customer use and more efficient manufacturing. \n\nThe Designer Series ran from 1988 to 1995, which introduced \"fashionable, funky and sometimes psychedelic designs... The company also made a deal with Lisa Frank... and licensed iconic characters like Garfield and Sonic the Hedgehog.\" \n\nIn 2007, a new version of Trapper Keeper featured a magnetic closure in place of the Velcro closure, a customizable front cover, and binder dividers instead of Trapper folders.\n\nIn 2014, another new version of the Trapper Keeper was released, featuring a metal button closure, as well as a new feature called \"Snapper Trappers\", which are plastic strips that act as dividers and they can have regular notebooks attached to them in addition to folders and dividers; the Snapper Trappers can be placed or removed without having to open the rings of the binder.\n\nFor the 2015 school season, Trapper Keeper introduced \"Star Wars\" Trapper Keeper supplies, \"Hello Kitty\" Trapper Keeper supplies, and a new patterned line called \"Fun In The Sun\".\n\nAn advanced, futuristic, titular Trapper Keeper played a prominent role in season four, episode twelve of the American animated series \"South Park\". The episode, \"Trapper Keeper\", played with various science fiction tropes, including allusions to \"Akira\", \"\", and \"The Terminator\".\n\n\n"}
