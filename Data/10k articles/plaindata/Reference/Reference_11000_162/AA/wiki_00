The clips were published under the title \"Stari obrazi\" (\"Old Faces\") by someone who signed himself as \"stariobrazi\" (\"oldfaces\"). The publication happened during the term of the Prime Minister Borut Pahor, just before the early Slovenian 2011 parliamentary election on 4 December.\n\nThe first of the clips published was dated to 31 January 2008, when Janez Janša was the Prime Minister. The second and the third clip was dated to 23 April 2009, respectively 23 April and 30 April 2009, when Borut Pahor was the Prime Minister. The original recordings were produced in audio and video. They were stored on DVDs and locked in a safe available only to authorised personnel. They were also available at home to three people via the Spectiva remote viewing software, but due to their low quality, the probability of Spectiva being the source of the leaked data has been estimated as low, and it was not used during the term of Pahor's government. Spectiva could be misused until July 2009. It seems most probable that the recordings originated from the recording room or were transferred with additional equipment from the press room of the government; till 2009, sessions were broadcast live there so that extracts of resolutions could be made by the authorised personnel.\n\nMarjan Miklavčič, an expert in intelligence services and a lecturer at the University of Maribor, compared the publication to WikiLeaks. He particularly stressed that it was not known which data had been stolen and whether they could be used for extortion. Iztok Prezelj, who lectures on intelligence at the University of Ljubljana, stated that the publication showed a parallel state to exist in Slovenia. Miklavčič confirmed that all the data publicly available indicate the thesis about a parallel state to be correct.\n\nThe ministers of Janša's government, Andrej Vizjak and Mojca Kucler Dolinar, were discussing the wages of judges. The recordings of Pahor's sessions showed the Foreign Minister Samuel Žbogar reporting about the pressures from the European Union on Slovenia regarding the Slovenian blockade of Croatian entry to the Union and the Interior Minister Katarina Kresal discussing the acquisition of water cannons for the Slovenian Police.\n\nOn 9 December, it was reported that the Slovenian Police had started investigation about the clips. On 14 December, the Government spokesperson Darijan Košir explained that in 2006, government areas were renovated. He said that the recorded sessions were held at Gregorčič Street 20 (; Government and Presidential Palace) and the recording room was at Gregorčič Street 25. The buildings were connected with of cable. The system could be abused at several points. The works at Gregorčič Street 25 were carried out by the construction company SCT, and the computer infrastructure was set up by the companies ADM and TSE. Košir told that all the people with access to the data were thoroughly checked. On 12 December, after the Secretariat filed a criminal complaint, the Police requested an internal report from the Secretary-General Kamnar.\n\nOn 15 December, TSE denied having spotted any anomalies in the computer system since it had been installed. They told that all their employees were checked and that they never received any instruction that would allow for an illegal access. They also pointed out that the Government was responsible for the security of the system after it had been taken over. The telephone number of ADM was unavailable. Rumors about a slow investigation due to long preparation of report by the Secretary-General appeared. Both the minister of interior and the Secretary-General denied this.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, an inspectional surveillance, ordered by the Information Commissioner Nataša Pirc Musar, was carried out by the Inspectorate for Protection of Personal Data at the Secretary–General. As of 27 January 2012, the findings were not available yet. The results will influence the decision of the Government about the destruction of the original session recordings.\n\nOn 26 January 2012, the Secretariat-General of the Government issued a report about an internal investigation that failed to find the perpetrator. However, it was found out that the clips were carefully chosen and taken out of context, giving them a different meaning than they would have in the whole. They were alienated after they had been processed in the recording room. This significantly narrowed the number of supply locations and the circle of possible suspects. The highest risk was associated with the human factor. The Secretariat–General identified the crimes of betrayal of secrets, misuse of position, unauthorized image recording, and an information system attack. Due to lack of jurisdiction of the Government, further investigation would be carried out by the Police.\n\nOn 27 January 2012, Helena Kamnar, the Secretary-General of the Government, unofficially told for media that three people had access to the Spectiva remote viewing software, and could also watch the sessions from their home. Kamnar also explained that it was possible to find out who had access in which period but had no information due to the Police having confiscated one of the computers. On 28 January 2012, she told that according to the information she had received from the person who allocated the right to use the system, the three people were Janez Janša, the former Secretary-General Božo Predalič, and the former Secretary-General Milan M. Cvikl. They only had the possibility to use it in their respective terms. Predalič told that he used it perhaps twice, because he was present at Janša's sessions and did not have the option to use it during Pahor's sessions. Cvikl told that he refused to use it as it seemed redundant to him and due to security reasons even demanded it to be uninstalled.\n\nThe confiscated computers were returned to the Secretary-General on 31 January 2012. The next morning, Kamnar found the doors of the secretary open and reasoned that someone had broken in. Nothing was stolen. The Government officially denied any evidence that a criminal act had happened. There were guesses whether the two events could be related, but Kamnar decided there would be no investigation, as the possibility of it being successful was slim and she was to be replaced by the new government. Since February 2012, the government is again led by Janša, and the Secretary-General is again Predalič.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, the information commissioner reported that the measures for the safeguarding of the recordings were inadequate. Although the places where the recording device was situated and the recordings were kept were guarded, there were no revision marks on them, which would enable the tracing of their production, usage, viewing and processing. The law on the protection of personal data was not broken.\n\nIn September 2012, the pre-trial procedure had not been completed yet by the Police.\n\nOn 7 December, the Secretary-General of the Government filed a criminal complaint against the unknown perpetrator and notified about the incident the Criminal Police Directorate and the Office for the Protection of Classified Information. On 8 December, the Slovenian government demanded the removal of the clips from YouTube. On 9 December in the evening, when the publication was reported for the first time by media, there were three clips remaining of the allegedly original five although none had been removed by the host. YouTube had removed the clips on 15 December 2011, after a copyright-related demand by the Slovenian Computer Emergency Response Team (SI–CERT). However, on the same day they appeared again, albeit shorter. They were removed again in less than 24 hours. The clips were republished by users who downloaded them after they have been found by media. The original perpetrator as well as the reuploaders were unknown. The decision about the destruction of the original governmental recordings has not been made yet, pending the results of an inspectional surveillance. After the incident, the recordings were not produced until 26 January. Since then, they have been made only in audio and have been destroyed immediately after extracts had been made. They are not transmitted via cable to another building anymore. In April 2012, the deputy of the Secretary-General stated that the affair cannot repeat itself, because the government had implemented the traceability of users of governmental session video recordings.\n\nA tone clip of a closed government session was inadvertently leaked to the website of the Government already on 2 July 2009. It showed Katarina Kresal, the former Minister of the Interior, and Irma Pavlinič Krebs, the former Minister of Public Administration, in a wrangle about the number of the policemen in Slovenia, and had a large echo in the public. Krebs later commented: \"I didn't know that our areas have ears.\"\n"}

The following list contains a list of a few examples:\n\n\nAgMES as a namespace is designed to include agriculture specific extensions for terms and refinements from established standard metadata namespaces like Dublin Core, AGLS etc. Thus to be used for Document-like Information Objects, for example like publications, articles, books, web sites, papers, etc., it will have to be used in conjunction with the standard namespaces mentioned before. The AgMES initiative strives to achieve improved interoperability between information resources in agricultural domain by enabling means for exchange of information.\n\nDescribing a DLIO with AgMES means exposing its major characteristics and contents in a standard way that can be reused easily in any information system. The more institutions and organizations in the agricultural domain that use AgMES to describe their DLIOs, the easier it will be to interchange data in between information systems like digital libraries and other repositories of agricultural information.\n\nMetadata on agricultural Document-like Information Objects (DLIOs) can be created and stored in various formats:\n\nAgMES defines elements that can be used to describe a DLIO that can be used together with other metadata standards such as the Dublin Core, the Australian Government Locator Service. A complete list of all elements, refinements and schemes endorsed by AgMES is available from the AgMES website.\n\nApplication profiles are defined as schemas which consist of data elements drawn from one or more namespaces, combined by implementers, and optimized for a particular local application. Application profiles share the following four characteristics:\n\n\nOne of the advantages of the AgMES metadata schema is the ability to link between the metadata element and controlled vocabularies. The use of controlled vocabulary provides a \"known\" set of options to the indexer (and the search programmer) as to how the field can be filled out. Often the values may come from a specific thesaurus (e.g. AGROVOC) or classification schemes (e.g. the AGRIS/CARIS classification scheme) etc.\n\nThanks to the possibility to use controlled vocabularies for metadata elements, the user is provided with the most precise information. In this context, work is also being carried out on exploiting the power of controlled vocabularies expressed as using URIs and machine-understandable semantics. In this context, FAO is promoting the Agricultural Ontology Service (AOS) initiative with the objective of expressing more semantics within the traditional thesaurus AGROVOC and build a Concept Server as a repository from which it will be always possible to extract traditional KOS.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "187111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187111", "title": "Ara Pacis", "text": "Ara Pacis\n\nThe Ara Pacis Augustae (Latin, \"Altar of Augustan Peace\"; commonly shortened to Ara Pacis) is an altar in Rome dedicated to Pax, the Roman goddess of Peace. The monument was commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC to honor the return of Augustus to Rome after three years in Hispania and Gaul, and consecrated on January 30, 9 BC. Originally located on the northern outskirts of Rome, a Roman mile from the boundary of the \"pomerium\" on the west side of the Via Flaminia, it stood in the northeastern corner of the Campus Martius, the former flood plain of the Tiber River and gradually became buried under of silt deposits. It was reassembled in its current location, now the Museum of the Ara Pacis, in 1938.\n\nThe altar reflects the Augustan vision of Roman civil religion. The lower register of its frieze depicts vegetal work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the Roman Peace (), while the monument as a whole serves a civic ritual function whilst simultaneously operating as propaganda for Augustus and his regime, easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional Roman culture.\n\nThe monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its center surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends (so called today because of the modern layout) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in Luna marble.\n\nWithin the enclosing precinct walls, the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the \"lex aria\", the law governing the ritual performed at the altar. The sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a Republican style similar to the so-called \"Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus,\" in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls. What remains of the altar is otherwise fragmentary, but it appears to have been largely functional with less emphasis on art and decoration.\n\nThe interior of the precinct walls are carved with bucrania, ox skulls, from which carved garlands hang. The garlands bear fruits from various types of plants, all displayed on a single garland as allegorical representations of plenty and abundance. The bucrania in turn evoke the idea of sacrificial piety, appropriate motifs for the interior of the altar precinct. The lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts, which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in Rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city's \"pomerium.\"\n\nThe exterior walls of the Ara Pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register is compared of scenes of nature: harmonic, intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control. The upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor, his family, and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice. Various togate figures are shown with their heads covered (\"capite velato\"), signifying their role as both priests and sacrificiants. Other figures wear laurel crowns, traditional Roman symbols of victory. Members of individual priestly colleges are depicted in traditional garb appropriate to their office, while lictors can be identified by their iconographic \"fasces\". Women and children are also included among the procession; the depiction of children in Roman sculpture would have been novel at the time of the Altar's construction, evoking themes of moral and familial piety, as well as easing concerns over dynastic intentions while simultaneously introducing potential heirs to the public eye.\n\nThe western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar, although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side. The entryways were flanked by panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes evocative of peace, piety and tradition. On the eastern wall, panels depicted the seated figures of Roma and Pax, while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as Aeneas, but increasingly believed to be Rome's second king, Numa Pompilius. The identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years, relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains, discussed below.\n\nThe sculpture of the Ara Pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative, and its iconography has several levels of significance. Studies of the Ara Pacis and similar public Roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs, and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda. The Ara Pacis is seen to embody without conscious effort the deep-rooted ideological connections among cosmic sovereignty, military force, and fertility that were first outlined by Georges Dumézil, connections which are attested in early Roman culture and more broadly in the substructure of Indo-European culture at large. Peter Holliday suggested that the Altar's imagery of the Golden Age, usually discussed as mere poetic allusion, appealed to a significant component of the Roman populace. The program of the Ara Pacis addressed this group's very real fears of cyclical history, and promised that the rule of Augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought.\n\nThe East and West walls each contain two panels, one well preserved and one represented only in fragments.\n\nThe East Wall contains a badly preserved scene of a female warrior (\"bellatrix\"), possibly Roma, apparently sitting on a pile of weapons confiscated from the enemy, thus forcing peace upon them by rendering them unable to make war. This scene has been reconstructed, based on coins that depict such a seated Roma. When the monument was being reconstructed at its present site, Edmund Buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like. This interpretation, although widely accepted, can not be proved correct, as so little of the original panel survives.\n\nThe other panel is more controversial in its subject, but far better preserved. A goddess sits amid a scene of fertility and prosperity with twins on her lap. Scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is Italia, Tellus (Earth), Venus, and Peace, although other views also circulate. Due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace, and because the Altar is named for \"peace\", the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is Pax.\n\nThe West Wall also contains two panels. The fragmentary \"Lupercal Panel\" apparently preserves the moment when Romulus and Remus were discovered by Faustulus the shepherd, while Mars looks on. Again this panel is a modern drawing without much evidence. Marble fragments of the tree and the head and shoulder of Mars (if it is Mars) and part of a second individual (thought to be Faustulus) survive, but the addition of the she-wolf, Romulus, and Remus is entirely speculative.\n\nThe better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig (the standard sacrifice when Romans made a peace treaty) by an old priest and two attendants. In 1907, this scene was identified by Johannes Sieveking as the moment when Aeneas, newly arrived in Italy, sacrificed a sow and her 30 piglets to Juno, as told by Virgil and others, even though the scene differs greatly from Vergil's description. In the 1960s, Stephan Weinstock challenged this identification (and the very identity of the entire monument), citing numerous discrepancies that Sieveking and his followers had failed to notice between Vergil's version and the panel. Subsequently, the suggestion was made that the scene shows Numa Pompilius, the Roman king associated with Peace and the Gates of Janus. Paul Rehak later published an article with this proposal, confirmed in a chapter of his posthumous book. This theory has won over many scholars, despite considerable initial resistance.\n\nThe long friezes of the Ara Pacis (the North and South Walls) contain figures advancing towards the West, who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the Peace created by Augustus. These figures fall into four categories: lictors (men carrying fasces, bodyguards of magistrates); priests (three of the four major \"collegia\" – \"Pontifices\", \"Septemviri\", and \"Quindecimviri\"): women and children (generally from the imperial family, represented in portraiture); and attendants (a few anonymous figures necessary for religious purposes).\n\nIn addition there are two or three non-Roman children, who may be guests (or hostages) in Rome. Their identification by their non-Roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that Rome is the centre of the world, and that other nations send their young to Rome to learn Roman ways, so great is Rome's reputation. The ceremony took place in the summer of 13 BC, but not necessarily on 4 July, when the Senate voted to build the Ara Pacis.\n\nThe north wall has about 46 extant or partially extant figures. The first two foreground figures are lictors, carrying fasces (bundles of rods symbolizing Roman authority). The next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the Septemviri epulones, so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols. One member of this college is missing in a gap.\n\nAfter them follows the \"collegium\" of the \"quindecimviri sacris faciundis\", also identified by the incense box carried by a public slave among them. Although the name suggests this college has exactly fifteen members, the size of the college has grown to 23, including Augustus and Agrippa, who appear on the South Frieze. The other twenty-one members are present here. Two very badly damaged figures in the middle are split by a gap. From photos, the gap appears to affect a single figure, but as Koeppel, Conlin, and Stern have proven, in-site examination reveals that one is a foreground and the other a background figure.\n\nThe last portion of the North Frieze consists of members of the imperial family. Many scholars used to identify the veiled, leading figure as Julia, daughter of Augustus, but since Julia appears on the South Frieze, it is more likely that this figure is Octavia Minor. Other figures in the entourage might include Marcella (a daughter of Octavia), Iullus Antonius (a son of Mark Antony), and two boys and a girl of the imperial family.\n\nIn 1894, and again in 1902 and 1903, Eugen Petersen suggested that Lucius Caesar appears with Agrippa, dressed in a \"Trojan\" costume for the Troy Game held in 13 BC (see below). Many scholars, realizing by 1935 that Lucius was too young to be the boy beside Agrippa, preferred to identify him as Gaius. They named the smallest child on the North Frieze \"Lucius,\" even though he is a mere toddler (Lucius was four in 13 BC). Some scholars assumed this boy also was a participant in the Troy Games, although he is certainly too young (six or seven was the minimum age). If this toddler were Lucius, he would be too young and in the wrong costume for the Troy Games. The best guess is that he is a Germanic tribal prince, but he is certainly not a dressed as a Trojan. As Charles Brian Rose has noted, \"The variable value of the Eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of Trojan and Parthian iconography can make it difficult to determine whether one is viewing the founders of the Romans or their fiercest opponents.\"\n\nThe youth wearing Hellenistic Greek clothing suited to a Hellenistic prince has been identified as Gaius in the guise of a \"camillus\", an adolescent attendant of the Flamen Dialis. The Gaius identification is best supported by his size, however an additional boy in Roman dress who has a \"bulla\" (but has lost his head!) is also the right size, and therefore a better guess. For Gaius to appear in public without his \"bulla\" would invite the evil eye. This same figure in Hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as Ptolemy of Mauretania representing Africa, along with the German boy (Europe) and the Parthian prince (Asia). A foreign prince would not wear a \"bulla\".\n\nThe South Wall has seen a great deal of scholarship and the greatest number of academic debates. Unlike the North Wall, where most of the heads are new (not authentic ancient heads, but modern creations), the heads of the figures on the South Wall are mostly original. Some half dozen figures are recognizable from looking at other surviving statues of members of the imperial family. Nevertheless, much debate has taken place over many of these figures, including Augustus, Agrippa, Tiberius, Julia, and Antonia.\n\nThe figure of Augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation, and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the Renaissance palazzo built on top of the original Ara Pacis site. Although he was identified correctly in 1903, Petersen, Strong, and Stuart-Jones initially saw the figure as the \"rex sacrorum\". Today Augustus is better recognized by his hair style than his face.\n\nIn the absence of Augustus from the panel, early scholars debated whether this figure was Augustus or Agrippa or Lepidus. In 1907, Sieveking proposed that this figure was Lepidus, the \"Pontifex Maximus\" at the time. Sieveking later reversed his position with a series of peculiar suggestions. In 1926, Loewy compared the Louvre Agrippa of the Agrippa in Copenhagen (and elsewhere) to the Ara Pacis in order to demonstrate iconographical similarity. Aside from a very small minority of scholars (most vehemently defensive of Lepidus in \"Rom. Mitt\" in the 1930s was Ludwig Curtius), the rest of the academy concluded that this figure is Agrippa. Ryberg's 1949 article gave further weight to that conclusion.\n\nMany scholars continue to see the Julia figure as Livia, having reasoned that Livia has to be on the Ara Pacis. Indeed, Livia does appear somewhere (her exclusion is unlikely), but by 13 BC Julia had politically eclipsed Livia, as has been understood and explained by many scholars. The identification dates back to Milani in 1891. Furthermore, Livia has no bond to Agrippa, whereas Julia was his wife and expected to be the unofficial empress of Rome for decades, during and beyond Augustus' lifetime. Julia also better personified Augustus' new pro-natalism program, having already given birth to four surviving children. Nevertheless, a majority of scholars in 2000 preferred to see this figure as Livia.\n\nThe Tiberius figure was identified as such by Milani, an identification that was rarely questioned until the 1940s. Moretti, in making the glass museum for the Ara Pacis at Mussolini's command, guessed that the two consuls (Tiberius and Varus) of 13 flank Augustus, so he saw this figure as M. Valerius Messalla. V.H. von Poulsen and Toynbee proposed Iullus Antonius. But as has been well established, Augustus is flanked by priests, and this figure is Tiberius. Boschung and Bonanno have both matched the face to early period Tiberius statuary.\n\nIn relation to Antonia, Drusus, and Germanicus, H. Dütschke proposed in 1880 the correct identity for Antonia and Drusus, but incorrectly saw the toddler as Claudius. A. von Domaszewski amended this family identification and correctly saw the child as Germanicus. He also suggested that the Ara Pacis is arranged in family groups. He also correctly determined that the two-year-old child could be only Germancius, whose exact birth on 24 May 15 BC is known. This helps prove that the ceremony is an event in 13, although a few scholars continued to argue the ceremony was that of 9 BC (until definitive proof in favor of 13 came out in 1939).\n\nIn relation to the Domitii Ahenobarbi, von Domaszewski also proposed in the same 1903 article that the last family on the South Wall is that of the father of the emperor Nero (born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus). This identification remains widespread today. Pollini provides the best summary of this viewpoint in his article, \"Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis\", where he points out that the writer Suetonius specifically mentions that Nero's father went \"to the East on the staff of the young Gaius Caesar\". As this campaign is known to have begun in 2 BC, it means that Gnaeus must have been of mature age by that time, therefore requiring a birth year of at least 17 BC, which would, in turn, make him sufficiently old to be the boy on the Ara Pacis. Pollini also reasons that the delay in Gnaeus' career (only reaching the consulship in 32 AD) resulted from his documented unpleasant character and points out that the careers of other members of the family with undesirable traits also suffered similar delays, notably Augustus' youngest grandson, Agrippa Postumus, who had no career, and Germanicus' brother, the later emperor, Claudius, whose career started late. However, there are some dissenters from this theory. Stern claims that these figures cannot possibly be the Domitii Ahenobarbi, on the basis of the belief that Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom von Domaszewski saw as the boy of the family, was born after the monument's completion. Syme had also argued that Gnaeus was born after the monument's completion, but accepted the identification of the Ahenobarbus family, preferring to identify the boy as an otherwise unknown elder brother and the girl figure as an otherwise unknown elder sister of Gnaeus—both of whom died young. Syme also proved somewhat unintentionally, based on the inscription \"ILS\" 6095 that Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was governor of Africa in 13 BC and could not be in Rome for the Ara Pacis ceremony.\n\nStarting in 1894, Eugen Petersen suggested that Lucius Caesar appears with Agrippa, dressed in a \"Trojan\" costume for the equestrian event called the Troy Game, which was held in 13 BC for the dedication of the Theater of Marcellus. This theory won universal acceptance for many decades, even though the evidence is overwhelmingly against. The only early challenge was slight: Several scholars, noting the size and age of the boy beside Agrippa, preferred to identify him as Gaius, an opinion that prevailed by 1935. The boy is clearly not a Roman, given his clothing, lack of \"bulla\", and hair. So ingrained was Petersen's theory, however, that when the distinguished scholar Erika Simon (1968, 18) suggested the boy is a barbarian, she was subjected to intense criticism until she retreated (\"e.g\". Mario Torelli (1982, 60 n. 72), once called her opinion \"perfect nonsense\"). Subsequently, led by Charles Brian Rose, scholars have realized Petersen was wrong: the boy is a foreign prince. Stern adds the costume is wrong for a Trojan (no Phrygian hat) and no \"bulla\" – worn by all Roman boys as protection from the evil eye. Many others have contributed to disprove Petersen's theory.\n\n\nIn 1938 the finally reconstructed Ara was placed near the Mausoleum of Augustus, and a big pavilion was built around it by architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo as part of Benito Mussolini's attempt to create an ancient Roman \"theme park\" to glorify Fascist Italy. Several dozens of the buildings surrounding the Mausoleum were leveled to free up space around the monument. This led to a great number of complaints from the locals and the surrounding city, starting a long series of arguments and criticisms of the Ara Pacis project. These arguments are ongoing despite having the original pavilion replaced by a new one in 2006, known as \"Ara Pacis museum\".\n\nThe historic Fascist style building around the Altar, locally known as \"teca del Morpurgo\", was pulled down in 2006, and replaced by a glass and steel structure in modern style, designed by architect Richard Meier. The new cover building, which has been named \"Ara Pacis museum\", now stands on the same site as Mussolini's structure. This new structure is much bigger than previous one and it is divided in multiple rooms and sections besides the main one containing the altar.\n\nMeier's building construction caused new arguments and criticism, after the ones which accompanied the first building construction, both from Rome inhabitants and stranger observers, probably due both to political memory tied to the pre-existent pavilion and to visual impact of the new pavilion, which in opinion of many is in great contrast with surrounding historical buildings.\n\nNicolai Ouroussoff, of \"The New York Times\" called the building “a contemporary expression of what can happen when an architect fetishizes his own style out of a sense of self-aggrandizement. Absurdly overscale, it seems indifferent to the naked beauty of the dense and richly textured city around it.” The presiding right-wing mayor Gianni Alemanno, backed since July 2008 by culture undersecretary Francesco Maria Giro said he would tear down the new structure. Mayor Alemanno has since changed his stance on the building and has agreed with Mr. Meier to modifications including drastically reducing the height of the wall between an open-air space outside the museum and a busy road along the Tiber river. The city plans to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. \"It's an improvement,\" says Meier, adding that \"the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one.\" The mayor’s office said Alemanno hopes to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, at the highest levels of play, both sports are separated into two standardized halves of equal time, allowing for extra time to be played at the referee's discretion to make up for any time wasted.\n\nIn futsal, that standardized time for each half is 20 minutes and in association football, the standardized time for each half is 45 minutes.\n\nAlso in futsal, teams are allowed to stop the clock once per half, something not allowed in association football.\n\nUnlike in association football, futsal keeps track of fouls that award a direct free kick, also known as \"accumulated foul.\"\n\nUpon the sixth accumulated foul in a half and every accumulated foul after the sixth, the free kick is generally taken from what is known as the \"second penalty mark,\"\n\nAfter the sixth accumulated foul, the advantage rule generally no longer applies, with referees granting an immediate free kick outside of very clear goal scoring opportunities.\n\nIf the infringement takes place in the attacking half of the pitch, the fouled player may take the free kick from the spot of the infringement or from the second penalty mark, which on a regulation futsal pitch is 10 metres from the goal (the penalty mark is six metres from the goal.)\n\nUnlike a penalty kick, the goalkeeper is required only to stay 5 metres from the spot of the free kick and does not have to stay on the goal line until the ball is kicked. The player kicking the ball must also shoot at the goal and all other players must stay behind the ball until the ball is kicked.\n\nIn association football, a player is an offside position is they are beyond the half-line, beyond the second to last defender or beyond the ball at the moment when their teammate touches the ball, excluding when the teammate is engaged in a goal kick, throw-in, or corner kick.\n\nThey are committing an infringement if they are in an offside position and are interfering with an opponent, interfering with play or gaining an advantage from being in an offside position.\n\nIn futsal, there is no comparable offside rule, although a portion of the Laws of the Game is dedicated to indicating that there is no offside rule.\n\n\n\nAlthough in both sports, the referee has discretion over which players can or cannot come into the pitch, but in futsal substitutions can happen during play provided that players come on and off the pitch simultaneously and through a designated area.\n\nIn association football, players must wait until a stoppage in play to enter the pitch, and then only after the referee has been advised of the substitution. Although there are many variations, at the highest levels of competition, generally three substitutions are allowed per side during a match.\n\nIn football, the penalty kick is taken at a spot inside the center of the Penalty Area 12 yards from the goal, called the penalty mark.\n\nIn futsal, the first penalty mark is analogous to the penalty mark in football and is 6 metres from the midpoint of the goalposts.\n"}

{"id": "28559148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28559148", "title": "Critica Botanica", "text": "Critica Botanica\n\nCritica Botanica (\"Critique of botany\", Leiden, July, 1737) was written by Swedish botanist, physician, zoologist and naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778). The book was published in Germany when Linnaeus was twenty-nine with a discursus by the botanist Johannes Browallius (1707–1755), bishop of Åbo. The first and only edition was published in July 1737 under the full title \"Critica botanica in qua nomina plantarum generica, specifica & variantia examini subjiciuntur, selectoria confirmantur, indigna rejiciuntur; simulque doctrina circa denominationem plantarum traditur. Seu Fundamentorum botanicorum pars IV Accedit Johannis Browallii De necessitate historiae naturalis discursus\".\n\nLinnaeus’s principles of botanical nomenclature were first expounded in \"Fundamenta Botanica\" (\"Foundations of botany\") of 1736 chapters VII to X which contained the aphorisms (principles) 210 to 324 that outlined the rules for the acceptance and formation of names. These were later elaborated, with numerous examples, in his \"Critica Botanica\" of 1737. The practical application of these rules was soon seen in subsequent publications such as \"Flora Lapponica\" (\"Flora of Lapland\", 1737), \"Hortus Cliffortianus\" (\"In honour of Clifford's garden\", 1738), and \"Flora Svecica\" (\"Flora of Sweden\", 1746). Together the \"Fundamenta\" and \"Critica\" summarised Linnaeus's thoughts on plant nomenclature and classification which he later revised and elaborated in his \"Philosophia Botanica\" of 1751.\n\nIn the \"Critica\" Linnaeus presented a series of rules which guided him in his own publications, established standards of procedure for his followers, and led him to discard on a grand scale the names used by his predecessors. Many of his canons have long since been disregarded, but they ensured that modern botanical nomenclature at least began with a series of well-formed, euphonious and convenient names.\n\nTo understand the objectives of the \"Critica\" it is first necessary to appreciate the state of botanical nomenclature at the time of Linnaeus. In accordance with the provisions of the present-day International Code of Botanical Nomenclature the starting point for the scientific names of plants effectively dates back to the list of species enumerated in Linnaeus’s \"Species Plantarum\", ed. 1, published 1 May 1753. The \"Species Plantarum\" was, for European scientists, a comprehensive global Flora for its day, and by the 10th edition had reached over 3000 species. Linnaeus had learned plant names as short descriptive phrases (polynomials) known as \"nomina specifica\". Each time a new species was described the diagnostic phrase-names had to be adjusted, and lists of names, especially those including synonyms (alternative names for the same plant) became extremely unwieldy. Linnaeus’s solution was to associate with the generic name an additional single word, what he termed the \"nomen triviale\", to designate a species. Linnaeus emphasized that this was simply a matter of convenience, it was not to replace the diagnostic \"nomen specificum\". But over time the \"nomen triviale\" became the “real” name and the \"nomen specificum\" became the Latin “diagnosis” that must, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, accompany the description of all new plant species: it was that part of the plant description distinguishing that particular species from all others. Linnaeus did not invent the binomial system but he was the person who provided the theoretical framework that lead to its universal acceptance.\n\nThe second word of the binomial, the \"nomen triviale\" as Linnaeus called it, is now known as the \"specific epithet\" and the two words, the \"generic name\" and \"specific epithet\" together make up the \"species name\".\n\n\"Systema Naturæ\" was Linnaeus’s early attempt to organise nature. The first edition was published in 1735 and in it he outlines his ideas for the hierarchical classification of the natural world (the “system of nature”) by dividing it into the animal kingdom (\"Regnum animale\"), the plant kingdom (\"Regnum vegetabile\") and the \"mineral kingdom\" (\"Regnum lapideum\") each of which he further divided into classes, orders, genera and species, with [generic] characters, [specific] differences, synonyms, and places of occurrence. The tenth edition of this book in 1758 has been adopted as the starting point for zoological nomenclature. The first edition of 1735 was just eleven pages long, but this expanded with further editions until the final thirteenth edition of 1767 had reached over 3000 pages.\n\nIn the early eighteenth century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms. This highlighted difficulties in communication about plants, the replication of descriptions, and the importance of an agreed way of presenting, publishing and applying plant names. From about 1730 when Linnaeus was in his early twenties and still in Uppsala, Sweden, he planned a listing all the genera and species of plants known to western science in his day. Before this could be achieved he needed to establish the principles of classification and nomenclature on which these works were to be based.\nFrom 1735 to 1738 Linnaeus worked in the Netherlands where he was personal physician to George Clifford (1685–1760) a wealthy Anglo-Dutch merchant–banker with the Dutch East India Company who had an impressive garden containing four large glasshouses that were filled with tropical and sub-tropical plants collected overseas. Linnaeus was enthralled by these collections and prepared a detailed systematic catalogue of the plants in the garden, which he published in 1738 as \"Hortus Cliffortianus\". It was during this exceptionally productive period of his life that he published the works that were to lay the foundations for biological nomenclature. These were \"Fundamenta Botanica\" (1736) (\"Foundations of botany\"), \"Bibliotheca Botanica\" (\"Botanical bibliography\", 1736), and \"Critica Botanica\" (1737) He soon put his theoretical ideas into practice in his \"Genera Plantarum\" (\"Genera of plants\", 1737), \"Flora Lapponica\" (1737), \"Classes Plantarum\" (\"Plant classes\", 1738), and \"Hortus Cliffortianus\" (1738). The ideas he explored in these works were revised until, in 1751, his mature thinking was finally published as \"Philosophia Botanica\" (\"Science of botany\") released simultaneously in Stockholm and Amsterdam.\n\nWith the foundations of plant nomenclature and classification now in place Linnaeus then set about the monumental task of describing all the plants known in his day and, with the publication of \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753, his ambitions of the 1730s were finally accomplished. \"Species Plantarum\" was his most acclaimed work and a summary of all his botanical knowledge. Here was a global Flora that codified the usage of morphological terminology and acted as a bibliography of all the pre-Linnaean botanical literature of scientific importance. It presented his new 'sexual system' of plant classification and became the starting point for scientific botanical nomenclature for 6000 of the 10,000 species he estimated made up the world’s flora. Here too, for the first time, the species, rather than the genus, becomes the fundamental taxonomic unit. Linnaeus defined species as \" ... \"all structures in nature that do not owe their shape to the conditions of the growth place and other occasional features\".” There was also the innovation of the now familiar \"nomen triviale\" (pl. \"nomina trivialia\") of the binary name although Linnaeus still regarded the real names as the \"differentiae specificae\" or “phrase names” which embodied the diagnosis for the species – although be was eventually to regard the trivial name (specific epithet) as one of his great inventions. Sketches of the book are known from 1733 and the final effort resulted in his temporary collapse.\n\nThe \"Fundamenta Botanica\" (“The Foundations of Botany”) of 1736 consisted of 365 aphorisms (principles) with principles 210–324 devoted to nomenclature. He followed this form of presentation in his other work on nomenclature. Linnaeus apparently regarded these as a “grammar and a syntax” for the study of botany. Chapters VII to X comprised principles 210 to 324 to do with the nomenclature of genera, species and varieties and how to treat synonyms. The \"Critica Botanica\" was an extension of these nomenclatural chapters of the \"Fundamenta\". \"Critica Botanica\" which was published a year later in July 1737, the principles of the \"Fundamenta\" are repeated essentially unchanged but with extensive additions in smaller print. It was this work, with its dogmatic, often amusing and provocative statements, that was to spread his ideas and enthrall intellects of the stature of Goethe. He was, however, dismissive of botanical work other than taxonomy and presented his principles as dogma rather than reasoned argument.\n\nThese works established ground rules in a field which, at this time, had only “gentlemen's agreements”. Conventions such as: no two genera should have the same name; no universally agreed mechanisms. \"Genera Plantarum\" ran to five editions, the first in 1737 containing short descriptions of the 935 plant genera known at that time. Observing his own principle to keep generic names as short, euphonious, distinctive and memorable as possible he rejected many names that had gone before, including those of his fellow botanists which was not popular. In their place he used names that commemorated patrons, friends and fellow botanists as well as many names taken from Greek and Roman mythology.\n\nBy far the most important section of the \"Critica\" is that dealing with generic names – here we clearly see the forces shaping the present-day provisions of the \"Botanical Code\". In the \"Philosophia Botanica\" § 159 Linnaeus had stated that a genus of plants was a group of species possessing similarly constructed organs of fructification, i.e. flowers and fruits, and hence distinguishable by these from other genera.\nSome examples of the aphorisms (principles) concerned with genera are given below:\n\nLinnaeus considered that generic names should be apt in meaning, pleasant to hear, easy to say, and not more than 12 letters long. He advocates the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names, quoting his own name as an example:\n\nAnd in relation to specific names:\n\nLinnaeus's system of classification follows the principles of Aristotelian logic by which arranging subjects into classes is classification; distinguishing divisions of classes is logical division. The group to be divided is the genus; the parts into which it is divided are the species. The terms genus and species acquired their specialized biological usage from Linnaeus's predecessors, in particular Ray and Tournefort. There was also the question of whether plants should a) be put together or separated because they conform to a definition (essentialism) or b) put together with plants having similar characteristics generally, regardless of the definition (empiricism). Linnaeus was inclined to take the first approach using the Method of Logical Division based on definition, what he called in \"Philosophia Botanica\" §152 the \"dispositio theoretica\" – but in practice he employed both methods.\n\nBotanical historian Alan Morton, though praising Linnaeus’s contribution to classification and nomenclature, is less complimentary about the theoretical ideas expressed in the publications discussed above:\n\nLinnaean historian, chronicler, and analyst Frans Stafleu points out that Linnaeus's training and background was scholastic. He excelled in logic ...\"which was almost certainly the Aristotelian and Thomistic logic generally taught in secondary schools all over Europe\".:\n\nLinnaeus's philosophical approach to classification is also noted by botanist David Frodin who observed that applying the \"methodus naturalis\" to books and people as well as plants, animals and minerals, was a mark of Linnaeus's ‘scholastic’ view of the world:\n\nFinally, Linnaean scholar William T. Stearn has summarised Linnaeus's contribution to biology as follows:\nFull bibliographic details including exact dates of publication, pagination, editions, facsimiles, brief outline of contents, location of copies, secondary sources, translations, reprints, travelogues, and commentaries are given in Stafleu and Cowan's \"Taxonomic Literature\".\n\n"}

It provides the legal framework for federal records management, including record creation, maintenance, and disposition.\n\nThe Federal Records Act came following the recommendations of the Hoover Commission (1947-49). The act, and its related regulations, require each federal agency to establish an ongoing program for records management and to cooperate with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). A 1985 NARA pamphlet describes the Federal Records Act as the \"basis for the Federal Government's policies and procedures for creating, maintaining, and disposing of Federal records. The act and its related regulations define Federal records, mandate the creation and preservation of those records necessary to document Federal activities, establish Government ownership of records, and provide the exclusive legal procedures for the disposition of records.\" The Second Hoover Commission (1953-55) addressed paperwork management and recommended the adoption of program relating to \"directives management, reports management, paperwork quality control, and clerical work measurement.\" As a result, the first \"Guide to Record Retention Requirements\" was published in 1955; the guide is updated annually and is used by archivists and other record managers both in and out of government.\n\nThe Federal Records Act was amended over time. Amendments in 1976 emphasized paperwork reduction and information lifecycle management. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, which followed the issuance of the report of the Commission on Federal Paperwork in 1977, introduced information resources management and gave responsibility to the Office of Management and Budget for creating federal information policy standards.\n\nIn November 2014, the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 was signed into law by President Barack Obama.

The act also grants the Archivist of the United States the final determination as to what constitutes a Federal record; \"authorizes the early transfer of permanent electronic federal and presidential records to the National Archives, while legal custody remains with the agency or the president\"; \"clarifies the responsibilities of federal government officials when using non-government email systems\"; and \"empowers the National Archives to safeguard original and classified records from unauthorized removal.\"\n\n"}

He learned to trade while serving in the United States army in Shanghai and on his return to the US bought and sold small newspapers, 13 in all. He spent the rest of his career advising on investments and writing books and his eponymous newsletter. He has been closely associated with libertarian causes.\n\nHarry Schultz was born in 1923 and raised in Milwaukee, United States. He served in the United States Army during the Second World War when he was stationed in Shanghai and began to trade shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. He discovered that he could make money even in a foreign environment: \"I bought and sold silk, bank shares, currency and made a small fortune (very small) in a high inflation economy. I also bought and sold gold coins and bars.\"\n\nAs a child he had produced a newspaper for his family, neighbours and school using a typewriter and later a mimeograph machine. In the army, he read voraciously and planned to buy a real newspaper on his discharge with the money he had made from trading. He managed to accumulate enough for a down-payment on a weekly newspaper in Palm Springs, California, which he turned into a daily and sold to \"The Sun\". He owned a further twelve newspapers during his involvement with that business, specialising in buying small papers, improving them and selling them on.\n\nSchultz published \"The International Harry Schultz Letter\" for 45 years, starting around 1963. It was known for its somewhat folksy and eccentric tone. Readers were said by \"The Times\" in 1968 to include Enoch Powell and Richard Nixon, while \"New Internationalist\" magazine in 1981 named Margaret Thatcher, Sir Keith Joseph, South African finance minister Owen Horwood and Saudi Arabian oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani as readers. In addition to his newsletter, Schultz is known for his advice on investing in bear markets which he first wrote about in his 1964 book, \"Bear markets: how to survive and make money in them\". He expanded on his ideas of profiting from adversity in his 1972 book, \"Panics & crashes and how you can make money out of them\". His 1964 book was reprinted and updated in 2002 as \"Bear market investing strategies\".\n\nHe appeared in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as the most highly paid investment consultant in the world and, according to Schultz, he was the model for the character of Lewis Dorsey in Arthur Hailey's bestselling novel \"The Moneychangers\", who also writes a financial newsletter.\n\nSchultz has been associated with the libertarian movement and has written a guide to using Swiss banks. He is credited with inventing the Three Flags Theory which proposes that everyone should have a second passport, an address in a tax haven and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. According to \"New Internationalist\" magazine, he was one of the trustees of the Phoenix Foundation which unsuccessfully attempted to establish small libertarian states in the 1970s.

{"id": "29991636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29991636", "title": "Idola theatri", "text": "Idola theatri\n\nIdola theatri (singular Idolum theatri) is a type of tendency towards logical fallacy or error, normally translated as \"Idols of the Theatre.\" The Latin was coined by Sir Francis Bacon in his \"Novum Organum\"—one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. Bacon described them as \"Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration.\" He named them Idols of the Theater \"because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion.\"\n\nThe term is one of four such \"idols,\" that represent \"idols and false notions\" that are \"in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\". Of these, the Idola theatri is the most avoidable, being caused by particular historical situations, such as when there is a lot of interest in religion, and no strong monarch to repress such discussion.\n\nBesides \"idola theatri\", there are also \"idola tribus\" (Idols of the Tribe, stemming from human nature itself), \"idola specus\", (Idols of the cave, stemming from a person's particular tendencies), and \"idola fori\" (Idols of the Market Place, coming from the influence of our human language and its usages).\n\nAccording to Howard B. White:In the famous discussion of the four idols, Bacon says that only one kind, the Idols of the Theater, are not innate; nor do they steal \"into the understanding secretly.\" Therefore, they, at least, can be removed.(N.O. I,61) Since, alone among all the idols, they are created by philosophical systems, alone, among all the idols, they may be removed by philosophical systems. Obviously, the principal idol of the theater to Bacon was Aristotle.\n\nBut Aristotle was not the only example for Bacon, who wrote:Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue, or only of the ancient sects and philosophies, that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems, but also of many principles and axioms in science, which by tradition, credulity, and negligence have come to be received.\n\nConcerning the number of variations of this type, Bacon says furthermore:Idols of the Theater, or of Systems, are many, and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. For were it not that now for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments, especially monarchies, have been averse to such novelties, even in matters speculative; so that men labor therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes — not only unrewarded, but exposed also to contempt and envy — doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks. For as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed, so likewise (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy. And in the plays of this philosophical theater you may observe the same thing which is found in the theater of the poets, that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant, and more as one would wish them to be, than true stories out of history.\n\nNevertheless, he distinguished three types for special attention:\n\n\nBacon said that, in his time, the last type, the superstitious, was most common, and did the most harm.\n\nSuperstition was the subject of one of Bacon's well-known Essays, and as Howard B White points out, Bacon made it clear that he considered Catholicism, for example, to be a form of Christian superstition, and that he felt atheism to be superior to superstition. But \"while the classics also regarded superstition as at variance with philosophy\" they did not \"regard it as necessary or desirable to wage an onslaught against existing superstition\".\n\n\n"}

Johannes Cornelis de Jonge (9 May 1793 in Zierikzee – 12 June 1853 in The Hague) was a Dutch \"Rijksarchivaris\" (Chief Archivist of the Dutch National Archives), historian, and politician. He is best known for his encyclopedic \"Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen\", a naval history of the Netherlands that was based on the Dutch naval archives, a large part of which were destroyed in a fire in the archives of theDutch Department of the Navy in 1844. By default therefore this history had to come in the place of the lost primary documents.\n\nDe Jonge was born in an old \"patrician\" family of Zeeland notables (his ancestor Bonifacius de Jonge had been \"Raadpensionaris\" of Zeeland from 1615 to 1625), for which reason he and his family received the aristocratic title of Jonkheer, when king William I of the Netherlands reorganized the Dutch aristocracy in 1814. He was the son of Willem Adriaan de Jonge van Campens Nieuwland and Cornelia Petronella Mogge Pous. As a boy he was already interested in history, and he was instrumental in saving a number of medieval Zeeland charters from being auctioned off in 1810 by the French authorities in his native city of Zierikzee. This brought him to the attention of Hendrik van Wijn, the first archivist of the Batavian Republic, who became the first \"Rijksarchivaris\" in the new Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1814, and nominated de Jonge as his deputy in that year. Meanwhile, de Jonge was pursuing his studies in jurisprudence and history at Leiden University, and as a member of the \"studentenweerbaarheid\" (student militia) he took part in the with the Dutch army. After his return to Leiden he received his doctorate in law and history on 27 July 1816 with the doctoral thesis \"Diplomata quaedam Hollandica et Zelandica partim inedita partim emendata animadversionibus illustrata\".\n\nHe married Henrietta Philippina Jacoba van Kretschmar on 18 September 1816 with whom he had five children. He died after suffering a stroke in his mansion \"Huize Zuidhoorn\" near Rijswijk/The Hague in 1853.\n\nHe was appointed \"substituut\" (deputy) \"Rijksarchivaris\" in March 1814. In 1816 he was also appointed superintendent of the \"Koninklijk Kabinet van Munten, Penningen en Gesneden Stenen\" (Royal Dutch Numismatic Collection). In both offices he promoted the accessibility of the collections of archival sources and coins by publishing catalogs. He wrote a large number of historical publications and published facsimile publications of historical documents, in which he used his direct access to the archives.\n\nIn 1831, after the death of his mentor Van Wijn, he himself was appointed \"Rijksarchivaris\". In this period he wrote his \"magnum opus\" on the history of the Dutch navy: \"Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen\" (6 volumes, between 1833 and 1848). In 1833 he obtained the original copy of the Union of Utrecht treaty for the National Archives from the \"Koninklijke Bibliotheek\", and a large collection of original medieval charters that had previously been held in the Charter room of the County, later Province, of Holland.\n\nDe Jonge was also politically active. He was appointed a member of the Municipal Council of The Hague in 1825. In that capacity he became editor of the \"Dagblad voor Zuid-Holland en 's-Gravenhage\" (the official publication of the city) in 1827. In 1844 he was elected \"wethouder\" (alderman) of The Hague, which he remained till his death. He was also a member of the \"Provinciale Staten\" of the province of South Holland between 1840 and 1851.\n\nThe following is a selection of his published works:\n\n"}

{"id": "21073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21073", "title": "Mad (magazine)", "text": "Mad (magazine)\n\nMad (stylized as MAD) is an American humor magazine founded in 1952 by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, launched as a comic book before it became a magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1974 circulation peak. From 1952 until 2018, \"Mad\" published 550 regular issues, as well as hundreds of reprint \"Specials\", original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. The magazine's numbering reverted to 1 with its June 2018 issue, coinciding with the magazine's headquarters move to the West Coast.\n\nThe magazine is the last surviving title from the EC Comics line, offering satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format is divided into a number of recurring segments such as TV and movie parodies, as well as freeform articles. \"Mad\"s mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, is typically the focal point of the magazine's cover, with his face often replacing that of a celebrity or character who is lampooned within the issue.\n\n\"Mad\" began as a comic book published by EC, debuting in August 1952 (cover date October–November), and located in lower Manhattan at 225 Lafayette Street. In the early 1960s, the \"Mad\" office moved to 485 Madison Avenue, a location given in the magazine as \"485 MADison Avenue\".\n\nThe first issue was written almost entirely by Harvey Kurtzman, and featured illustrations by Kurtzman, along with Wally Wood, Will Elder, Jack Davis, and John Severin. Wood, Elder, and Davis were the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.\n\nTo retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue #24 (1955). The switchover only induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but crucially, the move had removed \"Mad\" from the strictures of the Comics Code Authority. After Kurtzman's departure in 1956, new editor Al Feldstein swiftly brought aboard contributors such as Don Martin, Frank Jacobs, and Mort Drucker, and later Antonio Prohías, Dave Berg, and Sergio Aragonés. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.\n\nWhen Feldstein retired in 1984, he was replaced by the team of Nick Meglin and John Ficarra, who co-edited \"Mad\" for the next two decades. Following Meglin's retirement in 2004, Ficarra continued as executive editor for 13 years, until the publishing company announced in June 2017 that \"Mad\" would relocate to Burbank, California. Bill Morrison succeeded him in January 2018.\n\nGaines sold his company in the early 1960s to the Kinney Parking Company, which also acquired National Periodicals (a.k.a. DC Comics) and Warner Bros. by the end of that decade. Gaines was named a Kinney board member, and was largely permitted to run \"Mad\" as he saw fit without corporate interference.\n\nFollowing Gaines' death, \"Mad\" became more ingrained within the Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue, and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics' offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 Broadway. In 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. \"Mad\" ended its 65-year run in Manhattan at the end of 2017, when its offices relocated to DC Entertainment headquarters in Burbank, California.\n\nIn its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and seven times a year. By the end of 1958, \"Mad\" had settled on an unusual eight-times-a-year schedule, which lasted almost four decades. Issues would go on sale 7 to 9 weeks before the start of the month listed on the cover. Gaines felt the atypical timing was necessary to maintain the magazine's level of quality. \"Mad\" then began producing additional issues, until it reached a traditional monthly schedule with the January 1997 issue. With its 500th issue (June 2009), amid company-wide cutbacks at Time Warner, the magazine temporarily regressed to a quarterly publication before settling to six issues per year in 2010.\n\nThough there are antecedents to \"Mad\"s style of humor in print, radio and film, \"Mad\" became a pioneering example of it. Throughout the 1950s, \"Mad\" featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture—such as Archie and Superman—with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by Dave Kehr in \"The New York Times\": \"Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding on the radio, Ernie Kovacs on television, Stan Freberg on records, Harvey Kurtzman in the early issues of \"Mad\": all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives.\" Bob and Ray, Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to \"Mad\".\n\nIn 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in \"The New York Times\" about the then 25-year-old publication's initial effect:\n\n\"Mad\" is often credited with filling a vital gap in political satire from the 1950s to 1970s, when Cold War paranoia and a general culture of censorship prevailed in the United States, especially in literature for teens. Activist Tom Hayden said, \"My own radical journey began with \"Mad Magazine\".\" The rise of such factors as cable television and the Internet has diminished the influence and impact of \"Mad\", although it remains a widely distributed magazine. In a way, \"Mad\"s power has been undone by its own success: what was subversive in the 1950s and 1960s is now commonplace. However, its impact on three generations of humorists is incalculable, as can be seen in the frequent references to \"Mad\" on the animated series \"The Simpsons\". \"Simpsons\" producer Bill Oakley said, \"The Simpsons has transplanted \"Mad\" magazine. Basically everyone who was young between 1955 and 1975 read \"Mad\", and that's where your sense of humor came from. And we knew all these people, you know, Dave Berg and Don Martin – all heroes, and unfortunately, now all dead. And I think \"The Simpsons\" has taken that spot in America's heart.\" In 2009, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"\"Mad\" once defined American satire; now it heckles from the margins as all of culture competes for trickster status.\" Longtime contributor Al Jaffee described the dilemma to an interviewer in 2010: \"When \"Mad\" first came out, in 1952, it was the only game in town. Now, you've got graduates from \"Mad\" who are doing The Today Show or Stephen Colbert or Saturday Night Live. All of these people grew up on \"Mad\". Now \"Mad\" has to top them. So \"Mad\" is almost in a competition with itself.\"\n\n\"Mad\"s satiric net was cast wide. The magazine often featured parodies of ongoing American culture, including advertising campaigns, the nuclear family, the media, big business, education and publishing. In the 1960s and beyond, it satirized such burgeoning topics as the sexual revolution, hippies, the generation gap, psychoanalysis, gun politics, pollution, the Vietnam War and recreational drug use. The magazine took a generally negative tone towards counterculture drugs such as cannabis and LSD, but also savaged mainstream drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. \"Mad\" always satirized Democrats as mercilessly as it did Republicans. In 2007, Al Feldstein recalled, \"We even used to rake the hippies over the coals. They were protesting the Vietnam War, but we took aspects of their culture and had fun with it. \"Mad\" was wide open. Bill loved it, and he was a capitalist Republican. I loved it, and I was a liberal Democrat. That went for the writers, too; they all had their own political leanings, and everybody had a voice. But the voices were mostly critical. It was social commentary, after all.\" \"Mad\" also ran a good deal of less topical or contentious material on such varied subjects as fairy tales, nursery rhymes, greeting cards, sports, small talk, poetry, marriage, comic strips, awards shows, cars and many other areas of general interest.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Los Angeles Times\" Robert Boyd wrote, \"All I really need to know I learned from \"Mad\" magazine\", going on to assert:\n\nIn 1988, Geoffrey O'Brien wrote about the impact \"Mad\" had upon the younger generation of the 1950s:\n\nIn 1994, Brian Siano in \"The Humanist\" discussed the effect of \"Mad\" on that segment of people already disaffected from society:\n\nPulitzer Prize–winning art comics maven Art Spiegelman said, \"The message \"Mad\" had in general is, 'The media is lying to you, and we are part of the media.' It was basically... 'Think for yourselves, kids.'\" William Gaines offered his own view: when asked to cite \"Mad\"s philosophy, his boisterous answer was, \"We must never stop reminding the reader what little value they get for their money!\"\n\nComics historian Tom Spurgeon picked \"Mad\" as the medium's top series of all time, writing, \"At the height of its influence, \"Mad\" was \"The Simpsons\", \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Onion\" combined.\" Graydon Carter chose it as the sixth best magazine of any sort ever, describing \"Mad\"s mission as being \"ever ready to pounce on the illogical, hypocritical, self-serious and ludicrous\" before concluding, \"Nowadays, it's part of the oxygen we breathe.\" Joyce Carol Oates called it \"wonderfully inventive, irresistibly irreverent and intermittently ingenious.\"\n\nArtist Dave Gibbons said, \"When you think of the people who grew up in the ’50s and ’60s, the letters M-A-D were probably as influential as L-S-D, in that it kind of expanded people’s consciousness and showed them an alternative view of society and consumer culture — mocked it, satirized it.\" Gibbons also noted that \"Mad\" was an overt influence on \"Watchmen\", the acclaimed 12-issue comic book series created by writer Alan Moore and himself:\nMonty Python's Terry Gilliam wrote, \"\"Mad\" became the Bible for me and my whole generation.\" Underground cartoonist Bill Griffith said of his youth, “\"Mad\" was a life raft in a place like Levittown, where all around you were the things that \"Mad\" was skewering and making fun of.\" When Weird Al Yankovic was asked whether \"Mad\" had had any influence in putting him on a road to a career in parody, the musician replied, \"[It was] more like going off a cliff.\" Comedian Jerry Seinfeld talked about the magazine's impact on him, saying, \"You start reading it, and you're going, 'These people don't respect \"anything\".' And that just exploded my head. It was like, you don't have to buy it. You can say 'This is stupid. This is stupid.'\" Critic Roger Ebert wrote:\n\nRock singer Patti Smith said more succinctly, \"After \"Mad\", drugs were nothing.\"\n\nThe magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the United States Supreme Court. The most far-reaching was \"Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.\" In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers and Cole Porter filed a $25 million lawsuit against \"Mad\" for copyright infringement following \"Sing Along With \"Mad\"\", a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be \"sung to the tune of\" many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song's composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of \"Mad\" in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute. However, in the case of two parodies, \"Always\" (sung to the tune of \"Always\") and \"There's No Business Like No Business\" (sung to the tune of \"There's No Business Like Show Business\"), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of copyright infringement was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks (\"always\" and \"business\") as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-\"Mad\" decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Circuit Judge Irving Kaufman pointedly observed, \"We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in iambic pentameter.\" The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, thus allowing the decision to stand.\n\nThis precedent-setting case established the rights of parodists and satirists to mimic the meter of popular songs. However, the \"Sing Along With \"Mad\"\" songbook was not the magazine's first venture into musical parody. In 1960, \"Mad\" had published \"My Fair Ad-Man\", a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical \"My Fair Lady\". In 1959, \"If Gilbert & Sullivan wrote \"Dick Tracy\"\" was one of the speculative pairings in \"If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics\".\n\nIn 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the Alfred E. Neuman image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of \"Mad \" – or anyone else for that matter – to use the image. In addition, \"Mad\" established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.\n\nOther legal disputes were settled more easily. Following the magazine's parody of the film \"The Empire Strikes Back\", a letter from George Lucas' lawyers arrived in \"Mad\"'s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures. The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that Lucasfilm must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages. Unbeknownst to Lucas' lawyers, \"Mad\" had received a letter days earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist Mort Drucker and writer Dick DeBartolo \"the Leonardo da Vinci and George Bernard Shaw of comic satire.\" Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas' letter, added the handwritten notation \"Gee, your boss George liked it!\" across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers. Said DeBartolo, \"We never heard from them again.\"\n\n\"Mad\" was one of several parties that filed \"amicus curiae\" briefs with the Supreme Court in support of 2 Live Crew and its disputed song parody, during the 1993 \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" case..\n\n\"Mad\" was long noted for its absence of advertising, enabling it to satirize materialist culture without fear of reprisal. For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free, beginning with issue #33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue #402 (February 2001).\n\nAs a comic book, \"Mad\" had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line. The magazine later made a deal with Moxie soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. \"Mad\" ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled \"real advertisement\" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original \"Mad\" regime was for Famous Artists School; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue #34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in \"Mad\" for decades were house ads for \"Mad\"'s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of \"Mad\" jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as Parker Brothers \"Mad Board Game\", the video game based on \"Spy vs. Spy\", and the notorious \"Up the Academy\" movie (which the magazine later disowned). \"Mad\" explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.\n\nBoth Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising \"Mad\"'s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered \"Ballyhoo\", a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house \"Mad\" ad agency, and produced a \"dummy\" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\", \"We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.\" Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:\n\n\"Mad\" is known for many regular and semi-regular recurring features in its pages, including \"Spy vs. Spy\", the \"Mad Fold-in\", \"The Lighter Side of...\" and its television and movie parodies. The magazine has also included recurring gags and references, both visual (e.g. the \"Mad\" Zeppelin, or Arthur the potted plant) and linguistic (unusual words such as axolotl, furshlugginer, potrzebie and veeblefetzer).\n\nThe image most closely associated with the magazine is that of Alfred E. Neuman, the boy with misaligned eyes, a gap-toothed smile, and the perennial motto \"What, me worry?\" The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before \"Mad\" adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with \"Mad\".\n\n\"Mad\" initially used the boy's face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for President on issue #30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his \"What, me worry?\" motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to \"Mad\" writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the U.S. mail bearing only Neuman's face, without any address or other identifying information.\n\n\"Mad\" has provided an ongoing showcase for many long-running satirical writers and artists and has fostered an unusual group loyalty. Although several of the contributors earn far more than their \"Mad\" pay in fields such as television and advertising, they have steadily continued to provide material for the publication. Among the notable artists were the aforementioned Davis, Elder and Wood, as well as Mort Drucker, George Woodbridge, Harry North and Paul Coker. Writers such as Dick DeBartolo, Stan Hart, Frank Jacobs, Tom Koch, and Arnie Kogen appeared regularly in the magazine's pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor's run at \"Mad.\"\n\nWithin the industry, \"Mad\" was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, \"I got spoiled... Other publishers don't do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check.\" Another lure for contributors was the annual \"Mad Trip\", an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set amount of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list. Later that year, Gaines' mother died, and Kogen was asked if he would be attending the funeral. \"I can't,\" said Kogen, \"I don't have enough pages.\" Over the years, the \"Mad\" crew traveled to such locales as France, Kenya, Russia, Hong Kong, England, Amsterdam, Tahiti, Morocco, Italy, Greece, and Germany. The tradition ended with Gaines' death, and a 1993 trip to Monte Carlo.\n\nAlthough \"Mad\" was an exclusively freelance publication, it achieved a remarkable stability, with numerous contributors remaining prominent for decades. Critics of the magazine felt that this lack of turnover eventually led to a formulaic sameness, although there is little agreement on when the magazine peaked or plunged. Many have written that the key factor is when the reader first encountered \"Mad\". According to former Mad Senior Editor Joe Raiola, \"Mad is the only place in America where if you mature, you get fired.\"\n\nProclaiming the precise moment that purportedly triggered the magazine's irreversible decline is a common pastime. Among the most frequently cited \"downward turning points\" are: creator-editor Harvey Kurtzman's departure in 1957; the magazine's mainstream success; adoption of recurring features starting in the early 1960s; the magazine's absorption into a more corporate structure in 1968 (or later, the mid-1990s); founder Gaines' death in 1992; the magazine's publicized \"edgy revamp\" in 1997; the arrival of paid advertising in 2001; or the magazine's 2018 move to California. \"Mad\" has been criticized for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s and then criticized again for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.\n\nIt has been proposed that \"Mad\" is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as \"Mad\" focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture. In 2010, Sergio Aragones said, \"Mad is written by people who never thought 'Okay, I'm going to write for kids,' or 'I'm going to write for adults.' ... And many people say 'I used to read \"Mad\", but \"Mad\" has changed a lot.' Excuse me—you grew up! You have new interests. ... The change doesn't come from the magazine, it comes from the people who grow or don't grow.\" \"Mad\" poked fun at the tendency of readers to accuse the magazine of declining in quality at various points in its history in its \"Untold History of \"Mad\" Magazine\", a self-referential faux history in the 400th issue which joked: \"The second issue of \"Mad\" goes on sale on December 9, 1952. On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that \"Mad\" 'just isn't as funny and original like it used to be' arrives.\" The magazine's then art director, Sam Viviano, suggested in 2002 that historically, \"Mad\" was at its best \"whenever you first started reading it.\"\n\nAmong the loudest of those who insist the magazine is no longer funny are supporters of Harvey Kurtzman, who had the good critical fortune to leave \"Mad\" after just 28 issues, before his own formulaic tendencies might have become obtrusive. This also meant Kurtzman suffered the bad creative and financial timing of departing before the magazine became a runaway success.\n\nHowever, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the Al Feldstein system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to Al Jaffee, \"There's a group of \"Mad\" aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at \"Mad\", the magazine would not only have been different, but better.\" Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, \"And then there's a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with \"Mad\", he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it.\" During Kurtzman's final two-plus years at EC, \"Mad\" appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and Will Elder returned to \"Mad\" for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)\n\nThe magazine's sales peak came with issue #161 which sold 2.4 million copies in 1973. That period coincided with several other magazines' sales peaks, including \"TV Guide\" and \"Playboy\". \"Mad\"'s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.\n\nMany of the magazine's mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include Joe Raiola, Charlie Kadau, Tony Barbieri, Scott Bricher, Tom Bunk, John Caldwell, Desmond Devlin, Drew Friedman, Barry Liebmann, Kevin Pope, Scott Maiko, Hermann Mejia, Tom Richmond, Andrew J. Schwartzberg, Mike Snider, Greg Theakston, Nadina Simon, Rick Tulka and Bill Wray.\n\nOn April 1, 1997, the magazine publicized an alleged \"revamp\", ostensibly designed to reach an older, more sophisticated readership. However, Salon's David Futrelle opined that such content was very much a part of \"Mad\"s past:\n\n\"Mad\" editor John Ficarra acknowledges that changes in culture have made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, \"The editorial mission statement has always been the same: 'Everyone is lying to you, including magazines. Think for yourself. Question authority.' But it's gotten harder, as they've gotten better at lying and getting in on the joke.\"\n\n\"Mad\" contributor Tom Richmond has responded to critics who say the magazine's decision to accept advertising would make late publisher William Gaines \"turn over in his grave\", pointing out this is impossible because Gaines was cremated.\n\n\"Mad\" is known for the stability and longevity of its talent roster, billed as \"The Usual Gang of Idiots\", with several creators enjoying 30-, 40- and even 50-year careers in the magazine's pages.\n\nAccording to the \"Mad Magazine Contributor Appearances\" website, more than 850 contributors have received bylines in at least one issue of \"Mad\", but only three dozen of those have contributed to 100 issues or more. Writer-artist Al Jaffee has appeared in the most issues; #550 (April 2018) was the 500th issue with new work by Jaffee. The other three contributors to have appeared in more than 400 issues of \"Mad\" are Sergio Aragonés, Dick DeBartolo, and Mort Drucker; Dave Berg, Paul Coker and Frank Jacobs have each topped the 300 mark. (The list calculates appearances by issue only, not by individual articles or overall page count; e.g. although Jacobs wrote three separate articles that appeared in issue #172, his total is reckoned to have increased by one.)\n\nEach of the following contributors has created over 100 articles for the magazine:\n\nWriters:\n\n\n\n\nWriter-Artists:\n\n\n\nArtists:\n\n\n\nPhotographer:\n\nOver the years, the editorial staff, most notably Al Feldstein, Nick Meglin, John Ficarra, Joe Raiola and Charlie Kadau have had creative input on countless articles and shaped Mad's distinctive satiric voice.\n\nAmong the irregular contributors with just a single \"Mad\" byline to their credit are Charles M. Schulz, Chevy Chase, Andy Griffith, Will Eisner, Kevin Smith, J. Fred Muggs, Boris Vallejo, Sir John Tenniel, Jean Shepherd, Winona Ryder, Jimmy Kimmel, Jason Alexander, Walt Kelly, Rep. Barney Frank, Tom Wolfe, Steve Allen, Jim Lee, Jules Feiffer, Donald Knuth and Richard Nixon, who remains the only President credited with \"writing\" a \"Mad\" article. (The entire text was taken from Nixon's speeches.)\n\nThose who have contributed twice apiece include Tom Lehrer, Wally Cox, Gustave Doré, Danny Kaye, Stan Freberg, Mort Walker and Leonardo da Vinci. (Leonardo's check is still waiting in the Mad offices for him to pick it up.) Appearing slightly more frequently were Frank Frazetta (3 bylines), Ernie Kovacs (11), Bob and Ray (12), Henry Morgan (3), and Sid Caesar (4). In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside \"name\" talent. Often, \"Mad\" would simply illustrate the celebrities' preexisting material while promoting their names on the cover. The Bob and Ray association was particularly fruitful. When the magazine learned that Tom Koch was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by \"Mad\", Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 \"Mad\" articles over the next 37 years.\n\nThe magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated. In 1964, an article called \"Comic Strips They'd Really Like To Do\" featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including Mell Lazarus and Charles M. Schulz. More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as Frank Miller or Jim Lee to design and illustrate a series of \"Rejected Superheroes.\" In 2008, the magazine got national coverage for its article \"Why George W. Bush is in Favor of Global Warming\". Each of the piece's 10 punchlines was illustrated by a different Pulitzer Prize–winning editorial cartoonist. In 2015, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic served as the magazine's first and only guest editor, writing some material and guiding the content in issue #533, while upping his own career \"Mad\" byline total from two to five.\n\nIn 1955, Gaines began presenting reprints of material for \"Mad\" in black-and-white paperbacks, the first being \"The Mad Reader\". Many of these featured new covers by \"Mad\" cover artist Norman Mingo. This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 \"Mad\" paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers.\n\n\"Mad\" also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of \"Super Special\" format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled \"The Worst from Mad\" and \"More Trash from Mad\". Various other titles have been used through the years. These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on flexi-disc, or comic book–formatted inserts reprinting material from the 1952–55 era.\n\nOne steady form of revenue has come from foreign editions of the magazine. \"Mad\" has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication's back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the \"Mad\" vein. However, the sensibility of the American \"Mad\" has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican \"Mad\"s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs cancelled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (35 years and counting) United Kingdom (35 years) and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted \"Mad\" variants.\n\n\n\n\nConflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees. When a comic strip satirizing England's royal family was reprinted in a \"Mad\" paperback, it was deemed necessary to rip out the page from 25,000 copies by hand before the book could be distributed in Great Britain. But \"Mad\" was also protective of its own editorial standards. Bill Gaines sent \"one of his typically dreadful, blistering letters\" to his Dutch editors after they published a bawdy gag about a men's room urinal. \"Mad\" has since relaxed its requirements, and while the U.S. version still eschews overt profanity, the magazine generally poses no objections to more provocative content such as the Swedish edition's 1999 parody of the film \"Fucking Åmål\".\n\nBetween 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of \"Mad Kids,\" a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic. Reminiscent of Nickelodeon's newsstand titles, it emphasized current kids' entertainment (i.e. \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\", \"Naruto\", \"High School Musical\"), albeit with an impudent voice. Much of the content of \"Mad Kids\" had originally appeared in the parent publication; reprinted material was chosen and edited to reflect grade schoolers' interests. But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids' magazines.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Mad\", other black-and-white magazines of topical, satiric comics began to be published. Most were short-lived. The three longest-lasting were \"Cracked\", \"Sick\", and \"Crazy Magazine\". Many featured a cover mascot along the lines of Alfred E. Neuman.\n\nColor comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were \"Nuts!\", \"Get Lost\", \"Whack\", \"Riot\", \"Flip\", \"Eh!\", \"From Here to Insanity\", and \"Madhouse\"; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two. Later color satiric comic books included \"Wild\", \"Blast\", \"Parody\", \"Grin\" and \"Gag!\". EC Comics itself offered the color comic \"Panic\", produced by future \"Mad\" editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC's \"Panic\" had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.\n\nIn 1967, Marvel Comics produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book \"Not Brand Echh\", which parodied the company's own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, DC Comics published the comic \"Plop!\", which featured \"Mad\" stalwart Sergio Aragonés and frequent cover art by Basil Wolverton. Another publisher's comic was \"Trash\" (1978) featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, \"We mess with \"Mad\" (p. 21)\" and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of \"Mud\" and \"Crocked\" with the frowning faces of Neuman and \"Cracked\" cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.\n\nAmong other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former \"Mad\" editor Harvey Kurtzman's \"Trump\", \"Humbug\" and \"Help!\", as well as \"National Lampoon\".\n\nOver the years, \"Mad\" has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard \"Mad\" products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside \"Mad\" items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a straitjacket (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust. For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman (\"suitable for framing or for wrapping fish\") with misleading slogans such as \"Only 1 Left!\" (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines' death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that \"Mad\" merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the Warner Bros. Studio Stores, and in 1994 \"The Mad Style Guide\" was created for licensing use.\n\n\"Mad\" has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings. In 1959, Bernie Green \"with the Stereo Mad-Men\" recorded the album \"Musically Mad\" for RCA Victor, featuring music inspired by \"Mad\" and an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover; it has been reissued on CD. That same year, \"The Worst from Mad\" #2 included an original recording, \"Meet the staff of Mad\", on a cardboard 33 rpm record, while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman & The Furshlugginger Five: \"What – Me Worry?\" (b/w \"Potrzebie\"), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label. Two additional albums of novelty songs were released by Bigtop Records in 1962–63: \"Mad 'Twists' Rock 'N' Roll\" and \"Fink Along with Mad\". The latter album featured a song titled \"It's a Gas\", which punctuated an instrumental track with belches (along with a saxophone break by an uncredited King Curtis). Dr. Demento featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. \"Mad\" included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) flexi discs with their reprinted \"Mad Specials\". A number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as \"Gall in the Family Fare\" (a radio play adaptation of their previously illustrated \"All in the Family\" parody), a single entitled \"Makin' Out\", the octuple-grooved track \"It's a Super Spectacular Day\", which had eight possible endings, the spoken word \"Meet the staff\" insert, and a six-track, 30-minute \"Mad Disco\" EP (from the 1980 Special of the same title) that included a disco version of \"It's a Gas\". The last turntable-playable recording \"Mad\" packaged with its magazines was \"A Mad Look at Graduation\", in a 1982 Special. A CD-ROM containing several audio tracks was included with issue #350 (October 1996). Rhino Records compiled a number of \"Mad\"-recorded tracks as \"Mad Grooves\" (1996).\n\nAn off Broadway production, \"The Mad Show\", was first staged in 1966. The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by \"Mad\" regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited Stephen Sondheim). The cast album is available on CD. In September 2017, the show will return with new writers and actors.\n\nIn 1979, Mad released a board game. \"The Mad Magazine Game\" was an absurdist version of \"Monopoly\" in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine's contributors, the game included a $1,329,063-bill that could not be won unless one's name was \"Alfred E. Neuman\". It also featured a deck of cards (called \"Card cards\") with bizarre instructions, such as \"If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500.\" In 1980 a second game was released: \"The Mad Magazine Card Game\" by Parker Brothers. In it, the player who first loses all their cards is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to \"Uno\" by Mattel. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 \"Trivial Pursuit: Warner Bros. Edition\" (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the \"Looney Tunes\"/\"Merrie Melodies\" cartoons (and follow-up projects from Warner Bros Animation)), as well as DC Comics, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network and assorted MGM properties owned by Turner Entertainment Co. that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.\n\nFollowing the success of the \"National Lampoon\"–backed \"Animal House\", \"Mad\" lent its name in 1980 to a similarly risque comedy film, \"Up the Academy\". It was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that \"Mad\" successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although those references were eventually restored on the DVD version, which was titled \"Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy\". \"Mad\" also devoted two pages of its magazine to an attack on the movie, titled \"Throw Up the Academy\". The spoof's ending collapsed into a series of interoffice memos between the writer, artist, editor and publisher, all bewailing the fact that they had been forced to satirize such a terrible film. On March 2, 2018, \"Mad\" announced via their Twitter page that a sequel to the original film will be written by an A-list film writer.\n\nA 1974 \"Mad\" animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by ABC but the network decided to not broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, \"Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.\" The program was instead created into a TV special, and is available for online viewing.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hanna-Barbera developed another potential \"Mad\" animated television series which was never broadcast.\n\nIn 1995, Fox Broadcasting Company's \"Mad TV\" licensed the use of the magazine's logo and characters. However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing \"Spy vs. Spy\" (1994–1998) and Don Martin (1995–2000) cartoons during the show's first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sketch comedy series was in the vein of NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and Global/CBC's \"SCTV\", and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, The CW aired an hour-long special celebrating the series' 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.\n\nAnimated \"Spy vs. Spy\" sequences were also seen in TV ads for Mountain Dew soda in 2004.\n\nIn September 2010, Cartoon Network began airing the animated series \"Mad\", from Warner Bros. Animation and executive producer Sam Register (\"Teen Titans\", \"Ben 10\", \"\"). The series aired short animated vignettes about current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture. Much like \"Mad TV's\", this series also features appearances by \"Spy vs. Spy\" and Don Martin cartoons. Produced by Kevin Shinick (\"Robot Chicken\") and Mark Marek (\"KaBlam!\", \"The Andy Milonakis Show\"), the series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.\n\nIn 1984, the \"Spy vs. Spy\" characters were given their own computer game series, in which players could set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the Apple II, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for \"Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper\" and a polar setting for \"Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics\".\n\nNot to be confused with the later television show, \"Mad TV\" is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine's general style of cartoon humor, but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman's eyes during the opening screens.\n\nIn 1996, \"Mad\" #350 included a CD-ROM featuring \"Mad\"-related software as well as three audio files. In 1999, Brøderbund/The Learning Company released \"Totally Mad,\" a Microsoft Windows 95/98 compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine's content from #1 through #376 (December 1998), plus over 100 \"Mad Specials\" including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as Andy Griffith's \"What It Was, Was Football\". In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology's DVD-ROM \"Absolutely Mad\" updated the original \"Totally Mad\" content through 2005. A single seven-gigabyte disc, it is missing the same deleted material from the 1999 collection. It differs from the earlier release in that it is Macintosh compatible.\n\nAnother Spy vs. Spy video game was made in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. A \"Mad\" app was released for iPad on April 1, 2012. It displays the contents of each new issue beginning with \"Mad\" #507, as well as video clips from Cartoon Network's \"Mad\", and material from the magazine's website, The Idiotical.\n\n\n"}

He has been practising sports since 10, when he started attending Judo classes. \n\nIn 2011-2013 he served in the Armenian Armed Forces.\nUntil 18, Manvel also tried himself in Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling. Manvel set his 11th record in Armenia when he was only 17. His first record was set in Dyutsaznagirk by doing sit up - abdominal exercise for 2 h. 46 min for 3511 reps. For the second time he appeared in Dyutsaznagirk for the most push-ups with one arm using back of the hand in one minute - 89 reps.\n\nAfter returning from the army, Manvel set a Guinness world record in October 23, 2015. He did 27 handstand push-ups in a minute. In order to complete one handstand push-up, Manvel’s elbows had to reach 90 degrees or less and then he had to fully straighten his arms. His legs also had to be straight or cross his ankles. He did the exercise in 48,3 seconds. Manvel didn’t have any injury before his performance, and the record was set. He dedicated his victory to the memory of the Genocide of Armenian and Yazidi people promised to update his record throughout the year. \n\nOn 25 August, 2016 Manvel dedicated his record in memory of the victims of April Four-Day War unleashed in Nagorno-Karabakhby Azerbaijan. In response to the murder of Hayk Torosyan, Hrant Gharibyan and his compatriot Kyaram Sloyan by Azeris, Manvel Mamoyan set a new record: however, in August, 2016 he couldn’t exceed the record (84 push-ups) of the Canadian Roy Berger from his first performance in the Freedom Square, Yerevan, by reaching 83 reps. According to the Guinness World Records’ rules the athlete has a right to perform the exercise for 3 sets. Manvel managed to set the desired record from his second performance, after having a rest. By doing push-ups for 86 reps in a minute, the athlete exceeded the previous record and set a record in the Guinness World Records.\n\nIn one his interviews Manvel told about his desire to set 10 records in Guinness World Records in a year, particularly by through the Flag exercise, which was set as a record a few years ago by him and was performed for only 20 seconds. It was included in Dyutsaznagirk. He also mentioned he strives to set records more for Guinness World Records. In 2016 Manvel fell behind 5-6 seconds of setting a new world record and the record was 1 min. 5 sec. 71 millisec.\n\nIn 2017 Manvel set 4 records in handstand push-ups. He did the exercise 37 reps in a minute. With this result then he set a new record by doing 37 reps non-stop in a minute. \n\nFor his second record he did the same exercise 55 reps in 3 minutes. However, Manvel's last and most important result was doing push-ups for 352 reps in an hour. According to him, the achieved most result was 300 reps and he wished to surpass that record. \n\nIn 2017 Manvel also set a record for the Most jump squats in one minute (male), with 67 reps per minute.\n\n"}

It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe. Musée d'Orsay had 3.177 million visitors in 2017.\n\nThe museum building was originally a railway station, Gare d'Orsay, constructed for the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, Émile Bénard and Victor Laloux. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939.\n\nBy 1939 the station's short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II. It was then used as a set for several films, such as Kafka's \"The Trial\" adapted by Orson Welles, and as a haven for the Renaud–Barrault Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the Hôtel Drouot was being rebuilt. \n\nIn 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but Jacques Duhamel, Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museums of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum. ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues. In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. Finally in July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president François Mitterrand.\n\nThe square next to the museum displays six bronze allegorical sculptural groups in a row, originally produced for the Exposition Universelle:\n\n\n\nMajor sculptors represented in the collection include Alfred Barye, François Rude, Jules Cavelier, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Émile-Coriolan Guillemin, Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, Camille Claudel, Sarah Bernhardt and Honoré Daumier.\n\nIt also holds collections of:\nThe Directors have been:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11300498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11300498", "title": "Oxyrhynchus Papyri", "text": "Oxyrhynchus Papyri\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus Papyri are a group of manuscripts discovered during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by papyrologists Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt at an ancient rubbish dump near Oxyrhynchus in Egypt (, modern \"el-Bahnasa\").\n\nThe manuscripts date from the time of the Ptolemaic (3rd century BC) and Roman periods of Egyptian history (from 32 BC to the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640 AD).\n\nOnly an estimated 10% are literary in nature. Most of the papyri found seem to consist mainly of public and private documents: codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records, sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, and private letters.\n\nAlthough most of the papyri were written in Greek, some texts written in Egyptian (Egyptian hieroglyphics, Hieratic, Demotic, mostly Coptic), Latin and Arabic were also found. Texts in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac and Pahlavi have so far represented only a small percentage of the total.\n\nSince 1898 academics have puzzled together and transcribed over 5000 documents from what were originally hundreds of boxes of papyrus fragments the size of large cornflakes. This is thought to represent only 1 to 2 percent of what is estimated to be at least half a million papyri still remaining to be conserved, transcribed, deciphered and catalogued.\n\nOxyrhynchus Papyri are currently housed in institutions all over the world. A substantial number are housed in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. There is an on-line table of contents briefly listing the type of contents of each papyrus or fragment.\n\nAdministrative Documents assembled and transcribed from the Oxyrhynchus excavation so far include: \n\nAlthough most of the texts uncovered at Oxyrhynchus were non-literary in nature, the archaeologists succeeded in recovering a large corpus of literary works that had previously been thought to have been lost. Many of these texts had previously been unknown to modern scholars.\n\nSeveral fragments can be traced to the work of Plato, for instance the \"Republic\", \"Phaedo\", or the dialogue \"Gorgias\", dated around 200-300 CE.\n\nAnother important discovery was a papyrus codex containing a significant portion of the treatise \"The Constitution of the Athenians\", which was attributed to Aristotle and had previously been thought to have been lost forever. A second, more extensive papyrus text was purchased in Egypt by an American missionary in 1890. E. A. Wallis Budge of the British Museum acquired it later that year, and the first edition of it by British paleographer Frederic G. Kenyon was published in January, 1891. The treatise revealed a massive quantity of reliable information about historical periods that classicists previously had very little knowledge of. Two modern historians even went so far as to state that \"the discovery of this treatise constitutes almost a new epoch in Greek historical study.\" In particular, 21–22, 26.2–4, and 39–40 of the work contain factual information not found in any other extant ancient text.\n\nThe discovery of a historical work known as the \"Hellenica Oxyrhynchia\" also revealed new information about classical antiquity. The identity of the author of the work is unknown; many early scholars proposed that it may have been written by Ephorus or Theopompus, but many modern scholars are now convinced that it was written by Cratippus. The work has won praise for its style and accuracy and has even been compared favorably with the works of Thucydides.\n\nThe findings at Oxyrhynchus also turned up the oldest and most complete diagrams from Euclid's \"Elements\". Fragments of Euclid discovered led to a re-evaluation of the accuracy of ancient sources for \"The Elements\", revealing that the version of Theon of Alexandria has more authority than previously believed, according to Thomas Little Heath.\n\nThe classical author who has most benefited from the finds at Oxyrhynchus is the Athenian playwright Menander (342–291 BC), whose comedies were very popular in Hellenistic times and whose works are frequently found in papyrus fragments. Menander's plays found in fragments at Oxyrhynchus include \"Misoumenos\", \"Dis Exapaton\", \"Epitrepontes\", \"Karchedonios\", \"Dyskolos\" and \"Kolax\". The works found at Oxyrhynchus have greatly raised Menander's status among classicists and scholars of Greek theatre.\n\nAnother notable text uncovered at Oxyrhynchus was \"Ichneutae\", a previously unknown play written by Sophocles. The discovery of \"Ichneutae\" was especially significant since \"Ichneutae\" is a satyr play, making it only one of two extant satyr plays, with the other one being Euripides's \"Cyclops\".\n\nExtensive remains of the \"Hypsipyle\" of Euripides and a life of Euripides by Satyrus the Peripatetic were also found at Oxyrhynchus.\n\n\nAn \"epitome\" of seven of the 107 lost books of Livy was the most important literary find in Latin.\n\nAmong the Christian texts found at Oxyrhynchus, were fragments of early non-canonical Gospels, \"Oxyrhynchus 840\" (3rd century AD) and \"Oxyrhynchus 1224\" (4th century AD). Other Oxyrhynchus texts preserve parts of Matthew 1 (3rd century: \"P2\" and \"P401\"), 11–12 and 19 (3rd to 4th century: \"P2384,\" \"2385\"); Mark 10–11 (5th to 6th century: \"P3\"); John 1 and \"20\" (3rd century: \"P208\"); Romans 1 (4th century: \"P209\"); the First Epistle of John (4th-5th century: \"P402\"); the Apocalypse of Baruch (chapters 12–14; 4th or 5th century: \"P403\"); the \"Gospel according to the Hebrews\" (3rd century AD: \"P655\"); \"The Shepherd of Hermas\" (3rd or 4th century: \"P404\"), and a work of Irenaeus, (3rd century: \"P405\"). There are many parts of other canonical books as well as many early Christian hymns, prayers, and letters also found among them.\n\nAll manuscripts classified as \"theological\" in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri are listed below. A few manuscripts that belong to multiple genres, or genres that are inconsistently treated in the volumes of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, are also included. For example, the quotation from Psalm 90 (P. Oxy. XVI 1928) associated with an amulet, is classified according to its primary genre as a magic text in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri; however, it is included here among witnesses to the Old Testament text. In each volume that contains theological manuscripts, they are listed first, according to an English tradition of academic precedence (see Doctor of Divinity).\n\nThe original Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) was translated into Greek between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC. This translation is called the Septuagint (or LXX, both 70 in Latin), because there is a tradition that seventy Jewish scribes compiled it in Alexandria. It was quoted in the New Testament and is found bound together with the New Testament in the 4th and 5th century Greek uncial codices Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus and Vaticanus. The Septuagint included books, called the Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical by Christians, which were later not accepted into the Jewish canon of sacred writings (see next section). Portions of Old Testament books of undisputed authority found among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri are listed in this section.\nThis name designates several, unique writings (e.g., the Book of Tobit) or different versions of pre-existing writings (e.g., the Book of Daniel) found in the canon of the Jewish scriptures (most notably, in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew \"Tanakh\"). Although those writings were no longer viewed as having a canonical status amongst Jews by the beginning of the second century A.D., they retained that status for much of the Christian Church. They were and are accepted as part of the Old Testament canon by the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox churches. Protestant Christians, however, follow the example of the Jews and do not accept these writings as part of the Old Testament canon.\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus Papyri have provided the most numerous sub-group of the earliest copies of the New Testament. These are surviving portions of codices (books) written in Greek uncial (capital) letters on papyrus. The first of these were excavated by Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt in Oxyrhynchus, at the turn of the 20th century. Of the 127 registered New Testament papyri, 52 (41%) are from Oxyrhynchus. The earliest of the papyri are dated to the middle of the 2nd century, so were copied within about a century of the writing of the original New Testament documents.\n\nGrenfell and Hunt discovered the first New Testament papyrus (), on only the second day of excavation, in the winter of 1896–7. This, together with the other early discoveries, was published in 1898, in the first volume of the now 70-volume work, \"The Oxyrhynchus Papyri\".\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection contains around twenty manuscripts of New Testament apocrypha, works from the early Christian period that presented themselves as biblical books, but were not eventually received as such by the orthodoxy. These works found at Oxyrhynchus include the gospels of Thomas, Mary, Peter, James, \"The Shepherd of Hermas,\" and the \"Didache.\" Among this collection are also a few manuscripts of unknown gospels. The three manuscripts of Thomas represent the only known Greek manuscripts of this work; the only other surviving manuscript of Thomas is a nearly complete Coptic manuscript from the Nag Hammadi find. P. Oxy. 4706, a manuscript of \"The Shepherd of Hermas,\" is notable because two sections believed by scholars to have been often circulated independently, \"Visions\" and \"Commandments\", were found on the same roll.\n\n\n\n"}

This included the docket privilege of South African law.\n\nThe court held that the practices of the past whereby the State retained tight control of almost all available information relevant to a criminal prosecution was inconsistent with modern values of openness and accountability in a democratically oriented administration.\n\nThus the court held that section 23 gave an accused the right to access to the information contained in the police docket for the exercise and protection of his right to a fair criminal trial.\n\nThe Commissioner argued that the judgment in \"R v Stinchcombe\" permitted non-disclosure of witness statements on grounds of privilege, and that this privilege included South African docket privilege.\n\nThe court held that, whereas in Canada, the state had a discretion to withhold information which would ordinarily be disclosed, the South African Constitution’s inclusion of section 23 meant that there was a protected right to information.\n\nThe court thus ordered that the respondents furnish the applicant with witness statements, and all exhibits, plans and diagrams in the police docket, if any, and give the applicant access to the remaining information in the docket.\n"}

He is the leader of the Italian party Forza Nuova. He self-identified as a fascist.\n\nAfter the police found a large quantity of explosives and weapons in a local office of the political organization Terza Posizione in the 1980s, Roberto Fiore migrated to the United Kingdom in order to avoid arrest. The anti-fascist magazine \"Searchlight\" claimed that Roberto was working for the Secret Intelligence Service. This has also been alleged by the \"Sunday Express\", in 2000, citing a source within MI5. Fiore denied any connections to British intelligence.\nThe allegation that he worked for MI6 was also made in para 2.12.11 of the Report drawn up on behalf of the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia, 1991 (The Ford Report)\n\nFiore is generally considered to be a neofascist leader. In England Fiore became a close friend of Nick Griffin and following Griffin's departure from the National Front he helped to organise the International Third Position, becoming a founding member. Fiore had connections with the traditionalist philosopher Julius Evola and has written about topics such as traditionalism and the third position.\n\nIn 1986, thanks to their friendship with Nick Griffin and other far right activists, Roberto Fiore and Massimo Morsello managed to found \"Meeting Point\", which was later renamed \"Easy London\". Easy London is a society that helps young students and workers live and work in London by providing jobs, beds and contracts.

In the United States, municipal policies include prohibiting police or city employees from questioning people about their immigration status and refusing requests by national immigration authorities to detain people beyond their release date, if they were jailed for breaking local law. \nSuch policies can be set expressly in law (\"de jure\") or observed in practice (\"de facto\"), but the designation \"sanctuary city\" does not have a precise legal definition. The Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated in 2018 that more than 500 U.S. jurisdictions, including states and municipalities, had adopted sanctuary policies.\n\nStudies on the relationship between sanctuary status and crime have found that sanctuary policies either have no effect on crime or that sanctuary cities have lower crime rates and stronger economies than comparable non-sanctuary cities. Opponents of sanctuary cities argue that cities should assist the national government in enforcing immigration law. Supporters of sanctuary cities argue that enforcement of national law is not the duty of localities. Legal opinions vary on whether immigration enforcement by local police is constitutional. \n\nEuropean cities have been inspired by the same political currents of the sanctuary movement as American cities, but the term \"sanctuary city\" now has different meanings in Europe and North America. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in continental Europe, sanctuary city refers to cities that are committed to welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and others who are seeking safety. Such cities are now found in 80 towns, cities and local areas in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The emphasis is on building bridges of connection and understanding, which is done through raising awareness, befriending schemes and forming cultural connections in the arts, sport, health, education, faith groups and other sectors of society. Glasgow and Swansea have become known as noted sanctuary cities.<ref name=\"swansea.cityofsanctuary.org/\"></ref>\n\nThe concept of a sanctuary city goes back thousands of years. It has been associated with Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Baha'i, Sikhism, and Hinduism. In Western Civilization, sanctuary cities can be traced back to the Old Testament. The Book of Numbers commands the selection of six cities of refuge in which the perpetrators of accidental manslaughter could claim the right of asylum. Outside of these cities, blood vengeance against such perpetrators was allowed by law. In AD 392, Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I set up sanctuaries under church control. In AD 600 in medieval England, churches were given a general right of sanctuary, and some cities were set up as sanctuaries by Royal charter. The general right of sanctuary for churches in England was abolished in 1621.\n\nThe movement that established sanctuary cities in the United States began in the early 1980s.The movement traces its roots to religious philosophy, as well as in histories of resistance movements to perceived state injustices. The sanctuary city movement took place in the 1980s to challenge the US government’s refusal to grant asylum to certain Central American refugees. These asylum seekers were arriving from countries in Central America like El Salvador and Guatemala that were politically unstable. More than 75,000 Salvadoreans and 200,000 Guatemalans were killed by their governments in hopes to suppress the communist movement in those countries at the time. Faith based groups in the US Southwest initially drove the movement of the 1980s, with eight churches publicly declaring sanctuary in March 1982. John Fife, a minister and movement leader famously wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Smith, saying that the \"South-side United Presbyterian Church will publicly violate the Immigration and Nationality Act\" by allowing sanctuary in its church for those from Central America. \n\nA milestone in the U.S. sanctuary city movement occurred in 1985 in San Francisco, which passed the largely symbolic “City of Refuge” resolution. The resolution was followed the same year by an ordinance which prohibited the use of city funds and resources to assist federal immigration enforcement–the defining characteristic of a sanctuary city in the U.S.  As of 2018 more than 560 cities, states and counties considered themselves sanctuaries.\n\nSeveral different terms and phrases are used to describe immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. The term \"alien\" is \"considered insensitive by many\" and a LexisNexis search showed that its use in reports on immigration has declined substantially, making up just 5% of terms used in 2013. Usage of the word \"illegal\" and phrases using the word (e.g., \"illegal alien\", \"illegal immigrant\", \"illegal worker\" and \"illegal migrant\") has declined, accounting for 82% of language used in 1996, 75% in 2002, 60% in 2007, and 57% in 2013. Several other phrases are competing for wide acceptance: \"undocumented immigrant\" (usage in news reports increased from 6% in 1996 to 14% in 2013); \"unauthorized immigrant\" (3% usage in 2013 and rarely seen before that time), and \"undocumented person\" or \"undocumented people\" (1% in 2007, increasing to 3% in 2013). A recent term is \"illegalized immigrant\".\n\nMedia outlets' policies as to use of terms differ, and no consensus has yet emerged in the press. In 2013, the Associated Press changed its \"AP Stylebook\" to provide that \"Except in direct quotes essential to the story, use \"illegal\" only to refer to an action, not a person: \"illegal immigration\", but not \"illegal immigrant\". Acceptable variations include \"living in\" or \"entering a country illegally\" or \"without legal permission\".\" Within several weeks, major U.S. newspapers such as \"Chicago Tribune\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"USA Today\" adopted similar guidance. The \"New York Times\" style guide similarly states that the term \"illegal immigrant\" may be considered \"loaded or offensive\" and advises journalists to \"explain the specific circumstances of the person in question or to focus on actions: \"who crossed the border illegally\"; \"who overstayed a visa\"; \"who is not authorized to work in this country\".\" The style book discourages the use of \"illegal\" as a noun and the \"sinister-sounding\" \"alien\". Both \"unauthorized\" and \"undocumented\" are acceptable, but the stylebook notes that the former \"has a flavor of euphemism and should be used with caution outside quotation\" and the latter has a \"bureaucratic tone.\" The \"Washington Post\" stylebook \"says 'illegal immigrant' is accurate and acceptable, but notes that some find it offensive\"; the \"Post\" \"does not refer to people as 'illegal aliens' or 'illegals,' per its guidelines.\n\nThis issue entered presidential politics in the race for the Republican Party Presidential Nomination in 2008. Colorado CongressmanTom Tancredo ran on an anti-illegal immigration platform and specifically attacked sanctuary cities. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney accused Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani of running it as a sanctuary city. Mayor Giuliani's campaign responded saying that Governor Romney ran a sanctuary Governor's mansion, and that New York City is not a \"haven\" for undocumented immigrants.\n\nFollowing the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco (a sanctuary city) by an undocumented immigrant, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D-NY) told \"CNN\" that \"The city made a mistake, not to deport someone that the federal government strongly felt should be deported. I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on.\" The following day, her campaign stated: \"Hillary Clinton believes that sanctuary cities can help further public safety, and she has defended those policies going back years.\"\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the U.S. Justice Department sued California, Governor Jerry Brown, and the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, over three state laws passed in recent months, saying the laws made it impossible for federal immigration officials to do their jobs and deport criminals who were born outside the United States. The Justice Department called the laws unconstitutional and asked a judge to block them. The lawsuit says the state laws “reflect a deliberate effort by California to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law.” \nThe Trump administration previously released a list of immigration principles to Congress. The list included funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a crackdown on the influx of Central American minors, and curbs on federal grants to sanctuary cities. A pledge to strip \"all federal funding to sanctuary cities\" was a key Trump campaign theme. President Trump issued an executive order which declared that jurisdictions that \"refuse to comply\" with 8 U.S.C. 1373—a provision of federal law on information sharing between local and federal authorities—would be ineligible to receive federal grants. \n\nStates and cities have shown varying responses to the executive order. Thirty-three states introduced or enacted legislation requiring local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE officers and requests to hold non-citizen inmates for deportation. Other states and cities have responded by not cooperating with federal immigration efforts or showcasing welcoming policies towards immigrants. California openly refused the administration's attempts to \"clamp down on sanctuary cities\". A federal judge in San Francisco agreed with two California municipalities that a presidential attempt to cut them off from federal funding for not complying with deportation requests is unconstitutional, ultimately issuing a nationwide permanent injunction against the facially unconstitutional provisions of the order. On March 27, 2018, the all-Republican Board of Supervisors in Orange County, California voted to join the Justice Department's lawsuit against the state. In Chicago a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration may not withhold public safety grants to sanctuary cities. These decisions have been seen as a setback to the administration's efforts to force local jurisdictions to help federal authorities with the policing of illegal immigrants. On July 5, 2018, a federal judge upheld two of California's Sanctuary laws, but struck down a key provision in the third.\n\nLocal officials who oppose the president's policies say that complying with federal immigration officers will ruin the trust established between law enforcement and immigrant communities. Supporters of the president's policies say that protection of immigrants from enforcement makes communities less safe and undermines the rule of law.\n\nGeorgia banned \"sanctuary cities\" in 2010, and in 2016 went further by requiring local governments, in order to obtain state funding, to certify that they cooperate with federal immigration officials.\n\nArizona, through SB 1070 (enacted in 2010), requires law enforcement officers to notify federal immigration authorities \"if they develop reasonable suspicion that a person they’ve detained or arrested is in the country illegally.\"\n\nTennessee state law bars \"local governments or officials from making policies that stop local entities from complying with federal immigration law.\" In 2017, legislation proposed in the Tennessee General Assembly would go further, withholding funding from local governments deemed insufficiently cooperative with the federal government.\n\nThe California state senate passed a bill that would largely prohibit local law enforcement agencies from using their money, equipment or personnel to aid federal government action against illegal immigrants.\nIn Texas no city has formally declared \"sanctuary\" status, but a few do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities and have drawn a negative response from the legislature. Bills seeking to deprive state funding from police departments and municipalities that do not cooperate with federal authorities had been introduced into the Texas Legislature several times. On February 1, 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott blocked funding to Travis County, Texas due to its recently implemented \"de facto\" sanctuary city policy. On May 7, 2017, Abbott signed Texas Senate Bill 4 into law, effectively banning sanctuary cities by charging county or city officials who refuse to work with federal officials and by allowing police officers to check the immigration status of those they detain if they choose.\n\nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 addressed the relationship between the federal government and local governments. Minor crimes, such as shoplifting, became grounds for possible deportation. Additionally, the legislation outlawed cities' bans against municipal workers reporting a person's immigration status to federal authorities.\n\nSection 287(g) makes it possible for state and local law enforcement personnel to enter into agreements with the federal government to be trained in immigration enforcement and, subsequent to such training, to enforce immigration law. However, it provides no general power for immigration enforcement by state and local authorities. This provision was implemented by local and state authorities in five states, California, Arizona, Alabama, Florida and North Carolina by the end of 2006. On June 16, 2007 the United States House of Representatives passed an amendment to a United States Department of Homeland Security spending bill that would withhold federal emergency services funds from sanctuary cities. Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) was the sponsor of this amendment. 50 Democrats joined Republicans to support the amendment. The amendment would have to pass the United States Senate to become effective.\n\nIn 2007, Republican representatives introduced legislation targeting sanctuary cities. Reps. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Fla., Thelma Drake, R-Va., Jeff Miller, R-Fla., and Tom Tancredo introduced the bill. The legislation would make undocumented immigrant status a felony, instead of a civil offense. Also, the bill targets sanctuary cities by withholding up to 50 percent of Department of Homeland Security funds from the cities.\n\nOn September 5, 2007, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told a House committee that he certainly wouldn't tolerate interference by sanctuary cities that would block his \"Basic Pilot Program\" that requires employers to validate the legal status of their workers. \"We're exploring our legal options. I intend to take as vigorous legal action as the law allows to prevent that from happening, prevent that kind of interference.\"\n\nOn January 25, 2017 President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13768 directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General to defund sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to comply with federal immigration law. He also ordered the Department of Homeland Security to begin issuing weekly public reports that include \"a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.\" Ilya Somin, Professor of Law at George Mason University, has argued that Trump's withholding of federal funding would be unconstitutional: \"Trump and future presidents could use [the executive order] to seriously undermine constitutional federalism by forcing dissenting cities and states to obey presidential dictates, even without authorization from Congress. The circumvention of Congress makes the order a threat to separation of powers, as well.\" On April 25, 2017, U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a nationwide preliminary injunction halting this executive order. The injunction was made permanent on November 20, 2017, when Judge Orrick ruled that section 9(a) of the order was \"unconstitutional on its face\". The judgment concluded that the order violates \"the separation of powers doctrine and deprives [the plaintiffs] of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights.\"\n\nJurisdiction\n\nWhether federal or local government has jurisdiction to detain and deport undocumented immigrants is a tricky and unsettled issue, because the U.S. Constitution does not provide a clear answer. Both federal and local government offer arguments to defend their authority. The issue of jurisdiction has been vigorously debated dating back to the Alien Act of 1798. Opponents of local level policing tend to use the Naturalization Clause and the Migration clause in the Constitution as textual confirmation of federal power. Because the Supremacy Clause is generally interpreted to mean that federal law takes priority over state law, the U.S. Supreme Court in the majority of cases has ruled in favor of the federal government. Certain states have been affected by illegal immigration more than others and have attempted to pass legislation that limits access by undocumented immigrants to public benefits. A notable case was Arizona's SB 1070 law, which was passed in 2010 and struck down in 2012 by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional.\n\nStates like Arizona, Texas and Nevada justify their aggressive actions as a result of insufficient efforts by the federal government to address issues like use of schools and hospitals by illegal immigrants and changes to the cultural landscape—impacts that are most visible on a local level. Ambiguity and confusion over jurisdiction is one of the reasons why local and state policies for and against sanctuary cities vary widely depending on location in the country.\n\nA 2017 review study of the existing literature noted that the existing studies had found that sanctuary cities either have no impact on crime or that they lower the crime rate. A second 2017 study in the journal \"Urban Affairs Review\" found that sanctuary policy itself has no statistically meaningful effect on crime. The findings of the study were misinterpreted by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a July 2017 speech when he claimed that the study showed that sanctuary cities were more prone to crime than cities without sanctuary policies. A third study in the journal \"Justice Quarterly\" found evidence that the adoption of sanctuary policies reduced the robbery rate but had no impact on the homicide rate except in cities with larger Mexican undocumented immigrant populations which had lower rates of homicide.\n\nAccording to a study by Tom K. Wong, associate professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, published by the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank: \"Crime is statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties. Moreover, economies are stronger in sanctuary counties – from higher median household income, less poverty, and less reliance on public assistance to higher labor force participation, higher employment-to-population ratios, and lower unemployment.\" The study also concluded that sanctuary cities build trust between local law enforcement and the community, which enhances public safety overall. The study evaluated sanctuary and non-sanctuary cities while controlling for differences in population, the foreign-born percentage of the population, and the percentage of the population that is Latino.\"\n\nAdvocates of local enforcement of immigration laws argue that more regulatory local immigration policies would cause immigrants to flee those cities and possibly the United States altogether, while opponents argue that regulatory policies on immigrants wouldn't affect their presence because immigrants looking for work will relocate towards economic opportunity despite challenges living there. Undocumented migrants tend to be attracted to states with more economic opportunity and individual freedom. Because there is no reliable data that asks for immigration status, there is no way to tell empirically if regulatory policies do have an effect on immigrant presence. A study comparing restrictive counties with nonrestrictive counties found that local jurisdictions that enacted regulatory immigration policies experienced a 1–2% negative effect in employment.\n\nA preliminary study's results imply that the number of Sanctuary cities in the U.S. positively affects well-being in the undocumented immigrant population. Concerning health, a study in North Carolina found that after implementation of section 287(g), prenatal Hispanic/Latina mothers were more likely than non-Hispanic/Latina mothers to have late or inadequate prenatal care. The study's interviews indicated that Hispanics/Latinos in the section 287(g) counties had distrust in health services among other services and had fear about going to the doctor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the municipalities which are considered sanctuary cities are Asbury Park, Camden, East Orange, Hoboken, Jersey City, Linden, New Brunswick, Newark, North Bergen, Plainfield, Trenton and Union City. Those with specific executive orders made by mayors or resolution by municipal councils are:\n\n\n\nThere are currently 18 sanctuary jurisdictions in the state of Pennsylvania. Sanctuary jurisdictions exist in Bradford County, Bucks County, Chester County, Clarion County, Delaware County, Erie County, Franklin County, Lebanon County, Lehigh County, Lycoming County, Montgomery County, Montour County, Perry County, Philadelphia County, Pike County, and Westmoreland County. \n\nPhiladelphia mayor Jim Kenney said in November 2016 that federal immigration policies lead to more crime, and that crime rates declined the year he reinstated a sanctuary city policy. U.S. Attorney General Sessions has included Philadelphia on the list of cities threatened with subpoenas if they fail to provide documents to show whether local law enforcement officers are sharing information with federal immigration authorities.\n\n\nToronto was the first city in Canada to declare itself a sanctuary city, with Toronto City Council voting 37–3 on February 22, 2013 to adopt a formal policy allowing undocumented migrants to access city services. Hamilton, Ontario declared itself a sanctuary city in February 2014 after the Hamilton City Council voted unanimously to allow undocumented immigrants to access city-funded services such as shelters, housing and food banks. In response to US President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769, the city council of London, Ontario voted unanimously to declare London a sanctuary city in January 2017 with Montreal doing the same in February 2017 after a unanimous vote.\n\nWhile Vancouver, Canada is not a sanctuary city, it adopted an \"Access to City Services without Fear\" policy for residents that are undocumented or have an uncertain immigration status in April 2016. The policy does not apply to municipal services operated by individual boards, including services provided by the Vancouver Police Department, Vancouver Public Library, or Vancouver Park Board.\n\n, the cities of Calgary, Ottawa, Regina, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg are considering motions to declare themselves sanctuary cities.\n\n, Edmonton adopted \"Access Without Fear\" policy for undocumented and vulnerable residents.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, sanctuary cities provide services – such as housing, education, and cultural integration – to asylum seekers (i.e. persons fleeing one country and seeking protection in another). The movement began in Sheffield in the north of England in 2005. It was motivated by a national policy adopted in 1999 to disperse asylum seekers to different towns and cities in the UK. \n\nIn 2009, the city council of Sheffield, UK drew up a manifesto outlining key areas of concern and 100 supporting organizations signed on.\n\nA city's status as a place of sanctuary is not necessarily a formal governmental designation. The organization City of Sanctuary encourages local grassroots groups throughout the UK and Ireland to build a culture of hospitality towards asylum seekers.\n\nGlasgow is a noted sanctuary city in Scotland. In 2000 the city council accepted their first asylum seekers relocated by the Home Office. The Home Office provided funding to support asylum seekers but would also forcibly deport them (\"removal seizures\") if it was determined they could not stay in the UK. As of 2010 Glasgow had accepted 22,000 asylum seekers from 75 different nations. In 2007, local residents upset by the human impact of removal seizures, organized watches to warn asylum seekers when Home Office vans were in the neighborhood. They also organized protests and vigils which led to the ending of the removal seizures.\n\n\n"}

The first nine editions were compiled by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first edition was published in Britain by Penguin Books in 1992. Every two years since then, through 2010, a new edition has been published with updated entries. The eighth and ninth editions, published in 2006 and 2008, respectively, each include 2,000 new CD listings.\n\nThe title has taken different forms over the lifetime of the work, as audio technology has changed. The seventh edition was known as \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD\" while subsequent editions are titled \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings.\" The earliest edition had the title \"The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, LP and Cassette\".\n\nRichard Cook died in 2007, prior to the completion of the 9th edition (2008). Penguin released \"The Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in the 1001 Best Albums\" in December 2010, using fewer reviews and a different format from previous editions.\n\nIn the first nine editions, artists are listed alphabetically and the entries begin with short (usually one paragraph) biographies before a comprehensive listing of a musicians' available recordings. Each disc is given a rating of up to four stars and details of its label and catalogue number, musicians featured on the disc, month and year of the recording or the span of time in which the tracks were recorded and finally a review of varying length. Often a number of discs are reviewed together.\n\nTwo extra features, author's picks (crowns) and \"core collections\", have been added to succeeding editions. The first shows entries flagged as personal favorites while the latter are the \"more essential\" albums for a jazz CD collection. John Eyles comments in a review that \"the implication is that the choices for crowns are subjective, while the Core Collection is somehow more objective,\" when in fact both lists are decided upon by the same two editors.\n\nBootlegs and limited-edition Mosaic Records releases are excluded. Various-artists compilations were reviewed in the first edition but were dropped in later editions. Due to the increasing numbers of CDs on the market, space limitations and depth of coverage have increasingly become an issue: in the 7th edition, for instance, the index was dropped to save space, but it was restored in the 8th edition (but a number of entries were dropped or shortened to make room for it).\n\nIn the tenth edition, titled \"The Penguin Jazz Guide\" (2010), Morton revised his and Cook's entries from previous editions, and pared down the content to 1001 reviews of what Morton had selected as the best jazz recordings. Morton also presented the reviews in chronological order by recording dates, rather than alphabetically by artist, and included historical context for the recordings as well as biographical details. The tenth edition also dispensed with the starred rating system, the Core Collection, and Crown accolades.\n\nThough the first nine editions did not \"spring any great surprises,\" the book \"has a tried and trusted formula that works\". It is also praised as being \"of equal value to both experienced jazz listeners and novices.\" Alison Kerr, reviewing the 2010 \"Penguin Jazz Guide\" in \"The Herald\", noted the lack of an index as a hindrance, but cited the chronological format as one of the book's strengths. Kerr also noted the subjective nature of Morton's selection of the best jazz albums.\n\n"}
