It is a book of \"quite interesting\" quotations.\n\n\"Advanced Banter\" was first published by Faber in hardback on 1 October 2008. A paperback version of \"Advanced Banter\" was published on 5 November 2009. The book was released in the United States under the title \"If Ignorance Is Bliss, Why Aren't There More Happy People?\" on 4 August 2009.\n\nOf the previous \"QI\" books, the structure is akin to the second book, \"The Book of Animal Ignorance\", which is an encyclopaedic listing of 100 animals, compared to the first book, \"The Book of General Ignorance\", which was written in a question and answer format. \"Advanced Banter\" contains a series of quotes which are divided into over 400 separate topics, such as \"Acting\", \"Action\" and \"Adventure\", which are listed alphabetically. However, there are no topics under the letter \"X\". As with the two previous books, there are also contributions by two television stars of \"QI\": host Stephen Fry and panellist Alan Davies. Fry writes an introduction entitled \"Prologue\", while Davies writes a section called \"Proverb\", which contains a proverb which he himself has written: \"A small pie is soon eaten.\"\n\nBoyd Tonkin in \"The Independent\" wrote of Lloyd and Mitchinson: \"They prove in spades that the distinction between reference and entertainment has collapsed, with no exact sources given and a preface that styles the book as a 'manifesto' for pithy wit rather than a monument of scholarship.

It houses the archaeological finds of the city of Hamburg and the neighbouring counties to the south of the city. It focuses on northern German prehistory and early history as well as the history of the former city of Harburg. The museum is also home to the cultural heritage landmarks commission of the city of Hamburg and the adjacent district of Harburg in Lower-Saxony and thus supervises all archaeological undertakings in the region.\n\nThe museum has two major exhibition spaces. The future City Museum of Harburg, temporary exhibitions, the library, offices and small storage facilities are located in the main building, which is shared with the Harburger Theater at . The permanent archaeological exhibition and education facilities are located nearby, at . In addition, the Museum maintains as external branches the exhibition area of the 12th-century (Bishop's Tower) in Hamburg's old town, the archaeological trail at and the 8th-century hillfort of Hollenstedt.\n\nWith more than 2.5 million objects, the museum holds the largest collection of prehistoric finds. On exhibit are mostly local examples of the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras, the Bronze and Iron Ages, the Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages in northern Germany. In 2009, the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition opened. It is structured in the following subject areas: materials, food, violence, death, innovation and mobility. In more than 160 glass display cases, models and large exhibit items represent all aspects of human cultural development over the last 40,000 years. In addition, installations on cultural heritage landmarks, the archaeology of Hamburg, and methods of collection and preservation provide information about the work of the museum and archaeologists. Some of the notable exhibits are the Duvensee paddle (one of the oldest surviving paddles), the Metzendorf-Woxdorf head burial, the Bronze Age Daensen folding chair, the Ovelgönne Bread Roll, the Saxon Wulfsen horse burial, the Tangendorf disc brooch, a section of the Wittmoor Bog Trackway and the Maschen disc brooch.\n\nA second permanent exhibition on the local history of the Harburg borough is due to be opened in the near future.\n\nThe museum's foundation was initiated in 1898 by the Hamburg Senator August Helms, who was joined by other public figures in a museum association. Their aim was to create a museum for the then independent Prussian city of Harburg (Elbe) and their county. In 1925, the founder's sons deeded the museum a prestigious villa in to use as an exhibition hall, and the museum was renamed \"Helms-Museum\". By that time, the collection already had more than 50,000 catalogued objects. In 1937, the Helms-Museum became a public institution. In 1955, the Museum left the villa, which had been damaged by a bomb in World War II, and moved to a new main building next to the Harburger Theater. In 1953, Director Willi Wegewitz initiated the open-air . In 1972, the Helms-Museum became Hamburg's only archaeological museum, and all archaeological holdings at other Hamburg museums were transferred to it. Since 1987, the museum has been entrusted with the preservation of cultural heritage landmarks. For space reasons, the archaeological permanent exhibition was moved to its present location at . A third exhibition area was maintained from 1990 to 1999 at the old Harburg Fire Station. On 1 January 2008, the ownership of the Helms-Museum transferred to the (Foundation of Hamburg Historical Museums), and it was renamed \"\". On 14 May 2009 the newly designed permanent archaeological exhibition was opened.\n\nThe museum participates in the \"Long Night of Museums of Hamburg\", and offers a variety of educational programs for children and school classes. Since the Museum has provided an interactive electronic museum guide as an iTunes mobile app, also available for Android operating systems.\n\n\n"}

They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between . The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.\n\nThe native habitat of the Atlantic halibut is the temperate and arctic waters of the northern Atlantic, from Labrador and Greenland to Iceland, the Barents Sea and as far south as the Bay of Biscay and Virginia. It is the largest flatfish in the world, reaching lengths of up to and weights of . Its lifespan can reach 50 years.\n\nThe Atlantic halibut is a right-eyed flounder. It is flattened sideways and habitually lies on the left side of its body with both eyes migrating to the right side of its head during development. Its upper surface is a uniformly dark chocolate, olive or slate colour, and can be almost black; the underside is pale. The end of the caudal fin is concave. Young fish are paler with more mottled colouration.\n\nThe Atlantic halibut has a relatively slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity, with males attaining maturity at seven to eight years old, females at 10 to 11 years, and individuals are thought to live up to 50 years. Little is known about their breeding except their spawning is seasonal, although its timing varies somewhat with location. In the eastern Atlantic, spawning occurs chiefly in March, April and May, although may span from January to June. Off the American coast, however, the spawning season appears to continue through the summer as late as September. After spawning, both sexes migrate northwards in search of food. Young Atlantic halibut individuals feed on crustaceans such as crabs and prawns. These halibut lie motionless and invisible on the sea bed, capturing any fish that pass within reach, although they may also hunt for fish in open water.\n\nThis marine fish usually lives on the ocean floor at depths between , but it occasionally comes closer to the surface. The larvae are pelagic, drifting relatively helplessly, but at around 4 cm, they migrate to the bottom. Young between the ages of two and four years live close to the shore, moving into deeper waters as they grow older.\n\nFound in both the eastern and western portions of the North Atlantic. In the western Atlantic, found from southwestern Greenland and Labrador, Canada to Virginia in the USA. They are found in the eastern Atlantic around Iceland, the United Kingdom, and northern Europe to Russia. A map of the Atlantic Halibut's geographic distribution can be found on the Official Website of Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.\n\nThe Atlantic halibut occupies a relatively high trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe diet of the Atlantic halibut consists mainly of other fish, e.g. cod, haddock, herring, pogge, sand eels and capelin, but it will also eat cephalopods, large crustaceans and other benthos organisms.\n\nAtlantic halibut are eaten by seals, and are a staple food of the Greenland shark.\n\nThe wild Atlantic halibut was formerly a very important food fish, but due to its slow rate of population growth, it is unable to recover quickly from overfishing, and the fishery has largely collapsed. Consequently, wild fish labelled as \"halibut\" are usually one of the other large flatfishes, including Pacific halibut, \"Hippoglossus stenolepis\".\n\nDue to its popularity as a food fish, Atlantic halibut has attracted investment in fish farming. As of 2006, five countries - Canada, Norway, the UK, Iceland and Chile - were engaged in some form of Atlantic halibut aquaculture production.\n\nIn 1996, the IUCN rated it as Endangered and placed it on its Red List.\n\nThe Atlantic halibut is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, one of those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The American Fisheries Society has classified the species as \"Vulnerable\". In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Atlantic halibut to its seafood red list of \"fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\n"}

It is named in honour of the 19th-century French lexicographer and grammarian Louis-Nicolas Bescherelle (and perhaps his brother Henri Bescherelle). It is often used as a general term, but the \"Collection Bescherelle\" is in fact a brand name, used by Éditions Hatier for Metropolitan French, and also by Éditions Hurtubise for Canadian French. \n\nThe series is made up of three volumes dealing with various aspects of French grammar. Each of the three volumes uses example sentences to demonstrate proper French grammar. The term \"Bescherelle\" is often used to refer to the first book, \"L'art de conjuguer\".\n\n\"L'art de conjuguer\" (The Art of Conjugation) presents the conjugation of every type of verb in the French language in every verb tense. Each verb type is numbered so that multiple verbs with identical conjugation (such as \"chanter\" and \"enchanter\") can be grouped under one basic verb of that type. \"L'art de conjuguer\" also offers all of the rules concerning grammar within verb conjugation as well as a detailed guide on the purpose of each verb tense. The most recent versions cover 12,000 verbs in 95 conjugation tables. \n\nThe second volume, \"L'orthographe pour tous\" (Spelling for All) explains how to convert spoken sounds in French into writing. The third volume, \"Grammaire pour tous\" (Grammar for All) is a guide on French syntax, sentence structure, the application of proper grammar to sentences, and punctuation. \n\nBescherelles (\"L'art de conjuguer\" in particular) are commonly used in French immersion schools, and it is often required for students to purchase one for class.\n\nBescherelles also exist on the grammars of German, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Latin although they are less popular than that of the original French. Similarly, there are not only editions written for students whose first language is the subject, but there are also editions for students with a grounding in another language. Students can choose an edition to use their existing or new language to read \"about\" the new one.\n\nAlthough the word \"Bescherelle\" has the typically feminine ending \"-elle\", it is a masculine noun in French (\"le Bescherelle\").\n\nThere is an iPhone and iPad application named \"Bescherelle ‐ Le conjugueur\" (The Conjugator), which contains all of the French language verbs and conjugations. It was published by the two French publishers: Anuman Interactive and Hatier.\n\n"}

{"id": "51396868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51396868", "title": "Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese", "text": "Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\n\nThe Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1947), which was compiled by Yuen Ren Chao and Lien Sheng Yang, made numerous important lexicographic innovations. It was the first Chinese dictionary specifically for spoken Chinese words rather than for written Chinese characters, and one of the first to mark characters for being \"free\" or \"bound\" morphemes according to whether or not they can stand alone as a complete and independent utterance.\n\nThe compilers of the \"Concise Dictionary of Chinese\", the linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1892-1982) and the historian Yang Lien-sheng (1914-1990), were famous Chinese-American scholars who worked in Harvard University wartime Chinese language programs for the War Department. Chao was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1941 to 1946, while Yang entered the graduate program in 1940, and received an M.A. in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1946.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, the shortage of Chinese and Japanese bilingual dictionaries became an urgent matter for English-speaking Allies. The Harvard–Yenching Institute said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had \"grown from chronic to acute\", and selected two \"practical dictionaries\" to revise and reprint—without either author's permission—for \"the immediate demands of American students\" (Mathews 1943: v). Both photolithographic reproductions were retitled: \"The Five Thousand Dictionary\" (5th ed., 1940) became \"Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary\" (1942) and \"\" (1931) became \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1943). Y. R. Chao contributed to both these reprints. He revised the introduction and wrote the Standards of Pronunciation, Styles of Pronunciation, and Tones sections for \"Fenn's\" (1942: xxii-xxiv), and wrote the Introduction on Pronunciation for \"Mathews\"' (1943: ix-xvii).\n\nYuen Ren Chao and Lien-sheng Yang divided the lexicographical work. Yang compiled the preliminary list of entries, partially drafted the definitions, served both as informant and as grammarian on Beijing dialect, and wrote the characters. Chao wrote most of the definitions, added pronunciations from regional varieties of Chinese, and wrote the front matter and the appendices (1947: vii). Chao and Yang finished compiling their \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" in 1945, the same year when the War Department published the anonymous \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese: Chinese-English, English-Chinese\". Although the 847-page \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" is large, it contains relatively few lexical items, approximately 2,500 English-Chinese head entries in 500 pages and 5,000 Chinese-English ones in 300 pages (1945: 1).\n\nThe Chinese-English section's head entries are not single characters, as in traditional Chinese dictionaries, but monosyllabic and polysyllabic words, which are alphabetically collated using a newly devised system for romanizing Chinese (which became the prototype for Yale romanization). \"This represents a radical departure from all earlier Chinese-English dictionaries, which were primarily dictionaries of Chinese characters (\"hànzi\") and not of the spoken language as such\" (Norman 1988: 175). Although the Chinese-English section gives characters for head entries, they are treated as secondary. The \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" records authentic colloquial pronunciation, and its chief function is to show a user how to employ the entries in spoken Chinese—in contrast, the chief function of previous bilingual dictionaries is to enable a user to decode written texts. Most entries provide one or more usage examples from colloquial speech. This dictionary classifies words into twelve complex grammatical categories: adjective (A), demonstrative (Dem), adverb (H), intransitive verb (I), conjunction (J), coverb (K), measure word (M), noun (N), numeral (Num), pronoun (Pron), resultative compound (RC) and transitive verb (V).\n\nThe \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\"'s English-Chinese section averages around 5 entries per page, compared to around 18 per page in the Chinese-English section. Some English-Chinese entries are quite elaborate, providing multiple Chinese translation equivalents and usage examples illustrating various semantic nuances of the English word.\n\nThe influence of American structural linguistics, which shifted interest from the written to the spoken language, is evident in both the War Department's \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" (1945) and Chao's and Yang's \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" (1947). \"In both dictionaries we can observe the authors attempting not just to provide their Chinese entries with English equivalents but to demonstrate through grammatical categorization and examples how they are actually used\" (Norman 1988: 175).\n\nAlthough the War Department dictionary was never widely distributed or used, it affected Chao's and Yang's \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\", and served as the model for two well-known dictionaries. Yale University's Institute of Far Eastern Languages published a revised edition \"Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" (1966), and Fred Fangyu Wang published a two-volume \"Mandarin Chinese dictionary\", Chinese-English (1967) and English-Chinese (1971). With these dictionaries, \"American efforts in Chinese lexicography effectively ceased\" (Norman 1988: 176)—until the \"ABC Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1996).\n\nThe \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" comprises approximately 5,000 single-character head entries, collated by radical-and-stroke and numbered according to the 214 Kangxi radicals. The twelve most frequent radicals are given at the bottom of the pages for the dictionary user to memorize. \"To insure further the finding of the characters, the authors have entered each character under all its apparently possible radicals and made a cross reference to the main entry\" (1947: xxvi). For instance, 魯 \"luu\" is entered under radical 72 曰 \"sun\", with the note \"See Rad. 195 魚 [\"fish\"].\" The \"Concise Dictionary\" includes the popular and cursive forms of many characters, as well as the Suzhou numerals (e.g., \"〢 \"ell\" Soochow numeral for '2', used in trade\"), and the Bopomofo symbols (\"ㄎ \"ke\" National Phonetic letter for the aspirated initial \"k\"\"), which had never been included in a Chinese dictionary, thus removing \"one source of bewilderment for the foreign student of Chinese\" (Luo 1947: 434).\n\nThe \"Concise Dictionary\" has \"many elaborate features to help the user study the refinements of spoken Chinese\" (Dunn 1977: 78). Chao's introduction lists eight unique features not found in previous comparable Chinese-English dictionaries such as Fenn's and Mathews' (1947: v-vi).\n\n(1) The grammatical function of each word is distinguished according to whether it is free (F) or bound (B). With the exception of measure words or Chinese classifiers, called \"auxiliary nouns\" (AN), the dictionary generally did not indicate syntactic part of speech, called \"word classes\". Chao explains, \"The same word, as a noun, means one thing; as an auxiliary noun (AN) something else, as a verb something else again. This is not a matter of inference, as those who say that Chinese has no parts of speech assume, but a matter of individual facts.\" (1947: v). The dictionary's English translation equivalents usually can clarify Chinese part of speech; if 吃 \"chy\" [\"chī\"] is defined by the English verb \"to eat\", then it is itself also a verb. word classes are only specified in cases of ambiguity; 脂肪 \"jyfang\" [\"zhīfáng\"] \"fat\" is marked \"n.\" \"noun\" since English \"fat\" can also be an adjective (Norman 1988: 174). The dictionary lists other specialized grammatical categories (1947: xxvii-xxxi), for instance, \"auxiliary nouns proper\" and \"quasi-auxiliary nouns\", and introduces for the first time in a Chinese dictionary \"many new ideas about the linguistic structure of Chinese, such as the four types of verbal complements\": the \"pre-transitive,\" \"verb-object construction\", \"possessive object,\" and \"impersonal verb-object compound\"\" (Luo 1947: 432-433).\n\n(2) The stylistic register or usage class of each entry is either marked by an abbreviation (e.g., \"derog.\", \"honorif.\", \"poet.\") or implied in the translation (as 殆 \"well-nigh,\" but 差不多 \"almost\"), in order to \"channel the student's efforts in using the language to more profitable directions\".\n\n(3) The \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" is the first Chinese dictionary to give detailed descriptions of particles and interjections. For example, 了 has three entries: \n\n(4) Dictionary entries give morphological derivations, words created by adding affixes (e.g., 兒 \"erl\" [\"r\"], the \"syllabic diminutive suffix, frequently used in verse\") or by reduplication (單 \"dan\" [\"dān\"] single … 單單 \"(this) only, alone; (this) of all things\").\n\n(5) Entries also give collocative words that are frequently used together (e.g., \"棋 \"chyi\" [\"qí\"] \"chess\" … 下棋 \"to play chess or \"go\"\") and common antonyms. This dictionary \"includes a great number of meanings even of well-known words which so far have not been noted in any other dictionary\" (Simon 1949: 137).\n\n(6) The Gwoyeu Romatzyh \"National Romanization\" system, which Y.R. Chao co-created and popularized, is used for pronunciation of main entries, along with usual Wade-Giles orthography given in parentheses. Appendix 1, Part 2, is a table of concordance for these two systems. Tonal spelling of the four tones is the primary advantage of National Romanization, for instance, \"dau\" (1st tone), \"daur\" (2nd), \"dao\" (3rd), and \"daw\" (4th tone), corresponding to pinyin \"dāo\", \"dáo\", \"dǎo\", and \"dào\". The neutral tone is indicated by a dot before the atonal syllable.\n\n(7) Romanizations incorporate superscripts and other symbols to denote the historical features of Middle Chinese pronunciation and modern pronunciation in varieties of Chinese, often misleadingly called \"dialects\". For examples, a subscribed dot under an initial (恤 \"ṣhiuh\" [xù] \"to pity, to give relief to\") makes it possible for students interested in Peking opera to distinguish 尖 \"sharp\" dental consonants from 圓 \"rounded\" palatal consonants, and a superscript indicates Cantonese has a final \"-p\" checked tone and Wu Chinese has a glottal stop (Luo 1947: 433).\n\n(8) All entries \"are treated as morphemes, or monosyllabic meaningful spoken words\", whether bound morphemes or free morphemes, rather than as characters. Chao gives a chemical analogy to differentiate between \"zìdiǎn\" 字典 \"character dictionaries\" and \"cídiǎn\" 辭典 \"word dictionaries\".\nIn China, dictionaries are divided into 字典 and 詞典, the former giving only single characters, which may be compared with chemical elements, and the latter compounds and phrases, like chemical compounds. To pursue the chemical analogy one step further, compounds are so numerous that they cannot all be included except in a much more comprehensive work. We can do more than merely list the elements and their atomic weights. We can classify their affinities, their electric polarity, indicate whether they can be ionized, and give such information as to enable us to predict more compounds than can be listed. Thus by giving the morphemes of the language properly analyzed, indicating whether they are bound or free, the attempt has been made to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of a dictionary of single words.\" (1947: vi)\nBy treating all entries as bound or free morphemes rather than as characters, Chao and Yang have made an attempt to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of a dictionary of single words (Luo 1947: 433).\n\nThe dictionary's spine has English \"\"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" / Chao and Yang\" and the front cover has equivalent Chinese \"國語字典 [\"Guóyǔ zìdiǎn\", \"Standard Chinese Dictionary\"] / 趙元任 / 楊聯陞 / 合編\" [\"Zhào Yuánrèn, Yáng Liánshēng, co-editors\"]. The title page has both English \"\"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" / By Yuen Ren Chao and Lien Sheng Yang\" and the same Chinese.\n\nThe Chinese character 道 (composed of radical 162 辶 \"walk\" and a \"shǒu\" 首 \"head\" phonetic) for \"dào\" \"way; path; say; the Dao\" or \"dǎo\" \"guide; lead; instruct\" makes a good sample entry for illustrating a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Chao's and Yang's dictionary entry gives detailed syntactic and pragmatic information, but fails to note the pronunciation \"dǎo\" 道 that is a variant Chinese character for \"dǎo\" 導 (with radical 41 寸 \"thumb\") \"to lead, to guide\", which they do enter (1947: 64).\n道 d̠aw. (tao). \"B\" way, reason, principle, \"Tao\" 道.理; \"-l\" a road \"AN\" 條, 個; \"AN\" a course (of food); \"-l\", \"tz\" a streak \"AN\" a streak \"-l\"; \"F\" to say (introducing a direct quotation: novel style); \"B-\" to say (polite words), \"as\" 道喜 \"v-o\" 'to congratulate,' 道謝 \"v-o\" 'to give thanks.' 有道 \"used at the end of the salutation in writing to a prominent scholar\"; 沒道.理 unreasonable; mean; rude. (1947: 218) \nFirst, this 道 entry glosses pronunciation with National Romanization \"d̠aw\" and Wade-Giles \"tao\". The underscored \"d̠\" consonant indicates a voiced initial in Wu and a lower register tone in Cantonese. Second, it gives English translation equivalents for the bound word (\"B\") \"dàoli\" 道理, with the dot before 理 denoting neutral tone \"li\", and the subscript 96 meaning radical 96 玉 \"jade\" where a dictionary user can find the character 理 \"lii\" listed under 96.7, with 7 being the number of strokes in the \"lǐ\" 里 phonetic. Third, it gives the colloquial term \"dàor\" 道兒 \"road\" with \"-l\" indicating the word plus the diminutive retroflex suffix \"-r\" 兒, counted with \"tiáo\" 條 \"measure word for long, narrow things\" (\"AN\" abbreviates \"auxiliary noun\"). Fourth, the entry notes that 道 itself is used as a measure word for courses during a meal. Fifth, \"dàor\" 道兒 or \"dàozi\" 道子 (\"tz\" denotes the noun suffix 子) can mean \"streak\", counted with \"tiáo\" 條 or \"ge\" 個 \"general measure word\". Sixth, \"dàor\" 道兒 can also be used as a measure word for streaks. Seventh, the free word (\"F\") \"dào\" 道 \"dao\" means \"to say\". Eighth, it also means \"to say (polite words)\" in bound terms such as \"dàoxǐ\" 道喜 (subscript 30 denotes radical 30 口 \"mouth\"), \"dàoxiè\" 道謝, and \"yǒudào\" 有道. Ninth, the entry gives the bound word \"méi dàoli\" 沒道理. Chao's and Yang's brief 道 entry is packed with linguistic information for users.\n\nMost, if not all, reviewers have praised the \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\", while some have been critical. The co-author Lien-Sheng Yang responded to DeFrancis' and Simon's reviews in a 1949 article about free and bound morphemes in Chinese.\n\nThe Chinese linguist Luo Changpei (1947: 432) describes the dictionary as \"unprecedented in the history of Chinese-European lexicography since its beginnings\" in the early 17th century. Luo lists three unique features of the dictionary, combining six of the eight given by Chao (above); the first combines (1) and (3), the second (2), (7), (8), and the third is (6). Luo (1947: 435-436) lists 15 corrections or suggestions, 9 of which are included in later editions of the dictionary, under Corrections and Additions (1957: x)\n\nThe American linguist and lexicographer John DeFrancis described the \"Concise Dictionary\" as \"a landmark notable for its presentation of a great deal of extremely valuable information—grammatical, phonetic, dialectical, and otherwise\" (1948: 447).\n\nDeFrancis suggests that Chao and Yang have been \"unduly influenced by the ideographs and the myths of Chinese monosyllabism\" (1948: 447). Although the dictionary title has \"Spoken Chinese\", the authors approach the subject through characters rather than through speech. Using data from a 10-page sample, DeFrancis disproves Chao's contention that with \"very few exceptions\" Chinese morphemes are \"for the most part monosyllabic\" (1947: vi). The sample dictionary entries marked as \"literary\" (L), \"comparable to \"yclept\" in English and hence not really belonging in a dictionary of spoken Chinese\", amount to 16% of the total entries. (Yclept is an archaic or humorous word meaning \"called; named\".\nOf the entries which really represent spoken forms, no more than 29 per cent have been classified by the authors as Free, the only category which is generally accepted as designating a word in English and other languages. But not all the remaining 71 per cent are classified as Bound forms of the type \"er\" in \"banker\" or \"sender\". Only 49 per cent are of this type of meaningful syllables without independent life. The remaining 22 per cent, represented by \"shan\" and \"hu\" in \"shanhu\", \"coral,\" are of a type which have no more meaning or independence than do \"cor\" and \"al\" in the English equivalent. (1948: 448) \nDeFrancis proposes that the category of Bound syllables (not \"words\") should be divided into two groups: \"meaningless bound syllables\" (like \"shan\" and \"hu\" in \"shanhu\" 珊瑚 \"coral\") and \"meaningful bound syllables\" (like \"fu\" \"father\" and \"mu\" \"mother\" in \"fumu\" 父母 \"parents\"). \"The former are fully bound (occurring in only one word), and the latter are semibound (occurring in more than one word).\" DeFrancis concludes that the contributions of scholars like Dr. Chao, \"give hope that lexicographers, if they can concentrate on Chinese speech and not be misled by the ideographic writing, will eventually succeed in compiling a real dictionary of the Chinese spoken language.\" (1948: 448).\n\nIn response to DeFrancis' review, Lien-sheng Yang states that comparing the dictionary entries designated as literary to \"yclept\" in English is \"misleading, because the latter is an archaic word, whereas the former are still used in modern Spoken Chinese\" (1949: 463). Yang says DeFrancis' suggestion of differentiating \"meaningless bound syllables\" and \"meaningful bound syllables\" appears interesting but unfortunately it involves three difficulties. First, since the word \"meaning\" is ambiguous, a linguist has to define \"meaningful\" and \"meaningless\" and ascertain whether all native-speaker informants agree. Second, a linguist needs to consider differences in the informants' background and education, \"One syllable which is meaningful to one may be meaningless to another\" (1949: 463). Third, the identification of meaningful and meaningless syllables with those occurring in more than one word and those occurring in only one \"is doubtful\". Taking the example of \"shan\" and \"hu\" in \"shanhu\" \"coral\", Yang notes both characters are used in other compounds, namely, \"shanshan\" 珊珊 \"tinkling sound (of ornaments)\" and \"hulian\" 瑚璉 \"two types of ritual vessels\" (1949: 464).\n\nThe German sinologist Walter Simon says the \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" is a \"definite advance on our knowledge of the Chinese language\" and calls it a \"very important lexicographical contribution\" from which \"students cannot fail to derive great benefit\" (1949: 137). Simon says\n[O]ne can readily see that a dictionary which notes the alternatives \"free\" or \"bound\" in the case of each single character, is a mine of information which may lend itself to very important subsequent research. Questions like the following come to the mind at once. \"How many of the characters included in the dictionary occur only 'free' or only 'bound', how many occur with the suffix –\"tz\" or –\"l\", what is the distribution if we proceed to grouping words according to their meanings (e.g., parts of the body)? Are practically all verbs free and all nouns 'bound', etc., etc.?\" (1949: 137)\nQuoting this remark, Yang says, \"These are good questions. The last one is particularly suggestive, because it leads to the question whether there are free and bound parts of speech.\" (1949: 465).\n\nYu-Ju Chih, a teacher and developer of Chinese language textbooks, says that unlike almost all the commonly used Chinese-English dictionaries that are geared primarily to reading Chinese texts, the \"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese\" is the \"only one of its kind available to the public\" (1967: 108).\n\n"}

The \"Cyclopaedia\" was one of the first general encyclopedias to be produced in English. \nThe 1728 subtitle gives a summary of the aims of the author:\n\nThe first edition included numerous cross-references meant to connect articles scattered by the use of alphabetical order, a dedication to the King, George II, and a philosophical preface at the beginning of Volume 1. Among other things, the preface gives an analysis of forty-seven divisions of knowledge, with classed lists of the articles belonging to each, intended to serve as a table of contents and also as a directory indicating the order in which the articles should be read.\n\nA second edition appeared in 1738 in two volumes in folio, with 2,466 pages. This edition was supposedly retouched and amended in a thousand places, with a few added articles and some enlarged articles. Chambers was prevented from doing more because the booksellers were alarmed by a bill in Parliament containing a clause to oblige the publishers of all improved editions of books to print their improvements separately. The bill, after passing the House of Commons, was unexpectedly thrown out by the House of Lords; but fearing that it might be revived, the booksellers thought it best to retreat though more than twenty sheets had been printed.\n\nFive other editions were published in London from 1739 to 1751–1752. An edition was also published in Dublin in 1742; this and the London editions were all 2 volumes in folio. An Italian translation appearing in Venice, 1748–1749, 4to, 9 vols., was the first complete Italian encyclopaedia. When Chambers was in France in 1739, he rejected very favorable proposals to publish an edition there dedicated to Louis XV.\n\nChambers' work was carefully done, and popular. However, it had defects and omissions, as he was well aware; at his death, on 15 May 1740, he had collected and arranged materials for seven new volumes. George Lewis Scott was employed by the booksellers to select articles for the press and to supply others, but he left before the job was finished. The job was then given to Dr. John Hill. The \"Supplement\" was published in London in 1753 in two folio volumes with 3307 pages and 12 plates. Hill was a botanist, and the botanical part, which had been weak in the \"Cyclopaedia\", was the best.\n\nAbraham Rees, a nonconformist minister, published a revised and enlarged edition in 1778–1788, with the supplement and improvements incorporated. It was published in London, as a folio of 5 vols., 5010 pages (but not paginated), and 159 plates. It was published in 418 numbers at 6d. each. Rees claimed to have added more than 4,400 new articles. At the end, he gave an index of articles, classed under 100 .heads, numbering about 57,000 and filling 80 pages. The heads, with 39 cross references, were arranged alphabetically.\n\nAmong the precursors of Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" was John Harris's \"Lexicon Technicum\", of 1704 (later editions from 1708 through 1744). By its title and content, it was \"An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.\" While Harris's work is often classified as a technical dictionary, it also took material from Newton and Halley, among others.\n\nChambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" in turn became the inspiration for the landmark \"Encyclopédie\" of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, which owed its inception to a proposed French translation of Chambers' work begun in 1744 by John Mills, assisted by Gottfried Sellius\n\n\n"}

It uses HTTP/2 and HTTPS, and supports the \"wire format\" DNS response data, as returned in existing UDP responses, in an HTTPS payload with the codice_1 MIME type. If HTTP/2 is used, the server may also use HTTP/2 server push to send values that it anticipates the client may find useful in advance.\n\nDNS over HTTPS is used for recursive DNS resolution by DNS resolvers. Resolvers (\"DoH clients\") need to have access to a DoH server hosting a query endpoint.\n\nDNS over HTTPS currently lacks native support in operating systems. Thus a user wishing to use it must install additional software. Three usage scenarios are common:\n\n\nIn all of these scenarios, the DoH client does not directly query any authoritative name servers. Instead, the client relies on the DoH server using traditional (port 53 or 853) queries to finally reach authoritative servers. Thus DoH does not qualify as an end-to-end encrypted protocol, only hop-to-hop encrypted and only if DNS over TLS is used consistently.\n\nDNS over HTTPS server implementations are already available for free by some public DNS providers.

The title comes from a song in the special, \"Don't Eat the Pictures,\" sung by Cookie Monster. It was available as a video tape by Random House in 1987, and it re release vhs by Paramount Home Video in 1996. and to DVD in 2011. During the program, five splendid songs. The special has everybody reprising their roles from the children's television series, \"Sesame Street\". The story takes on getting locked in an American Metropolitan Museum of Art overnight as they embark on an adventure to find their friend Big Bird, who has gotten lost finding Snuffy. They must stay there until the morning while avoiding a security guard. The special features the regular human cast of \"Sesame Street\" along with several of The Muppets, including Cookie Monster, Telly, Bert & Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Oscar the Grouch. Snuffy also appears, even though his names are revealed to be Mr. Snuffleupagus and Aloysius Snuffleupagus; however, at this point in the show's history, he is still the imaginary friend of Big Bird, never seen by the other characters on Sesame Street.\n\nThe Sesame Street gang have gone on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Big Bird has arranged to meet with Snuffy at the museum but before he can, it is closing time. Big Bird decides to go off and look for Snuffy. Before the group can leave, they realize Big Bird is missing and run all through the museum looking for him. The chase has them going through different exhibits at high speed and missing, spotting, and chasing him. After a bit, they give up, only to find that they are locked in the museum overnight. They decide to go back out and look for Big Bird and look at all the exhibits while they are at it.\n\nBig Bird eventually finds Snuffy and they wander the Egyptian exhibit and encounter an Egyptian prince named Sahu (Aram Chowdhury) and his cat who have been cursed to remain on Earth and not be able to become a star like his parents until he answers the question \"Where does today meet yesterday?\" Every night at midnight for thousands of years, a demon (James Mason) appears to ask Sahu that and he has answered wrong every night. Big Bird suggests Sahu remain on Earth and become \"the only 4,000 year old kid on Sesame Street\", but later agrees with Snuffy that they should work together to get the answer right.\n\nMeanwhile, the group has split up and are all in different exhibits. Bob and Cookie Monster find themselves looking at pictures with food in them. While Cookie Monster tries to eat the pictures, Bob points out to him a sign that says \"Please don't eat the pictures.\" He replies with \"Oh, this going to be a long night.\" He later sings the song \"Don't Eat the Pictures\" about this. Oscar finds an exhibit of Greek and Roman statues that have been broken by natural disasters. He looks in and breaks into song on how beautiful they are to him. Grover finds an exhibit filled with armor from medieval times and thinks a suit of Maximilian armour is a guy named \"Max\" and tries to befriend him by changing into his Super Grover costume and singing a song. Bert and Ernie view the painting of \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\", to which Bert comments on the dedication of Washington and his men, but Ernie comments how he was very silly to cross in the winter and should have waited until Easter or taken the George Washington Bridge.\n\nAs the night passes, Big Bird and Snuffy continue to try to figure out the answer to the question. Soon just before midnight Big Bird unknowingly figures out the answer is \"a museum.\" When the demon appears that night, the question is answered correctly and Sahu is sent to Osiris (Fritz Weaver) to have his heart weighed. When the feather to weigh his heart doesn't appear, Big Bird offers one of his to help. But when Sahu's heart is too heavy, Big Bird claims that it wasn't fair since Sahu was on Earth for 40 centuries and he was so alone his heart would be heavy, so he can't become a star.\n\nAfter this, Sahu's heart becomes lighter and he is now ready to join his parents and take his cat. Big Bird and Snuffy then exit the museum, look up into the night sky, and see four stars in a straight line (representing Sahu, his parents, and his cat), and are glad that they reunited Sahu with his parents. When morning comes, Big Bird finds the group and Snuffy is not there. He got up early and left to get to \"Snufflegarden.\" Cookie Monster promised anything on a hot dog stand as a special reward for not eating anything in the museum, and decides to eat the entire stand.\n\nAfter the credits, Big Bird pretends to be a statue. He encourages the viewers to visit their local museum, and comments on how staying perfectly still is tiring and wonders how statues can do it.\n\n\nThe title song from \"Don't Eat the Pictures\" begins with Cookie Monster and his human friend, Bob McGrath in front of \"Still Life with Ham\", a painting by Philippe Rousseau which Cookie Monster tries to devour. Bob holds Cookie Monster back and reminds him that he promised not to eat anything in the museum. Then Cookie Monster breaks into song, with angelic choral accompaniment, about paintings, statues, and mummies, and how he understands how important it is to not devour them.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hooker sailed on HMS \"Erebus\" as assistant surgeon. It was the third in a series of four Floras in the \"Flora Antarctica\", the others being the \"Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands\" (1843–45), the \"Flora of Fuegia, the Falkland Islands, etc\" (1845–47), and the \"Flora Tasmaniae\" (1853–59). They were \"splendidly\" illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch.\n\nThe larger part of the plant specimens collected during the Ross expedition are now part of the Kew Herbarium.\n\nThe British government fitted out an expedition led by James Clark Ross to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, HMS \"Terror\" and HMS \"Erebus\" on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.\n\nThe ships arrived, after several stops, at the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp \"Macrocystis pyrifera\" was found off Marion Island, but no landfall could be made there or on the Crozet Islands due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all the plant species previously encountered by James Cook on the Kerguelen Islands were collected. On 16 August they reached the River Derwent, remaining in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at Lord Auckland's Islands and Campbell's Island for the spring months.\n\nLarge floating forests of \"Macrocystis\" and \"Durvillaea\" were found until the ships ran into icebergs at latitude 61° S. Pack-ice was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage Victoria Land, Mount Erebus and Mount Terror were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the Bay of Islands, and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect plants there. After visiting other islands, the ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.\n\n\"Flora Novae-Zelandiae\" was published between 1851 and 1853.\n\n\nDavid Frodin commented in 2001 that the \"Flora\" \"largely completed\" the \"primary phase of botanical survey in the region\".\n\n"}

Left an orphan at the age of 13, Savigny was brought up by a guardian until, in 1795, he entered the University of Marburg, where, though in poor health, he studied under Professors Anton Bauer and Philipp Friedrich Weiss, the former a pioneer in the reform of the German criminal law, the latter distinguished for his knowledge of medieval jurisprudence. After the fashion of German students, Savigny visited several universities, notably Jena, Leipzig and Halle; and returning to Marburg, took his doctor's degree in 1800. At Marburg he lectured as \"Privatdozent\" on criminal law and the Pandects.\n\nIn 1803 Savigny published \"Das Recht des Besitzes\" (\"The Law of Possession\"). Anton Thibaut hailed it as a masterpiece which brought the old uncritical study of Roman law to an end. It quickly obtained a European reputation, and still remains a prominent landmark in the history of jurisprudence. In 1804 he married Kunigunde Brentano, sister of Bettina von Arnim and Clemens Brentano the poet. The same year he embarked on an extensive tour through France and south Germany in search of fresh sources of Roman law.\n\nIn 1808 Savigny was appointed full professor of Roman law at Landshut. He remained in this position for a year and a half. In 1810 he was appointed to the chair of Roman law at the new University of Berlin, chiefly at the insistence of Wilhelm von Humboldt. Here, in connection with the faculty of law, he created a \"Spruch-Collegium\", an extraordinary tribunal competent to deliver opinions on cases remitted to it by the ordinary courts; and he took an active part in its labours. This was the busiest time of his life. He was engaged in lecturing, in the government of the university (of which he was the third rector), and as tutor to the crown prince in Roman, criminal and Prussian law. During his time in Berlin Savigny befriended Niebuhr and Eichhorn.\n\nIn 1814 Savigny wrote the pamphlet '. In an earlier pamphlet Thibaut had argued for the creation of a unified legal code for Germany, independent of the influence of foreign legal systems. Savigny argued that such a codification of the law would have an adverse effect. According to Savigny the damage which had been caused by the neglect of former generations of jurists could not be quickly repaired, and more time was required to set the house in order. Moreover, a unified legal code would almost certainly be influenced by natural law, with its \"infinite arrogance\" and its \"shallow philosophy\". It was Savigny's opinion that jurisprudence should be saved from the \"hollow abstractions\" of such a work as the ' of Christian Wolff. Savigny opposed this conception of jurisprudence to the \"historical study of the positive law\", which, according to him, is \"a condition precedent to the right understanding of the science of all law\". However, Savigny did not oppose to the introduction of new laws or of a new system of laws.\n\nIn 1815 Savigny, together with Karl Friedrich Eichhorn and Johann Friedrich Ludwig Göschen, founded the \"\" (\"Journal of Historical Legal Studies\"), the organ of the new historical school. In this periodical (vol. iii. p. 129 seq.) Savigny made known to the world the discovery by Niebuhr at Verona of the lost text of Gaius. Savigny pronounced it to be the work of Gaius himself and not, as Niebuhr suggested, of Ulpian.\n\nThe same year, 1815, Savigny published the first volume of his \"\" (\"History of Roman Law in the Middle Ages\"), the sixth and final volume of which did not appear until 1831. He had been prompted to write this work by his early instructor Weiss. Savigny intended it to be a literary history of Roman law from Irnerius to the present time. His design was in some respect narrowed; in others it was widened. He did not continue the narrative beyond the 16th century, when the separation of nationalities disturbed the foundations of the science of law. In the first volume, Savigny treated the history of Roman law from the breaking up of the empire until the beginning of the 12th century. According to Savigny, Roman law, although considered dead, lived on in local customs, in towns, in ecclesiastical doctrines and school teachings, until it once again reappeared in Bologna and other Italian cities.\n\nIn 1817 Savigny was appointed a member of the commission for organizing the Prussian provincial estates, and also a member of the department of justice in the ' (State Council). In 1819 he became a member of the supreme court of appeal for the Rhine Provinces. In 1820 he was made a member of the commission for revising the Prussian code. In 1822 he was afflicted with nervous illness, which compelled him to seek relief in travel. In 1835 Savigny began his elaborate work on contemporary Roman law, ' (8 vols., 1840–1849). His activity as professor ceased in March 1842, when he was appointed \"\" (High Chancellor), the official at the head of the juridical system in Prussia. In this position he carried out several important law reforms in regard to bills of exchange and divorce. He held the office until 1848, when he resigned.\n\nIn 1850, on the occasion of the jubilee of obtaining his doctor's degree, appeared in five volumes his \"Vermischte Schriften\", consisting of a collection of minor works published between 1800 and 1844. Savigny was hailed throughout Germany as \"the great master\" and founder of modern jurisprudence. In 1851 and 1853 he published the two volumes of his treatise on the law of obligations, \"\", mostly on what English-speaking lawyers consider as contract law. It was a supplement to his work on modern Roman law, in which he again argued for the necessity of the historical treatment of law.\n\nSavigny died at Berlin. His son, Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1814–1875), was Prussian minister of foreign affairs in 1849. He represented Prussia in important diplomatic transactions, especially in 1866.\n\nSavigny belongs to the German historical school of jurists, founded by Gustav Hugo, and served a role in its consolidation. The works for which Savigny is best known are the \"Recht des Besitzes\" and the \"Beruf unserer Zeit für Gesetzgebung\". According to Jhering \"with the Recht des Besitzes the juridical method of the Romans was regained, and modern jurisprudence born.\" It was seen as a great advance both in results and method, and rendered obsolete a large body of literature. Savigny argued that in Roman law possession had always reference to \"usucapion\" or to \"interdicts\". It did not include a right to continuance in possession but only to immunity from interference as possession is based on the consciousness of unlimited power. These and other propositions were derived by the interpretation and harmonization of the Roman jurists. However, many of Savigny's conclusions did not meet with universal acclaim. They were opposed by, among others, Jhering, Gans, and Bruns.\n\nSavigny argued in the \"Beruf unserer Zeit\" that law is part and parcel of national life. He opposed the idea, common to French 18th century jurists and Bentham, that law can be arbitrarily imposed on a country irrespective of its state of civilization and history. Another important idea of Savigny is that the practice and theory of jurisprudence cannot be divorced without injury to both.\n\n"}

Soon after filming finished, he discussed the idea with O'Donnell and the pair launched what would become the Glasgow Filmmakers Alliacne on 31 October 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the alliance was invited by Stephen Paton of Production Attic to form what would become the Glasgow Creative Network which hosts networking events for media professionals in Glasgow.\n\nA supporter of independent film, Quick led a campaign to get the British Academy Scotland New Talent Awards recognised by IMDB stating that 'they represented the best of emerging Scottish talent'. The campaign was successful and the awards were introduced to the site later that year. He later repeated this success with the inclusion of the Virgin Media Short Awards after the first double win by Scottish director John McPhail.\n\nIn 2014, Quick and O'Donnell wrote an open letter on behalf of the independent filmmakers of Glasgow to the director of BAFTA Scotland, Jude MacLaverty. In the letter, the pair asked the film body to consider a proposal of including three new awards at the annual ceremony aimed at low budget / independent filmmakers.

{"id": "32866788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32866788", "title": "L'Enfant Plan", "text": "L'Enfant Plan\n\nThe L'Enfant Plan for the city of Washington is the urban plan developed in 1791 by Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant for George Washington, the first President of the United States.\n\nMajor L'Enfant was a French engineer who served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. In 1789, discussions were underway regarding a new federal capital city for the United States, and L'Enfant wrote to President Washington asking to be commissioned to plan the city. However, any decision on the capital was put on hold until July 1790 when Congress passed the Residence Act. The legislation specified that the new capital should be situated on the Potomac River, at some location between the Eastern Branch (the Anacostia River) and the Conococheague Creek near Hagerstown, Maryland. The Residence Act gave authority to President Washington to appoint three commissioners to oversee the survey of the federal district and provide public buildings to accommodate the Federal government in 1800.\n\nPresident Washington appointed L'Enfant in 1791 to plan the new \"Federal City\", under the supervision of three commissioners whom Washington appointed to oversee the planning and development of the territory that became the \"District of Columbia\". Included in the new district were the riverport towns of Georgetown (formerly in Montgomery County, Maryland) and Alexandria, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson worked alongside President Washington in overseeing the plans for the capital, and he sent L'Enfant a letter outlining his task, which was to provide a drawing of suitable sites for the federal city and the public buildings. Jefferson had modest ideas for the Capital, but L'Enfant saw the task as far more grandiose, believing that he was also devising the city plan and designing the buildings.\nL'Enfant arrived in Georgetown on March 9, 1791 and began his work from Suter's Fountain Inn. Washington arrived on March 28 to meet with L'Enfant and the Commissioners for several days. On June 22, L'Enfant presented his first plan for the federal city to the President. On August 19, he appended a new map to a letter that he sent to the President. President Washington retained a copy of one of L'Enfant's plans, showed it to the Congress, and later gave it to the three Commissioners.\n\nIn November 1791, L'Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and southeast along Aquia Creek to supply well-regarded \"Aquia Creek sandstone\" for the foundation of the \"Congress House\". However, his temperament and his insistence that his city design be realized as a whole brought him into conflict with the Commissioners, who wanted to direct the limited funds into construction of the Federal buildings, and they had Jefferson's support in the matter.\n\nAndrew Ellicott had been conducting the original boundary survey of the \"Federal City\" under the direction of the Commissioners, and he informed them in February 1792 that L'Enfant had not been able to have the city plan engraved and had refused to provide him with the original plan. Ellicott and his brother Benjamin then revised the plan, despite L'Enfant's protests. Ellicott's revisions included straightening the longer avenues and the removal of L'Enfant's Square No. 15, and this created changes to the city's layout.\n\nWashington dismissed L'Enfant soon after, and Andrew Ellicott continued the city survey in accordance with the revised plan, several versions of which were engraved, published, and distributed. As a result, Ellicott's revisions subsequently became the basis for the capital city's development.\n\nL'Enfant's \"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States...\" encompassed an area bounded by the Potomac River, the Eastern Branch, the base of the escarpment of the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, and Rock Creek (named on Plan as Pine Creek). His plan specified locations for two buildings, the \"Congress House\" (the United States Capitol) and the \"President's House\" (known after its 1815–1817 rebuilding and repainting of its stone walls, as the \"White House\" or \"Executive Mansion\").\n\nThe \"Congress House\" would be built on \"Jenkins Hill\" (later to be known as \"Capitol Hill\"), which L'Enfant described as a \"pedestal awaiting a monument\". The \"President's House\" would be situated on a ridge parallel to the Potomac River north of the mouth of Tiber Creek, which L'Enfant proposed to canalize.\n\nL'Enfant envisioned the \"President's House\" to have public gardens and monumental architecture. Reflecting his grandiose visions, he specified that the \"President's House\" (occasionally referred to as the \"President's Palace\") would be five times the size of the building that was actually constructed, even then becoming the largest residence then constructed in America. Emphasizing the importance of the new nation's legislature, the \"Congress House\" would be located on a longitude designated as 0:0.\n\nThe plan specified that most streets would be laid out in a grid. To form the grid, some streets (later named for letters of the alphabet) would travel in an east–west direction, while others (named for numbers) would travel in a north-south direction. Diagonal broader avenues, later named after the states of the Union, crossed the north/south-east/west grid. The diagonal avenues intersected with the north–south and east–west streets at circles and rectangular plazas that would later honor notable Americans and provide open space.\n\nA prominent geometric feature of L'Enfant's plan was a large right triangle whose hypotenuse was a wide avenue (now part of Pennsylvania Avenue, NW) connecting the \"President's House\"and the \"Congress House\". To complete the triangle, a line projecting due south from the center of the President's house intersected at a right angle a line projecting due west from the center of the Congress house. A -wide garden-lined \"grand avenue\" containing a \"public walk\" would travel for about along the east–west line.\n\nL'Enfant chose the west end of the \"grand avenue\" (at the triangle's southwest corner) to be the location of a future equestrian statue of George Washington for which the Continental Congress had voted in 1783. (Although the planned \"grand avenue\" became the portion of the National Mall that is now between the Capitol's grounds and the Washington Monument, neither the avenue nor Washington's equestrian statue were ever constructed (see: National Mall). In 1793, a wooden marker was placed at the triangle's southwest corner (the intersection of the cross axis of the White House and the Capitol). A small stone obelisk, the Jefferson Pier, replaced the marker in 1804.\n\nThe Plan also proposed the erection of an \"historic Column\" that would be located within an open space (now the site of Lincoln Park) at the intersection of several streets and avenues that would be one mile east of the Congress House. The column would contain the point from which \"all distances of places through the Continent, are to be calculated\".\n\nL'Enfant's plan additionally laid out a system of canals (later designated as the Washington City Canal) that would pass the \"Congress House\" and the \"President's House\". One branch of the canal would empty into the Potomac River south of the \"President's House\" at the mouth of Tiber Creek, which would be channelized and straightened. The other branch of the canal would divide and empty into the Eastern Branch at two separate points near the Eastern Branch's confluence with the Potomac River. The scale and complexity of the canals in the 1791-92 plan and its revisions suggested the importance of the canals within the grand design of the city, with important structures located along its banks – the proposed National Pantheon, Judiciary Square, a market/exchange complex, a national bank and theater, as well as a grand church complex.\n\nIn a paper published in 1899, John Stewart, who was in charge of records in the United States Army Engineers' Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, wrote that President Washington had sent one of L'Enfant's handwritten plans to Congress on December 13, 1791. Stewart wrote that L'Enfant had sent this plan to the President on August 19, 1791, and had also prepared a larger exact copy. Stewart stated that surveyors had used the copy to lay out the city's streets and that L'Enfant had employed a Philadelphia architect to draft a copy of the larger version for L'Enfant's own use.\n\nStewart also wrote that President Washington had in December 1796 sent to the Commissioners a plan of the city that had contained penciled directions from Thomas Jefferson that identified those parts of the plan that the plan's engravers should omit. Stewart stated that he had discovered that plan in the Commissioners' office in 1873. He reported that the plan was still in that office in 1898.\n\nDuring 1882, Stewart had been in charge of records that the Office of the United States Commissioner of Public Buildings was holding. In that year, he created a black and white copy of several portions of a manuscript plan of the federal capital city. The last line in an oval in the upper left corner of Stewart's reproduction contains the words \"Peter Charles L'Enfant\", which are written in a script and alignment that are similar to those in the line that precedes it. Stewart certified that \"this is a true copy of the original in this office\".\n\nFive years later, in 1887, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey prepared a colored tracing of a manuscript plan. The last line in the oval contained the words \"By Peter Charles L'Enfant\", which were written in a block script. The script and its alignment differed from those in the oval's preceding line.\n\nPrinters published the tracing in at least three formats, which together enabled the Plan to be widely distributed for the first time. The printers added to each of the reproduced tracings a copy of a message that a survey assistant had sent to the survey's superintendent. The message stated that the Acting Secretary of the Treasury had directed that the tracing be produced for the purposes of preservation and reproduction. The message further stated that the Plan's original manuscript was in a dilapidated state and had earlier been mounted on cotton cloth and varnished for preservation, rendering the manuscript \"quite opaque\".\n\nThe survey assistant's message additionally contained a synopsis of letters requesting the tracing that a Special Assistant Attorney for the United States, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, the United States Attorney General, the Acting Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Secretary of War had written. The Assistant Attorney's letter stated that pending litigation had necessitated the plan's reproduction to enable the United States Government to establish title of the Government to the Potomac Flats.\n\nThe Assistant Attorney's letter further stated that an office of the U.S. Army's Engineer Corps that was in charge of Public Buildings and Grounds was holding the original plan, which had become so indistinct that it could not be accurately photographed. Several of the letter writers asked the Survey to return the original manuscript plan to the War Department after the Survey had reproduced it.\n\nIn 1930, the chief of the Division of Maps at the Library of Congress compared the wording in one of reproduced tracings to the wording in an annex to a plan of the City of Washington which, according to a January 1792 publication, President Washington had recently sent to Congress and which contained the words \"By Peter Charles L'Enfant\". The librarian concluded that the two maps were not the same.\n\nA Library of Congress web page states that, on November 11, 1918, a map that L'Enfant had prepared was presented to the Library of Congress for safekeeping. In a 1930 report to the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, William Partridge described the features and history of that map, as well as the changes that Andrew Ellicott had apparently made to the map.\n\nPartridge noted that L'Enfant had written that all of his drawings had been seized in December 1791, but that only one, a plan for the city of Washington, had been recovered. He further stated that although L'Enfant had produced a number of versions of his plan, only one (an intermediate version) was still known to exist. Partridge concluded that the origin of that plan, which the Library of Congress was holding, was still in doubt. That plan, which the Library now holds in its Geography and Map Division, is still the only map of the capital city bearing L'Enfant's name that is widely known.\n\nThe Library's web page states that, in 1991, to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the manuscript map, the Library of Congress, in cooperation with the National Geographic Society, the National Park Service and the United States Geological Survey, published an exact-size, full-color facsimile and an uncolored computer-assisted reproduction of that map. The manuscript's upper left corner contains an oval that identifies the title of the map, followed by the words \"By Peter Charles L'Enfant\" written in a block script that has the same alignment as does that in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey's 1887 tracing.\n\nThe Library states that these reproductions were the Library's first facsimiles to be based on photography and electronic enhancement technology. The Library further states that, during the reproduction process, it was possible to record faint editorial annotations that Thomas Jefferson had made and which are now virtually illegible on the original map.\n\nThe Library states (as did Partridge) that it is believed that its Plan is one that L'Enfant submitted to President Washington in August 1791. However, others have contended that the named manuscript map that the Library holds is actually an earlier draft that was hand-delivered to George Washington in June 1791.\n\nThe Library has in its collections a \"Dotted line map of Washington, D.C., 1791\" that lacks an author's name. The Library's notes state that this document is a \"Ms. survey map drawn by P.C. L'Enfant\" and is \"accompanied by positive and negative photocopies of L'Enfant's letter to George Washington, Aug. 19, 1791, the original in the L'Enfant papers\". (L'Enfant's papers include an August 19, 1791, letter to President Washington that contains an \"annexed map of dotted lines\".) The named plan would therefore be the one that L'Enfant annexed to his June 22, 1791 letter to the President. Comparisons of Andrew Ellicott's February 1792 revision of L'Enfant's Plan with the two manuscript maps suggest that Ellicott had based his revision (which printers distributed soon after its preparation) on the August 1791 \"dotted line map\", rather than on June 1791 manuscript.\n\nThe L'Enfant Plan is depicted in Edward Savage's 1789–1796 painting, \"The Washington Family\".\n\nIn 1980, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation constructed Western Plaza along Pennsylvania Avenue in Northwest Washington, D.C. Designed by architect Robert Venturi and renamed in 1988 to Freedom Plaza, the plaza contains an inlay that partially depicts the L'Enfant Plan. The last line in an oval inscribed in the Plaza contains the words \"By Peter Charles L'Enfant\" in a block script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sport pilots may use a valid state driver's license in place of a medical certificate, and glider and hot air balloon pilots are not required to obtain them.\n\nThe term \"aegrotat\" (abbreviated as \"aegrot\") is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations. In the context of British undergraduate degrees a student who is too ill to finish may be awarded an aegrotat degree if the student otherwise would have passed exams or other requirements.\n\nExcept in certain unique circumstances, a holder of a medical certificate in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may not \"act as pilot in command or in any other capacity as a required flight crewmember of an aircraft\".\n\nA patient with conditions such as: measles, chicken-pox, hepatitis A, leprosy, typhoid fever, and whooping cough, can return to work immediately after their healing phase or medical tests. Almost always the patient may only be allowed to return to work upon submission of a medical certificate.\n\nSometimes, there are standards and procedures in place, for workers in a certain field to be eligible to receive a medical certificate. Any airman at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must give their employees access to the National Driver Register. On top of this, other tests which are required for first-, second- and third-class airmen are: eye, ear/nose/throat/equilibrium, mental, neurologic, and cardiovascular.\n\n\"The India List and India Office List 1905\" explains that officers on \"Long Leave in Europe\" must, among other things, provide a medical certificate, which is obtained at the Medical Board of India Office.\n\n\"Practical Guide to Employees' State Insurance Act, Rules and Regulations\" explains that under the ESI Act, the employee must obtain a medical certificate via the ESI Dispensary/Hospital, which then gets deposited at the nearest office of the ESI Corporation.\n\nAs many illnesses can come about suddenly, sometimes the worker will not have enough time to receive a medical certificate, or may be too sick to obtain one. In other cases, the worker may not be bothered to go to the trouble of getting one, or may be lying about their illness and want to falsify a certificate to back up their story to their boss.\n\nThere have been discussions regarding whether it is okay to fire someone for submitting a fabricated medical certificates. In many cases, it is deemed wrong, such as in Australia where a bank officer was dismissed after handing in a forged certificate, which prompted a Fair Work Australia Commissioner to say they had a \"continued lack of regard for the truth\". Another example is a WA police officer who was stood down after committing the same offense. Sometimes it is not so black and white. In one case, a woman claimed she was \"coerced into falsifying [a] medical certificate [which ultimately led to her being fired] because she was 'being bullied and treated unfairly' by two managers\".\n\nThere are some companies that sell fake medical certificates. Although the site \"Doctors Note Store\" sells \"fake sick notes and medical certificates for workers in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom\", they add that the \"fakes are for 'novelty use only'\".\n\nAt Flinders University, \"providing a forged medical certificate\" is viewed as academic misconduct.\n\nIn New South Wales, medical professionals who \"deliberately issue a false, misleading or inaccurate certificate\" can be charged under the Medical Practice Act. This is in response to The New South Wales Medical Board \"receiving numerous complaints from employers, insurers, the courts, etc regarding the quality, accuracy and truthfulness of sickness certificates\".\n\nIn order to prove that one's medical certificate is authentic, the following should be done and taken into consideration:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48713575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48713575", "title": "Medieval European magic", "text": "Medieval European magic\n\nDuring the Middle Ages magic in Europe took on many forms. Instead of being able to identify one type of magician, there were many who practiced several types of magic in these times, including: monks, priests, physicians, surgeons, midwives, folk healers, and diviners.\n\nThe practice of “magic” often consisted of using medicinal herbs for healing purposes. Classical medicine entailed magical elements, they would use charms or potions in hopes of driving out a sickness. \n\nMedicinal practices in the Middle Ages were often regarded as forms of “natural magic”. One in particular was referred to as a “leechbook”, or a doctor-book that included masses to be said over the healing herbs. For example, a procedure for curing skin disease first involves an ordinary herbal medicine followed by strict instructions to draw blood from the neck of the ill, pour it into running water, spit three times and recite a sort of spell to complete the cure. In addition to the leechbook, the Lacnunga included many prescriptions derived from the European folk culture that more intensely involved magic. The Lacnunga prescribed a set of Christian prayers to be said over the ingredients used to make the medicine, and such ingredients were to be mixed by straws with the names “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John” inscribed on them. In order for the cure to work, several charms had to be sung in Latin over the medicine.\n\nPrayers, blessings, and adjurations were all common forms of verbal formulas whose intentions were hard to distinguish between the magical and the religious. Prayers were typically requests directed to a holy figure such as God, a saint, Christ, or Mary. Blessings more often were addressed to patients, and came in the form of wishes for good fortune. Adjurations, also known as exorcisms were more directed to either a sickness, or the agent responsible such as a worm, demon, or elf. While these three verbal formulas may have had religious intentions, they often played a role in magical practices. When the emphasis of a prayer so apparently relied on the observance of religiously irrelevant conditions, we can characterize it as magical. Blessings were more often than not strictly religious as well, unless they were used alongside magic or in a magical context. However, adjurations required closer scrutiny, as their formulas were generally derived from folklore. The command targeted at the sickness or evil left the possibility of refusal, meaning the healer entered a battle with the devil in which he or she relied on a holy power to come to his/her aid. Though people at this age were less concerned with whether or not these verbal formulas involved magic or not, but rather with the reality of if they were or were not successful.\n\nNot only was it difficult to make the distinction between the magical and religious , but what was even more challenging was to distinguish between helpful (white) magic from harmful (black) magic. Medical magic and protective magic were regarded as helpful, and called ‘white’, while sorcery was considered evil and ‘black’. Distinguishing between black magic and white magic often relied on perspective, for example, if a healer attempted to cure a patient and failed, some would accuse the healer of intentionally harming the patient. In this era, magic was only punished if it was deemed to be ‘black’, meaning it was the practice of a sorcerer with harmful intentions \n\nOne of the main reasons magic was condemned was because those who practiced it put themselves at risk of physical and spiritual assault from the demons they sought to control. However, the overarching concern of magical practices was the grievous harm it could do to others. Magic represented a huge threat to an age that widely professed belief in religion and holy powers.\n\nLegislation against magic could be one of two types, either by secular authorities or by the Church. The penalties assigned by secular law typically included execution, but were more severe based on the impact of the magic, as people were less concerned with the means of magic, and more concerned with its effects on others. The penalties by the Church often required penance for the sin of magic, or in harsher cases could excommunicate the accused under the circumstances that the work of magic was a direct offense against God. The distinction between these punishments, secular versus the Church, were not absolute as many of the laws enacted by both parties were derived from the other \n\nThe persecution of magic can be seen in law codes dating back to the 6th century, where the Germanic code of Visigoths condemned sorcerers who cursed the crops and animals of peasant’s enemies. In terms of secular legislation, Charles the Great (Charlemagne) was arguably the strongest opposing force to magic. He declared that all who practiced sorcery or divination would become slaves to the Church, and all those who sacrificed to the Devil or Germanic gods would be executed.\n\nCharlemagne’s objection to magic carried over into later years, as many rulers built on his early prohibitions. King Roger II of Sicily punished the use of poisons by death, whether natural or magical. Additionally, he proclaimed that ‘love magic’ be punished regardless of if anyone was hurt or not. However, secular rulers were still more concerned with the actual damage of the magic rather than the means of its infliction.\n\nInstructions issued in 800 at a synod in Freising provide general outlines for ecclesiastical hearings. The document states that those accused of some type of sorcery were to be examined by the archpriest of the diocese in hopes of prompting a confession. Torture was used if necessary, and the accused were often sentenced to prison until they resolved to do penance for their sins.\n\nImportant political figures were the most frequently known characters in trials against magic, whether defendants, accusers, or victims. This was because high-society trials were more likely to be recorded as opposed to trials involving ordinary townspeople or villagers. For example, Gregory of Tours recorded the accusations of magic at the royal court of 6th century Gaul. According to History of the Franks, two people were executed for supposedly bewitching emperor Arnulf and prompting the stroke that lead to his death.\n\nThe concept of magic was further developed in the high and late Middle Ages. The rise of legal commentaries and consultations during this time lead to the inclusion of law in Universities’ curricula. This fueled a detailed reflection of the principles underlying prosecution for magic. The early fourteenth century brought about the pinnacle of trials involving magic. In this time, several individuals were charged with using magic against both Pope John XXII and the King of France. These trials only enhanced the already growing concern about magic, and thus perpetuated the increasing severity of punishments for such actions. \nThe increase in trials in the late Middle Ages was also in part due to the shift from accusatory to inquisitorial procedures. In accusatory procedures, the accuser had to provide ample evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. If the accuser failed to do so, or did not have any proof, he or she would have to face the punishment that would have been assigned to the accused had he/she been found guilty. The inquisitorial procedure allowed judges to undertake prosecution on their own initiative without consequences. This made it easier for the accuser to secure conviction for sorcery, and not have to worry about having insufficient evidence thus putting their own innocence in jeopardy. Inquisitorial interrogation took many forms, including experiments with reflecting surfaces, invocation of demons, use of human heads to obtain love or hatred, and more.\n\nAnother possible reason for the rise in frequency of trials regarding magic in the later fourteenth century was due to a change from parchment to a cheaper medium of paper. This made it cheaper for more information to be recorded and preserved, therefore we have a greater volume of documented information from this era. While this may have caused a slight increase in trials against magic, the main reason was in fact the new inquisitorial procedure of trial and prosecution as mentioned above.\n\nThe fourteenth century already brought about an increase of sorcery trials, however the second and third quarters of the fifteenth century were known for the most dramatic uprising of trials involving witchcraft. The trials developed into catch-all prosecution, in which townspeople were encouraged to seek out as many suspects as possible. The goal was no longer to secure justice against a single offender but rather to purge the community of all transgressors. The term “witchcraft” has multiple connotations, all involving some type of sorcery or magic. However, by the late Middle Ages this term developed into someone who went beyond mere sorcery and acted in league with other witches on behalf of the Devil. Friars preached that not only are the witches who work for the devil guilty, but also all those who fail to report these culprits. This led to an outbreak of accusations, in fear of being accused themselves. Trials inspired more trials, and this increase in trials inspired the rise in the frequency of literature on witches. The famed culmination of this literary tradition was the Malleus maleficarum written in 1486 by Jacob Sprenger and Henry Kramer. This classic case of misogynist witchcraft treatise and its impact on magic in the Middle Ages will be explored later in this article. The growing popularity of literature regarding witchcraft and magic lead to an even greater upsurge in trials and prosecutions of witches.\n\nThe stereotype of the witch finally solidified in the late Middle Ages. Numerous texts singled out women to be especially inclined to witchcraft. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, women defendants outnumbered men two to one. This difference only became more pronounced in the following centuries. The disparity between women and men defendants was primarily due to the position women held in late medieval society. Women in this era were far less trusted than men, as they were presumably weak minded and easily dissuaded. General misogynist stereotypes further encouraged their prosecution, which lead to a more stiffened stereotype of witches. Massive witch trials swept across Europe in the second half of the fifteenth century. In 1428, more than 100 people were burned for killing others, destroying crops, and working harm by means of magic. This trial in the Valais provided the first evidence for the fully developed stereotype of a witch, including flight through the air, transforming humans into animals, eating babies and the veneration of the Devil. The unrestricted use of torture in combination with the adoption of inquisitorial procedures as well as the development of the witch stereotype and a dramatic rise in public suspicion ultimately caused the swelling fervor and frequency of these sweeping witch hunts.\n\nPractices such as alchemy, medicinal magic, charms, and sorcery have been dated back centuries before they were considered evil. The Catholic Church condemned such practices in about 900 AD (3), but it was not until Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487 that individuals who practiced things considered as “witchcraft” were punished severely. Malleus Maleficarum was published by a Catholic clergyman in Germany. It was written in Latin and the title roughly translates to “Hammer of the Witches”. Before the publication of Malleus Maleficarum, an individual was barely punished if accused of practicing any form of magic. Post-publication of this document changed the way that medieval society treated anyone who performed anything considered an act of magic or witchcraft. Malleus Maleficarum was used as a judicial book of guidelines within secular courts of Europe over three hundred years past its date of publication. Its main two purposes were to inform the audience about how to detect individuals who practice magic and how to prosecute said individuals. The document was divided into three parts, each of which dealt with something different within the process of persecution. The first section discusses what makes witchcraft real and how it is a very present threat to their current society. This section also makes the connection between witches and the Devil. In the second part, actual acts of magic are discussed. Chapters within this section are titled with various spells that the witches might perform, such as “How they are transported from Place to Place”, “How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation”, “Of the Manner whereby they Change Men into the Shapes of Beasts”, etc. They identify various magical practices with the idea of witchcraft, thus condemning many acts of magic that have been performed for centuries as crimes punishable by death. This section also discusses various remedies by which one can protect themselves against the actions of witches, many of these remedies being reminiscent of various magical acts. The third section discusses the actual prosecution of witches, and the procedure by which one must follow. It defines the use of prosecution, defense, witnesses, and punishments. It is essentially a guide on how to convict an individual of witchcraft.\n"}

Menippe and Metioche offered themselves; they thrice invoked the infernal gods, and killed themselves with their shuttles. Persephone and Hades metamorphosed them into comets.

{"id": "33815178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33815178", "title": "Metadata repository", "text": "Metadata repository\n\nA metadata repository is a database created to store metadata. Metadata is information about the structures that contain the actual data. Metadata is often said to be \"data about data\", but this is misleading. Data profiles are an example of actual \"data about data\". Metadata is one layer of abstraction removed from this – it is data about the structures that contain data. Metadata may describe the structure of any data, of any subject, stored in any format.\n\nA well-designed metadata repository typically contains data far beyond simple definitions of the various data structures. Typical repositories store dozens to hundreds of separate pieces of information about each data structure.\n\nComparing the metadata of a couple data items - one digital and one physical - will help one understand what metadata really is:\n\nFirst, digital: for data stored in a database one may have a table called \"Patient\" with many columns, each containing data which describes a different attribute of each patient. One of these columns may be named \"Patient_Last_Name\". What is some of the metadata about the column that contains the actual surnames of patients in the database? We have already used two items: the name of the column that contains the data (Patient_Last_Name) and the name of the table that contains the column (Patient). Other metadata might include the maximum length of last name that may be entered, whether or not last name is required (can we have a patient without Patient_Last_Name?), and whether the database converts any surnames entered in lower case to upper case. Metadata of a security nature may show the restrictions which limit who may view these names.\n\nSecond, physical: for data stored in a brick and mortar library, one have many volumes and may have various media, including books. Metadata about books would include ISBN, Binding_Type, Page_Count, Author, etc. Within Binding_Type, metadata would include possible bindings, material, etc.\n\nThis contextual information of business data include meaning and content, policies that govern, technical attributes, specifications that transform, and programs that manipulate.\n\nThe metadata repository is responsible for physically storing and cataloging metadata. Data in a metadata repository should be generic, integrated, current, and historical. Generic : meta model should store the metadata by generic terms instead of storing it by an applications-specific defined way, so that if your data base standard changes from one product to another the physical meta model of the metadata repository would not need to change. \nIntegration of the metadata repository allows all business areas' metadata to be in an integrated fashion: covering all domains and subject areas of the organization. \nThe metadata repository should have accessible current and historical metadata. Metadata repositories used to be referred to as a data dictionary.\n\nWith the transition of needs for the metadata usage for business intelligence has increased so is the scope of the metadata repository increased. Earlier data dictionaries are the closest place to interact technology with business. Data dictionaries are the universe of metadata repository in the initial stages but as the scope increased Business glossary and their tags to variety of status flags emerged in the business side while consumption of the technology metadata, their lineage and linkages made the repository, the source for valuable reports to bring business and technology together and helped data management decisions easier as well as assess the cost of the changes.\n\nMetadata repository explores the enterprise wide data governance, data quality and master data management (includes master data and reference data) and integrates this wealth of information with integrated metadata across the organization to provide decision support system for data structures, even though it only reflects the structures consumed from various systems.\n\nRepository has additional functionalities compared with registry. Metadata repository not only stores metadata like Metadata registry but also adds relationships with related metadata types. Metadata when related in a flow from its point of entry into organization up to the deliverables is considered as the lineage of that data point. Metadata when related across other related metadata types is called linkages. By providing the relationships to all the metadata points across the organization and maintaining its integrity with an architecture to handle the changes, metadata repository provides the basic material for understanding the complete data flow and their definitions and their impact. Also the important feature is to maintain the version control though this statement for contrasting is open for discussion. These definitions are still evolving, so the accuracy of the definitions needs refinement.\n\nPurpose of registry is to define the metadata element and maintained across the organization. and data models and other data management teams refers to the registry for any changes to follow. While Metadata repository sources metadata from various metadata systems in the organizations and reflects what is in the upstream. Repository never acts as an upstream while registry is used as an upstream for metadata changes.\n\nMetadata repository enables all the structure of the organizations data containers to one integrated place. This opens plethora of resourceful information for making calculated business decisions. This tool uses one generic form of data model to integrate all the models thus brings all the applications and programs of the organization into one format. And on top of it applying the business definitions and business processes brings the business and technology closer that will help organizations make reliable roadmaps with definite goals. With one stop information, business will have more control on the changes, and can do impact analysis of the tool. Usually business spends lots of time and money to make decisions based on discovery and research on impacts to make changes or to add new data structures or remove structures in data management of the organization. With a structured and well maintained repository, moving the product from ideation to delivery takes the least amount of time (considering other variables are constant). \nTo sum it up:\n\nEach database management system (DBMS) and database tools have their own language for the metadata components within. Database applications already have their own repositories or registries that are expected to provide all of the necessary functionality to access the data stored within. Vendors do not want other companies to be capable of easily migrating data away from their products and into competitors products, so they are proprietary with the way they handle metadata. CASE tools, DBMS dictionaries, ETL tools, data cleansing tools, OLAP tools, and data mining tools all handle and store metadata differently. Only a metadata repository can be designed to store the metadata components from all of these tools.\n\nMetadata repositories should store metadata in four classifications: ownership, descriptive characteristics, rules and policies, and physical characteristics. Ownership, showing the data owner and the application owner. The descriptive characteristics, define the names, types and lengths, and definitions describing business data or business processes. Rules and policies, will define security, data cleanliness, timelines for data, and relationships. Physical characteristics define the origin or source, and physical location. Like building a logical data model for creating a database, a logical meta model can help identify the metadata requirements for business data. The metadata repository will be centralized, decentralized, or distributed. A centralized design means that there is one database for the metadata repository that stores metadata for all applications business wide. A centralized metadata repository has the same advantages and disadvantages of a centralized database. Easier to manage because all the data is in one database, but the disadvantage is that bottlenecks may occur.\n\nA decentralized metadata repository stores metadata in multiple databases, either separated by location and or departments of the business. This makes management of the repository more involved than a centralized metadata repository, but the advantage is that the metadata can be broken down into individual departments.\n\nA distributed metadata repository uses a decentralized method, but unlike a decentralized metadata repository the metadata remains in its original application. An XML gateway is created that acts as a directory for accessing the metadata within each different application. The advantages and disadvantages for a distributed metadata repository mirror that of a distributed database.\n\nDesign of information model should include various layers of metadata types to be overlapped to create an integrated view of the data. Various metadata types should be stitched with related metadata elements in a top down model linking to business glossary.\n\nLayers of Metadata:\n\nMetadata repositories can be designed as either an Entity-relationship model, or an Object-oriented design.\n\n"}

He is the author of several books on cultural studies, disability rights, liberal and conservative politics, and debates in higher education. From 2010 to 2017, he was the Director of the Institute for the Arts and Humanities at Penn State; from 1997 to 2001 he was the founding director of the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities. He was the 2012 president of the Modern Language Association, and served as vice president from 2010–2011. He served two terms on the National Council of the American Association of University Professors from 2005 to 2011, and three terms on the AAUP's Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure from 2009 to 2018. He was a member of the International Advisory Board of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes for two terms, 2011-2017. Bérubé was named a University Scholar for research at the University of Illinois in 1995 and was awarded the Faculty Scholar medal for research from Penn State in 2012.\n\nThe son of Maurice Berube (now Eminent Scholar Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Educational Leadership at Old Dominion University), Bérubé was born and raised in New York City. He attended Regis High School. He received a B.A. in English from Columbia University in 1982 and a Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia, where he studied from 1983 to 1989. Bérubé held a professorship in the English department at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1989 to 2001, where he was affiliated with the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory and the Afro-American Studies and Research Program. In 2001, Bérubé moved to Penn State for the then-newly created Paterno Family Professorship in Literature, from which he resigned in the wake of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2016, Bérubé edited \"Cultural Front\", the New York University Press series which published his 2009 book \"The Left at War\" and his 1998 book \"The Employment of English,\" as well as fifteen other titles, many in disability studies. He now co-edits \"Crip: New Directions in Disability Studies\" for NYU Press along with Robert McRuer and Ellen Samuels. He maintained a personal blog from 2004 to 2010 and wrote for \"Crooked Timber\" from 2007 to 2012.\n\nBérubé drew attention in the early 1990s for his essays in the \"Village Voice\" and \"Village Voice Literary Supplement\" (VLS), which dealt with (among other things) political correctness, postmodernism, and cultural studies. In 1994 he published an essay in \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Life As We Know It: A Father, A Son, and Genetic Destiny\", about his son Jamie, who has Down syndrome, and in 1995 a review essay in \"The New Yorker\" on contemporary black intellectuals; these essays, particularly the latter, drew a wide array of energetic and often contentious responses. Some of the \"VLS\" essays were revised and republished in Bérubé’s second book, \"Public Access\" (1994). Since then, Bérubé has continued to write for newspapers and magazines, including \"Dissent\", \"the Nation\", the \"New York Times\"(and \"New York Times Magazine\"), the \"Boston Globe\", the \"Chicago Tribune\", and the \"Washington Post\". Since 1997 he has also been a contributor to the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\".\n\nBérubé's third book, \"Life As We Know It: A Father, A Family, and an Exceptional Child\", was published in 1996. Following a positive review by Beverly Lowry, \"Life As We Know It\" was named a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the Year; it was also named as one of the best books of the year by Maureen Corrigan of National Public Radio. It is an expanded account of Jamie's first four years, as well as a discussion of disability rights, abortion and prenatal testing, early intervention programs, early childhood language acquisition, school policy, and theories of justice.\n\nIn 2005-06, Bérubé emerged as a critic of David Horowitz's \"Academic Bill of Rights\"; an account of that campaign, together with a description of Bérubé's pedagogy in undergraduate classes, makes up most of Bérubé’s fifth book, \"What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts? Classroom Politics and \"Bias\" in Higher Education\" (2006). Bérubé also published a number of essays critical of figures on the antiwar left and their response to the terrorist attack of 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan, though he said he opposed the Iraq War; the argument was elaborated in his seventh book, \"The Left At War\", published in 2009. In 2016 Bérubé published two books in disability studies: \"The Secret Life of Stories\", a study of narrative strategies involving varieties of intellectual disability, and \"Life as Jamie Knows It\", a sequel to \"Life as We Know It\" written with substantial input from the now-adult Jamie Bérubé.\n\nBérubé lives in State College, Pennsylvania, with his wife Janet Lyon.

{"id": "17966035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17966035", "title": "New York Public Library for the Performing Arts", "text": "New York Public Library for the Performing Arts\n\nThe New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, at 40 Lincoln Center Plaza, is located in Manhattan, New York City, at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on the Upper West Side, between the Metropolitan Opera House and the Vivian Beaumont Theater. It houses one of the world's largest collections of materials relating to the performing arts. It is one of the four research centers of the New York Public Library's Research library system, and it is also one of the branch libraries.\n\nOriginally the collections that formed The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (hereafter LPA) were housed in two buildings. The Research collections on Dance, Music, and Theatre were located at the New York Public Library Main Branch, now named the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, and the circulating music collection was located in the 58th Street Library.\n\nA separate center to house performing arts was first proposed by Carleton Sprague Smith (chief of the Music Division) in a 1932 report to the library administration, \"A Worthy Music Center for New York.\" (At the time, dance materials and sound recordings were all part of the Music Division.) There were attempts to create partnerships with Rockefeller Center (under construction at the time), the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (to which New York University wanted to join as a partner). During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Music Division produced a program of concerts (based on the model of the Library of Congress concerts in Coolidge Auditorium). These concerts were often held in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Juilliard School, and the program grew to include Lectures from New York University staff.\n\nAfter Lincoln Center was incorporated in 1956, an early mention of a possible \"library and museum of the performing arts\" appeared in June 1957. It was envisioned that a library-museum would serve to \"interpret and illuminate the entire range of the performing arts.\" By December of that year, the library had become an accepted component of Lincoln Center planning and fundraising. Recalling his earlier reports, Smith produced a new report arguing for a move to Lincoln Center. Library administration officially approved of the move in June 1959.\n\nThe building housing the library's research collections and the Vivian Beaumont Theater was the third building to be opened at Lincoln Center. Original plans conceived the library as a separate building, but prohibitive costs necessitated a combination of the Library and the Theater. As built, the Theater forms the central core of the building, the 1st and 2nd floors occupying the southern and western sides, and the 3rd floor research collections providing a roof. Noted modernist architect Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) designed the interiors, and SOM consulted with Eero Saarinen and Associates (architect for the Vivian Beaumont Theater) on the exteriors. The Claire Tow Theater (belonging to Lincoln Center Theater) was built on the roof of the Library and opened in June 2012.\n\nThe third floor, housing the research collections, opened to the public on July 19. The entire library was opened to the public on November 30, 1965, the 4th building to open at Lincoln Center. At its opening, it was called \"Library and Museum of the Performing Arts.\" The Library's museum component was named the Shelby Collum Davis Museum in honor of an investment banker who contributed $1 million to Lincoln Center for museum purposes.\n\nAt its opening, the Library's main lobby at the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance housed a bookstore, a film viewing area, and a listening area. The second floor included a children's performing arts collection as well as the Hecksher Oval, an enclosed space that could accommodate story-telling. Prior to the 2001 renovation, the children's collection was relocated to the Riverside Branch. The Hecksher Oval was removed as part of the renovation.\n\nThe Shelby Collum Davis Museum spaces included small and separate areas in the Dance, Music, Sound archive and Theater research divisions. Bigger galleries were the Vincent Astor Gallery on the 2nd floor, and galleries on the lower level and 2nd floor.\n\nFrom 1998 through 2001, the building was closed due to a $38 million renovation project designed by Polshek Partnership. (The renovation was unrelated to the Lincoln Center renovations which commenced shortly after 2001.) During this time, the research collections were serviced from the NYPL's Annex (at 10th avenue and 43rd street), and the circulating collections were housed at the Mid-Manhattan Library at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue. LPA reopened to the public on October 29, 2001 with its building newly named Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center after a gift from the Cullmans (Dorothy was a trustee until she died; Lewis is still a trustee).\n\nDuring the renovation, the library was wired to enable installation of numerous computers on each floor. There are nearly 200 publicly accessible computers in the building. Most are restricted to use of the library catalog and electronic databases or viewing the library's audiovisual material, but a few provide full Internet access. The renovation also created a Technology Training Room, with twelve desktop computers for users and one for a teacher, as well as a projection screen. \n\nUpon the building's original opening in 1965, each research division had a separate reading room. The renovation removed these and consolidated public areas into a single unified public reading area, with separate rooms for the Theater on Film and Tape Archive (its screening room named for Lucille Lortel) and Special Collections (its room named for Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic). Subsequently the Special Collections reading room was moved into a portion of the main reading area of the 3rd floor, while a screening room for the Reserve Film and Video Collection (originally part of the Donnell Media Center, but absorbed into the Collection in 2008) took its place. Meanwhile, gallery space for the museum was consolidated into two main gallery spaces with smaller areas for display of other items. The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery is located on the first floor, adjacent to the Lincoln Plaza entrance, while the Vincent Astor Gallery (formerly on the second floor) is now located on the lower level, adjacent to the Amsterdam Avenue entrance. A small area near the Lincoln Center Plaza entrance houses caricaturist Al Hirschfield's desk and chair. The main corridor on the first floor is used for displaying photographs, posters, and other two-dimensional items. The third floor has numerous display cases highlighting rotating displays of thematic groupings of artifacts from the collections. \n\nThe renovation was not without detractors. Critic Joseph Horowitz criticized the third floor in particular. Where previously each division had its own reading room, the renovation united all public reading areas into one room, resulting in less intimacy and more noise. Edmund Morris characterized the Special Collections reading room as \"a charmless space...<nowiki>[which]</nowiki> exudes a dispirited air of neglect.\"\n\nFrom its inception, LPA has had both a research component (funded mostly with private money) and a branch library component (funded with significant money from New York City, the remainder coming from private contributions).\n\nIn addition to published works (for example, books, periodicals, and scores), the research divisions collect an enormous amount of unique material: Archival material (material that was created by or that once belonged to an individual or organization), text manuscripts, music manuscripts, typescripts, prompt books, posters, original set and costume designs, programs, and other ephemera are just some of the major categories of materials. The library's collection of sound recordings is in all formats that in themselves trace the history and development of sound recording.\n\nThe library has 500,000 folders containing clippings on a variety of people and subjects pertaining to the performing arts. These clippings can sometimes provide a beginning to those at the initial stage of their research. The library also collects a variety of iconography in various forms: photographs, lithographs, engravings, drawings, and others. A recent internal report estimated that LPA holds approximately 4.5 million photographs, including the recently acquired collection of New York photographer Martha Swope, itself holding 1 million photographs.\n\nMuch of this non-book material was not initially in the online catalog. Some materials are accessible through in-house card files and indexes. Policy since changed to bring as much of the material as possible into the main catalog, and by 2013, most of it was accessible in the catalog. Because of the enormous volume of material, some classes of it, such as the clipping files, has never been inventoried, although it is arranged in a retrievable manner with an alphabetical or chronological arrangement. Unlike most U.S. public libraries, the research collections stacks are located in non-public areas and are not available for browsing. Patrons must determine what they want to view, fill out call slips, and submit the slips to library staff. Library staff then retrieves the material for the patron.\n\nThe holdings of LPA are divided by subject into divisions, which contain a number of special centers.\n\nThe Music Division, as a founding division of The New York Public Library, is the oldest of all the divisions at LPA. Its origins stem from the private library of banker Joseph William Drexel. Upon his death in 1888, his valuable library of 5,542 volumes and 766 pamphlets, known as the Drexel Collection, became part of the Lenox Library. The Astor Library also had an endowment that helped with the purchase of music. In 1895, upon the Lenox Library's consolidation with the Astor Library, the Music Division became one of the first subject divisions of The New York Public Library.\n\nAccording to \"The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz\", the library has particular strong manuscript holdings in jazz, These include 400 of Benny Goodman's arrangements, and the arrangements made by Sy Oliver for musicians including Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, and Tommy Dorsey. It holds working scores of works by Ellington, and by Charles Mingus as well as extensive microlim copies of Mingus' manuscripts.\n\nClassical music manuscript holding include manuscripts by Bach, Johannes Brahms, Franz Liszt, Glinka, Handel, Haydn, Korngold Mozart, Paganini, Schubert and Schumann ;\n\nThe Library has been collecting theatrical materials for years prior to 1931, when the executors of David Belasco's estate offered the producer's holdings on the condition that a division be created. The Theatre Collection (as it was initially known) began on September 1, 1931. The division opened at Lincoln Center as the Theatre Collection. In 1979, it was renamed the Billy Rose Theatre Division, honoring a financial gift from the lyricist/producer's foundation. It is now the largest research division at the library, with holdings primarily on the theatre, and increasing on film, with some collections on the related subjects of vaudeville, magic, puppetry, and the circus. The Theater of Film and Tape Archive is administratively within the division.\n\nThe Theatre division includes the Theatre on Film and Tape Archive (TOFT) which produces video recordings of New York and regional theater productions, and provides research access at its Lucille Lortel screening room. The collection is considered one of the most comprehensive collections of videotaped theater productions in the world. Archives modeled on TOFT include the Museum of Performance & Design in San Francisco, the Washington Area Performing Arts Video Archive established in Washington, D.C., and the National Video Archive of Performance in London. The core of the collection consists of live recordings of Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, with some additional productions from professional regional theaters. The Archive also records interviews and dialogues with notable theater professionals. In addition to live performances, commercial recordings of theater-related films, documentaries, and television programs are also included in the collection. Currently between 50 - 60 live recordings are produced each year, covering most important productions. As of fall of 2016, the collection included 7,901 titles.\n\nThe Jerome Robbins Dance Division began in 1944 under the auspices of Genevieve Oswald. Originally dance materials were part of the Music Division (when it was known as the \"Dance Collection\"), but its growth necessitated hiring a full-time staff member in 1947. Acquisitions were augmented by gifts of papers of Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, and Hanya Holm. With the gift of a collection of Walter Toscanini in honor of his deceased wife, Cia Fornaroli (a dancer), the Dance Collection became an internationally known repository. Due to its subsequent growth and increasing importance, the collection was formally recognized as a separate division on January 1, 1964.\n\nOne of the division's most significant resources is the Jerome Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image. Endowed with a gift from Jerome Robbins, this archive collects and preserves moving images of dance, making them available to researchers. The Archive has received many gifts from dancers and choreographers and contains many privately made films and video.\n\nThe Division's oral history program began formally in 1965. These oral histories are particularly valuable since they provide information, history and context not generally available in published sources.\n\nThough not technically a part of the Research divisions, the Reserve Film and Video Collection (formerly the Donnell Media Center) is serviced from the third floor. For film and video that must be viewed onsite, there is a screening room (large enough for classes) equipped with a 16 mm projector. There are also moviolas and Steenbeck equipment, permitting close frame-by-frame examination and analysis.\n\nThe origins of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound can be traced to a gift of 500 78 rpm records by Columbia Records in 1937 to the Music Division. Successive gifts by record companies and individuals led to the formal creation of a separate division with the opening of the building at Lincoln Center in 1965. It was named in honor of a generous gift from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization. Radio station WQXR donated 11,000 78 rpm recordings in 1966. Carleton Sprague Smith envisioned the purpose of the sound archive as \"stimulating interest among recording and broadcasting executives, as well as other arts institutions that had potential for playing a cooperative role.\" Resources include the Rigler-Deutsch Index, which lists of library's extensive holdings of 78 rpm records.\n\nThe beginnings of the circulating music collection are due in great part to its first head librarian, Dorothy Lawton. Lawton took part in the establishment of the music collection at the 58th Street Library in 1920, beginning with a collection of 1,000 books and scores. In 1924 the circulating music collection was officially established as part of the 58th Street Library. Her passion for dance enabled her to get unusual publications, so much that dance critic John Martin complimented her on the growing collection of dance books.\n\nIn 1929, the 58th Street Library began a collection of recordings beginning with gifts from Victor and Columbia records, amounting to 500 records. Upon building a listening booth, Lawton reported that by 1933, the listening booth was constantly booked two weeks in advance.\n\nDuring World War II, she established a concert series for servicemen on Sundays from 3–7 PM. Servicemen could request selections of their choice and could also participate in playing chamber music with instruments that had been loaned to the Library. She established the Orchestra Collection, a set of scores and parts that could be loaned to groups for performance. Currently, the Orchestra Collection loans parts to over 2,000 works.\n\nUpon Lawton's retirement in 1945, chief music critic of the New York Times Olin Downes complimented her on the development of the 58th Street Library, and remarked on her achievements such as attracting donors and enlisting the concern and help of professional musicians. (Many of the rare items that were gifts to the 58th Street Branch were subsequently moved to the Music Division.)\n\nAfter retiring, Lawton returned to the country of her birth, England, and help organize a newly created music collection at Central Music Library of the Buckingham Palace Road Library (today the Westminster Music Library), modeling the new library on the one she established at 58th Street.\n\nCurrently, the Circulating collections loan books on music, dance, theater, film, and arts administration. They also loan scores, scripts, CDs, videotapes, DVDs, and sets of orchestral parts.\n\nThe museum component of LPA takes the form of exhibitions in its two main exhibition spaces, The Donald and Mary Oenslager Gallery and the Vincent Astor Gallery, as well as a walled area in the plaza entrance, and additionally display cases distributed throughout the building. Among the purposes of the exhibitions is to show to all visitors that the millions of items belonging to the library are not for the exclusive use of scholars but for anyone who walks in the door. Exhibitions highlights items from the library's collections and keep the name of the library before the public, attracting new and potential donations.\n\nSince the late 1990s, NYPL's exhibitions program has added online exhibitions. Online exhibitions serve as an extension of physical exhibitions, adding more material or allowing a greater depth of exploration.\n\nPublic programs are free of charge and take place in the 202-seat Bruno Walter Auditorium located on the lower level. The auditorium is used several times a week for musical performances, film screenings and lectures.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "16966680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16966680", "title": "Occupational segregation", "text": "Occupational segregation\n\nOccupational segregation is the distribution of workers across and within occupations, based upon demographic characteristics, most often gender. Occupational segregation levels differ on a basis of perfect segregation and integration. Perfect segregation occurs where any given occupation employs only one group. Perfect integration, on the other hand, occurs where each group holds the same proportion of positions in an occupation as it holds in the labor force.\n\nMany scholars, such as Biblarz et al., argue that occupational segregation is most likely caused by gender-based discrimination that often occurs in patterns, either horizontally (across occupations) or vertically (within the hierarchy of occupations). Both of these contribute to the gender pay gap.\n\nHorizontal segregation refers to differences in the number of people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.\n\nThe term \"vertical segregation\" describes men's domination of the highest status jobs in both traditionally male and traditionally female occupations. Colloquially, the existence of vertical segregation is referred to as allowing men to ride in a \"glass escalator\" through which women must watch as men surpass them on the way to the top positions. Generally, the more occupational segregation present in a country, the less vertical segregation there is because women have a better chance of obtaining the highest positions in a given occupation as their share of employment in that particular occupation increases.\n\nVertical segregation can be somewhat difficult to measure across occupations because it refers to hierarchies within individual occupations. For example, the category of Education Professionals, (a category in the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations, Second Edition), is broken down into \"School Teachers,\" \"University and Vocational Education Teachers,\" and \"Miscellaneous Education Professionals.\" These categories are then further broken down into subcategories. While these categories aptly describe the divisions within education, they are not comparable to the hierarchical categories within other occupations, and thus make comparisons of levels of vertical segregation quite difficult.\n\nSome women self-select out of higher status positions, choosing instead to have more time to spend at home and with their families. According to Sarah Damaske, this choice is often made because high status positions do not allow time for the heavy domestic workload that many women expect to take on due to the gendered division of labor in the home. Working class women, in particular, also sometimes self-select out of more time-intensive or higher -status positions in order to maintain the traditional gender hierarchy and household accord.\n\nHuman capital explanations are those that argue that an individual's and a group's occupational and economic success can be at least partially attributed to accumulated abilities developed through formal and informal education and experiences. Human capital explanations for occupational segregation, then, posit that a difference in educational levels of men and women is responsible for persistent occupational segregation. Contrary to this theory, however, over past 40 years, women's educational attainment has outpaced men's. One area of education that might play a substantial role in occupational segregation, however, is the dearth of women in science and mathematics. STEM fields tend to be pipelines to higher paying jobs. Therefore, the lack of women in higher paying jobs might be partially because they do not pursue science and mathematics in school. This can be seen in areas such as finance, which is very mathematics heavy and is also a very popular field for those who eventually rise to high status positions in the private sector. This choice, like others, is often a personal preference or made because of the cultural idea that women are not as good as men at mathematics.\n\nHuman capital explanations also posit that men tend to rise to higher positions than women because of a disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates are more likely than males to interrupt their careers to raise children. Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.\n\nHuman capital explanations posit additionally that men are more likely than women to preference their work life over their family life. However, the General Social Survey found that men were only slightly less likely than women to value short hours, and that preferences for particular job characteristics depended mostly on age, education, race, and other characteristics rather than on gender. In addition, other research has shown that men and women likely hold endogenous job preferences, meaning that their preferences are due to the jobs they hold and those they have held in the past rather than related inherently to gender. After taking into consideration men and women's jobs, there is no difference in their job preferences. Men and women engaged in similar types of work have similar levels of commitment to work and display other similar preferences.\n\nAccording to sociologists Hanson and Pratt, men and women employ different strategies in their job searches that play a role in occupational segregation. These differing strategies are influenced by power relations in the household, the gendered nature of social life, and women's domestic responsibilities. The last factor, in particular, leads women to prioritize the geographical proximity of paid employment when searching for a job. In addition, most people have been found to find their jobs through informal contacts. The gendered nature of social life leads women to have networks with smaller geographical reach than men. Thus, the location of women in female-dominated occupations which are lower-status and lower pay is the result of \"severe day-to-day time constraints\" rather than a conscious and long-term choice made that would be able to maximize pay and prestige.\n\nWomen in female-dominated jobs pay two penalties: the average wage of their jobs is lower than that in comparable male-dominated jobs, and they earn less relative to men in the same jobs. In addition, women's wages are negatively affected by the percentage of females in a job, but men's wages are essentially unaffected.\nThe crowding hypothesis postulates that occupational segregation lowers all women's earnings as a result of women's exclusion from primarily male occupations and segregation into a number of predominantly female-dominated occupations. Given that feminine skills are traditionally rewarded less both in salary and prestige, the crowding of women into certain occupations makes these occupations valued less in both pay and prestige.\n\nCrowding is found to be alleviated through macro-changes in occupational segregation. Teaching, for example, at least in recent generations, is traditionally a female- dominated profession. However, when positions open up for women in business and other high-earning occupations, school boards must raise the salaries of potential teachers to attract candidates. This is an example of how even women in traditionally female-dominated professions still benefit salary-wise from the gendered integration of the market.\n\nThe gendered division of labor helps to explain the hierarchy of power across gender identity, class, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Socialist feminists contribute to this ideology through a Marxist frame of alienated labor and the means of production. Heidi Hartmann emphasized the gendered division of labor as patriarchal control over women's labor. Wally Saccombe suggested the mode of production should become a unity of production and reproduction, in which women's reproductive abilities are viewed as a valuable source of labor or income.The \"wages for housework\" movement in the late 1970s showcased the importance of gender inequality in the workplace. Socialist feminists critiqued the exploitation of women's household and reproductive labor, since it was not viewed as a commodity that deserved payment in the market economy. Women often experience working a \"double day\" or \"second shift\" when they go to a wage-earning job and then come home to take care of children and the home.\n\nOccupational segregation is measured using Duncan's D (or the index of dissimilarity), which serves as a measure of dissimilarity between two distributions. D has to be calculated first:\n\n\nOver the last century in the United States, there has been a surprising stability of segregation-index scores, which measure the level of occupational segregation of the labor market. There were declines in occupational segregation in the 1970s and 1980s, as technologies that made the care work of the home quicker and easier allowed more women time to enter the workforce. However, occupational segregation remains a fixed element of the United States workforce today.\nAs recently as 1996, it has been found that gender occupational segregation over the past three generations has not decreased. In one study, grown women working in the 1980s were likely to have faced the same occupational segregation faced by their mothers working in the 1960s and their grandmothers working in the 1940s.\n\nGender egalitarian cultural principles, or changes in traditional gender norms, are one possible solution to occupational segregation in that they reduce discrimination, affect women's self-evaluations, and support structural changes. Horizontal segregation, however, is more resistant to change from simply modern egalitarian pressures. Changes in norms may reinforce the impact of occupational integration in that once people see women in traditionally male-dominated occupations, their expectations about women in the labor market might be changed.\n\nSome scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, therefore argue that any policies aimed at reducing occupational inequality must focus on culture changes. According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim to provide benefits across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might be most effective.\n\nIn addition, the more occupational integration that occurs, the more women are in the positions to make powerful decisions affecting occupational segregation. If the overall market becomes less segregated, those who make personnel decisions in traditionally female-dominated occupations will have to make jobs, even higher status jobs, more attractive to women to retain them. School boards, for example, will have to appoint more women to department head positions and other positions of authority in order to retain women workers, whereas those jobs might previously have gone to men.\n\nIn addition to gender, sexual orientation can also be a significant basis for occupational segregation: there is a disproportionately high number of gay and lesbian workers in certain occupations. Research shows that gay men are more likely to be in female-majority occupations than are heterosexual men, and lesbians are more represented in male-majority occupations than are heterosexual women, but even after accounting for this tendency, common to both gay men and lesbians is a propensity to concentrate in occupations that provide task independence or require social perceptiveness, or both. \n\n"}

He is currently employed by the professional wrestling promotion WWE as a creative consultant. The inaugural WWE Intercontinental Champion and creator of the Royal Rumble match, Patterson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 1996. He has been described by journalist Dave Meltzer as \"Vince McMahon's right-hand man\" and \"one of the chief architects of the WWE, playing an integral role in helping it become a global phenomenon.\"\n\nPatterson was born into an impoverished French-speaking family in the Ville-Marie arrondissement of Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1941. He began training to wrestle at the age of 14 at Loisirs Saint Jean Baptiste.\n\nPatterson is a Roman Catholic, and was an altar boy. He expressed an interest to a priest in becoming one himself, but was advised it would not have worked, because he was \"too adventurous\".\n\nPatterson debuted in Montreal, Quebec in 1958, wrestling at the Palais des Sports for promoter Sylvio Samson. Early in his career, he performed as \"Killer\" Pat Patterson.\n\nIn 1962, Patterson - despite speaking no English - emigrated to the United States to pursue his professional wrestling career. \nHe eventually became a U.S. citizen.\n\nPatterson initially worked for Tony Santos's Big Time Wrestling promotion in Boston, Massachusetts. While living and working in Boston, Patterson met his long-term partner, Louie Dondero.\n\nIn 1962, Patterson was recruited by Mad Dog Vachon for Don Owen's Portland, Oregon-based Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion. At the encouragement of PNW promoter Harry Elliot, who was aware of Patterson's homosexuality, Patterson developed the character of \"Pretty Boy\" Pat Patterson, an effeminate wrestler who wore lipstick, sunglasses, and a beret and carried a cigarette holder.\n\nIn 1963, Patterson wrestled for promotions in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma as part of a talent exchange organized by Owen.\n\nPatterson returned to Pacific Northwest Wrestling in 1964. He held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on two occasions that year. On October 2, 1964, Patterson defeated Pepper Martin for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. He held the championship for six weeks before losing to Martin. Patterson won the championship again in 1965 and 1966.\n\nIn January 1965, Patterson was hired by Roy Shire for his San Francisco, California-based NWA San Francisco promotion. At Shire's request, Patterson dyed his hair blond to form a tag team with Ray Stevens, The Blond Bombers. The duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1965 and again in 1967. The Blonde Bombers were described by Bret Hart as \"considered by many to be the best tag team of the 1970s\".\n\nIn 1968, Patterson wrestled for NWA Western States Wrestling in Amarillo, Texas as Lord Patrick Patterson, winning the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship and NWA Brass Knuckles Championship. In the same year, he undertook a six-week tour of Japan, facing Antonio Inoki in a series of bouts.\n\nAfter Stevens turned face in the late 1960s, he had a feud with the heel Patterson, culminating in the 1970s Texas Death match, in which Stevens won the title from Patterson.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, Patterson wore a mask during his matches, and would cheat by placing a foreign object under the mask to add power to his head butts. In 1972, Patterson turned face again, after feuding with Lars Anderson, who was managed by Dr. Ken Ramey. Later that year, he teamed with Rocky Johnson and won the tag team championship. In 1975 and 1981, Patterson won the Cow Palace Battle Royal in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1977, Patterson wrestled for Eddie Graham's Tampa, Florida-based Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion. During his run, he won the NWA Florida Television Championship and the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, as well as briefly serving as booker.\n\nIn 1978, Patterson joined Verne Gagne's Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. He reformed The Blond Bombers with Ray Stevens, with the duo winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship later that year. Patterson performed intermittently for the AWA until 1983.\n\nIn 1979, Patterson toured Japan with New Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nPatterson made his professional return to Quebec in 1980, wrestling a number of bouts for the Montreal, Quebec-based Lutte Internationale promotion. He held the Canadian International Tag Team Championship on five occasions between 1980 and 1983.\n\nIn 1979, Patterson debuted in the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), working as a heel, under the tutelage of manager The Grand Wizard. As a villain, Patterson's primary feuds were with then WWF North American Champion Ted DiBiase and WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund. During a television taping on June 19 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Patterson defeated DiBiase for the WWF North American Championship by using a pair of brass knuckles to knock out DiBiase. Patterson was unsuccessful, however, in winning the WWF Heavyweight Championship from Backlund.\n\nIn September 1979, the WWE would introduce the WWE Intercontinental Championship, a secondary championship for its midcard wrestlers. Patterson was crowned the company's first Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion after an alleged tournament held in Rio de Janeiro. While Patterson's tournament \"victory\" is widely listed in wrestling title and match histories, the tournament itself never actually took place. Patterson's apocryphal title victory would later become something of an inside joke during Patterson's on-screen tenure as one of Vince McMahon's \"stooges\". The fictional tournament was also later profiled in-depth on WWE.com as an April Fool's joke. On November 8, Patterson dropped the North American title to Seiji Sakaguchi.\n\nIt was during Patterson's reign as champion that he turned face, after a botched attempt by the Grand Wizard to \"sell\" Patterson's contract to \"Captain\" Lou Albano for $100,000; Albano's protégés, the Wild Samoans, attacked Patterson after he cut a promo insulting Albano. Patterson held the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship until April 21, 1980 when he was defeated by Ken Patera in New York City, New York. The match ended in controversial fashion after Patterson placed his right leg on the ropes just before the three count was made.\n\nOn May 4, 1981, Patterson's feud with Sgt. Slaughter culminated in an Bootcamp match in Madison Square Garden. The match was voted Match of the Year by the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\".\n\nPatterson began doing color commentary in 1980 with Vince McMahon, calling \"WWF Championship Wrestling\" from 1980-84. While Patterson was a face commentator when partnered with Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon, he hosted a heel interview segment for French WWF broadcasts known as \"Le brunch de Pat\", where he would politely ask questions in English but furtively mock his face guests in French. Patterson was on commentary with Monsoon when Hulk Hogan defeated The Iron Sheik for the world heavyweight championship, as well as for when Sheik defeated Bob Backlund. Patterson was also calling the action when Jimmy Snuka jumped off the steel cage and splashed Don Muraco in Madison Square Garden in 1983.\n\nPatterson retired from wrestling in 1984. Although retired, Patterson continued to occasionally wrestle. On January 26, 1985 he wrestled Nikolai Volkoff in a losing effort in a house show in Cincinnati, OH. The following month he teamed with Andre the Giant at a pair of house shows in Canada and defeated Ken Patera and Big John Studd. A year later he made another appearance, this time in a battle royal in Montreal on February 24, 1987. He also appeared in a battle royal at a house show in Buffalo, NY on December 27. Patterson made a handful of additional appearances in Montreal in 1987, wrestling as a heel (while remaining a face or neutral backstage official in the United States and elsewhere in Canada). His most notable appearance was a win over the up-and-coming Brutus Beefcake on August 10 His final match would come three weeks later in Montreal as he fell in defeat to Beefcake.\n\nHe began working backstage as a road agent and right-hand man to WWF promoter Vince McMahon, and is credited with inventing and booking the Royal Rumble match. In the late 1990s, he also worked in the talent-relations department.\n\nAfter his retirement, Patterson also worked as a WWF referee. He was selected as the in-ring referee for the main event at the first ever WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden on March 31, 1985, a well as the main event of WrestleMania XI.\n\nIn 1992, Patterson was accused of sexual harassment by former ring announcer Murray Hodgson. He was briefly released from the company until the charges were dropped, when he was promptly rehired.\n\nIn 1997, Patterson, along with Gerald Brisco, became comedy heels as the on-screen stooges of Vince McMahon, assisting their boss in his rivalries with Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind and The Rock. Patterson and Brisco were among the founding members of The Corporation. In order to mock Hulk Hogan, they used \"Real American\" as their entrance music and parodied Hogan's flexing routine as they approached the ring. on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco competed in a 2 on 1 Street Fight against Stone Cold that ened in a no contest when Vince Mcmahon and Dude Love attacked Stone Cold.\n\nLater in 1999, the two became entangled with the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. On the December 16, 1999 episode of \"SmackDown\", Patterson and Brisco helped Test, who had been injured by D-Generation X. Triple H and Stephanie McMahon then forced Patterson and Brisco to compete for the WWF Tag Team Championship against The New Age Outlaws or be fired. Patterson and Brisco lost the match. In 2000, Patterson and Brisco joined Triple and Stephanie. On the May 8 episode of Raw, Patterson, Road Dogg and X-Pac lost a 3 on 1 handicap to Rikishi after Patterson hit Rikishi with a chair afterwards Patterson gave him a stinkface. On June 12, 2000, when the Faction unmasked Kane, Patterson photographed Kane's \"hideously scarred\" face, and threatened to \"expose him to the world\" if he did not comply. Kane was forced to wrestle The Rock (then his ally) in a No Holds Barred match. When Patterson's film did not develop properly, Kane turned on the Faction.\n\nOn June 19, 2000 Patterson helped Brisco win the perpetually contested WWF Hardcore Champion from Crash Holly but during the victory celebration turned on his ally, blinding him with champagne and then breaking a second bottle over Brisco's head, and pinning the (kayfabe) unconscious champion. Brisco pursued Patterson into the women's locker room, where Patterson was hiding in drag. Subsequently, Vince McMahon scheduled them to fight over Hardcore Championship in a Evening Gown match at King of the Ring 2000; in the course of the match, Crash Holly attacked both men and pinned Patterson to become Hardcore Champion.\nOn The June 21 episode of Raw, Patterson and Brisco's match with Shane and Vince Mcmahon ened in a no contest when The Mean Street Posse ran in and attacked them.\n\nThe Intercontinental Championship, unified with the World Heavyweight Championship on October 20, 2002, was resurrected on May 18, 2003 at Judgment Day in a battle royal. Patterson, as the first ever Intercontinental Champion, was at ringside to present the belt to the victor. Booker T eliminated Christian for the win, but the referee was unconscious. As Patterson attempted to give the championship belt to Booker T, Christian attacked him, stole the Intercontinental Championship belt and used it to knock out Booker T. The referee then recovered and awarded the match to Christian.\n\nIn October 2004, Patterson retired from World Wrestling Entertainment. Patterson returned to WWE in a limited capacity in May 2005. While he is now retired as a producer for WWE, he still acts as a creative consultant. At Breaking Point, Patterson made an appearance in his hometown of Montreal in an in-ring segment with Dolph Ziggler.\n\nPatterson was a regular cast member on the WWE Network original reality show \"Legends' House\".\n\nPatterson is openly gay. He first came out in the early 1970s, and although Jim Ross made several jokes about it on commentary, his sexuality was not acknowledged publicly or in WWE storylines until the season finale of \"WWE Legends' House\", which aired June 12, 2014.\n\nHis longtime partner was Louie Dondero. Patterson stated on \"WWE Legends' House\" that they were together for 40 years and that Dondero died of a heart attack in 1998.\n\nIn August 2006, Patterson underwent emergency heart surgery to remove a cyst from his coronary artery. In October, Patterson recovered from his operation and was released from the hospital.\n\nHe legally changed his name to Pat Patterson in 2008.\n\nPat Patterson has been accused of committing countless acts of sex abuse on young boys and former WWE wrestlers. \n\n\n\n"}

Since the accused had also been charged and convicted of housebreaking with intent to commit a crime to the prosecutor unknown, the question arose: Was there a splitting of charges?

There had, therefore, not been a splitting of charges.\n\nThe accused had been charged and convicted on two counts:\n\n\nThe evidence showed that he had broken into a room where there were a number of persons sleeping, and that, when they were aroused by his presence, the accused, apparently in an effort to escape, had broken in two the door, which had been locked.\n\nOn a review, the court held that the accused's conduct amounted to malicious injury to property, and that there had not been a splitting of charges, as the accused's breaking out was separate from the breaking-in in point of time and motive; they were separate and distinct incidents.\n\n\n"}

W. Pool (Dated 1913) in Hollywood Cemetery holds the remains of a vampire. Supposedly Pool was run out of England in the 1800s for being a vampire. Oral legends to this effect were circulating by the 1960s. They may be influenced by the architecture of the tomb, which has both Masonic and ancient Egyptian elements, and double Ws looking like fangs. Because this cemetery is adjacent to Virginia Commonwealth University, the story became popular among students, especially from the 1980s onward. It was first mentioned in print in the student newspaper Commonwealth Times in 1976.\n\nIn the past few years, the vampire story has been combined with the collapse of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad's Church Hill Tunnel under Church Hill, a neighborhood of eastern Richmond, Virginia, which buried several workers alive on October 2, 1925. This part of the story showed up online in 2001 and was first reported in print in 2007 in \"Haunted Richmond: The Shadows of Shockoe\".\n\nAccording to this newer story, the tunneling awakened an ancient evil that lived under Church Hill and brought the tunnel crashing down on the workers. Rescue teams found an unearthly blood-covered creature with jagged teeth and skin hanging from its muscular body crouching over one of the victims. The creature escaped from the cave-in and raced toward the James River. Pursued by a group of men, the creature took refuge in Hollywood Cemetery, where it disappeared in a mausoleum built into a hillside bearing the name W. W. Pool.\n\nAccording to Gregory Maitland, an urban legend and folklore researcher with the paranormal research groups Night Shift and the Virginia Ghosts & Haunting Research Society, the \"creature\" that escaped the tunnel collapse was actually the 28-year-old railroad fireman, Benjamin F. Mosby (1896-1925), who had been shoveling coal into the firebox of a steam locomotive of a work train with no shirt on when the cave-in occurred and the boiler ruptured. Mosby's upper body was horribly scalded and several of his teeth were broken before he made his way through the opening of the tunnel. Witnesses reported he was in shock and layers of his skin were hanging from his body. He died later at Grace Hospital and was buried at Hollywood Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Teodoro's father was Giacomo and his wife, the Neapolitan noblewoman Anna Maria Petagno, daughter of Andrea, from the princely family of Trebisaccia. Teodoro was the first of nine brothers and aged ten was sent to school with the Teatini at San Nicola da Tolentino. He only stayed there a year before moving to the San Cipriano college on Murano, which he left aged twenty-one in 1771. Even as a youth he became interested in collecting objects and artworks relating to Venice and its history.\n\nWhen they reached twenty-five all Venetian patricians were required to take up minor magistracies and Correr reluctantly followed suit. In 1775 he entered the High Council and the same year was elected 'savio' to the Orders. The following year he was made provider of the Pompe and in 1778 he was re-elected 'savio' and made provider of the Comun. In 1787 he was elected Podestà and captain of Treviso, but he immediately gained dispensation from taking up this office. In 1788 he became podestà procurator at Verona. He only half-heartedly held public office and finally eschewed it altogether by becoming an abbot in 1789. He even declined to serve in the Civic Guard on health grounds during the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 and instead paid a cash fine in monthly instalments.\n\nAfter his parents died, he was able to commit himself to collecting full-time, though he had already begun forming a collection of paintings, relics and documents relating to Venetian history whilst still a young man. His collecting peaked during the years immediately after the Republic's fall and the resulting decision by many patrician families to sell off their whole art collections. Despite his limited means, he used his connections to other patrician families to buy and exchange paintings, coins, archaeology. majolica, glassware, books, engravings, gems, enamels, medals, curiosities, weapons, antiquities, bronzes and manuscripts. He installed his growing collection in his family palazzo in the San Giovanni Decollato district of the Santa Croce sestiere.\nIn old age he wondered how to ensure his collection stayed together after his death, rather than being dispersed by his brother. He wrote his will on 1 January 1830, stipulating:\n\nThis marked the beginning of Venice's city museums and formed the foundation stone for the current museum network in the city. Correr's collection formed the nucleus for the present-day Museo Correr, which moved in 1879 to the neighbouring Fondaco dei Turchi (now the Museo di Storia Naturale) then to the former Palazzo Reale (or Procuratie Nuovissime) on Piazza San Marco in 1922, where it still remains.\n\n\n"}

They had lived together as husband and wife from 1985 until Mr Shandling’s death in 2001. Mr. Shandling had supported Mrs. Robinson. When. Mr Shandling died— Volks was his executor— he left Mrs. Robinson a small legacy, but Mrs. Robinson sued additionally for maintenance.\n\nRobinson's claim was rejected because she did not fall within the definition of a “spouse” in the Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990. On appeal to the High Court, the court held that the Act was unfairly discriminatory on the grounds of equality and dignity.\n\nOn appeal to the Constitutional Court, the court held that the purpose of the Act was to provide for the maintenance of the surviving spouse, and that the ultimate aim was to extend an invariable consequence of marriage (i.e., support) beyond the death of either of the parties. The court further held that the Act was incapable of an interpretation including permanent life partners in the definition of a “spouse,” as marriage is an important social institution, and the law is allowed to distinguish between married and unmarried persons and accord benefits to the married.\n\nThe court held, accordingly, that there was a differentiation in the Act, but that it did not amount to an infringement of the right to equality. This decision was based on the fact that, during a marriage, the parties have a reciprocal duty of support, but there is no such duty accorded to the unmarried. The aim of the legislation was not to encompass the unmarried. Accordingly, the court could not require the imposition of an obligation on a deceased person's estate where there is no such obligation on the deceased when he is alive.\n\n"}
