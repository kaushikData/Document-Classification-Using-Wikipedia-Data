{"id": "22992603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22992603", "title": "Adelaide Hasse", "text": "Adelaide Hasse\n\nAdelaide Rosalie Hasse (September 13, 1868 – July 28, 1953) is listed as one of the \"100 most important leaders we had in the 20th century\" in the December 1999 edition of \"American Libraries\". She is credited with having developed the Superintendent of Documents Classification system used by the Government Printing Office and Federal Depository Library Program.\n\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Hasse was the first-born of a surgeon of German ancestry, a fact of which she was very proud despite the negative impact it would have on her mid-career. While there is no record of her ever formally attending school, it is assumed that she would have been educated through the local public school system.\n\nEventually Hasse's family made its way to southern California where she not only earned the title of \"Champion Fast Lady Bicycle Rider of Los Angeles,\" but also obtained her first library job. From 1889 to 1895, Hasse worked under the resolute tutelage of Tessa Kelso, the Head Librarian at the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL). Hasse and Kelso became lifelong friends in their endeavors to collect, organize, and maintain libraries and their documents as well as making libraries, and the United States, in general, more equitable places for women to work and live.\n\nWhen Hasse was hired on at the LAPL as \"Addie Hasse,\" she dove into her work with a passion and eagerness that she managed to retain for the remainder of career. In her first six years of library work, she and Kelso developed the LAPL's collection from 6,000 items to 42,000 items. The two also worked to make the LAPL more user-friendly by offering free borrowing privileges, adding additional weekend hours, and allowing check-out of periodicals. Later, they developed a librarian training course that was offered through the library.\n\nWhen the library officially joined the Federal Depository Library Program in 1891, Hasse set to work on classifying its United States Department of Agriculture documents. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system was largely in use at this time, but it was not \"suitable\" for Hasse's needs. She needed a more specific system, and one not classified by author as government documents frequently do not have an author listed beyond the department. Classifying by department seemed to make the most sense; however, this proved equally problematic as many departments begin with the same word. Thus, Hasse devised an inverted, departmental system for classification, e.g., \"Agriculture, Dept. of\" rather than \"Dept. of Agriculture.\" As her system for government documents differed significantly from the rest of the library's collection, which was organized by DDC, Hasse marked them as a special collection.\n\nDuring her tenure at the LAPL, Hasse also organized the Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Pasadena, Riverside, and local normal school collections as well. She also began attending local and national conferences, publishing bibliographies with some regularity, was promoted to First Assistant, and began to go by \"Adelaide R.\" rather than simply, \"Addie.\" Early in her career, Hasse gained the attention of prominent librarians and made a rather notable name for herself in the field.\n\nWhile Hasse's work with Kelso significantly improved many areas of the LAPL and earned them high marks with outsiders, the duo increasingly found themselves in trouble with the local library board. The board, consisting of men, was unhappy with their frequent travel to conferences, living arrangements, and outspokenness on community issues. After enduring much harassment, pay decreases, threats to cut library funding, and general moral outrage from the board, Hasse and Kelso resigned from their positions in 1895.\n\nUpon her departure from the LAPL, Hasse went to work in the newly formed Government Printing Office library program under Francis Crandall. Her assigned task was to collect, organize, and classify government documents from its various departments, divisions, and bureaus. Hasse set to work immediately, uncovering documents from all over Washington, D.C., even going so far as to look in ceilings and behind walls. According to \"The New York Times\" article from 1897, Hasse's work \"unearth[ing] the heap from the sub-cellar of the Interior Department\" took \"ten men and four teams six weeks' time to remove the mass to her office\" from a room that had supposedly been sealed for almost two decades. Of this experience, Hasse reportedly exclaimed: \"I dare say never had a young collector been given such an opportunity to revel in a very orgy of collecting.\" In fact, in just a little over a year, Hasse had \"unearthed\" 252,602 volumes.\n\nOnce she had all of the documents, she had to come up with a way to classify them. Building on her work with the Department of Agriculture documents at LAPL, she devised a system of letters and numbers that denoted the department, division, document type, and volume or series (if needed). This system is now generally referred to Superintendent of Documents Classification, or SuDocs. While she was collecting and organizing, Hasse continued to regularly publish not only bibliographies of government publications, but also items of other interest such as \"Travel and Exploration\" that appeared in \"List of Books for Girls and Women and Their Clubs\".\n\nCrandall eventually hired several catalogers to assist in the GPO's work; Edith Clarke was one such employee. Right away, Clarke made it clear to Hasse that their relationship was one of associate, not of supervisor-employee. In both Hasse and Clarke's personal documents, there are vague references to regular squabbling over whether SuDocs or DDC was a better system; Clarke favored the latter, though, and later declared that SuDocs was \"indisputable for its special situation.\" Hasse grew tired of Crandall's lack of recognition for her work and resigned from the GPO in March 1897. Hasse's worries about Crandall were not unfounded as he later accused her of stealing GPO documents and often publicly took the bulk of the credit for the system over which Hasse had so lovingly labored. In the 1980s, Hasse finally received the GPO recognition she deserved when it named a room for her.\n\nOnce again, Hasse left an unpleasant situation only to land in the beginnings of an organization. Hasse had known John Shaw Billings, Director of the recently reorganized New York Public Library (NYPL), for several years and was thrilled to take a position in NYPL's newly created Astor Library. A reporter from \"The New York Times\" met Hasse on her second day of work and wrote an article entitled, \"Miss Hasse's Unique Task.\" In it, Hasse described her previous work at the GPO and her hopes for developing a public documents division in New York.\n\nWhen the NYPL consolidated its borough branches, it was said to have housed \"one of the world's greatest collections of government publications,\" with items dating back to the American colonies. Hasse's work developing and classifying this special collection garnered her praise from the top periodicals in the field, most especially from \"Library Journal\", for which she was a regular contributor. As the leader in document classification, she was selected to serve on the ALA Committee on Public Documents in 1897, and from 1904–1908, even served as its chair.\n\nBillings, like Kelso at the LAPL, was a warm, nurturing supervisor to Hasse, giving her free rein to work as she pleased. Due to this freedom, she was able to track down the first book ever published in New York (1693), \"Narrative of an Attempt Made by the French of Canada Upon the Mohaque's Country,\" which, coincidentally, also happened to be the first government publication as it was written at the request of the governor. As Hasse increasingly became a household name for librarians, it was only natural that librarians in the Federal Depository system would begin requesting her assistance in dealing with their own documents. She even assisted Oregon employment lawyers in compiling information and documentation to support their cases against the state, as in \"Muller v. Oregon\" and \"Bunting v. Oregon\". At a time when women were expected to be seen and not heard, once again, her actions won her more enemies than friends.\n\nIn 1911, Hasse was moved to the Documents Division of the NYPL where she was given the additional task of providing reference services, which greatly diminished the time she had available for working on NYPL's massive collection of government and municipal documents. The Documents Division was closely related to the Economics Division, which was led by Charles Williamson. It was at this point that Hasse's reputation as a misandrist and \"classic difficult woman, selfish, bad-tempered, and unreasonable\" began to unfold. As she was passed over for promotions with some regularity, her less experienced male supervisors sought to undermine her authority and expertise in government documents at every turn. In 1915, the Chief Reference Librarian, Harry Miller Lydenberg, under new NYPL Director Edwin Anderson, launched a campaign against her, claiming that her entries were \"erroneous or inconsistent.\" This campaign gathered steam and continued until her termination from the NYPL in 1919. The beginning of the end for Hasse was when Anderson and Lydenberg removed her from her special collection to the Cataloging Division because they claimed that she \"refused to 'coordinate' with the cataloging office on her work.\" After twenty years of cataloging government documents on her own, she was now little more than just another cataloging staff member. Anderson eventually fired Hasse \"via a two-sentence letter\" and denied her request for a meeting as to why she was fired as well as for a hearing. Patrons of the library were even told not to associate with her when she came in as a patron after her dismissal, and her supporters working in the library, as well as those she hired, were fired soon after.\n\nFrom 1917 forward, Hasse would struggle because of her German ancestry, support of the women's suffrage movement and equal pay and working conditions, desire to aggressively market library services, and lack of a husband. Anderson began keeping a file on Hasse, documenting every questionable move she made, even misconstruing legitimate inquiries to suit his needs. He reported her to the United States Secret Service in 1917 for \"suspicious activity,\" which was largely due in part to her seeking other employment with President Wilson's Inquiry group. The Inquiry was formed by President Woodrow Wilson to \"collect and organize information for the eventual peace conference\" that would occur at the conclusion of World War I. Hasse inquired about work with the group only to find that Lydenberg and Anderson were already heading it up in the basement of the NYPL. Anderson claimed that since she had been born to German parents (her parents were Americans of German heritage) and was at a conference in Germany when the war began, she could not possibly have any other motive for working with The Inquiry other than that as a German spy.\n\nThe NYPL special collections division had an extensive collection of Latin American documents. There was, however, a gap in the collection, and in 1918, Hasse asked Anderson for permission to travel to Mexico on a vacation to California to collect the missing documents. Anderson again reported Hasse to the Secret Service for suspicious activity because this was during a time of great unrest in Mexico. She was denied permission to go to Mexico, but while she was in California, her house was searched by the Secret Service no fewer than four times over the course of six weeks. Later in 1918, when the New York city police came to the library to inquire about possible suspicious activity by library employees, Lydenberg readily offered Hasse up to them, claiming she had ties to Jews, Marxism, Trotskyism, and Bolshevism because of a thank you note she had written to him regarding a \"Marx book\" a patron had requested. Also in 1918, Anderson and Lydenberg hired Edith Clarke, Hasse's colleague from the GPO, who eagerly \"came out against Hasse's work\" and agreed that she was difficult to work with. The Anderson file also contained accusations that Hasse was a lesbian and was involved in a relationship with Tilloah Squires, an assistant Hasse hired in 1918 to work on the Foreign Relations Index.\n\nAs late as 1922, three years after her departure from the NYPL, Anderson was still reporting her to the Justice Department and even worked with J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to open a file on her. The Anderson file is located in the NYPL Archives, which, in addition to the Library of Congress, the National Archives and Records Administration, and FBI, also has their own files on Hasse. As of 2006, the FBI still refuses to release five pages of their file on Hasse.\n\nFor the first time in her career, Hasse was out of a job and had no immediate prospects for one. From 1919 to 1923, she conducted research for the War Labor Policies Board, becoming an \"expert in the Council of National Defense\" and identified herself as a bibliographer rather than a librarian. She went on to found the School for Business Librarians within the Washington School for Secretaries and became editor of \"Special Libraries\". She also wrote an autobiography entitled \"Compensations of Librarianship,\" in which she finally had her say against Anderson, Crandall, Clarke, and Lydenberg.\n\nIn 1923, she was hired on as a bibliographer for the Brookings Institution through 1932, at which time she was again out of a job, this time for a year. She finally obtained employment as an instructor at George Washington University and as a research consultant for what would later become the Works Progress Administration (WPA), publishing bibliographies of Social Security information. From there she worked temporarily for the Temporary National Economic Committee (TNEC) and then as indexer for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and later still, as a bibliographer for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nHasse died on July 28, 1953, with a fifty-four year career in library and information science. In those fifty-four years, Hasse made a significant mark on the field as a library assistant, indexer, cataloguer, classifier, bibliographer, editorial analyst, and author. She was an advocate of \"efficient and effective\" library service, public access to government materials, and the women's movement. Hasse overcame great obstacles in her quest for providing quick, easy access to materials. \"American Libraries\" states that she was best \"known for her acerbic personality\"; however, Gail K. Nelson and John V. Richardson, Jr., state that, regardless of what one may say of her professional relationships and personal life, the basis of the Superintendent of Documents Classification system still in use today was \"essentially Hasse's.\" Because of her work in the GPO, the American public has a system for easily accessing a century's worth of government publications and documents.\n\n"}

An alert may be a calendar reminder or a notification of a new message.\n\nAlert messaging emerged from the study of personal information management (PIM), the science of discovering how people perform certain tasks to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use information relevant to them. Alert notification is a natural evolution of the concept of RSS which makes it possible for people to keep up with web sites in an automated manner. Alerting makes it possible for people to keep up with the information that matters most to them.\n\nAlerts are typically delivered through a notification system and the most common application of the service is machine-to-person communication. Very basic services provide notification services via email or SMS. More advanced systems (for example AOL) provides users with the choice of selecting a preferred delivery channel such as e-mail, Short Message Service (SMS), instant messaging (IM), via voice through voice portals, desktop alerts and more. Novel approaches provide users with the ability to schedule their own alerts (for example Google Calendar). The most sophisticated service providers embrace all capabilities, aggregating a multitude of reminder, notifications and alert, catering the delivery system to the specific context of the content being delivered thus enabling users to create sophisticated scenarios.\n\nThe notion of content being delivered to users has received negative connotation over the years and is sometimes labeled as spamming, particularly for information that hasn't been requested by the user. The advent of technologies such as RSS and now alert notification are an effort directed to creating an antithesis to spam: the information being received by users is exclusively from opt-in requests.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is continually working to improve their ability to put in place a notification system in case of emergency, in an attempt to help protect citizens. The first system was the Emergency Broadcast System, an emergency warning system in the United States, used from 1963 to 1997, when it was replaced by the Emergency Alert System. On April 9, 2008, the FCC approved an emergency alert text-messaging system so that cellular telephone users can get text message alerts in case of emergencies.\n\n\n"}

A directory service is software which stores and organizes information about a computer network's users and network resources and which allows network administrators to manage users' access to the resources.\n\nIn the context of macOS Server, \"Open Directory\" describes a shared LDAPv3 directory domain and a corresponding authentication model composed of Apple Password Server and Kerberos 5 tied together using a modular Directory Services system. Apple Open Directory is a fork of OpenLDAP.\n\nThe term \"Open Directory\" can also be used to describe the entire directory services framework used by macOS and macOS Server. In this context, it describes the role of a macOS or macOS Server system when it is connected to an existing directory domain, in which context it is sometimes referred to as \"Directory Services\".\n\nApple, Inc. also publishes an API called the \"OpenDirectory\" framework, permitting macOS applications to interrogate and edit the Open Directory data.\n\nWith the release of Mac OS X Leopard (10.5), Apple chose to move away from using the NetInfo directory service (originally found in NeXTSTEP and OpenStep), which had been used by default for all local accounts and groups in every release of Mac OS X from 10.0 to 10.4. Mac OS X 10.5 now uses Directory Services and its plugins for all directory information. Local accounts are now registered in the Local Plugin, which uses XML property list (plist) files stored in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/ as its backing storage.\n\nmacOS Server can host an \"Open Directory domain\" when configured as an \"Open Directory Master\". In addition to its local directory, this OpenLDAP-based LDAPv3 domain is designed to store centralized management data, user, group, and computer accounts, which other systems can access. The directory domain is paired with the \"Open Directory Password Server\" and, optionally, a Kerberos realm. Either provides an authentication model and stores password information outside of the directory domain itself.\n\nFor Kerberos authentication, the Kerberos realm can either be hosted by a Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) running on the server system, or the server can participate in an existing Kerberos realm.\n\nFor services that are not Kerberized, the Password Server provides the following Simple Authentication and Security Layer-based authentication methods:\n\n\nAny Mac OS X Server system prior to 10.7 (Lion) configured as an Active Directory Master can act as a Windows Primary Domain Controller (PDC), providing domain authentication services to Microsoft Windows clients.\n\nIn a more general sense, Open Directory can describe the plugins model used by Directory Utility and the directory services framework in macOS and macOS Server. This could be thought of as analogous to the Name Service Switch systems of some other Unix-like operating systems. When \"connected to a directory system\", a macOS client or Server can authenticate users, lookup contacts, perform service discovery and name resolution with the following types of directories:\n\n\nOpen Directory began with Mac OS X Server 10.2. In this initial form, Open Directory consisted of a network-visible NetInfo directory domain and a corresponding Authentication Manager service for storing passwords outside of the directory. Version 10.2 also included support for Kerberos. Mac OS X versions 10.1 and 10.0 stored user password information within the directory domain using crypt password authentication authorities, but version 10.2 paved the way for the current Shadow Hash and Password Server mechanisms.\n\nPassword Server is the successor to Authentication Manager, and was introduced in Open Directory 2 in Mac OS X Server 10.3. Open Directory 2 was also the first version to use LDAPv3 as the directory domain.\n\nMac OS X Server 10.4 includes Open Directory 3, which introduced Active Directory domain member support, trusted directory binding, and increased robustness.\n\nMac OS X Server 10.5 features Open Directory 4 with support for cross-domain authorization and a built-in RADIUS server for managing AirPort base stations. Open Directory 4 no longer includes elements of NetInfo.\n\n"}

The Belt was stretched from the Iraqi border in the east to Ras al-Ayn (Kurdish: \"Serê Kaniyê\") in the west. After another coup within the Baath party, Hafez al-Assad succeeded in becoming the head of Syria in 1970 and began to implement the plan in 1973. The project's name was officially changed to \"Plan for the establishment of state model farms in the Jazira region\".\n\n41 Arab villages were built in the course of time, and all the Kurdish village names of the area were replaced by Arabic names. About 4,000 Arab families from the provinces of Al-Raqqa and Aleppo, where they had previously lost their houses by the construction of the Tabqa dam, were accommodated in the new villages. These Arabs are named as Maghmurin (مغمورين Maġmūrīn, which is affected by flooding). In these measures, approximately 2 million hectares of Kurdish cultivated land were expropriated and awarded to the newly settled Arabs. According to the original plan, about 140,000 Kurds must also be deported to the southern near deserts at Al-Raad. Although the Kurdish peasants were expropriated, they refused to move away and give up their houses. Among these peasants, those who had been declared foreigners were not allowed to have property, to repair houses, or to build new houses.\n\nThe Kurdish regions affected by the \"Arab Belt\" are rich in oil deposits and fertile agricultural land. About 50 to 60 per cent of the Syrian petroleum caves are estimated to be located in the district of Al-Malikiyah.\n"}

{"id": "19476473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19476473", "title": "Chinese encyclopedia", "text": "Chinese encyclopedia\n\nChinese encyclopedias comprise both Chinese-language encyclopedias and foreign-language ones about China or Chinese topics. There is a type of native Chinese reference work called \"leishu\" (lit. \"categorized writings\") that is sometimes translated as \"encyclopedia\", but although these collections of quotations from classic texts are expansively \"encyclopedic\", a \"leishu\" is more accurately described as a \"compendium\" or \"anthology\". The long history of Chinese encyclopedias began with the (222 CE) \"Huanglan\" (\"Emperor's Mirror\") \"leishu\" and continues with online encyclopedias such as the \"Baike Encyclopedia\".\n\nThe Chinese language has several translation equivalents for the English word \"encyclopedia\".\n\n\"Diǎn\" 典 \"standard; ceremony; canon; allusion; dictionary; encyclopedia\" occurs in compounds such as \"zìdiǎn\" 字典 \"character dictionary; lexicon\", \"cídiǎn\" 辭典 \"word/phrase dictionary; encyclopedia\", \"dàdiǎn\" 大典 \"collection of great classics; big dictionary\"; and titles such as the 801 \"Tongdian\" (\"Comprehensive Encyclopedia\") and 1408 \"Yongle Dadian\" (\"Yongle Emperor's Encyclopedia\").\n\n\"Lèishū\" 類書 (lit. \"category book\") \"reference work arranged by category; encyclopedia\" is commonly translated as \"traditional Chinese encyclopedia\", but they differ from modern encyclopedias in that they are compendia composed of selected and categorically arranged quotations from Chinese classics, \"the name encyclopedia having been applied to them because they embrace the whole realm of knowledge\" (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 83).\n\n\"Bǎikē\" 百科 (lit. \"hundred subjects\") in the words \"bǎikēquánshū\" 百科全書 (with \"comprehensive book\") and \"bǎikēcídiǎn\" 百科辭典 (with \"dictionary\") specifically refer to Western-style \"encyclopedias\". Encyclopedia titles first used \"Bǎikēquánshū\" in the final decades of the 19th century.\n\nEncyclopedic \"leishu\" anthologies were published in China for nearly two millennia before the first modern encyclopedia, the English-language 1917 \"Encyclopaedia Sinica\".\n\nWhile English usually differentiates between \"dictionary\" and \"encyclopedia\", Chinese does not necessarily make the distinction. For instance, the ancient \"Erya\", which lists synonyms collated by semantic fields, is described as a dictionary, a thesaurus, and an encyclopedia. The German sinologist Wolfgang Bauer describes the historical parallel between Western encyclopedias and Chinese \"leishu\", all of which arose from two roots, glossaries and anthologies or florilegia.\nThe boundaries between both are quite fluid at first; the shorter the entries and the more exclusively they are directed to the definition of the word concerned, the more the work partakes of the character of a dictionary, while a longer commentary delving into history and culture and provided with extensive quotations of sources is, conversely, more characteristic of the encyclopaedia. The dividing line between a language lexicon (such as glossaries, onomastica and rhyming dictionaries) and a factual lexicon, to which all general and special encyclopaedias belong, is only clearly drawn when, in addition to the definitions, necessarily supported by literary references, an \"interpretation\" appears which takes into consideration not only the current literary usage but also the thing itself, which not only describes the subject but also, at times, evaluates and thereby forms a true connection between the new and the old. The very characteristic of the traditional Chinese encyclopaedia as in contrast to that in the West is that these distinctions were \"never\" clearly drawn. All Chinese encyclopaedias are anthologies, upon which were grafted greatly varying forms of dictionary arrangement. They consist of (generally quite long) quotations arranged in one order or another and, although they may include an opinion on the subject, they rarely contain an original opinion.\n\nRobert L. Fowler, Professor of Greek at the University of Bristol, says that although comprehensiveness is a primary criterion in defining an \"encyclopedia\", there are encyclopedias of individual subjects (e.g., \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\") that defy the etymology from Greek \"enkyklios paideia\" \"the circle of subjects\". He says, \"To call a comprehensive treatment of one subject an \"encyclopaedia\" is a catachresis known already in medieval China, where the term \"leishu\", properly a collection of classical texts on many fields, came to be applied to similar treatments of one subject only, for instance the use of jade\".\n\nChinese scholar-bureaucrats compiled about 600 leishu traditional Chinese \"encyclopedias\" between the 3rd and 18th centuries. About 200 of these are extant today, and 10-20 are still used by historians. Most were published by imperial mandate during the Tang dynasty (618-907), Song dynasty (960-1279), Ming dynasty (1368-1644), and early Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Some \"leishu\" were huge publications. For instance, the (1726) \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" contained an estimated 3 to 4 times the amount of material in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition\".\n\nAlthough most scholars consider the 222 CE \"Huanglan\" (see below) to be the first Chinese \"leishu\" encyclopedia. Needham, Lu, and Huang call the late 4th to early 2nd centuries BCE \"Erya\" the oldest Chinese encyclopedia, and consider its derivative literature (beginning with the \"Fangyan\" and \"Huanglan\") as the main line of descent for encyclopedias in China.\n\nThe c. 239 BCE \"Lüshi Chunqiu\", which is an anthology of quotes from many Hundred Schools of Thought philosophical texts, is another text sometimes characterized as the first Chinese \"encyclopedia\". Although its content is \"encyclopedic\", the text was compiled to show rulers and ministers how to govern well, and was not intended to be a comprehensive summary of knowledge.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, the 2nd century BCE \"Shiben\" (\"Book of Origins\") was the earliest Chinese dictionary / encyclopedia of origins. It explained imperial genealogies, the origins of surnames, and records of legendary and historical inventors. Among subsequent encyclopedias of origins, the largest was Chen Yuanlong's 1735 \"Gezhi Jingyuan\" (格致鏡元, \"Mirror of Scientific and Technological Origins\").\n\nShortly after the fall of the Han dynasty, the first true Chinese \"leishu\" encyclopedia appeared. The 222 \"Huanglan\" (\"Imperial Mirror\"), which is now a lost work, was compiled for Cao Pi, the first emperor of the Three Kingdoms Cao Wei state (r. 220-226), in order to provide rulers and ministers with conveniently arranged summaries of current knowledge (like the \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" above).\n\nAn important new type of \"leishu\" encyclopedia appeared in the early Tang dynasty (618–907), after the administration made the imperial examination obligatory for all applicants into government service. Unlike earlier Chinese encyclopedias (such as the \"Huanglan\") that were intended to provide information for rulers and government officials, these new anthologies were intended for scholars who were trying to enter into government, and provided general information, and especially literary knowledge about the classics. For instance, the famous calligrapher Ouyang Xun supervised compilation of the 624 \"Yiwen Leiju\" (\"Collection of Literature Arranged by Categories\") encyclopedia of literature, which quotes 1,431 diverse literary texts. Specialized encyclopedias were another innovation during the Tang period. The 668 \"Fayuan Zhulin\" (\"Forest of Gems in the Garden of the Dharma\") was a Chinese Buddhist encyclopedia compiled by the monk Dao Shi 道世. The 729 \"Kaiyuan Zhanjing\" (\"Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era\") is a Chinese astrology encyclopedia compiled by Gautama Siddha and others during Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Kaiyuan era (713-741).\n\nThe Golden Age of encyclopedia writing began with the Song dynasty (960–1279), \"when the venerated past became the general standard in Chinese thought for almost one whole millennium\". The \"Four Great Books of Song\" were compiled by a committee of scholars under the supervision of Li Fang. First, the 978 \"Taiping Guangji\" (\"Extensive Records of the Taiping Era\") was a collection of about 7,000 stories selected from over 300 classic texts from the Han to the Song dynasties. Second, the 983 \"Taiping Yulan\" (\"Imperial Reader of the Taiping Era\") anthologized citations from 2,579 different texts, ranging from poetry, proverbs, and steles to miscellaneous works. Third, the 985 \"Wenyuan Yinghua\" (\"Finest Blossoms in the Garden of Literature\"), quotes from many literary genres, dating from the Liang dynasty to the Five Dynasties era. Fourth, the \"Cefu Yuangui\" (\"Models from the Archives\"), was the largest Song encyclopedia, almost twice the size of the \"Taiping Yulan\". Li Fang began compilation in 1005 while Wang Qinruo and others finished in 1013. It comprises quotes from political essays, biographies, memorials, and decrees. Another notable Song \"leishu\" encyclopedia was the polymath Shen Kuo's 1088 \"Mengxi Bitan\" (\"Dream Pool Essays\"), which covers many realms of the humanities and natural sciences. The 1161 \"Tongzhi\" (\"Comprehensive Records\"), which was compiled by the Southern Song dynasty scholar Zheng Qiao 鄭樵, became a model for later encyclopedias.\n\nThe Ming dynasty period (1368–1644) was, in comparison with the Song period, of less significance for the history of Chinese encyclopedias. However, the Yongle Emperor commissioned compilation of the 1408 \"Yongle Encyclopedia\", which was a collection of excerpts from works in philosophy, history, arts, and sciences—and the world's largest encyclopedia at the time. The 1609 \"Sancai Tuhui\" (\"Pictoral Compendium of the Three Realms\" [heaven, earth, and people]) was compiled by Wang Qi and Wang Siyi. This early illustrated encyclopedia comprised articles on many subjects including history, astronomy, geography, biology, and more, including a very accurate \"Shanhai Yudi Quantu\" world map. The 1621 \"Wubei Zhi\" (\"Treatise on Armament Technology\") is the most comprehensive military encyclopedia in Chinese history. The 1627 \"Diagrams and explanations of the wonderful machines of the Far West\" was an illustrated encyclopedia of Western mechanical devices translated into Chinese by the Jesuit Johann Schreck and the scholar Wang Zheng 王徵. Song Yingxing's (1637) \"Tiangong Kaiwu\" (\"Exploitation of the Works of Nature\") was an illustrated encyclopedia of science and technology, and notable for breaking from Chinese tradition by rarely quoting earlier works. In Ming China, with the spreading of written knowledge to strata outside the literati, household \"riyong leishu\" 日用類書 (\"Encyclopedias for daily use\") began to be compiled, \"summarizing practical information for townsfolk and others not primarily concerned with mastering the Confucian heritage.\"\n\nThe last great \"leishu\" encyclopedias were published during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). The 1726 \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" (\"Illustrated Compendium of Literature, Ancient and Modern\") was a vast encyclopedic work compiled during the reigns of Emperors Kangxi and Yongzheng. The 1782 \"Siku Quanshu\" (\"Complete Library of the Four Categories\") was the largest Chinese \"leishu\" encyclopedia, and commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor in order to show that the Qing dynasty could surpass the Ming \"Yongle Encyclopedia\". This colossal collection contained some 800 million Chinese characters, and remained the world's largest encyclopedia until recently being surpassed by the English Wikipedia. The emperor ordered the destruction of 2,855 books that were considered to be anti-Manchu, but were listed in the 1798 \"Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao\" annotated catalog. The 1773 \"Vân đài loại ngữ\" (\"Categorized Sayings from the Library\") is a Chinese-language Vietnamese encyclopedia compiled by the scholar Lê Quý Đôn.\n\nPresent-day Chinese encyclopedias—in the common Western sense of \"comprehensive reference work covering a wide range of subjects\"—include both printed editions and online encyclopedias.\n\nAmong printed encyclopedias, the earliest was the (1917) \"The Encyclopaedia Sinica\" compiled the English missionary Samuel Couling. The 1938 \"Cihai\" (\"Sea of Words\") is a general-purpose encyclopedic dictionary that covers many fields of knowledge. The Zhonghua Book Company published the first edition, and the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House issued revised editions in 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2009, making the \"Cihai\" a standard reference work for generations. The 1980-1993 \"Zhongguo Da Baike Quanshu\" or \"Encyclopedia of China\" is the first comprehensive (74 volume) Chinese encyclopedia. Compilation began in 1978, and the Encyclopedia of China Publishing House published individual volumes from 1980 through 1993. There is a 2009 concise second edition, as well as CD-ROM and online versions. The (1981–83) \"Zhonghua Baike Quanshu\" or \"Chinese Encyclopedia\" is a 10-volume comprehensive reference work published by the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan. An online version is also available. The 1985–91 Chinese-language edition \"Concise Encyclopædia Britannica\" or \"Jianming Buliedian Baike Quanshu\" is an 11-volume translation based on the Micropædia portion of the 1987 15th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nAmong major online Chinese encyclopedias, for Standard Chinese, the two largest both began in 2005, the Baike.com Encyclopedia and the Baidu Encyclopedia. There is the Chinese Wikipedia (2002–present), and for varieties of Chinese, there are Cantonese, Mindong, Minnan, Wu, and Gan Wikipedias, as well as the Classical Chinese Wikipedia. Lastly, there are modern English-language encyclopedias of China. For example, the 1991 2nd edition of the \"Cambridge Encyclopedia of China\", the 2009 \"Brill's Encyclopedia of China\", and the 5-volume 2009 \"Berkshire Encyclopedia of China\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17605752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17605752", "title": "Comparison of Windows Vista and Windows XP", "text": "Comparison of Windows Vista and Windows XP\n\nThis page is a comparison of Windows Vista and Windows XP. Windows XP and Windows Vista differ considerably in regards to their security architecture, networking technologies, management and administration, shell and user interface, and mobile computing. Windows XP has suffered criticism for security problems and issues with performance. Vista has received criticism for issues with performance and product activation. Another common criticism of Vista concerns the integration of new forms of DRM into the operating system, and User Account Control (UAC) security technology.\n\nWindows Vista faces backward compatibility problems with many of the games and utility programs that work in Windows XP. As of July 2008, there were about 2,000 applications that specifically carried the 'Vista Compatibility Logo', although the majority of applications without the logo will run without any problems. This number is low compared to the number of programs that can currently work under XP, either natively or in simulation modality.\n\nInitial performance tests have demonstrated that Windows XP outperforms Vista in several productivity areas. File copy operations are speculated to be one area where Vista performs better than XP. In a test run by CRN Test Center, a 1.25 GB file was copied from a network share to each desktop. For XP, it took 2 minutes and 54 seconds, for Vista with SP1 it took 2 minutes and 29 seconds. The Vista implementation of the file copy is arguably more complete and correct as the file does not register as being transferred until it has completely transferred; in Windows XP, the file completed dialogue box is displayed prior to the file actually finishing its copy or transfer, with the file completing after the dialogue is displayed. This can cause an issue if the storage device is ejected prior to the file being successfully transferred or copied in Windows XP due to the dialogue box's premature prompt.\n\nAnother test was performed by \"Tom's Hardware\" in January 2007. Applications such as \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" and the graphics benchmarking suite SPECviewperf 9.03 suffered heavily from the lack of support for the OpenGL graphics library under Vista. They reached the conclusion that Windows Vista clearly is not a great new performer when it comes to executing single applications at maximum speed. On the other hand, they did not find evidence that Windows Vista's Desktop Window Manager (DWM) consumes more energy than Windows XP's window manager. All of the tests were performed on a computer with a 2.93 GHz Intel Core 2 Extreme X6800 processor, 2× 1024 MB DDR2-800 RAM, HIS Radeon X1900XTX IceQ3 graphics card, 150 GB Western Digital WD1500ADFD hard drive and a Gigabyte GA-965P-DQ6 motherboard.\n\nScientific paper about performance evaluation of recent Windows operating system performance concludes that Windows Vista doesn't provide a better overall performance on the high-end computer system compared to Windows XP. Some performance improvements can be seen in memory management and graphics display, but other parts of OS have equal or lower performance than Windows XP. On the low-end computer system, Windows XP outperforms Windows Vista in most tested areas. Windows OS network performance depends on the packet size and used protocol. However, in general, Windows Vista compared to Windows XP shows better network performance particularly for the medium-sized packets.\n\nSecurity was a top priority during Windows Vista development. In Windows XP, every user is set up as an administrator by default (unless added through Computer Management). As a result, most home users ran all their software with Administrator access. However, this left most users unwittingly open to potential security threats, such as hacking and malware downloads. A large amount of existing software doesn’t run well as a standard user, due to developers not implementing the principle of least privilege in their design and testing. For example, many poorly written applications often assume incorrectly that they will have read and write access to the entire filesystem and system Registry. Denying such an application access to any of these assumed rights can cause the application to fail. Sometimes, a person logged on as a standard user under Windows XP can't perform user-specific tasks such as changing the system clock and calendar, changing the computer's time zone, or changing the computer's power management settings due to so-called \"LUA bugs\".\n\nUser Account Control in Windows Vista improves this by limiting application software to standard user privileges until an administrator authorizes an increase in privilege level. In this way, UAC prevents users from making inadvertent changes to system settings and locks down the computer to prevent unauthorized applications from installing or performing malicious actions. Windows Vista is able to work around many LUA bugs in third party applications with its file and Registry virtualisation feature, as well as application compatibility shims. Internet Explorer 7's Protected Mode utilizes User Account Control to isolate IE from other applications and prevent it from writing content to any location, except the \"Temporary Internet Files\" folder. Internet Explorer 7 is available for XP, but does not support Protected Mode on XP. Windows Vista also includes Windows Defender, a spyware scanning and removal tool that is also available for Windows XP for free. Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption, which aims to help protect data in the case of stolen devices.\n\nVista implements address space layout randomization, that makes it considerably more difficult for malicious code to exploit Return-to-libc attacks than on previous versions of Windows, particularly on 64-bit systems. Furthermore, Vista implements heap management enhancements that make it much more difficult to carry out buffer overflow attacks.\n\n64-bit editions of Windows Vista require all kernel-mode drivers to be digitally signed, initially making it difficult for rootkits to install until Alureon managed to overcome this obstacle in 2010 by subverting the master boot record.\nThe firewall in Vista has been rewritten, allowing both outbound as well as inbound traffic to be blocked.\n\nLuna is the default visual style in Windows XP. It is available in three color schemes: Blue (default), Olive Green, and Silver. Windows XP Media Center Edition comes with Royale as the default theme.\n\nIn most editions of Windows Vista, the default theme is Windows Aero. Aero offers translucent window effects, as well as live thumbnails, animated transitions and Flip 3D. However, it requires a compatible graphics card, with a WDDM driver, DirectX 9 support and 32-bit color; otherwise, Windows Vista is displayed using the \"Windows Vista Basic\" visual style.\n\n"}

A statement terminator is used to demarcate the end of an individual statement. Languages that interpret the end of line to be the end of a statement are called \"line-oriented\" languages.\n\n\"Line continuation\" is a convention in line-oriented languages where the newline character could potentially be misinterpreted as a statement terminator. In such languages, it allows a single statement to span more than just one line.\n\nLine continuation is generally done as part of lexical analysis: a newline normally results in a token being added to the token stream, unless line continuation is detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo import a library is a way to read external, possibly compiled, routines, programs or packages. Imports can be classified by level (module, package, class, procedure...) and by syntax (directive name, attributes...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above statements can also be classified by whether they are a syntactic convenience (allowing things to be referred to by a shorter name, but they can still be referred to by some fully qualified name without import), or whether they are actually required to access the code (without which it is impossible to access the code, even with fully qualified names).\n\n\n\nA block is a notation for a group of two or more statements, expressions or other units of code that are related in such a way as to comprise a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\nComments can be classified by:\n\nInline comments are generally those that use a newline character to indicate the end of a comment, and an arbitrary delimiter or sequence of tokens to indicate the beginning of a comment.\n\nExamples:\n\nBlock comments are generally those that use a delimiter to indicate the beginning of a comment, and another delimiter to indicate the end of a comment. In this context, whitespace and newline characters are not counted as delimiters.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABAP supports two different kinds of comments. If the first character of a line, including indentation, is an asterisk (codice_6) the whole line is considered as a comment, while a single double quote (codice_204) begins an in-line commet which acts until the end of the line. ABAP comments are not possible between the statements codice_205 and codice_206 because Native SQL has other usages for these characters. In the most SQL dialects the double dash (codice_207) can be used instead.\n\n\nThere is a wide variety of syntax styles for declaring comments in source code.\ncodice_208 in italics is used here to indicate block comment style.\ncodice_209 in italics is used here to indicate inline comment style.\n\n"}

He then went to Leicester Polytechnic to study history and to bolster support for the already-established Young National Front Student Organisation. In the May 1979 general election, he contested Cambridge for the NF, receiving 311 votes (0.6%). After his studies Holland became closely associated with the Political Soldier wing of the party. One of the party's main writers in a time when their ideology was shifting, he contributed regularly not only to the party journal \"Nationalism Today\", but was also co-editor of \"Rising\", a radical nationalist journal that was independent of the NF and drew heavily from Julius Evola and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Holland became one of the leading lights on the Political Soldier wing of the party when his pamphlet \"The Political Soldier\" was published in 1984. Along with Nick Griffin and Patrick Harrington he became effective joint leader of the Official National Front following the resignation of Andrew Brons from overall leadership in 1984. In 1988 the three travelled to Libya on a fund-raising trip as an official representatives of the NF, although in the end they were given only copies of \"The Green Book\".\n\nIn 1989, Holland broke with Patrick Harrington and joined Michael Fishwick in following Nick Griffin and Roberto Fiore into the International Third Position (ITP) after Harrington had contacted \"The Jewish Chronicle\" with regards to opening dialogue. Holland injected his sympathies for anti-Zionist groups, as part of his nationalist philosophy, into the ITP. He supported the ideas of Muammar Gaddafi and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who had previously featured on a cover of \"National Front News\". \n\nHolland's last public appearance was at a Swedish nationalist convention in 2002, during this time Holland lived in the Irish Midlands where he sought grants from the local Community Enterprise Board for his involvement in the proposed publishing of the \"IHS Books\" however when he sought to use a different address to his home address he was not seen for some time after that, his present whereabouts is unknown following his past involvement with Nick Griffin coming to light.\n, (hosted by Nationaldemokratisk Ungdom, the youth wing of the National Democrats).

It was also stated in the A&E documentary \"The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling\" that he was dubbed the Strangler after a match in France where he applied a sleeper hold, and the French, who were unfamiliar with the hold, thought he was strangling his opponent.\n\nHe was the pivotal figure in the \"Gold Dust Trio\", along with promoters Toots Mondt and Big Billy Sandow, a travelling road show that was the precursor to wrestling tours, and which revolutionized professional wrestling by creating undercards, promoting full events instead of one match shows. They also developed the first professional wrestling storylines, creating worked feuds between wrestlers. Because of the legit skills Lewis possessed, the Trio could put the title on who ever they wanted, because Lewis had the ability to defeat anyone who would not follow the script.\n\nLewis captured his first recognized World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship on December 13, 1920, defeating Joe Stecher. Stecher would prove to be Lewis' biggest rival, both in and out of the ring, with Stecher running his own shows against the Gold Dust Trio, beginning quite possibly the first promotional rivalry. Lewis and Stecher wrestled one of the longest matches in professional wrestling history, where they battled for five and a half hours, ending in a draw. The climax of their feud came on April 15, 1925, when Gold Dust Trio star and former champion Stanislaus Zbyszko was asked to lose to the Gold Dust Trio's own handpicked champion, Wayne Munn, a former football star, in an effort to give Munn credibility. Zbyszko balked at the idea of losing to an unskilled wrestler, and secretly jumped to the Joe Stecher camp. Zbyszko double-crossed the Gold Dust Trio, using his knowledge of holds to legit defeat and, in the process, humiliate Munn. Eventually, Lewis and Stecher settled their differences, and agreed to do business with each other, with Stecher dropping the world title back to Lewis on February 20, 1928.\n\nIn 1931, Lewis and partner, Billy Sandow, signed former Notre Dame All-American running back \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi to his first professional wrestling contract. Lewis was credited with training Savoldi in Los Angeles during the first half of 1931. \n\nIn 1933, one of the Strangler's most infamous matches took place in Madison Square Garden. He was fighting Ray Steele for the title. The two men began circling each other, but no fighting happened, which made the fans bored. Steele finally ended the match by punching Lewis, causing the referee to disqualify him twenty minutes into the match.\n\nOn September 20, 1934, Lewis wrestled Jim Londos in front of an audience of 35,275 at Wrigley Field, and drawing a record gate of $96,302, which would stand until 1952. \n\nIn 1937, the Strangler had six contests in New Zealand. He beat Floyd Marshall, John Spellman, Glen Wade, and Rusty Wescoatt, and lost twice to the Canadian champion Earl McCready, who was then established as the top wrestler in New Zealand.\n\nLewis went into semi-retirement in 1935, but came out of retirement in 1942, at the age of 51, despite being legally blind. He retired from professional wrestling for good in 1948, at 57 years old. At the November 1949 NWA Convention in St. Louis, Lewis was named the ambassador of good will for the NWA. In later years, he would become the manager of his good friend and reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Lou Thesz.\n\nLewis went blind from trachoma. He was destitute and relied on his wife and acquaintances to survive. He died in New York on August 8, 1966 at the age of 75. In 1999, Lewis was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Hall of Fame. Today, a Wisconsin state historical marker commemorates his achievements in his hometown of Nekoosa on Prospect Avenue. In 2002, Lewis was voted in by professional wrestlers, historians and writers and inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Amsterdam, New York.\n\n\n"}

Following his graduation, Green was the 8th architect to be registered by the State University of New York.\n\nAfter graduation, Green worked as a junior architect with William Miller in Ithaca for three years while teaching at Cornell for one year. In 1880, along with William Sydney Wicks, an M.I.T. architecture graduate, he opened a practice in Auburn, New York, moving a year later to 69 Genesee Street in Buffalo, New York in 1881.\n\nGreen was thereafter active in Buffalo, New York through about 1930 where his work left a lasting impression on the city of Buffalo, and it includes such noteworthy structures as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Young Men's Christian Association Central Building, and Twentieth Century Club (1894); all three listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His public buildings include the Buffalo Savings Bank, the Market Arcade, the Buffalo Crematory, and South Park High School, The First Presbyterian Church of Buffalo, Kibler High School, Tonawanda Municipal Building, and Dayton Art Institute (1930) among others.\n\nIn Canada, Green made the designs for several structures owned by the Ontario Power Company at Niagara Falls, Ontario.\n\nHe also designed and built many private residences, including the Charles W. Goodyear Residence, the Granger Mansion, and his own residence at 180 Summer Street, which is not visible from the road. During his 72-year career, he designed more than 370 major structures. More than 160 of his Buffalo buildings survive today.\n\nAfter the death of his partner Wicks in 1919, he continued the practice with his son, Edward B. Green Jr., and then with R.M. James from 1936 to 1950.\n\nIn 1887, Green was married to Harriet Edson (1858–1935). Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nGreen died in Buffalo on February 2, 1950 after a two week illness. He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

It is considered a classic piece of climbing literature, known to many climbers as simply \"The Book\", and has served as an inspiration for more recent climbing books, such as Mark Kroese's \"Fifty Favorite Climbs\". Though much of the book's contents are now out of date, it is still recognized as a definitive text which goes beyond the traditional guidebook.\n\nThe first edition was published in 1979, by Sierra Club Books in the United States and in Great Britain by the now defunct Diadem Books. This was followed by a paperback printing by Random House in 1981. Two subsequent editions (with the same content) were published by Sierra Club Books in 1982 and 1996. Between 1979 and 1999 it sold nearly thirty thousand copies, a considerable achievement for a climbing guide book.\n\nReviewing the book in \"American Alpine Journal\", Fred Beckey wrote: \"Roper and Steck have presented a profile of what could be considered the Great American Dream climbs with a writing style that provides much \"Lebensraum\" for speculation and meditation. While reading, one is tempted to meditate: the challenge of the alpine adventure is always there; the dreams of the various pioneers sometimes filter through the narrative.\"\n\nRoper and Steck received the American Alpine Club's 1995 Literary Award for the book and for their other works such as \"The Best of Ascent\".\n\nTo choose the list of climbs, the coauthors solicited opinions from a number of leading climbers of the era, narrowing a list of more than 100 climbs according to three basic criteria: that the peak or route appear striking from afar, have a noteworthy climbing history, and offer climbing of excellent quality. Precedence was given to climbing quality over appearance, and appearance over historical significance. In order to judge historical significance and continuing popularity, routes were limited for the most part to those first ascended before 1970. A lower limit on the length of the route, at 500 feet, was also established. Steck and Roper had personally ascended or attempted most of the selected routes.\n\nThe list of fifty climbs has served as a challenge to climbers, providing them with a \"tick list\" of challenging routes that span a wide section of western North America. Author Steve Roper has emphasized that the climbs were chosen from a list of about 120 climbs he and Steck considered classic, and are simply '50 classic climbs', not \"'the\" 50 classics'. Nevertheless, the book brought great popularity to many of the routes it featured, and prospective climbers pursuing one of the \"fifty classics\" often found crowds on the more accessible climbs and unexpected company on the more remote routes, earning them the nickname \"Fifty Crowded Climbs\".\n\nNo one person has yet climbed all fifty routes. This has been attributed to the difficulty of some of the Alaskan and Canadian routes (the Hummingbird Ridge of Mount Logan has never been repeated by the original route). \n\nThe fifty climbs included in the book are listed below, along with their grades as given in the first edition, which may differ from those found in a modern guidebook due to changes in climbing standards or route conditions.\n"}

Mueller had been dissuaded from preparing a flora from Australia while in Australia by Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker since historic collections of Australian species were all held in European herbaria which Mueller could not access from Australia. Mueller did eventually produce his own flora of Australia, the \"Systematic Census of Australian Plants\" published in 1882 extended the work of Bentham with the addition of new species and taxonomic revisions.\n\n\"Flora Australiensis\" was the standard reference work on the Australian flora for more than a century.

According to Califia, the original 1974 edition of the book \"was one of the first above-ground nonfiction books to offer a rationalization for dominant/submissive role-playing and some instructions about how to do it\". However, the book does not use the terminology which later became common in BDSM circles \"for the very simple reason that the jargon and conventions we take for granted had not been created when he wrote the book\". While Norman focuses exclusively on male-dominant heterosexual couples, \"\"Imaginative Sex\" could, however, be used by readers of any sexual orientation or gender\", according to Califia, since \"Norman is very good at pinpointing archetypal situations that are ideal for building the tension and polarization crucial to a good scene\" and \"It's fairly easy to adapt these scenarios to any S/M or D/S relationship\".\n\nIn the book, Norman states that one of his goals as a writer is to allow people's imaginations to become \"sexually liberated\". He encourages married couples to use sexual fantasies and role playing in order to enliven their sex lives and explore the mental and spiritual aspects of sexual intercourse. While Norman defends his male-dominant psycho-sexual theories (which also underlie the Gor books), it is notable that he does not advise couples to attempt to adopt the customs and institutions of the fictional planet Gor in any literal or simplistic way. Norman places more emphasis on \"pair-bonding\" and stable heterosexual relationships than in the Gor books, and when fantasy-scenario whippings are to be enacted, for example, Norman recommends that the man sharply clap his hands together, \"while the slave reacts as if being whipped\".\n"}

The knock-for-knock agreement simplifies recovery claims among insurers and, over time, attributes costs fairly among insurers.\n\nHowever, knock-for-knock agreements between insurers have been criticised as unfair on the party \"not\" responsible for an accident. If, for the sake of administrative ease, an insurer pays out to repair damage done to its policy-holder's own car instead of pursuing the party responsible for the accident for all relevant costs, an effective claim is recorded against that policy-holder's insurance record. In this way, knock-for-knock agreements can result in policy-holders finding unexpectedly, when they come to renew their insurance, that they face higher premiums regardless of responsibility for an accident they were involved in.\n\nRegardless of the agreement between the insurers, once the client makes a claim or the insurer pays the client from his/her policy, the insurer has to reinstate the client's No Claim Discount (NCD); hence, the claim won't and should not affect the client's policy, especially if that client was not at fault.\n\nMilitary Claims\n\n'Knock for knock' is also used in a specific, analogous sense, for example, the following, cited in the \"Law at War\", from the US Army website :\n\nOil and Gas Industry\n\n'Knock for knock' is a common contractual arrangement in the oil and gas industry. The operator of an oil and gas property requires the assistance and expertise of many kinds of contractors, including drilling companies, well service companies, facility constructors, equipment suppliers, and caterers. Generally, the operator will engage these services under a 'Master Service Agreement' which sets forth the essential commercial terms under which the work will be performed. One of these terms is the allocation of the risk of loss to people and property. In general, a knock-for-knock agreement means that each party working on an oil and gas worksite -- the operator and each contractor -- agrees to protect and indemnify all the other parties against injuries to that party's employees and agents, and destruction or damage to that party's property. This allocation is not based upon the fault or culpability of the party whose employee was injured or whose property was damaged. The goal is the efficient defense and payment of a claim through having a single party responsible for the loss.\n"}

Afterward, the Kotoamatsukami \"hides away\" as \"hitorigami\".\n\nThough the Zōkasanshin (three deity of creation) are thought to be genderless, another theory stated Kamimusuhi was the woman and Takamimusubi the man, comparing them with water and fire or with yin and yang.\n\nSome theories also regard Ame-no-Minaka-Nushi as the source of all creation or as the God of the Big Dipper.\n\nStrangely, Takamimusubi later reappeared together with Amaterasu as one of the central gods in Takamagahara, and his daughter was the mother of the god Ninigi-no-Mikoto. He also played important roles in the events of the founding of Japan, such as selecting the gods who would tag along with Ninigi and sending the Yatagarasu, the three legged solar crow, to help Emperor Jimmu, who in turn, greatly worshiped him by playing the role of medium priest taking Takami Musubi's identity, in the ceremonies before his Imperial Enthronement (Sokui). Later, Takamimusubi was worshiped by the Jingi-kan and considered the god of matchmaking (based on a pun with his name, \"musubi\" meaning \"to join\"). Some Japanese clans also claimed descent from this god, such as the Saeki clan, he is also an Imperial ancestor.\n\nAs for Kamimusuhi, he (or she) has strong ties with both the Amatsukami (heavenly gods) and the Kunitsukami (earthly gods) of Izumo mythology. Kamimusuhi is also said to have transformed the grains produced by the food goddess Ōgetsuhime (Ukemochi no kami) after she was slain by Amaterasu's angered brother.\n\n"}

In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008 and again in July 2011. In October 2013, minor alterations were made to the plan to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework and other changes in national policy.\n\nThe current London Plan of March 2016 was published, and amended, in January 2017. The current plan has a formal end-date of 2036.\n\nThe plan replaced the previous strategic planning guidance for London issued by the Secretary of State and known as RPG3 . It is a requirement of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 that the document is produced and that it deals only with matters that are of strategic importance to Greater London. The Act also requires that the London Plan includes in its scope:\n\n\nThe plan is a spatial development strategy for the Greater London area and has six objectives.

The opportunity areas will be able to accommodate around 5,000 jobs each or about 2,500 homes, or a mixture of the two. The opportunity areas will mostly be town centres as opposed to suburban developments in the boroughs, although those are mentioned as important in terms of job growth and quality of life. By definition, an Opportunity Area is brownfield land with significant capacity for development. This contrasts with an Intensification Area that can be developed to higher than existing densities with more modest economic change.\n\nFor the purposes of the plan, London is divided into five sub-regions. From 2004 to 2008 the sub-regions were initially the same as the Learning and Skills Council areas established in 1999. Within this scheme there was a separate Central sub-region and four others around it. The London part of the Thames Gateway zone was entirely contained within the East London sub-region. The 2004–08 sub-regions each had a \"Sub-Regional Development Framework\". \n\nThe sub-regions were revised in February 2008 as part of the \"Further Alterations to the London Plan\". These sub-regions each radiated from the centre to combine inner and outer London boroughs. The 2008–11 sub-regions, each had its own \"Sub Regional Implementation Framework\". \n\nIn 2011 the sub-regions were revised again. A smaller Central sub-region was reintroduced, the South sub-region was reintroduced, and all boroughs in the Thames Gateway were returned to the East sub-region. The 2011 sub-regions are maintained in the 2016 London Plan.\n\nThroughout these revisions has been a separately defined \"Central Activities Zone\" which includes areas with a very high concentration of metropolitan activities.\n\nThe London Plan identifies 200 activity centres in the city. All activity centres are categorised into:\n\n\nOver 1,200 smaller neighbourhood and local centres are also identified in the plan.\n\nThere have been a number of amendments to the London Plan which have been incorporated into the current version that was published in February 2008. Early alterations were made covering housing provision targets, waste and minerals. Further alterations to the plan covered climate change; London as a world city; The London Economy; Housing; Tackling social exclusion; Transport; London's geography, the sub-regions and inter-regions; Outer London; Liveability (including safety, security and open spaces); and the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. The mayor gained new statutory powers following the Greater London Authority Act 2007. \n\nFollowing the 2008 change of mayor, a new review was initiated in July 2008 and a new London Plan published in July 2011. As of this date, modifications are made to fully comply with the National Planning Policy Framework.\n\nIn 2013, London Mayor Boris Johnson proposed early minor alterations to the London Plan that were aimed at preventing boroughs from setting rent caps or targets for affordable rented homes in their local development frameworks. The alterations were approved in a vote by the London Assembly in September 2013.\n\nAlterations made since July 2011 were consolidated in the London Plan of March 2016, which was published and amended in January 2017.\n\nFollowing the 2016 change of mayor, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has outlined proposals towards creating a new London Plan.

{"id": "30840200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30840200", "title": "Magic in Anglo-Saxon England", "text": "Magic in Anglo-Saxon England\n\nMagic in Anglo-Saxon England refers to the belief and practice of magic by the Anglo-Saxons between the fifth and eleventh centuries AD in Early Mediaeval England. In this period, magical practices were used for a variety of reasons, but from the available evidence it appears that they were predominantly used for healing ailments and creating amulets, although it is apparent that at times they were also used to curse.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon period was dominated by two separate religious traditions, the polytheistic Anglo-Saxon paganism and then the monotheistic Anglo-Saxon Christianity, both of which left their influences on the magical practices of the time.\n\nWhat we know of Anglo-Saxon magic comes primarily from the surviving medical manuscripts, such as \"Bald's Leechbook\" and the \"Lacnunga\", all of which date from the Christian era.\n\nWritten evidence shows that magical practices were performed by those involved in the medical profession. From burial evidence, various archaeologists have also argued for the existence of professional female magical practitioners that they have referred to as cunning women. Anglo-Saxons believed in witches, individuals who would perform malevolent magic to harm others.[Citation for this definition?]\n\nIn the late 6th century, Christian missionaries began converting Anglo-Saxon England, a process that took several centuries. From the 7th century on, Christian writers condemned the practice of malevolent magic or charms that called on pagan gods as witchcraft in their penitentials, and laws were enacted in various Christian kingdoms illegalising witchcraft.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Roman armies and administrative government from southern Britain in the early 5th century CE, large swathes of southern and eastern England entered what is now referred to as the Anglo-Saxon period. During this, the populace appeared to adopt the language, customs and religious beliefs of the various tribes, such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, living in the area that covers modern Denmark and northern Germany. Many archaeologists and historians have believed that this was due to a widespread migration or invasion of such continental European tribes into Britain, although it has also been suggested that it may have been due to cultural appropriation on behalf of native Britons, who wished to imitate such tribes.\n\nEither way, the Anglo-Saxon populace of England adopted many cultural traits that differed from those in the preceding Iron Age and Romano-British periods. They adopted Old English, a Germanic language that differed markedly from the Celtic and Latin languages previously spoken, whilst they apparently abandoned Christianity, a monotheistic religion devoted to the worship of one God, and instead began following Anglo-Saxon paganism, a polytheistic faith revolving around the veneration of several deities. Differences to people's daily material culture also became apparent, as those living in England ceased living in roundhouses and instead began constructing rectangular timber homes that were like those found in Denmark and northern Germany. Art forms also changed as jewellery began exhibiting the increasing influence of Migration Period Art from continental Europe.\n\nAnglo-Saxonist scholar Bill Griffiths remarked that it was necessary to understand the development of the pantheon of Anglo-Saxon gods in order to understand \"the sort of powers that may lie behind magic ritual.\" He argued that the Anglo-Saxon pagan religion was \"a mass of unorganised popular belief\" with various traditions being passed down orally.\n\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxons was Old English, a Germanic language descended from those of several tribes in continental Europe. Old English had several words that refer to \"powerful women associated with divination, magical protection, healing and cursing\". One of these was \"hægtesse\" or \"hægtis\", whilst another was \"burgrune\".\n\nAnother Old English term for magicians was \"dry\", making them practitioners of \"drycraeft\". Etymologists have speculated that the latter word might have been an anglicised term for the Irish \"drai\", a term referring to druids, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period. In this case, it would have been a term borrowed from the Celtic languages, which were widespread across southern Britain prior to the Anglo-Saxon migration.\n\nFrom the Early Mediaeval to the present day, much information about the Anglo-Saxons and their magical practices have been lost. What we do know comes from a small selection of historical and archaeological sources that have been able to survive.\n\nThe \"main sources of our knowledge of magic\" in the Anglo-Saxon period are the surviving medical manuscripts from the period. The majority of these manuscripts come from the 11th century, some being written in Old English and others in Latin, and they are a mix of new compositions and copies of older works. Three main manuscripts survive, now known as \"Bald's Leechbook\", the \"Lacnunga\" and the \"Old English Herbarium\", as do several more minor examples.\n\nRemarking on the magico-medical knowledge of the Anglo-Saxons, historian Stephen Pollington noted that the amount \"actually recorded was probably only a fraction of the total available to the communities of old, since not everybody had the time and skill to write down what they knew; and furthermore that the few records that survive are only a small part of the corpus: in the thousand years since our surviving manuscripts were written there have been a multitude of cases of accidental or deliberate destruction.\"\n\n\"Bald's Leechbook\" was written around the middle of the 10th century, and is divided into three separate books. Written at the Winchester scriptorium that had been founded by the King of Wessex Alfred the Great (848/849–899), it is a copy of an earlier work that may have been written during Alfred's reign. The first two books in the \"Leechbook\" are a collation of Mediterranean and English medical lore, whilst the third is the only surviving example of an early English medical textbook. This third book contains remedies listed under which part of the body they are supposed to heal, with plants described under their Old English (rather than Latin) names. This implies it was written before the later Mediterranean influence that came with Christianisation. In contrast with the first two parts of the \"Leechbook\", the third contains more magical instructions, with longer and more complicated charms and a greater folkloric component.\n\nThe second of these sources is the \"Lacnunga\", a medical manuscript that opens with an Old English translation of the \"Herbarium Apulei\", a description of plants and herbs found throughout classical and mediaeval Europe. The individual who had originally compiled the Lacnunga started with recipes to heal such ailments as headaches, eye pains and coughs, but whenever \"he came across anything that struck his fancy for some reason or other, he immediately put it in without bothering about its form or the order of his book\", leaving the work disjointed.\nThe name \"Lacnunga\" does not itself appear in the manuscript, but was given to the work by the Reverend Oswald Cockayne who first edited and published it into modern English in the third volume of his \"Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcraft of Early England\" (1866).\n\nGodfrid Storms compared the \"Leechbook\" and the \"Lacnunga\", arguing that if the former had been \"the handbook of the Anglo-Saxon medical man\", then the latter was more like \"the handbook of the Anglo-Saxon medicine-man\", placing a greater emphasis on magical charms and deviating from normal medical manuscripts in style.\n\nArchaeologists have identified evidence for magical practices in various burials from Anglo-Saxon England.\n\nStorms noted that in Anglo-Saxon magical praxes, specific ritual procedures would have had to have been performed in the belief that doing so would enable the magical operation to work.\n\nGodfrid Storms argued that animism played a significant role in the worldview of Anglo-Saxon magic, noting that in the recorded charms, \"All sorts of phenomenon are ascribed to the visible or invisible intervention of good or evil spirits.\" The primary creatures of the spirit world that appear in the Anglo-Saxon charms are the \"ælfar\", or elves, malevolent entities who were believed to cause sickness in humans. Another type of spirit creature believed to cause physical harm in the Anglo-Saxon world were dwarves, whom Storms characterised as \"disease-spirits\".\n\nA number of charms imply the belief that malevolent \"disease-spirits\" were causing sickness by inhabiting a person's blood. Such charms offer remedies to remove these spirits, calling for blood to be drawn out to drive the disease-spirit out with it.\n\nThe adoption of Christianity saw some of these pre-Christian mythological creatures reinterpreted as devils, who are also referenced in the surviving charms. For instance, in the \"Leechbook\", it states that:\n\nStorms believed that these charm formulas were \"the oldest relics of Anglo-Saxon and Germanic literature\", belonging \"to the oldest traditions of the Germanic and Indo-European peoples.\"\n\nMany of the Anglo-Saxon charms use symbolic comparisons between a known, described event and the magical act being performed. In this way, the \"...two things are in some way brought together, so that what happens to one of them will happen also to the other.\" Storms believed that in comparing the two things, the Anglo-Saxon magician hoped to actually make them similar and that their connection may have been based on a \"similarity in sound, meaning, form, colour and so on.\" For instance, in one charm, a curse is placed upon an individual, and their punishment is compared to various other events:\n\nIn other examples, comparisons are made between the magical operation being undertaken and Biblical events, for instance one charm states that:\n\nIn his 1948 study of the subject, entitled \"Anglo-Saxon Magic\", Godfrid Storms noted that the surviving evidence shows \"the close connection there was in Anglo-Saxon times between magic and religion.\" Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period, the religion of the communities living in England changed, from that of Anglo-Saxon paganism, which dominated from the fifth through to the eighth centuries, to Anglo-Saxon Christianity, which was dominant thenceforth.\n\nAnglo-Saxon paganism was polytheistic, believing in the existence of multiple deities. They also appeared to have revered a number of local deities and spirits in addition to holding nature and specific natural formations in high regard. lack of surviving evidence makes it unclear what Anglo-Saxon people believed the relationship between magic and the gods was like, although from examining the Norse mythological story surrounding the god Odin and his quest for knowledge, Godfrid Storms argued that across the Germanic-speaking world, there was a belief that the gods were \"as much subject to magic as more earthly creatures.\"\n\nThe god Woden is the only pre-Christian deity to be mentioned in the surviving Anglo-Saxon charms. The charm in question is known as the \"Nine Herbs Charm\", and involves a discussion of nine different herbs used medicinally. In the charm, it is proclaimed that:\n\nStorms noted that in this charm, Woden's victory in smiting the adder is evoked to symbolise how the poison in the human body is smitten by the recitation of the charm.\n\nAnimal charms also featured prominently in Anglo-Saxon magic as wards against evil magic users. These charms contained clear zoomorphic symbolism borrowed from Pagan beliefs such as symbols of the Boar, Eagle and Wolf. Furthermore, these charms were often designed for\n\nMany of the beliefs in charms, the supernatural and the magical world survived Christianization and were incorporated in Popular Religion and a \"Cultural Paganism\" that was not always seen as being at odds with Christian beliefs. Charms were continued to be used and often contained zoomorphic symbolism such as the Wolf, Raven or Boar, obviously influenced by sacral worship of these creatures from Anglo-Saxon Paganism. These charms were often used to guard against elves and other supernatural creatures which were believed to have a malicious intent towards humans and which had access to hostile magic.\n\nThere were various different kinds of magician in the Anglo-Saxon world.\n\nEvidence from the medical manuscripts informs us that among those who performed magic were members of the Anglo-Saxon medical profession, now known as leeches. In the context of Anglo-Saxon medics, the term \"leech\" was unconnected to the bloodsucking worms, instead deriving from the Old English \"læce\", a term that in Early Mediaeval England referred to healers of any kind. Being a commonly used word in Old English, \"læce\" was the basis to several place names in England, such as Lesbury (\"læce-burg\", or leech-fort) and Lexham (\"læce-ham\", or leech-settlement).\n\nThe written record only ever refers to male leeches, with no mention made of any females operating in the profession. Pollington noted that this does not necessarily imply that there never were any female leeches, but could \"reflect the bias of the records towards the official, fee-charging, professional physician over the local village healer or unofficial midwife.\"\n\nVarious archaeologists, primarily Audrey Meaney and Tania Dickinson, have argued that there were cunning women, or female magical practitioners, during the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\nStephen Pollington, an expert in Anglo-Saxon England, however commented that \"the evidence for 'healing' or 'cunning' men and women in Anglo-Saxon England is sparse, and what little there is remains difficult to interpret.\"\n\nEvidence for the practice of witchcraft, or malevolent magic, can be found in the written records dating from the latter centuries of Anglo-Saxon England. The earliest of these are Latin penitentials written as handbooks for Christian priests, explaining to them the type of penance required for each sin, including the sin of witchcraft. One of the earliest of these was the \"Paenitentiale Theodori\", attributed to Theodore of Tarsus, who held the position of Archbishop of Canterbury from 667 to 690. In chapter I. XV, \"De Cultura Idolorum\" ('Concerning the worship of idols'), it states:\n\nCommenting on this section of the \"Paenitentiale Theodori\", the archaeologist Audrey Meaney noted that it closely resembled Isidore Mercator's Latin version of Canon 23 of the Council of Ankara. She noted however that in this penitential, the sentence for witchcraft is far lighter that than prescribed at Ankara, and it refers specifically to women as witches. This section of the \"Paenitentiale Theodori\" was quoted in the \"Paenitentiale Ecgberhti\", which is attributed to the first Archbishop of York, Ecgbert, and also in the English \"Scriftboc\". In the latter, it remarks that:\n\nIn the introduction to \"Alfred's Laws\", containing a translation of biblical judgments, it includes an alteration on the law \"Do not allow sorcerers to live\" from the Book of Exodus. This alteration proclaims \"Do not allow the women who are accustomed to receive enchanters, magicians and witches to live.\" Audrey Meaney speculated that it might have been influenced by the anti-witchcraft passages in the \"Paenitentiale Theodori\".\n\nIn the surviving records, the Anglo-Saxon witch was usually portrayed as a young woman, who practiced magic to find a lover, win the love of her husbands, give birth to a live baby or to protect her children. This is in contrast to the later English stereotype of a witch, which is that of an elderly spinster or widow. All the records of Anglo-Saxon witchcraft were produced by men, potentially explaining why it was usually women who were accused of witchcraft.\n\n"}

The word \"manananggal\" comes from the Tagalog word \"tanggal\", which means \"to remove\" or \"to separate\", which literally translates as \"remover\" or \"separator\". In this case, \"one who separates itself\". The name also originates from an expression used for a severed torso.\n\nThe manananggal is said to favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck the hearts of fetuses, or the blood of someone who is sleeping. The severed lower torso is left standing, and is the more vulnerable of the two halves. Sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic or ash on top of the standing torso is fatal to the creature. The upper torso then would not be able to rejoin itself and would perish by sunrise.\n\nThe myth of the Manananggal is popular in the Visayan regions of the Philippines, especially in the western provinces of Capiz, Iloilo and Antique. There are varying accounts of the features of a manananggal. Like vampires, Visayan folklore creatures, and aswangs, manananggals are also said to abhor garlic and salt. They were also known to avoid daggers, light, vinegar, spices and the tail of a stingray, which can be fashioned as a whip. Folklore of similar creatures can be found in the neighbouring nations of Indonesia and Malaysia. The province of Capiz is the subject or focus of many manananggal stories, as with the stories of other types of mythical creatures, such as ghosts, goblins, ghouls generically referred to as aswangs. Sightings are purported here, and certain local folk are said to believe in their existence despite modernization. The manananggal shares some features with the vampire of Balkan folklore, such as its dislike of garlic, salt, and vulnerability to sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Yamaguchi. Vaughn became the ward of the Swedish Ambassador to Japan, Tage Grönfall and later Frederick Almquist, and resided in the Swedish Embassy in Tokyo.\n\nVaughn was born the only child of James A. Vaughn (May 7, 1925- February 3, 2003) and Vivienne Joy Wilson (November 2, 1929 – August 5, 1950), in Bluff Hospital in Yokohama, Japan, on April 17, 1949. Her father was a US national employed under contract with the United States Military Administration of Occupied Japan. Her mother was a Swedish national, of three generations of Swedish citizens resident in Japan. She was descended from John Wilson and Sophia Wilson, former Naka Yamazaki, her grandparents, and Professor John Wilson.\n\nVivienne Wilson had been weakened by the privations of World War II, and contracted tuberculosis during James Vaughn's absence to the United States, during which Mary Ann was cared for by a nanny, Fumi.

His performances and hard bumping style inspired generations of villain wrestlers who have attempted to emulate his ability to provide high quality and heat generating matches that continuously bring in huge crowds of fans. He was well known for using two different finishing moves in his many victories: the \"Bombs Away\" knee drop (a diving knee drop from the top rope to the throat) and the piledriver. Stevens wrestled as both a singles performer and in tag team matches with a variety of partners.\n\nIn 2006, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nStevens began his four decade-long career in 1950 at the age of 15. One of Stevens's mentors was the \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion. When commenting on the ability of his longtime friend, Rogers consistently said \"Ray was one of the most talented and graceful wrestlers I've ever watched and been a part of. He won titles at the youngest age of any wrestler I've ever known and was a credit to the game\" (Page 3 of Whatever Happened To...?, Issue Number Twenty One, May 1996).\n\nThroughout most of his working years, Stevens was a villain. He occasionally turned into a face. His most famous finishing move was the \"Bombs Away\" knee drop which involved Ray \"the Blond Bomber\" jumping off the top turnbuckle and landing with his knee on the throat of his opponent. Stevens's initial foray into main event wrestling involved his matches with one of the 1950s most colorful heels, Gorgeous George. It was a result of his work with George, that Stevens became a main event star. At this stage of his career, Ray Stevens was 17 years old.\n\nStevens further developed his skills in tag team matches. He initially went into a partnership with Don Fargo as Ray and Don Stevens. In addition, on August 6, 1959, Stevens teamed up with \"Professor\" Roy Shire as \"brother\" Ray Shire to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Dick the Bruiser and Angelo Poffo. The Shire Brothers were involved in many famous angles until Roy moved on to become promoter of Big Time Wrestling wrestling programs in San Francisco's Cow Palace. One angle, which took place in Indianapolis on October 1, 1960, involved a \"match\" between boxer Archie Moore, a former World Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion, and the Shire Brothers. This match did not show Ray and Roy having any significant advantage over Moore. For one thing, the Shire Brothers were required to wear boxing gloves and follow the rules of boxing when they went against professional boxer Moore. Both Ray and Roy were \"knocked out\" in a matter of minutes. This match did not settle the argument as to who is the superior athlete, the professional boxer or the professional wrestler. A positive outcome of this \"match\" was the fans, who attended this event in large numbers, having the pleasure of seeing the long-awaited comeuppance of the arrogant and rule-breaking Shire Brothers.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Ray Stevens was ready to move on to the next stage of his wrestling career, which took place in the city of San Francisco and throughout Northern California.\n\nStevens, reverting to his real name, started out in San Francisco, California for Big Time Wrestling on March 4, 1961, where he was involved in an angle with Pepper Gomez and captured the NWA United States Championship nine times and the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times. During his first televised interview on the Bay Area's \"KTVU Channel Two\" weekly Friday night wrestling show promoting his upcoming match at the Cow Palace, Stevens, speaking with a low pitched growl from the side of his mouth in the manner of a movie tough, shocked the fans when he said San Francisco was a terrible place to live. He also referred to those who watched the wrestling programs as \"hillbillies\" and \"pencil neck geeks.\" The insults thrown at the inhabitants of San Francisco caused a bit of a stir at the time which helped to further enhance Stevens' box office draw.\n\nOne noteworthy characteristic of Ray Stevens was his flexible use of different cities being referred to as his birthplace. His actual birthplace was Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He was, shortly afterward, raised in Columbus, Ohio by his aunt during the years of the Great Depression. Whenever he was introduced by a wrestling program announcer in San Francisco, his birthplace was New York City. After moving to the East Coast during the early 70s, his birthplace became San Francisco. This was done to plant the idea in the minds of the fans that he was an outsider instead of one of them.\n\nThe matches between Pepper Gomez and Ray Stevens, during the early part of the 1960s, certainly set the tenor for the Blond Bomber's dominance as top heel in the Bay Area during the entire decade. Gomez, at the time, had the reputation of having a \"cast iron\" stomach. He constantly challenged other wrestlers to jump on his stomach and try to get him to sell. Until the Blond Bomber came along, in May 1962, to pick up on this challenge, no wrestler was able succeed in causing more than just a little discomfort from jumping on his stomach. Gomez accepted a challenge from Ray Stevens to jump on his stomach off from a fifteen feet ladder which was placed in the center of the ring. Stevens did so from the halfway point on the ladder, but he did not succeed in getting Gomez to sell. Drawing from his seemingly inexhaustible arsenal of nefarious tactics, Stevens then went to the top of the ladder and, instead of jumping off feet first, he quickly switched to using his Bombs Away knee drop. The impact caused Gomez to spit blood and put him out of action for several weeks. After Gomez recovered from his \"injury\", he and Stevens had a bout at the Cow Palace which was attended by approximately 17,000 fans with many more turned away due to lack of space. This was the largest paying crowd to have attended any events at the Cow Palace, including a musical extravaganza which starred Elvis Presley.\n\nDuring 1962, the KTVU television station, in conjunction with its Friday night wrestling program, conducted a major survey which incorporated the opinions of wrestling fans in the Bay Area. The purpose of the survey was to determine which pro wrestler was considered to be the most popular and which one was the most hated. Unsurprisingly, Ray Stevens was selected as the most hated wrestler. However, many wrestling insiders were stunned to find that Stevens was also voted in as the most popular. This vote clearly shown the impact that Stevens had on the wrestling scene in San Francisco and its growing popularity among the fans.\n\nAnother match, which took place in 1963, between Gomez and Stevens led to an unexpected ending. After a heated exchange of blows, Gomez grabbed the rather hefty time keeper's bell and spun around to take aim at Stevens’s head. Gomez apparently misjudged the weight of the bell when hitting the Blond Bomber. Stevens quickly fell to the mat and laid prone. It took a short while before it was noticed that Stevens was seriously hurt. He was taken to the hospital unconscious. Fortunately, he did not incur brain damage and eventually recovered the next day. The San Francisco Examiner's columnist Jack Rosenbaum, headlining his story about the incident as \"A Touch of Realism at the Cow Palace\", compared Stevens to a fallen Greek warrior from ancient times. Gomez was fined $5,000 (which was a large sum of money during those times) by the California State Athletic Commission for his part in this mishap. Since then, Stevens and Gomez had many bouts which were always well attended by the fans.\n\nDuring his San Francisco years, Stevens took on and vanquished wrestlers of such caliber as Cowboy Bob Ellis, Karl Gotch, Pat O'Connor, Pepper Gomez, Kinji Shibuya, Bobo Brazil, Bruno Sammartino (through a count out), Pedro Morales, Dr. Big Bill Miller, Ernie \"Big Cat\" Ladd, Jose Lothario, and many others. More than any other move, the Bombs Away knee drop was the deciding factor in his victories.\n\nIn 1965, Stevens teamed up with Pat Patterson to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They were known as the \"Blond Bombers.\" Stevens and Patterson had two runs holding the NWA World Tag Team title and one run with the AWA World Tag Team Championship. In 1969, after making a babyface turn, Stevens went against Patterson in a number of mat wars.\n\nOn July 15, 1967, Bruno Sammartino, WWWF World Heavyweight Champion, wrestled a two out of three falls match for the title against the Blond Bomber in San Francisco. Stevens pinned Sammartino with the \"Bombs Away\" to win the first fall; Sammartino forced Stevens to submit to win the second fall; Stevens won the third and deciding fall via countout. It was later determined that according to WWWF rules, a champion could not lose the title due to a countout. Thus, Bruno Sammartino was able to return to the East Coast with his title still intact and the title change was never officially recognized.\n\nStevens was known for using risky acrobatic moves in his matches. An example of a crowd pleasing stunt, created by the Blond Bomber in 1965, was the Turnbuckle Flip. After being arm thrown into the far corner, Stevens would go into a half somersault landing with his back on the top turnbuckle and then do a blade job on his forehead before falling to the cement floor. This bumping technique was replicated by a few wrestlers like Ric Flair as part of their in-ring repertoire.\n\nOver the years, Ray Stevens has been viewed by many wrestling insiders as the best worker during the 1960s. Stevens had the ability to make any opponent look good, no matter how badly they may perform in the ring. In addition, he was able to demonstrably convince the fans, through his ring work and his equally great interview work, that he could methodically and completely destroy anyone regardless of how strong or how big they may be.\n\nHe then moved on to the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1971, where he enjoyed success as a four-time AWA World Tag Team champion (three with Nick Bockwinkel, one with Pat Patterson). After that, he captured three NWA World Tag Team titles in Jim Crockett Promotions. It was on January 20, 1972 when Stevens and Nick Bockwinkel first captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship from Crusher Lisowski and Red Bastien in Denver, Colorado. The team was managed by Bobby Heenan beginning in 1974.\n\nWhile working with the AWA in 1972, Stevens had a television match with a masked wrestler known as Doctor X (Dick Beyer) in which he applied the Bombs Away coup de grâce to win the match while Doctor X's leg was tangled between two ring ropes. This resulted in the \"breaking\" of Doctor X's leg (which allowed Beyer to leave the area to work with a wrestling tour in Japan as \"The Destroyer\") and also led to the outlawing of the Bombs Away maneuver by the AWA. It was shortly after that match when Ray Stevens was no longer called the Blond Bomber and became known as \"The Crippler.\"\n\nIn 1976, Stevens and Bockwinkel were still the team to beat, but friction was growing within the team. An angle developed where Heenan and Bockwinkel did the talking during their promos and cut Stevens off whenever he tried to speak. When Bobby Heenan was named the 1976 Manager of The Year by a pro wrestling magazine on a Christmas Day episode of \"AWA All-Star Wrestling\", Bockwinkel attacked Stevens. This happened because the Crippler pushed Heenan, while Bockwinkel was trying to congratulate Bobby on being manager of the year; however, Stevens was able to get the upper hand and eventually destroyed a trophy presented to Heenan for his being named \"Manager of the Year.\" This led to the eventual break up of the team and a feud between the two to start the year 1977.\n\nFrom there, he moved to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In the WWF, he was managed by \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie. Stevens and Captain Lou Albano turned on Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka (Albano was Snuka's manager) in 1982. This angle had the Crippler piledriving Snuka onto the concrete floor (before padding was introduced) two consecutive times. At this stage of his career, the mounting physical abuse after years on the road, with multiple injuries, difficulty in maintaining optimum conditioning, and his advancing age, along with promoters beginning to favor the use of more muscular physiques, had clearly began to take its toll.\n\nStevens also briefly did color commentary alongside Vince McMahon in 1984.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Stevens returned to the AWA, where he joined forces with Larry Zbyszko in feuding with the babyface-turned Bockwinkel, only to turn face himself after Zbyszko turned on him. Stevens was doing color commentary for ESPN's \"AWA Championship Wrestling\" during the AWA World Heavyweight title match between champion Bockwinkel and Curt Hennig in San Francisco on May 2, 1987 when interference by Zbyszko (who handed a roll of coins to Hennig from ringside to use against Bockwinkel) led to Hennig winning the title from Bockwinkel. Stevens and Bockwinkel protested the outcome of the match to the AWA Championship Committee, which held up the championship immediately after the match, but the original match decision was upheld days later after the committee ruled that there was no evidence that Zbyszko had illegally aided Hennig. As a result, the championship was returned to the now heel-turned Hennig. Stemming from the events of that match, Stevens feuded briefly with Zbyszko before finishing out his career in 1992, after 42 years.\n\nOn May 20, 2006, Ray \"The Crippler\" Stevens was posthumously honored by being inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame at Amsterdam, New York. He was the first professional wrestler to be selected for induction into two separate categories: Tag team (with Pat Patterson) and Modern Era (for his superlative work as a singles wrestler).\n\nIn 1952, Stevens was married to female wrestler Theresa Theis, who also did some work as Stevens' trainer and helped to hone his skills as a professional wrestler during the initial stage of his career. They were divorced in 1972.\n\nHe appeared in the 1974 movie \"The Wrestler\" and the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie \"Paradise Alley\".\n\nIn 1995, the mayors of San Francisco and Oakland jointly proclaimed April 5 \"Ray Stevens Day\".\n\nOn May 3, 1996, Stevens died from a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Fremont, California. He was survived by five children: Carl, Timothy and Laura from Fremont, Roy from Sacramento, California, and Kelly from Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3616604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3616604", "title": "Serials crisis", "text": "Serials crisis\n\nThe term serials crisis has become a common shorthand to describe the chronic subscription cost increases of many serial publications such as scholarly journals. The prices of these institutional or library subscriptions have been rising much faster than the Consumer Price Index for several decades, while the funds available to the libraries have remained static or have declined in real terms. As a result, academic and research libraries have regularly canceled serial subscriptions to accommodate price increases of the remaining current subscriptions.\n\nThe subscription prices of scholarly journals have been increasing at a rate faster than the inflation rate for several decades. This chronic inflation is caused by several factors. Each journal title publishes unique research findings and as a result is a unique commodity that cannot be replaced in an academic library collection by another journal title, such as a less expensive journal on the same subject, as one could with commodities. The publisher thus has the ability to act as a monopolist. Scholarly journals vary greatly in quality as do the individual articles that they publish. The highest quality journals are often expected and demanded by scholars to be included in their institution's library collections, often with little regard or knowledge about the subscription costs. Traditional metrics for quality in scholarly journals include Impact Factor and Citation count as recorded by Journal Citation Reports. This leads to price inelasticity for these higher quality journals.\n\nAnother possible set of factors in this situation includes the increasing domination of scholarly communication by a small number of commercial publishers, whose journals are far more costly than those of most academic societies. However, the institutional subscription prices for journals published by some academic society publishers (see below) have also exhibited inflationary patterns similar to those seen among commercial publishers.\n\nThe earnings of the American Chemical Society (ACS), for example, is based, in large parts, on publications. In 1999, the income of the ACS was $349 million, where $250 million came from information services. According to a 2004 House of Commons report (by the Science and Technology Committee), the ACS is one of the driving forces of the STM (science, technology, medicine) serials crisis. According to the same report, the crisis started around 1990, when many universities and libraries complained about the dramatic inflation of STM subscription prices especially for the flagship JACS, which is exclusively sold as a bundle with all other ACS journals. The report further complains that\nA typical inflation rate for 2008 included an increase of the bundle price of around 40% (from 22,800 USD to 30,200 USD) with a perspective of more than a doubling (to 55,000 USD) in the next three years.\n\nAn additional problem is a dramatic increase in the volume of research literature and increasing specialization of that research, i.e. the creation of academic subfields.\nThis includes a growth in the number of scholars and an increase in potential demand for these journals.\nAt the same time, funds available to purchase journals are often decreasing in real terms. Libraries have seen their collection budgets decline in real terms compared to the United States Periodical Price Index. There are other library expenditures such as computers and networking equipment that have also had a negative impact on scholarly publishing. As a result of the increasing cost of journals, academic libraries have reduced their expenditures on other types of publications such as scholarly monographs.\n\nCurrency exchange rates can serve to increase the volatility of subscription prices throughout the world. For example, many of the publishers of scientific journals are in Europe and do not set prices in United States dollars, so the prices of such scholarly journals in the United States vary in relation to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThere is much discussion among case librarians and scholars about the crisis and how to address its consequences. Academic and research libraries are resorting to several tactics to contain costs, while maintaining access to the latest scholarly research for their users. These tactics include: increasingly borrowing journals from one another (see interlibrary loan) or purchasing single articles from commercial document suppliers instead of subscribing to whole journals. Additionally, academic and research libraries cancel subscriptions to the least used or least cost-effective journals. Another tactic has been converting from printed to electronic copies of journals, however, publishers sometimes charge more for the online edition of a journal, and price increases for online journals have followed the same inflationary pattern as have journals in paper format. Many individual libraries have joined co-operative consortia that negotiate license terms for journal subscriptions on behalf of their member institutions. Another tactic has been to encourage various methods of obtaining free access to journals.\n\nDeveloped in part as a response to the serials crisis, open access models have included new models of financing scholarly journals that may serve to reduce the monopoly power of scholarly journal publishers which is considered a contributing factor to the creation of the serials crisis. These include open access journals and open access repositories.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47380791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47380791", "title": "Spin Alternative Record Guide", "text": "Spin Alternative Record Guide\n\nSpin Alternative Record Guide is a music reference book compiled by the American music magazine \"Spin\" and published in 1995 by Vintage Books. It was edited by rock critic Eric Weisbard and Craig Marks, who was the magazine's editor-in-chief at the time. The book features essays and reviews from a number of prominent critics on albums, artists, and genres considered relevant to the alternative music movement. Contributors who were consulted for the guide include Ann Powers, Rob Sheffield, Simon Reynolds, Michael Azerrad, and Robert Christgau.\n\nThe book did not sell particularly well and received a mixed reaction from reviewers in 1995. The quality and relevance of the contributors' writing were praised, while the editors' concept and comprehensiveness of alternative music were seen as ill-defined. Nonetheless, it inspired a number of future music critics and helped revive the career of 1960s folk artist John Fahey, whose music was covered in the guide.\n\nSpanning 468 pages, \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" compiles essays by 64 music critics on recording artists and bands who either predated, were involved in, or developed from the alternative music movement. In the book, each artist's entry is accompanied by their discography, with albums rated a score between one and ten. The book's editors, critic Eric Weisbard and \"Spin\" editor-in-chief Craig Marks, consulted journalists such as Simon Reynolds, Alex Ross, Charles Aaron, Michael Azerrad, Ann Powers, and Rob Sheffield, who wrote most of the complete discography reviews. The artist entries are also accompanied by song lyrics and album artwork.\nAlthough \"alternative\" had been used as a catchall term for rock bands outside the mainstream, \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" covers approximately 500 artists from a variety of genres considered relevant to alternative music's development. These include 1970s punk rock, 1980s college rock, 1990s indie rock, noise music, reggae, electronic, new wave, heavy metal, krautrock, synthpop, disco, alternative country, hip hop, grunge, worldbeat, and avant-garde jazz. Most artists associated with classic rock are not covered, while some mainstream pop artists are given entries, including Madonna and ABBA. Other non-rock artists reviewed in the book include jazz composer Sun Ra, country singer-songwriter Lyle Lovett, and Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Weisbard and Marks have said the book was meant to be \"suggestive\", rather than \"comprehensive\", of alternative music.\n\nAn introductory essay on alternative rock and \"alternative sensibilities\" was written by Weisbard. In it, he explains alternative music as a category whose principles are \"antigenerationally dystopian, subculturally presuming fragmentation\", and \"built on an often neurotic discomfort over massified and commodified culture\". He and Marks consulted a number of artists for their top-ten record lists, which were interspersed throughout the book. They also curated a \"Top 100 Alternative Albums\" list for the appendix, ranking the Ramones' 1976 self-titled debut album at number one.\n\n\"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" was published by Vintage Books on October 10, 1995, and was the first book compiled by \"Spin\" magazine. According to Matthew Perpetua, the guide was \"not a huge seller\".\n\nReviewing the book in 1995, Adam Mazmanian from \"Library Journal\" recommended \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" to \"both public and academic libraries\". He found its reviews superior in \"length and scope\" to \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (1992), which also offered complete discographies of artists ranging from Jonathan Richman to Throbbing Gristle. Mazmanian further argued that \"this guide fills a gap in the literature of modern music\" at a time when \"alternative\" has developed a ubiquitous presence in the marketing of popular music. In \"New York\" magazine, Kim France called it \"a well-edited, unpretentious, and comprehensive look at all the crazy stuff the kids are listening to these days\". \n\n\"Booklist\" critic Gordon Flagg was more qualified in his praise. He applauded the accuracy of the artist entries and the quality of the contributors' reviews, but found Weisbard's conception of \"alternative\" ill-defined and recommended \"The Trouser Press Record Guide\" (1991) as a more comprehensive option. Even more critical was \"Billboard\" magazine's Beth Renaud, who called much of the writing biased and the organization unencyclopedic. She said Weisbard's \"obligatory\" essay is outdated and vague in defining alternative rock and that the contributors \"gush\" over artists usually covered by \"Spin\"s magazine publication, with many relevant artists omitted in place of more perplexing additions.\n\nHaving edited the book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from \"Spin\", which marked the beginning of his career as a rock critic. Meanwhile, the guide's entry on 1960s folk guitarist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from \"The New York Times\", this led to substantial interest in the guitarist from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.\nAmerican pop culture critic Chuck Klosterman later cited \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" as one of his five favorite books, saying in 2011, \"I fear this might be out of print, but it's probably my favorite music book of all time. Since its 1995 publication, I doubt a year has passed when I didn't reread at least part of it.\" Robert Christgau, who contributed to the book, wrote that while most music guides and encyclopedia books he has consulted were unremarkable, \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" was one of the few \"useful exceptions\" because of what he felt was the \"sharpest writing\" from contributors such as Weisbard and Sheffield. Maura Johnston, on the other hand, said in retrospect that the book's list of the 100 best albums catered to \"hipper, Gen-Xier tastes\".\n\nIn 2011, \"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" was included in \"Pitchfork\"s list of their staff's favorite music books. In an essay accompanying the list, Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the \"alternative sensibility\" by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in \"an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes.\" According to Perpetua, the \"number of young readers [who] pursued music criticism\" because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of \"The Fader\", bought the book after it was published and said he used it as a consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up in the pre-Internet age, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: \"They had entries for all these different people that I had never heard of: Can, John Zorn, [John] Fahey, whatever.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36018645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36018645", "title": "Teochew Letters", "text": "Teochew Letters\n\nTeochew Letters () were a form of family correspondence combined with remittance, sent by Teochew immigrants in Southeast Asia (particularly Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia) as well as Hong Kong, to their families in the Teochew region (now known as Chaoshan in Mandarin), in eastern Guangdong Province, China.\n\nThese letters were sent from the early 19th century till the 20th century. They were initially delivered by men known as \"zui-kheh\" (水客) literally \"Water Traveller\", who travelled frequently between Southeast Asia and the Teochew region for business. Towards the end of the 19th century, delivery of the Teochew Letters became a full-fledged industry, known as the \"Qiaopi\" industry (侨批业). Qiaopi agencies in Southeast Asia collected the letters and remittances from the migrant workers and sent them to their corresponding partner in Swatow. The agencies in Swatow then distributed the letters to local agencies located in the counties and villages of the Teochew region. The men employed to hand-deliver the letters and money to the families were known as \"phoe-kha\" (批脚), literally the \"Feet of the Letters\". The Qiaopi industry ended in 1979 when the government in China ordered its functions to be transferred to Bank of China.\n\nFamily correspondence combined with remittance was not unique to the Teochews. Other groups of overseas Chinese, including the Hokkien, the Cantonese and the Hakka, also used this method to communicate with their families. The Qiaopi agencies of the different groups served only their own community circle and their services did not overlap. An estimate of 170,000 Qiaopi letters have been collected by researchers and private collectors. The majority are Teochew Letters. The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics, based in Swatow, has a collection of 120,000 Teochew Letters, consisting of both originals and copies.\nThe Teochew Letters has immense historical value. It is an archive of the cultural and collective historical experiences of the Teochew people. Its contents reflect society at all levels, touching on international relations, national issues, and details of daily life important to families. As such, the information they contain bear intrinsic value for further research, as they are able to authenticate and supplement contemporary written history.\n\n\"Qiaopi\" (僑批) literally means the \"Letter of the Overseas Chinese\", with \"phoe\" (批) being the Southern Min expression for \"letter\". The term has sometimes been translated as Overseas Remittance Mail or Money Remittance Mail but these fail to capture the cultural aspect of the artefacts.\n\nAs part of the larger Archive of Overseas Remittance Mails, the Teochew Letters were added to the China Archival Heritage Register in 2010. Together with the Qiaopi collection of Jiangmen, Meizhou and Fujian, the Teochew Letters were included into the Asia/Pacific Regional Memory of the World (MOW) Register on 16 May 2012. Higher recognition is being sought through ongoing submission for inclusion in the prestigious UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2013.\n\nTo increase general awareness of the Teochew Letters and to promote the UNESCO Memory of the World Register application efforts, The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics launched an online museum for the Teochew Letters in June 2012. The website was created on behalf of the museum by the Cheung Kong School of Journalism of Shantou University.\n"}

{"id": "1759952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1759952", "title": "Unity in diversity", "text": "Unity in diversity\n\nUnity in diversity is a concept of \"unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation\" that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural, linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or psychological differences towards a more complex unity based on an understanding that difference enriches human interactions. It has applications in many fields, including ecology, cosmology, philosophy, religion and politics. \n\nThe idea and related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World cultures. The concept of unity in diversity was used by both the indigenous peoples of North America and Taoist societies in 400–500 B.C. In premodern Western culture, it has existed in an implicit form in certain organic conceptions of the universe that developed in the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome. \n\n\"Unity in diversity\" is used as a popular slogan or motto by a variety of religious and political groups as an expression of harmony and unity between dissimilar individuals or groups. The phrase is a deliberate oxymoron, the rhetorical combination of two antonyms, \"unitas\" \"unity, oneness\" and \"varietas\" \"variety, variousness\". When used in a political context, it is often used to advocate federalism and multiculturalism.\n\nThe diversity is a permanent human condition.\nThe concept of unity in diversity can be traced back to Sufi philosopher Ibn al-'Arabi (1165–1240), who advanced the metaphysical concept of the \"oneness of being\" (\"wahdat al-wujud\"), namely, that reality is one, and that God's is the only true existence; all other beings are merely shadows, or reflections of God's qualities. Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī (1366–1424) expanded on Al-'Arabi's work, using it to describe a holistic view of the universe which reflects \"unity in diversity and diversity in unity\" (\"al-wahdah fi'l-kathrah wa'l-kathrah fi'l-wahdah\").\n\nLeibniz used the phrase as a definition of \"harmony\" (\"Harmonia est unitas in varietate\") in his \"Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei super omnia\" (1677/8).\n\nThe Old Javanese poem \"Kakawin Sutasoma\", written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the Majapahit empire sometime in the 14th century, contains the phrase\n\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\", translated as \"unity in diversity\" or \"out of many, one\". \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\" is now the official national motto of Indonesia. The poem is notable as it promotes tolerance between Hindus (especially Shaivites) and Buddhists, stating that although Buddha and Shiva are different in substance, their truths are one:\n\nUnity in diversity is a prominent principle of the Bahá'í Faith. In 1938, in his book \"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh\", Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, said that \"unity in diversity\" was the \"watchword\" for the religion.\n\n`Abdu’l-Bahá, the head of the Bahá'í Faith from 1892 to 1921, explained this principle in terms of the oneness of humanity: \nIn Meher Baba's \"Final Declaration\", he stated that \"Unity in the midst of diversity can be made to be felt only by touching the very core of the heart. This is the work for which I have come. I have come to sow the seed of love in your hearts so that, in spite of all superficial diversity which your life in illusion must experience and endure, the feeling of oneness through love is brought about amongst all the nations, creeds, sects and castes of the world.\" \n\n\"Unity in diversity\" is also a slogan utilized by the disciples of Swami Sivananda. They came to America to spread the true meaning of Unity in Diversity; that we are All in One & One in All in an all loving ahimsa God.\n\nIn modern politics it was first used, as \"In varietate unitas\", by Ernesto Teodoro Moneta in the context of Italian Unification.\n\nThe phrase has since become somewhat of a staple of Canadian multiculturalism in general. \n\nThe phrase was invoked in the Interdisciplinary Research Seminar (IRS) at Wilfrid Laurier University in the 1970s. Ervin Laszlo presented his paper entitled \"Framework for a General Systems Theory of World Order\" (1974) as one of the first seminar Papers that led to the establishment of the IRS in 1975.\n\nThe motto of the province of Saskatchewan, adopted in 1986, is a variation, \"Multis e gentibus vires\" (from many peoples, strength).\n\nIn 2000, the European Union adopted 'United in Diversity' (Latin: \"In varietate concordia\") as official motto, a reference to the many and diverse member states of the Union in terms of culture. Apart from its English form, the European Union's motto is also official in 23 other languages. \"Unity in diversity\" was selected by means of a competition involving students from member nations. According to the European Union official website \n\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India and leader of the Indian National Congress, vigorously promoted unity in diversity as an ideal essential to national consolidation and progress. He wrote at length on this topic, exploring it in detail in his work \"The Discovery of India\".\n\n\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\", an Old Javanese phrase translated as \"Unity in Diversity\" (\"Out of many, one\"), is the official national motto of Indonesia. It is a quotation from an Old Javanese poem Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the Majapahit empire sometime in the 14th century.\n\nThe slogan Unity In Diversity meaning in malay is \"perpaduan dalam kepelbagaian\"\n\nWhen apartheid South Africa celebrated 20 years of independence on 31 May 1981, the theme of the celebrations was \"unity in diversity\". Anti-apartheid campaigners denounced the motto as a cynical attempt to explain away the inequalities in South African life and called on runners of the Comrades Marathon to protest at the co-option of the event by wearing a black armband. The winner of the race, Bruce Fordyce, was one of those wearing a black armband.\nThe term has since been incorporated into the preamble of the 1996 Constitution of South Africa as a central tenet of post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nThe Gwich’in Tribal Council representing the Gwich’in, a First Nations of Canada and an Alaskan Native Athabaskan people, who live in the northwestern part of North America, mostly above the Arctic Circle, adopted the motto Unity through Diversity.\n\n"}

The same cuneiform symbol used to write her name was also used to write the Sumerian word for \"spider\", indicating that Uttu was probably envisioned as a spider spinning a web. She appears primarily in the myth of \"Enki and Ninsikila\", in which she resists the sexual advances of her father Enki by ensconcing herself inside her web, but he convinces her to let him in using a gift of fresh produce and the promise that he will marry her. Enki then intoxicates her with beer and rapes her. She is rescued by Enki's wife Ninhursag, who removes Enki's semen from her vagina and plants it in the ground, resulting in the growth of eight new plants, which Enki later eats.\n\nIn the version of \"Enki and Ninsikila\" from Nippur, Uttu is the daughter of Enki and Ninkurra, but, in another version, Ninkurra instead gives birth to Nin-imma, who mates with her father Enki and gives birth to Uttu as a result. Uttu matures and becomes \"shapely and decorous\". Enki's wife Ninhursag warns Uttu that Enki will try to seduce her, as he has done with all his other daughters. Uttu fortifies herself inside her web and, when Enki comes to seduce her, she forces him to promise that he will marry her before she will have sex with him. As marriage gifts, Uttu demands that Enki give her fruits and vegetables. Enki finds a gardener, who demands that, in exchange for the fruits and vegetables, Enki must fill his irrigation ditches with water. Enki fills the ditches and the gardener gives him the produce.\n\nEnki brings the produce to Uttu, who happily admits him into her web, but Enki gives Uttu beer to make her drunk and then rapes her. Uttu screams and Ninhursag comes to rescue her. Ninhursag removes Enki's semen from Uttu's vagina and plants it in the ground, causing eight plants to rise. Later, Enki sees the plants and is annoyed because he does not recognize them. Isimud, Enki's \"sukkal\", or personal attendant, arrives, names each of the plants, and gives them to Enki to eat. The account ends with the declaration that \"Enki determined the nature of the grasses\" and \"had them know it in their hearts.\"\n\n"}
