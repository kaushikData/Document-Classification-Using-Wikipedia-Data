There are more than 2,500 entries spanning the years between 433 and 1450. The manuscript is thought to have been compiled in 1092, as the chronicle is written by a single scribe down to that point but updated by many different hands thereafter. It was written by the monks of Innisfallen Abbey, on Innisfallen Island on Lough Leane, near Killarney in Munster, but made use of sources produced at different centres around Munster as well as a Clonmacnoise group text of the hypothetical Chronicle of Ireland.\n\nAs well as the chronological entries, the manuscript contains a short, fragmented narrative of the history of pre-Christian Ireland, known as the \"pre-Patrician section\", from the time of Abraham to the arrival of Saint Patrick in Ireland. This has many elements in common with Lebor Gabála Érenn. It sets the history of Ireland and the Gaels within Eusebian universal history, which is provided both by a Latin world chronicle and extracts from \"Réidig dam, a Dé, do nim\", a Middle Irish poem attributed to Flann Mainistrech in later manuscripts.\n\nThe annals are now housed in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. In 2001, Brian O'Leary, a Fianna Fáil councillor in Killarney, called for the annals to be returned to the town.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26868975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26868975", "title": "Anti-miscegenation laws", "text": "Anti-miscegenation laws\n\nAnti-miscegenation laws or miscegenation laws are laws that enforce racial segregation at the level of marriage and intimate relationships by criminalizing interracial marriage and sometimes also sex between members of different races. Such laws were first introduced in North America from the late seventeenth century onwards by several of the Thirteen Colonies, and subsequently by many US states and US territories and remained in force in many US states until 1967. After the Second World War, an increasing number of states repealed their anti-miscegenation laws. In 1967, in \"Loving v. Virginia\", the remaining anti-miscegenation laws were held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Similar laws were also enforced in Nazi Germany as part of the Nuremberg laws, and in South Africa as part of the system of Apartheid. In the United States, interracial marriage, cohabitation and sex have been termed \"miscegenation\" since the term was coined in 1863. Contemporary usage of the term is less frequent, except to refer to historical laws banning the practice.\n\nWhile there have been no nationwide anti-miscegenation laws in the United States, there were state laws in individual states, particularly in the Southern States and the Plains States, that prohibited miscegenation. These laws were a part of American law since before the United States was established and remained so until ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Loving v. Virginia\". Typically defining miscegenation as a felony, these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between people of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes, the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of adultery or fornication would be brought against them instead. All anti-miscegenation laws banned the marriage of whites and non-white groups, primarily blacks, but often also Native Americans and Asians. In addition, the state of Oklahoma in 1908 banned marriage \"between a person of African descent\" and \"any person not of African descent\"; Louisiana in 1920 banned marriage between Native Americans and African Americans (and from 1920 to 1942, concubinage as well); and Maryland in 1935 banned marriages between blacks and Filipinos. In many states, anti-miscegenation laws also criminalized cohabitation and sex between whites and non-whites.\n\nEarly prohibitions on interracial marriages date back to the rule of the Dutch East India Company when High Commissioner Van Rheede prohibited marriages between European settlers and \"heelslag\" or full-blooded slave women (that is, of pure Asian or African origin) in 1685. The ban was never enforced.\n\nIn 1927, the Pact coalition government passed a law prohibiting marriages between whites and blacks (thought not between whites and \"coloured\" people). An attempt was made to extend this ban in 1936 to marriages between whites and coloureds when a bill was introduced in parliament, but a commission of inquiry recommended against it.\n\nSouth Africa's Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, passed in 1949 under Apartheid, forbade marriages between whites and anyone deemed to be non-whites. The Population Registration Act (No. 30) of 1950 provided the basis for separating the population of South Africa into different races. Under the terms of this act, all residents of South Africa were to be classified as white, coloured, or native (later called Bantu) people. Indians were included under the category \"Asian\" in 1959. Also in 1950, the Immorality Act was passed, which criminalized all sexual relations between whites and non-whites. The Immorality Act of 1950 extended an earlier ban on sexual relations between whites and blacks (the Immorality Act [No. 5] of 1927) to a ban on sexual relations between whites and any non-whites. Both Acts were repealed in 1985 as part of the reforms carried out during the tenure of P. W. Botha.\n\nIn Egypt the government reviews all marriages between Egyptian men and Israeli women to decide on an individual basis whether to strip the men of their Egyptian citizenship. The cabinet takes into consideration whether the Israeli woman is an Arab or a Jew. This is, however, done for political reasons considering Israelis are not a race and there are Israelis of Egyptian descent. \n\nEgyptian law says citizenship can only be revoked if the citizen is proven to be spying on his country, and marrying an Israeli is considered an act of spying.\n\nWithin Israel, Jews can not legally marry non-Jews, although such marriages are generally recognized if performed abroad. \n\nSaudi women are prohibited from marrying men other than Arab citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries without special dispensation from the King. Under Shari'a law, Saudi women, as Muslims, are not permitted under any circumstances to marry non-Muslim men.\n\nSaudi men require a government permit to marry a foreign woman and must be at least 25 years old to apply for such a permit. They may obtain a permit to take a foreign woman as a second wife only if their first wife has cancer, is disabled, or is unable to bear children. Saudi men are forbidden to marry women from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Chad and Pakistan.\n\nLaws and policies which discouraged miscegenation were issued in various dynasties, including an 836 AD decree forbidding Chinese to have relations with other peoples such as Iranians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans, and so on.\n\nAround 1500 BC, the Indian subcontinent was settled by Indo-Europeans from the north, who called themselves Aryans (Sanskrit: ' \"noble\"). The aboriginal population they encountered, the Dasa (Sanskrit: ' \"servant\"), are described in the Rigveda as dark skinned, phallus worshipping people. The Aryans instituted a rigid system of social stratification called Varna (Sanskrit: \"\" \"color, race, class\"), in which the aboriginals were relegated to the lowest rank, Shudra. The Shudra were tasked with serving the other classes, and were excluded from ritual communion. Members of the four varnas were forbidden from eating together or marrying each other. The Shudras who were relegated to the most degrading occupations, now known as the Dalit, were deemed members of a fifth varna and considered untouchable. Physical contact between them and the other varnas was completely forbidden. \n\nAfter the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, several anti-miscegenation laws were passed by the British.\n\nAfter the deterioration of relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union in the 1960s, North Korea began to enact practices such as forcing its male citizens who had married Eastern European women to divorce. \n\nAdditionally, the North Korean government has been accused of performing forced abortions on female escapees repariated from China out of fear that the father may be ethnically Chinese. \n\nIn 1723, 1724 and 1774 several administrative acts forbade interracial marriages, mainly in colonies, although it is not clear if these acts were lawful. On 2 May 1746, the Parlement de Paris validated an interracial marriage.\n\nUnder King Louis XVI, the order of the Conseil du Roi of 5 April 1778, signed by Antoine de Sartine, forbade \"whites of either sex to contract marriage with blacks, mulattos or other people of color\" in the Kingdom, as the number of blacks had increased so much in France, mostly in the capital. Nevertheless, it was an interracial marriage prohibition, not an interracial sex prohibition. Moreover, it was an administrative act, not a law. There was never any racial law about marriage in France, with the exception of French Louisiana. But some restricted rules were applied about heritage and nobility. In any case, nobles needed the King's authorization for their marriage.\n\nOn 20 September 1792, all restrictions regarding interracial marriage were repealed by the Revolutionary government. On 8 January 1803, a Napoleonic governmental circular forbade marriages between white males and black women, or black men and white women, although the 1804 Napoleonic code did not mention anything specific about interracial marriage. In 1806 a French court validated an interracial marriage. In 1818, the highest French court (\"cour de cassation\") validated a marriage contracted in New York between a white man and a colored woman. All administrative prohibitions were canceled by a law in 1833.\n\nDiscrimination against miscegenation mostly followed the mainstream Nazi anti-Semitism, which considered the Jews to be a group of people supposedly bound by close genetic (blood) ties to form a unit which one could neither join nor secede from. The influence of Jews had been declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, in order to justify the discriminations and persecutions of Jews. To be spared, one had to prove one's affiliation with the group of the Aryan race (cf. Aryan certificate).\nAlthough Nazi doctrine stressed the importance of physiognomy and genes in determining race, in practice race was determined only through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors. Individuals were considered non-Aryan (i.e. Jewish) if at least three of four of their grandparents had been enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation; it did not matter if those grandparents had been born to a Jewish family or had converted to Judaism in adulthood. The actual religious beliefs of the individual himself or herself were also immaterial, as was the individual's status under Halachic law.\n\nAn anti-miscegenation law was enacted by the National Socialist government in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws. The \"Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre\" (Protection of German Blood and German Honor Act), enacted on 15 September 1935, forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations between persons \"racially\" regarded as non-Aryans and Aryans (persons of \"German or related blood\"); this included all marriages, where at least one partner was a German citizen. \"Non-Aryans\" comprised mostly Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent. However, Germans of extra-European and especially of African descent and Germans regarded as belonging to the minority group of Sinti and Roma (Insultingly referred to as Gypsies) were also considered as non-Aryans. On the 26 November 1935, the laws were extended to \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\". Such extramarital intercourse was marked as \"Rassenschande\" (lit. \"race-disgrace\") and could be punished by imprisonment – later usually followed by the deportation to a concentration camp, often entailing the inmate's death. Germans of African and other extra-European descent were classified following their own origin or the origin of their parents. Sinti and Roma were mostly categorised following police records, e.g. mentioning them or their forefathers as Gypsies, when having been met by the police as travelling peddlers.\n\nThe existing 20,454 (as of 1939) marriages between persons \"racially\" regarded as Aryans and so-called non-Aryans – called \"mixed marriages\" () – would continue. However, the government eased the conditions for the divorce of mixed marriages. In the beginning the Nazi authorities hoped to make the Aryan partner get a divorce from their non-Aryan-classified spouses, by granting easy legal divorce procedures and opportunities for the Aryan spouse to withhold most of the common property after a divorce. Those who stuck to their spouse would suffer discriminations like dismissal from public employment, exclusion from civic society organisations, etc.\n\nAny children – whenever born – within a mixed marriage, as well as children from extramarital mixed relationships born until July 31, 1936, were discriminated against as \"Mischlinge\". However, children later born to mixed parents, not yet married at passing the Nuremberg Laws, were to be discriminated against as \"Geltungsjuden\", regardless if the parents had meanwhile married abroad or remained unmarried. Any children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation were also subject to discrimination as \"Geltungsjuden\".\n\nAccording to the Nazi family value attitude, the husband was regarded the head of a family. Thus people living in a mixed marriage were treated differently according to the sex of the Aryan spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not interfaith marriages, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due to her or his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second (marital conversion). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert. However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the German Confederation since 1847, and generally since 1875, when civil marriage became an obligatory prerequisite for any religious marriage ceremony throughout the united Germany.\n\nMost mixed marriages occurred with one spouse being considered as non-Aryan, due to his or her Jewish descent. Many special regulations were developed for such couples. A differentiation of privileged and other mixed marriages emerged on 28 December 1938, when Hermann Göring discretionarily ordered this in a letter to the \"Reich's Ministry of the Interior\". The \"Gesetz über die Mietverhältnisse mit Juden\" () of 30 April 1939, allowing proprietors to unconditionally cancel tenancy contracts with Germans classified as Jews, thus forcing them to move into houses reserved for them, for the first time enacted Göring's creation. The law defined \"privileged mixed marriages\" and exempted them from the act.\n\nThe legal definitions decreed: The marriage of a Gentile husband and his wife, being a Jewess or being classified as a Jewess due to her descent, was generally considered to be a \"privileged mixed marriage\", unless they had children, who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Then the husband was obviously not the dominant part in the family and the wife had to wear the yellow badge and the children as well, who were thus discriminated against as \"Geltungsjuden\". Without children, or with children not enrolled with a Jewish congregation, the Jewish-classified wife was spared from wearing the yellow badge (else compulsory for Germans classified as Jews as of 1 September 1941).\n\nIn the opposite case, when the wife was classified as an Aryan and the husband as a Jew, the husband had to wear the yellow badge, if they had no children or children enrolled with a Jewish congregation. In case they had common children not enrolled in a Jewish congregation (irreligionist, Christian etc.) they were discriminated as \"Mischlinge\" and their father was spared from wearing the yellow badge.\n\nSince there was no elaborate regulation, the practice of exempting \"privileged mixed marriages\" from anti-Semitic invidiousnesses varied amongst Greater Germany's different Reichsgaue. However, all discriminations enacted until December 28, 1938 remained valid without exemptions for \"privileged mixed marriages\". In the Reichsgau Hamburg, for example, Jewish-classified spouses living in \"privileged mixed marriages\" received equal food rations like Aryan-classified Germans. In many other Reichsgaue they received shortened rations. In some Reichsgaue in 1942 and 1943, privileged mixed couples, and their minor children whose father was classified as a Jew, were forced to move into houses reserved for Jews only; this effectively made a privileged mixed marriage one where the husband was the one classified as Aryan.\n\nThe inconsistent application of \"privileged mixed marriages\" led to different compulsions to forced labour in 1940: Sometimes it was ordered for all Jewish-classified spouses, sometimes for Jewish-classified husbands, sometimes exempting Jewish-classified wives taking care of minor children. No document or law indicated the exemption of a mixed marriage from some persecutions and especially of its Jewish-classified spouse. Thus if arrested, non-arrested relatives or friends had to prove their exemption status, hopefully fast enough to rescue the arrested from any deportation.\n\nSystematic deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent started on October 18, 1941. German Jews and German Gentiles of Jewish descent living in \"mixed marriage\" were in fact mostly spared from deportation. In case a mixed marriage ended by death of the Aryan spouse or divorce, the Jewish-classified spouse residing within Germany was usually deported soon after, unless the couple still had minor children not counting as Geltungsjuden.\n\nIn March 1943, an attempt to deport the Berlin-based Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent living in non-privileged mixed marriages, failed due to public protest by their relatives-in-law of Aryan kinship (see Rosenstraße protest). Also, the Aryan-classified husbands and Mischling-classified children (starting at the age of 16) from mixed marriages were taken by the Organisation Todt for forced labour, starting in autumn 1944.\n\nA last attempt, undertaken in February/March 1945 ended, because the extermination camps already were liberated. However, 2,600 from all areas of the Reich, not yet captured by the Allies, were deported to Theresienstadt, of whom most survived the last months until their liberation.\n\nWith the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the laws banning mixed marriages were lifted again. Marriage dates could be backdated, if so desired, for couples who lived together unmarried during the Nazi era due to the legal restrictions, upon marrying after the war. Even if one spouse was already dead, the marriage could be retroactively recognised, in order to legitimise any children and enable them or the surviving spouse to inherit from their late father or partner, respectively. In the West German Federal Republic of Germany 1,823 couples applied for recognition (until 1963), which was granted in 1,255 cases.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, the Ostrogoths under the Theodoric the Great established the Ostrogothic Kingdom at Ravenna, ruling Italy as a dominant minority. In order to prevent the Romanization of his people, Theodoric forbade intermarriage between Goths and Romans. Theodoric's effort to separate Goths and Romans was however not entirely successful. The Rugii, a Germanic tribe which supported Theodoric while preserving its independence within the Ostrogothic Kingdom, likewise avoided intermarriage with Goths and other tribes in order to preserve the purity of their race.\n\nAs part of the Manifesto of Race in Fascist Italy, laws prohibiting marriage between Aryans (Italians) and non-Aryans (Africans and Jews) were passed in Italy and its foreign colonies.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, the Visigoths established the Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia, ruling the peninsula as a dominant minority. The Visigoths were subjected to their own legal code, and were forbidden from intermarrying with the Romans. This law was abolished in the 6th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "24764487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24764487", "title": "Batavianization", "text": "Batavianization\n\nBatavianization or Batavianisation (see -ise vs -ize) also known as Dutchification and; historically, as Belgianization, is the spread of the Dutch language, people and/or culture either by force or assimilation. In Dutch it is known as \"vernederlandsing\" or \"neerlandisatie\".\n\nThe term \"Batavianization\", derives its name from the Batavi, a Germanic tribe living in the Netherlands, and long regarded as the mythical ancestors of the Dutch people. The term \"Dutchification\" is mostly used in English publications by Dutch authors, less so by native English-speakers. This likely has to do with the fact that \"Dutch\" isn't a Latin-derived term and hence sounds somewhat childish to some ears in combination with the (Latinate) suffix \"-fication\". As for \"Belgianization\", \"Belgae\" was the standard term in Latin to refer to the Dutch (compare the Leo Belgicus, United Belgian States and Belgic Confession for example) in the Late Middle Ages. After the establishment of Belgium, its use generally shifted to mean Belgicism.\n\nIn the Netherlands, most of the Batavianization was of a linguistic and, to a lesser extent cultural nature, and was focused on the Frisian region. Beginning at the end of the migration period, Dutch nobles sought to conquer the Frisian lands, in which they largely succeeded around the end of the High Middle Ages. The conquest was gradual and moved from the West to the East. By the time the Frisian heartland (the modern province of Friesland) was conquered, many Frisians formerly living in West Frisia had already fled and the region was subsequently colonized by Dutch settlers. In the remaining Frisian territory, a ruling Dutch upper class was instituted, the legacy of which can still be found in Stadsfries. The West Frisian language has since adopted large amounts of Dutch vocabulary, to such an extent that many objects or concepts originating after the Dutch conquest are nearly all calques or loanwords from Dutch.\n\nDespite Batavianization and the general idea that Frisians were underdeveloped and rural, Frisians never were the subject of ethnic discrimination or willful linguistic or cultural oppression.\n\nBetween the 1950s and early 1980s, primarily due to migration of rural West Frisian speakers to the non-West Frisian urban areas, and the settling of Dutch speakers from outside the province in the Frisian countryside, the percentage of inhabitants of Friesland using West Frisian as their home language dropped from 71% to 59%. The West Frisian language itself gradually dutchified as well.\n\nA 2016 Radboud University Nijmegen study by linguist Geert Driessen showed that the percentage of West Frisian speakers steadily declined between 1994 and 2014 in favour of Dutch. During those twenty years, the number of West Frisian-speaking children within families decreased from 48% to 32%, and outside families (amongst their friends) from 44% to 22%. The percentage of parents talking West Frisian amongst themselves dropped from 58% to 35%. According to Driessen, 'in two generations, there won't be much left', because people will no longer be able to read and especially write in West Frisian. The Dutch language would hang on for a few generations longer than West Frisian, but Driessen expects 'everything to switch to English.'\n\nIn Belgium, batavianization was an essential part of the political objectives of the Flemish movement, a social movement seeking acknowledgement of the Dutch language and culture. When Belgium was established in 1830, the Francophone government oppressed the Dutch populace. Dutch was banned from higher education, politics and justice in favour of French. Hence Batavianization in Belgium largely refers to the process of replacing French as the language of education in universities and as the language of culture among the elite.\n\nIn the toponymy of New Netherland, a 17th-century province in North America, Batavianization is seen in many place names based in Delaware languages.\n\nFor the concept of \"Batavianization\" in colonial North America, see:\nAlso:\n\nFor the concept of \"Batavianization\" in colonial Dutch East Indies, see:\n\n"}

Its choice of presenting itself in the form of an imaginary travelogue may have been whimsical, to tap into the fashionable travel literature of the era, popularized by Marco Polo and John Mandeville. \nIts geographical features are closely related to those of the Medici Atlas (notionally dated 1351, but probably c.1370). Also near-contemporary is the Catalan Atlas.\n\nFour manuscripts of the work are known, designated \"Z\", \"N\", \"R\" and \"S\".\n\nA manuscript copy of the \"Libro\", once owned by the 16th-century historian Jerónimo Zurita y Castro, and subsequently held by the count of San Clemente in Zaragoza, was reported lost sometime around 1680. It is believed this was the manuscript that resurfaced in London in 1978, popularly known as Manuscript \"Z\", currently held by the Bavarian State Library in Munich, as \"Cod.hisp. 150\". This manuscript, written in the late 14th century, is replete with miniature illuminations drawn by an Aragonese illustrator. \nA facsimile was published in 1999. In the introduction to that edition, editor Lacarra doubts the original c.1350 dating, and proposes instead that the \"Libro\" was probably composed a bit later, probably around 1385.\n\nManuscripts \"N\" and \"R\" are kept in the British Library.\n\nA further manuscript of the \"Libro\" was discovered in 1874 and compiled and published in 1877 in Madrid, by Marcos Jiménez de la Espada.\nThis is the most complete of the extant copies, known as Manuscript \"S\", kept in the Spanish National Library. In his introduction, the editor presented the book as an authentic travelogue of a Castilian Franciscan mendicant friar written around 1350. However, immediately upon its appearance, contemporary scholars (not without a touch of mockery at the editor) noted the travelogue was largely fantastical and imaginary, and that there was no clear indication that the author was a friar, Franciscan or otherwise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19972602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19972602", "title": "Dorset Ooser", "text": "Dorset Ooser\n\nThe Dorset Ooser () is a wooden head that featured in the 19th-century folk culture of Melbury Osmond, a village in the southwestern English county of Dorset. The head was hollow, thus perhaps serving as a mask, and included a humanoid face with horns, a beard, and a hinged jaw which allowed the mouth to open and close. Although sometimes used to scare people during practical jokes, its main recorded purpose was as part of a local variant of the charivari custom known as \"skimity riding\" or \"rough music\", in which it was used to humiliate those who were deemed to have behaved in an immoral manner.\n\nThe Dorset Ooser was first brought to public attention in 1891, at which time it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to Somerset, the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various folklorists and historians have debated the origins of the head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English Mummers plays. The folklorists Frederick Thomas Elworthy and H. S. L. Dewar believed that the head was a representation of the Devil and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist Margaret Murray suggested that it represented a pre-Christian god of fertility whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more recent scholarship has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of \"Ooser\" is also disputed, with various possibilities available.\n\nIn 1975 a replica of the original Ooser was produced by John Byfleet, which has since been on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. This mask retains a place in Dorset folk culture, being removed from the museum for use in local Morris dancing processions held by the Wessex Morris Men on both St. George's Day and May Day. The design of the Ooser has also inspired the production of copies which have been used as representations of the Horned God in the modern Pagan religion of Wicca in both the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nA wooden head, the Dorset Ooser had been cut from a single block of timber, with the exception of the lower jaw, which was movable and connected to the rest of the mask by leather hinges. The lower jaw could be moved by pulling on a string which passed through a hole in the upper jaw to connect to the lower. The mask also contained locks of hair on either side of its head, a beard on its chin, and a pair of bullock's horns. Between the Ooser's eyes was a rounded boss, the meaning of which is unknown. The Ooser was hollow, allowing someone to place their own head within it, potentially permitting it to be worn as a mask whilst being supported on the shoulders; however, there were no holes allowing for the wearer to see while wearing it in this way. The historian Ronald Hutton described the Ooser as \"a terrifying horned mask with human face, staring eyes, beard, and gnashing teeth\". Similarly, the folklorist H. S. L. Dewar stated that \"the expression of the eyes [conveyed] a really agonized spirit of hatred, terror, and despair\".\n\nThe term \"Ooser\" was pronounced with a short, quick \"s\" by villagers as \"Osser\". It is unclear if the head itself was the Ooser, or whether it instead was designed as a depiction of an entity called the Ooser. Dewar suggested the possibility that it might have been connected to the term \"Wurse\", used for the Devil in Layamon's \"Brut\", or to the 17th-century Italian term \"Oser\", again used for the Devil. Alternately, he suggested that it might be a derivative of \"Guisard\" or \"Guiser\", two old terms for a mummer. Hutton instead proposed that \"Osser\" possibly derived from \"Wooset\", a term used in the dialect around Wiltshire to refer to a pole upon which a horse's skull with deer's horns was affixed. This Wooset was recorded as having been paraded by youths in the Marlborough district until the 1830s, where it was used to mock neighbours whose partners were suspected of marital infidelity, the horns being a traditional sign of cuckoldry. Similar traditions have been recorded in Wiltshire and Somerset, where they can be traced back to at least the early 17th century.\n\nThe first public mention of the Dorset Ooser was in an 1891 edition of \"Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries\", where it was the subject of an article by the journal's editor, Charles Herbert May. The head was, at the time, in the possession of Thos Cave of Holt Farm in Melbury Osmond; the editor noted that it had been owned by Cave's family from \"time out of mind\". Cave had stated that it had formerly been kept in an \"old malt-house\" in the village, \"where it was an object of terror to children who ventured to intrude upon the premises\". May noted that it was \"possibly the only example now in existence, or at any rate from one of the very few which may still survive in the County\", adding that Cave was \"willing to dispose of this mask to a lover of objects of antiquarian interest\".\n\nAt some point before 1897, another member of the family, the doctor Edward Cave, left Holt Farm and moved to Crewkerne in Somerset, taking the Ooser with him. In 1897, he relocated to Bath, leaving the Ooser with his family coachman; when Edward Cave subsequently tried to recover the head, he was informed that it had been \"disposed of\", with some suggestion that it had found its way to the United States. In 1935, a folklore collector named S. A. Ramsden undertook enquiries into the fate of the head at the prompting of the Egyptologist and folklorist Margaret Murray. His enquiries led him to meet with Cave's coachman, Lawrence, who – after Cave left Crewkerne – had subsequently served as the coachman for Cave's replacement, a doctor by the name of Webber. Lawrence said that Cave left the head in his house in the village, where it was hung up in a loft and began to fall apart; Lawrence recalled wearing it to frighten people during a parade around 1900, at which time the hair was falling out. He said that the house was later pulled down, with the head probably still inside it, in order for a local post office to be constructed in its place.\n\nIn \"Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries\", May noted that \"no recollection of its ever being made use of is retained\", although thought that \"it may plausibly be conjectured\" that the Ooser was used in \"village revels, and at similar times of rustic entertainment\". The following year, a Dorchester-based writer, H. J. Moule, published a note in the same journal relating that their childhood nurse, who was from the village of Cerne Abbas, had talked about the head, and had referred to it as the \"Wurser\". Moule added that it was \"surely\" used in Mummers plays performed at Christmas time.\nDewar, after subsequent research, reported the recollections of K. G. Knight—a member of the Melbury Estate staff—that inhabitants of Melbury Osmond associated the head with a folk custom known as \"Skimity Riding\" or \"Rough Music\". In this custom, someone accused of \"husband-beating, scolding, sexual unfaithfulness or irregularity, and cuckoldry\" were made to ride on a donkey or horse, facing the direction of the animal's tail, while the assembled crowd made much noise by beating frying pans, kettles, bull's horns, and bones. In Melbury Osmond, the Ooser was brought out into the crowd at such an occasion. Similar forms of \"mob-punishment\" were recorded in parts of neighbouring Devon, where the act was termed \"Skimmety Riding\", \"Skimmington\", and \"Skivetton\". As he deemed it too heavy to be carried or worn by an individual, the historian of folklore Peter Robson later suggested that the Ooser might originally have been mounted in a carnival procession.\n\nDewar also recorded the villagers' claims that the Ooser was brought to the door of a tallet in order to scare the local children, and that it was also used to scare adults on some occasions. Knight came across the claim that it was once used to frighten a stable hand, who jumped through a window to escape it, and in doing so \"so injured himself that his life was despaired of\". Dewar further drew comparisons with the horned masks sometimes worn during Mummers plays. He noted that in a case of a group of Christmas Wassailers at Kingscote, Gloucestershire, a man was \"dressed in a sack, his head in a real bull's face, head and horns complete\". Another case highlighted by Dewar was taken from an account provided by G. W. Greening of Dorchester, in which a member of the Bradstock Mummers was dressed as Beelzebub. Given these similarities, Dewar ultimately suggested that the Ooser was \"likely enough an off-shoot from the 14th century and later Mummers' plays\". The antiquary Frederick Thomas Elworthy expressed the view that the Dorset Ooser was \"the probable head\" of a hobby horse. The folklorist E. C. Cawte, in his in-depth study of the hobby horse tradition in English folk culture, stated that although both entailed dressing up in an animalistic costume, the Ooser had no clear connection with this tradition.\n\nElworthy suggested that the Ooser was a depiction of the Devil, an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was \"intended to inspire terror in the minds of the foolish and the wicked\". Conversely, others have suggested that it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book \"The God of the Witches\", Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the witch-cult hypothesis—the idea that those persecuted in the Early Modern witch trials were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's Horned God. Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians Jeffrey B. Russell and Brooks Alexander have stated that \"today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong [regarding the existence of the witch-cult] – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises\". The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the \"Reader's Digest\" encyclopedia of British folklore, \"Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain\", where it was described as \"the idol of a former god of fertility\". Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar suggested that the imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of \"phallic or fertility worship\".\n\nIn 1975 the local Morris dancer John Byfleet made a replica of the original Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife. This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on May Day and St. George's Day, when it is used by the Wessex Morris Men as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from \"The Guardian\" reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop Giant Hill near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.\n\nMurray's interpretation of the Ooser was embraced by Doreen Valiente, an earlier practitioner of the modern Pagan religion of Wicca, who stated that the mask \"is certainly connected with the Old Religion [i.e. the witch-cult], and that from a long way back\". The Gardnerian Wiccan Melissa Seims suggested that the iconography of the Ooser was an influence on the design of the Head of Atho, a statue of the Wiccan Horned God created by Raymond Howard in mid-20th century England. Wiccans in the Minnesota area of the United States make use of a head with stag antlers that they term the Minnesota Ooser. Representing the religion's Horned God, it is kept on an altar and brought out for use in Sabbat rituals.\n\n"}

It started in 2006 as Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index (HVRI) and was modified and renamed in January 2018. The site provides a ranking of the 199 passports of the world according to the number of countries their holders can travel to visa-free. The number of countries that a specific passport can access becomes its visa-free 'score'. In collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and based on official data from their global database Henley & Partners has analysed the visa regulations of all the countries and territories in the world since 2006.\n\nThe HPI consists of a ranking of passports according to how many other territories can be reached 'visa-free' (defined below). All distinct destination countries and territories in the IATA database are considered. However, since not all territories issue passports, there are far fewer passports to be ranked than destinations against which queries are made.\n\nTo determine the score for each country or territory, the IATA database is queried in the following way:\n\n1. Each of the 199 passports for which the score is to be determined, is checked against every one of the 227 possible travel destinations for which travel restriction information exists in the IATA database. These interrogations continue throughout the year so scores will continuously change.\n\n2. Each query is made with the following conditions:\n\n3. Further conditions include:\n\nIt is assumed that the visa policies of Greenland and the Faroe Islands are identical to Denmark.\n\n4. If no visa is required for passport holders from a particular country or territory to enter the destination, then that passport scores 1. [The passport also scores 1 if a visa on arrival, a visitor's permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) can be obtained because they do not require pre-departure government approval, perhaps because of specific visa-waiver programs in place.]\n\n5. Where visas are needed, or where passport holders have to get government-approved electronic visas (e-Visas) before departure, a score of 0 is given. If passport holders must get government approval before leaving in order to obtain a visa on arrival, this also scores 0.\n\n6. The total score for a particular passport is then assigned according to the conditions defined above.\n\nOffering its citizens visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to a record total of 189 destinations, Japan takes the top spot in the Henley Passport Index. Germany and Singapore come in joint second place while third place is shared by seven countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan have once again been labelled by the index as the worst passports in the world. However, there are several other countries not included in the Henley Passport Index that offer even less travel freedom; these are mostly unrecognised countries such as Somaliland.\n\nEuropean countries are notable for their stability over the past decade, and Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Sweden all remain in exactly the same position as 10 years before. The 'Top 10s' were almost identical, with 30 countries in 2015, compared to 26 a decade before. While Liechtenstein dropped, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Malta, Slovakia and South Korea all made it into the top 10.\n\nTaiwan, Albania, the United Arab Emirates, Bosnia and Serbia all moved up more than 20 places in the Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index over the period, while the biggest drops were experienced by Guinea (−32), Liberia (−33), Sierra Leone (−35) and Bolivia (−37).\n\n"}

It features culinary tips on preparation and saving time, and sold 300,000 copies in Britain. It was praised by critics as a valuable guide to cooking.\n\nThe book begins with Lawson's preface, which states plainly \"I am not a chef\", and that she is not interested in \"strenuous originality\". She states that her goal, rather, is \"to make you feel that I'm there with you\".\n\nThe book is divided into themed chapters, such as cooking for \"One or Two\". Most of each chapter consists of recipes, but the chapters begin with a few pages of general advice on the theme, such as that while cooking for one may feel \"onanistic\", \"it might be a good thing to consider yourself worth cooking for.\"\n\nEach recipe is headed with its name, generally in English, though with foreign words as needed, as \"Pea Soufflé\". A recipe like \"Scallops and Bacon\" then begins with a paragraph of advice on its suitability, in this case stressing that the dish strikes\n\nfollowed by a paragraph about marketing, how to buy and store the ingredients.\n\nThe ingredients and quantities are tabulated in red boldface type. The recipe itself is given as a paragraph of instructions in light type.\n\nThe techniques used are not rigidly traditional: in her recipe for Ratatouille, introduced to Britain by Elizabeth David, Lawson admits that she is departing from David's prescriptions, but states that this does not seem to make much difference as she does not get a \"soggy mush\" by skipping the hour spent salting the aubergine and courgettes, but she explains the David method in an aside, just in case anyone want to try it.\n\nPage numbers refer to the first edition.\n\n\nIn her chapter \"Consuming Nigella\" in \"Feminism, Domesticity and Popular Culture\", Lise Shapiro Sanders observes that Lawson's early books including \"How to Eat\" and \"How to Be a Domestic Goddess\" (2001) \"emphasize cooking and eating as sites of pleasure for women.\" Sanders explains that the pleasure is both \"authentic\" and \"ironic, self-consciously reworking a mid-twentieth-century ideology of domestic femininity.\" In particular, baking gives Lawson \"access to a fantasy of femininity that, instead of dooming women to lives of 'domestic drudgery', enables the performance of a 'weekend alter ego winning adoring glances and endless approbation from anyone who has the good fortune to eat in her kitchen'\". Sanders notes Lawson's disclaimer in her preface that \"I have nothing to declare but my greed (page xv)\". She interprets Lawson as meaning to remind readers of \"the joys of giving in to temptation\". She notes from a passage by Simon Hoggart in \"The Spectator\" (about \"Nigella Bites\") that Lawson \"becomes an object of desire, ready-made for the consumption of the heterosexual male audience\", complete with double entendres and sexually suggestive language, both of which Sanders calls trademarks of Lawson's style.\n\n\"The Sunday Telegraph\" called the book \"the most valuable culinary guide published this decade.\"\n\nTony Buchsbaum, writing in the \"January Magazine\", calls \"How to Eat\" \"almost biblical, with countless recipes for just about anything one could name. It was all black ink on white pages, hardly the luxuriously art-directed volumes that would follow: How To Be a Domestic Goddess, Nigella Bites, Forever Summer...\"\n\n"}

The book was written by Jayne Rockmill and photography was provided by Ben Fink. Broken down into eight sections, the book covered how to make homemade bacon and moves onto \"brunch\" and \"small bites\" before covering soups, salads and sides, pasta, fish, meat, and desserts. \"I Love Bacon!\" was published in October 2010 by Andrews McMeel Publishing and met with favorable reviews for its unique dishes and helpful culinary tips for novices.\n\nThe book's author, Jayne Rockmill, is a literary agent based in New York City whose clients include Tony Caputo, François Halard, and the professional photographer and storm chaser, Jim Reed. Rockmill had also become involved in producing charity food and wine events, and is a longtime supporter of the New York City Food Bank and Share Our Strength, which focuses on ending childhood hunger. She conceived the book as a way to help raise money for their work, and a portion of the proceeds from \"I Love Bacon\" will be donated to the two charities. Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes, and then contacted others across the United States. In some cases, she adapted the original recipes in collaboration with the chefs.\n\nThe book's illustrator is the well-known food photographer, Ben Fink, whose photographs appear in \"Food & Wine\", \"Bon Appétit\", \"Saveur\" and publications of the Culinary Institute of America. A native of Memphis, Tennessee now based in New York, Fink illustrated Jacques Pépin's, \"Fast Food My Way\" (2004) and Maggie Glezer's \"Artisan Baking Across America\" (2000) for which he won a James Beard Foundation Award in 2001. Some of Fink's more unusual food photographs are those for Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge's 1997 \"InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook\", where the food is photographed against the background of a naked human body.\n\n\"I Love Bacon!\" contains over 50 recipes from celebrity chefs including Cat Cora, John Besh, Ming Tsai, and Chris Cosentino, as well as brief biographies of the chefs themselves. It presents basic bacon recipes as well as dishes with bacon as one of the chief ingredients. The recipes are grouped into eight sections beginning with \"Make Your Own Bacon\" which has recipes for \"Classic Cured Bacon\", \"Spicy Braised Bacon\", \"Soy-Ginger Braised Bacon\", \"Crispy Pork Belly\", and \"Chinese Style Pork Belly\". The remaining seven sections (\"Brunch\"; \"Small Bites\"; \"Soups, Salads and Sides\", \"Pasta\", \"Fish\", \" Meat\" and \"Desserts\") contain recipes for dishes using bacon as one of the main ingredients.\n\nThe \"Brunch\" section begins with a recipe from Seattle-based Black Rock Spirits for \"Bakon Bloody Mary\", a variant on the traditional Bloody Mary cocktail using bacon infused vodka with the glass rim dipped in lime juice and finely crumbled grilled bacon. Although the majority of recipes in this section feature bacon with its traditional brunch partner, eggs, there is also a recipe for \"Mediterranean BLTs\". This version of the classic BLT sandwich pairs the bacon, lettuce and tomato with toasted focaccia bread and red-pepper aioli in place of mayonnaise. Another version of the BLT using toasted brioche and sun-dried tomatoes cut into mini-sandwiches appears in the \"Small Bites\" section which is devoted to bacon-based hors d'oeuvres.\n\nAmong the recipes in \"Soups, Salads and Sides\" are \"Egg Chowder with Bacon and New Potatoes\", \"Grilled Bacon and Cucumber Salad with Chili Caramel Dressing\", and \"Spicy Braised Bacon with Spagna Beans and Treviso Radicchio\" which uses thickly sliced pork belly bacon. The \"Pasta\" section has a recipe for \"Bacon Mac and Cheese\" from Julie Taras Wallach, the chef and co-owner of the Tipsy Parson and Little Giant restaurants in New York City. Her variant on the traditional macaroni and cheese uses cavatelli pasta seasoned with dijon mustard, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and nutmeg and incorporates sauteed onion and pieces of grilled bacon. One of the recipes in the \"Meat\" section, \"Veal and Foie Gras Meatloaf Wrapped in Bacon\", comes from Mark Allen, who in 1997 became the youngest chef, and the first American, to have headed The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Allen also contributed a recipe for the \"Fish\" section, \"Whole Roasted Branzino with Carrots and Bacon\".

Among the recipes in the \"Desserts\" section are \"Bacon Panna Cotta with Huckleberries\", \"Cane Sugar and Bacon-Iced Cupcakes\", and Cat Cora's \"Pig Candy Ice Cream\". Cora's recipe uses a pound (.454 kilograms) of chopped applewood-smoked bacon per quart (.946 litres) of brown sugar-sweetened vanilla ice cream.\n\nCarol Johnson writing in the \"Kansas City Star\" described \"I Love Bacon!\" as both a cookbook with \"inventive\" recipes and \"a mini-course in some of the country's top restaurants.\" Johnson noted that not all recipes were for beginners, but found the accompanying notes for many of the recipes with information about techniques and ingredients to be helpful. She described Ben Fink's photography as \"vivid and mouth-watering, if a little spare.\" The Republic of Bacon website favorably reviewed the cookbook for its ability to go beyond the standard classic cured bacon dishes and the added biographies of the leading industry chefs which contributed recipes to the book.\n\n"}

They are widely considered a terrorist organization.\n\nJCAG conducted an international campaign of attacks against Turkish representatives and interests, primarily in Europe and North America, killing numerous attachés of the Turkish government. It has been described as a terrorist organization. JCAG's stated reason for these attacks was the establishment of an independent Armenia in historical Armenian areas, and the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Turkey. \n\nBy 1983, JCAG is generally thought to have transformed into the Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA) as either a renaming or continuation, with communiques and military activities claimed under that name until 1985. The organization committed a single attack in 1986 under the name Greek-Bulgarian-Armenian Front, and is believed to have unofficially dissolved the following year.\n\nJustice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) and the following Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA) are generally thought to be the military branch of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), a left-wing Armenian nationalist and Pan-Armenian political party established in the 19th century, which at the time of sought the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union. The ARF was instrumental in the creation of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918, which existed for two years until it was annexed by the Soviet Union, the successor state of the Russian Empire which had previously ruled eastern Armenia. After the Soviets came to power, the ARF leadership was exiled, where the organization maintained its existence internationally through the Armenian diaspora.\n\nThe existence of JCAG was discovered in May 1976, when a member was killed by his own bomb in the headquarters of ARF in Paris. It was confirmed when French political scientist Gaïdz Minassian was allowed to consult the archives of ARF for his doctoral thesis. In several occasions, the official newspapers of ARF in the United States, France and Lebanon justified the \"armed struggle\" and published official communiqués of JCAG. The party had used terrorism many times, both against the Ottoman Empire and Armenians opposed to the ARF, the most famous being Bedros Kapamciyan, mayor of Van, assassinated in December 1912, and archbishop Leon Tourian, assassinated in New York City on December 24, 1933.\n\nThe legal branches of the ARF fundraised to pay the lawyer costs of arrested JCAG members, the most famous case being Harry Sassounian, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for the assassination of the Turkish general consul in Los Angeles. According to Dashnak newspaper \"Asbarez\" (October 15, 1983), several dozens of thousands of Armenians (ARF sympathisers and militants) participated to the Sassounian solidarity groups. French ARF organized a demonstration in front of US consulate in Lyon, in protestation against Sassounian's arrest. The ARF also supported Harutyun Krikor Levonian and Alexander Elbekyan, who were sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for the assassination of Galip Balkar, Turkish ambassador to Yugoslavia, in Belgrade, and Max Hraïr Kilndjian, sentenced to two years imprisonment as an accessory in the attempted murder of the Turkish ambassador to Switzerland.\n\nIn 1982, an attempt to bomb the building of Turkish consulate in Philadelphia was stopped by the FBI. The leader of the group and now the main leader of ARF in the United States, Vicken Hovsepian, was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, a sentence confirmed in appeal. In January 2001, another leader of the American ARF, Mourad Topalian, was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment for illegal storing of weapons and explosives for JCAG. JCAG's activities were concentrated in European and North American countries, targeting Turkish interests, mainly the assassination of Turkish diplomats.\n\nIn 1983, the JCAG took the name of \"Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA)\", and like before, ARF-affiliated press published ARA communiqués as well as articles supporting its aims.\n\nEvery year the ARF organizes international ceremonies in honor of the five ARA members who attacked the Turkish embassy in Portugal, especially in Glendale, Los Angeles, in New Jersey, Beirut, Paris and Décines-Charpieu. After three ARA perpetrators of attack against Turkish embassy in Ottawa were sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 25 years, ARF attacked the verdict.\n\nUnder the name of \"Greek-Bulgarian-Armenian Front\", the JCAG perpetrated two attacks in Australia: the bombing of Melbourne's Turkish consulate, for which ARF member Levon Demirian was sentenced and served 10 years in prison, and the bombing of a mail sorting facility in Brisbane, on January 19, 1987.\n\nJCAG are widely considered a terrorist organization.\n\n25 total dead\n\n\n"}

These ancient documents adhere to the current definition, and have been designated National Treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into effect on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, a special body of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, based on their \"especially high historical or artistic value\". \"Ancient documents\" is one of thirteen categories of National Treasures recognized by the agency. The list presents 62 documents or sets of documents from classical to early modern Japan, from the Asuka period to the Meiji period. The actual number of items is more than 62 because groups of related objects have been combined into single entries. The list contains items of various type such as letters, diaries, records or catalogues, certificates, imperial decrees, testaments and maps. The documents record early Japanese government and Buddhism including early Japanese contact with China, the organization of the state and life at the Japanese imperial court. They are housed in 14 Japanese cities in temples (35), museums (13), libraries or archives (6), shrines (4), universities (2) and in private collections (2). Most entries (28) in the list are located in Kyoto. The documents in this list were made predominantly with a writing brush on paper and, in many cases, present important examples of calligraphy.\n\nWriting was physically introduced to Japan from China in the form of inscribed artefacts at the beginning of the Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as archaeological National Treasures, include coins of the reign of Wang Mang (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound, the Seven-Branched Sword with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century. All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have been mistaken for decorations by the Japanese. When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.\n\nThe concept of writing came to Japan from the Korean kingdom of Baekje in the form of classical Chinese books likely written on paper and in the form of manuscript rolls (\"kansubon\"). This probably happened at the beginning of the 5th century (around 400), and certainly during the 6th century. According to legend the scholar Wani introduced the Chinese writing system as well as Confucianism to Japan. The oldest texts of Japanese origin, which show a clear understanding of the concept of writing, date to the 5th century and are—like most texts from before 700—inscriptions on stone or metal.\nExamples include three archaeological National Treasures: Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror from about the 5th century, which is a poor copy of a Chinese original, the Inariyama Sword from 471 or 531 and the Eta Funayama burial mound sword from about the 5th century. The abrupt transition from an unfamiliarity with writing to reading and writing complicated works in a foreign language required the earliest Japanese texts be composed and read by people from the continent such as Wani. The Inariyama Sword is also the oldest example of man'yōgana use, a writing system that employs Chinese characters to represent the Japanese language. Soon after the introduction of writing, scribes were appointed to the provinces to \"record events and report conditions\".\n\nWhile writing in Japan was limited during the 5th and 6th centuries, the number of documents written locally increased in the 7th century; though most of them have been lost. By the end of the 7th century increased cultural dependence on China caused reading and writing, particularly in government and religion, to become an integral part of Japanese life. There were two major factors for this development: starting with the Taika Reforms (645–649) and continuing with the Asuka Kiyomihara Code (689) and censuses from 670 and 690, a Chinese style centralised state was formed, requiring the need for a large number of officials who were literate and educated in, among others, Confucian texts at the \"Daigakuryo\" (\"University\") founded under Emperor Tenchi. The second factor was the increasing popularity of Buddhism, which had been introduced to Japan in the mid-6th century and strongly promoted by Prince Shōtoku (574–622). The Sangyō Gisho (\"Annotated Commentaries on the Three Sutras\"), traditionally attributed to Prince Shōtoku, is the oldest extant Japanese text of any length. Buddhism required the study of sutras written in Chinese and the state founded a Sutra Copying Bureau (\"shakyōjo\") before 727. The oldest Japanese books are two chronicles, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, from the early 8th century. While the phonogram orthography enjoyed increasing popularity during the 8th century, it was not yet used for longer prose. The modern kana, notably hiragana and katakana were developed in the Heian period.\n\nAlmost half of all entries in the list are located in Kyoto.\n\nThe table's columns (except for \"Content\" and \"Images\") are sortable pressing the arrows symbols. The following gives an overview of what is included in the table and how the sorting works.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1425928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1425928", "title": "Lost 116 pages", "text": "Lost 116 pages\n\nThe \"lost 116 pages\" were the original manuscript pages of what Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said was the translation of the Book of Lehi, the first portion of the golden plates revealed to him by an angel in 1827. These pages, which had not been copied, were lost by Smith's scribe, Martin Harris, during the summer of 1828 and are presumed to have been destroyed. Smith completed the Book of Mormon without retranslating the Book of Lehi, replacing it with what he said was an abridgment taken from the Plates of Nephi.\n\nJoseph Smith said that on September 22, 1827, he had recovered a set of buried golden plates in a prominent hill near his parents' farm in Manchester, New York. Martin Harris, a respectable but superstitious farmer from nearby Palmyra, became an early believer and gave Smith $50 to finance the translation of the plates. Lucy Harris, Martin's wife, also donated some of her own money and offered to give more, even though Smith denied her request to see the plates and told her that \"in relation to assistance, I always prefer dealing with men rather than their wives.\" (citation and bibliography are in conflict)\n\nSmith and his wife, Emma, moved to her hometown of Harmony, Pennsylvania, in late October 1827, where he began transcribing the writing on the plates. When Harris left Palmyra to visit Smith without taking his wife along, she became suspicious that Smith intended to defraud her and her husband.\n\nWhen Harris returned, Lucy refused to share his bed, and she had a suitor of her daughter surreptitiously copy the characters on the Anthon transcript that Smith had given to Harris. Lucy then accompanied her husband back to Harmony in April 1828, when Martin agreed to serve as Smith's scribe. Before returning home after two weeks, Lucy searched the Smith house and grounds for the plates but was unable to locate them. Smith said he did not need their physical presence to create the transcription and that they were hidden in a nearby woods.\n\nFrom April to June 1828, Harris acted as Smith's scribe as Smith dictated the manuscript using the Urim and Thummim and seer stones. By the middle of June, Smith had dictated about 116 manuscript pages of text.\n\nHarris continued to have doubts about the authenticity of the manuscript, and he \"could not forget his wife's skepticism or the hostile queries of Palmyra's tavern crowd.\" Smith's mother, Lucy, \"said that Harris asked Joseph for a look at the plates, for 'a further witness of their actual existence and that he might be better able to give a reason for the hope that was within him.' When that request was denied, he asked about the manuscript. Could he at least take it home to reassure his wife?\" After denying his request twice, Smith, with a great deal of uneasiness, said that the Lord had given permission, and he allowed Harris to take the manuscript pages back to Palmyra on condition that he show them to only five named family members. He even made Harris bind himself in a solemn oath.\n\nWhen Harris returned home, he showed the manuscript to his wife, who allowed him to lock them in her bureau. Harris then showed the pages not only to the named relatives but \"to any friend who came along.\" On one occasion Harris picked the lock of the bureau and damaged it, irritating his wife. The manuscript then disappeared.\n\nShortly after Harris left Harmony, Smith's wife gave birth to Smith's firstborn son, who was \"very much deformed\" and died less than a day after delivery. Emma Smith nearly died herself, and Smith tended her for two weeks. As she slowly gained strength, Smith left her in the care of her mother and went back to Palmyra in search of Harris and the manuscript.\n\nThe following day Harris was dragged into the Smith family home in distress and without the pages. Smith urged Harris to search his house again, but Harris told him he had already ripped open beds and pillows. Smith moaned, \"Oh, my God! ... All is lost! all is lost! What shall I do? I have sinned—it is I who tempted the wrath of God\".\n\nAfter returning to Harmony without Harris, Smith dictated to Emma his first written revelation, which both rebuked Smith and denounced Harris as \"a wicked man.\" Nevertheless, the revelation assured Smith that if he was penitent, the interpreters would be returned to him during his annual visit with Moroni on September 22, 1828, and he would regain his ability to translate.\n\nBetween the loss of the pages during the summer of 1828 and the rapid completion of the Book of Mormon in the spring of 1829, there was a period of quiescence as if Smith were waiting \"for help or direction.\" In April 1829, Smith was joined by Oliver Cowdery, a fellow Vermonter and a distant relation who replaced Harris as scribe. The pace of the transcription increased so dramatically that, within two months, nearly the entire remainder of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon was completed.\n\nAccording to Smith, he did not retranslate the material that Harris had lost because he said that if he did, evil men would alter the manuscript in an effort to discredit him. Smith said that instead, he had been divinely ordered to replace the lost material with Nephi's account of the same events. (Nevertheless, \"evil men\" might also have altered the lost manuscript to contradict the new account as well, as is evidenced by Mark Hofmann's supposed desire to do so.) When Smith reached the end of the book, he was told that God had foreseen the loss of the early manuscript and had prepared the same history in an abridged format that emphasized religious history, the Small Plates of Nephi. Smith transcribed this portion, and it appears as the first part of the book. When published in 1830, the Book of Mormon contained a statement about the lost 116 pages, as well as the Testimony of Three Witnesses and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses, who claimed to have seen and handled the golden plates.\n\nThe loss of the manuscript provided opponents of Mormonism, such as the 19th-century clergyman M. T. Lamb, with additional reasons to dismiss the religion as a fraud. Fawn Brodie has written that Smith \"realized that it was impossible for him to reproduce the story exactly, and that to redictate it would be to invite devastating comparisons. Harris's wife taunted him: 'If this be a divine communication, the same being who revealed it to you can easily replace it.'\" Ex-Mormons Jerald and Sandra Tanner argued that the lost manuscript suggested that Smith was not a misguided individual who believed in his own creative imagination but was at least minimally aware of his own deception.\n\nAccording to Jeffrey R. Holland, an apostle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), \"it was not tit for tat, this for that—you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so. We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so.\"\n\nMartin Harris was permitted by Smith to be one of the Three Witnesses. He mortgaged his farm for $3000 as security in the event that the Book of Mormon did not sell, and when in fact, it did not, he lost both his farm and his wife. He later disavowed Joseph Smith, left the church, joined several different varieties of early Mormon-related congregations, then at 87 joined the LDS Church and recanted what he'd earlier said about Smith. He never disavowed the gold plates, however. On his death bed, Harris said: \"The Book of Mormon is no fake. I know what I know. I have seen what I have seen and I have heard what I have heard. I have seen the gold plates from which the Book of Mormon is written. An angel appeared to me and others and testified to the truthfulness of the record, and had I been willing to have perjured myself and sworn falsely to the testimony I now bear I could have been a rich man, but I could not have testified other than I have done and am now doing for these things are true.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9131419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9131419", "title": "Nachzehrer", "text": "Nachzehrer\n\nA nachzehrer is a sort of German vampire. Nachzehrer translates \"after (\"nach\") living off (\"zehren\")\" likely alluding to their living after death or living off humans after death in addition to the choice of \"nach\" for \"after\" which is similar to \"nacht\" (\"night\"). The nachzehrer was prominent in the folklore of the northern regions of Germany, but even in Silesia and Bavaria, and the word was also used to describe a similar creature of the Kashubes of Northern Poland.\n\nA Nachzehrer is created most commonly after suicide, and sometimes from an accidental death. According to German lore, a person does not become a nachzehrer from being bitten or scratched; the transformation happens after death and is not communicable. Nachzehrers are also related to sickness and disease. If a large group of people died of the plague, the first person to have died is believed to be a nachzehrer.\n\nTypically, a nachzehrer devours its family members upon waking. It has also been said that they devour their own bodies, including their funeral shrouds, and the more of themselves they eat, the more of their family they physically drain. It is not unlikely that the idea of the dead eating themselves might have risen from bodies in open graves who had been partly eaten by scavengers like rats. \n\nThe nachzehrer was similar to the Slavic vampire in that it was known to be a recently deceased person who returned from the grave to attack family and village acquaintances. \n\nIt usually originated from an unusual death such as a person who died by suicide or accident. They were also associated with epidemic sickness, such as whenever a group of people died from the same disease, the person who died first was labeled to be the cause of the group's death. Another belief was that if a person's name was not removed from his burial clothing, that person would be a candidate for becoming a nachzehrer.\n\nSuch a belief was found even in the Republic of Venice, where the body of a woman, with a brick in her mouth, was recently discovered in a mass grave of plague-dead people.\n\nThe official killing myth says you can kill a nachzehrer by placing a coin in its mouth, and then chopping off its head. It can be discerned from this that a mere coin in the mouth may result in paralysis as some myths say that a stake through a vampires heart does. \n\nFinding nachzehrer in order to kill them is not difficult; it is characteristic of a nachzehrer to lie in its grave with its thumb in its opposite hand, and its left eye open. Additionally, they are easily found while eating their burial shroud due to the volume they produce in this act. \n\n"}

It is a phenomenon during which a person feels a presence of a supernatural malevolent being which immobilizes the person as if sitting on his/her chest or the foot of his/her bed. The word \"night-mare\" or \"nightmare\" was used to describe this phenomenon before the word acquired its modern, more general meaning. Various cultures have various names for this phenomenon and/or supernatural character.\n\nThe original definition of sleep paralysis was codified by Samuel Johnson in his \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" as \"nightmare\", a term that evolved into our modern definition. Such sleep paralysis was widely considered the work of demons, and more specifically incubi, which were thought to sit on the chests of sleepers. In Old English the name for these beings was \"mare\" or \"mære\" (from a proto-Germanic \"*marōn\", cf. Old Norse \"mara\"), hence comes the \"mare\" part in \"nightmare\".

It is the largest of the three halls of the Inner Court (the other two being the Hall of Union and the Palace of Earthly Tranquility), located at the northern end of the Forbidden City. During the Qing dynasty, the palace often served as the Emperor's audience hall, where he held council with the Grand Council. \n\nThe Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the Gate of Heavenly Purity to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. The large space was divided into nine rooms on two levels, with 27 beds. For security, on any one night the Emperor would randomly choose from any of these beds. This continued through the early Qing dynasty. However, when the Yongzheng Emperor ascended to the throne, he did not wish to inhabit the palace occupied by his father for 60 years. He and subsequent emperors lived instead at the smaller Hall of Mental Cultivation to the west. The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall, where he held court, received ministers and emissaries, and held banquets. At the centre of the Palace, set atop an elaborate platform, is a throne and a desk, on which the Emperor wrote notes and signed documents during councils with ministers. A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. \n\nAbove the throne hangs a tablet with a right-to-left script reading \"zhèng dà guāng míng\" (), penned by the Shunzhi Emperor. This tablet has been translated several ways but the loose transliteral meaning is \"let the righteous shine\". It is often used as a Chinese idiom, meaning \"to be decent, honest and magnanimous,\" or \"to have no secret or do a shameless deed.\" Beginning with the Yongzheng Emperor, who himself had ascended to the throne amid a succession dispute, Qing dynasty emperors had designated their heirs in secret, with one copy of the will hidden behind this tablet and another carried at all times by the Emperor himself.\n"}

He lectured for a time at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario in science and applied chemistry. Bryce served as the first secretary of the Ontario Board of Health from 1882 to 1904, when he was appointed the Chief Medical Officer of the federal Department of Immigration.\n\nBryce was hired by Indian Affairs Department in Ottawa to report on the health conditions of the Canadian residential school system in western Canada and British Columbia. His report was never released by the government but was published by Bryce in 1922 under the title \"The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921\".\n\nBryce claimed that Indigenous children enrolled in residential schools were deprived of adequate medical attention and sanitary living conditions. He suggested improvements to national policies regarding the care and education of Indigenous peoples. In a 1907 report Bryce cited an average mortality rate of between 14% and 24% at the schools and a shocking 42% infant mortality rate on the reserves, this due to sick children being sent home to die. Bryce noted that the lack of certainty about the exact number of deaths was, in part, due to the official reports submitted by school principals and \"defective way in which the returns had been made.\"\n\nHe appealed his forced retirement from the Civil Service in 1921 and was denied, subsequently publishing his suppressed report condemning the treatment of the Indigenous at the hands of the BNA.\n\nBryce died on January 15, 1932 while travelling in the West Indies. He is buried at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "964057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=964057", "title": "The Fabulous Moolah", "text": "The Fabulous Moolah\n\nMary Lillian Ellison (July 22, 1923 – November 2, 2007) was an American professional wrestler, better known by her ring name The Fabulous Moolah. She began her career working with promoter Billy Wolfe and his wife, wrestler and trainer Mildred Burke, as well as working alongside professional wrestler \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers. She won the NWA World Women's Championship in 1956 and was the most prominent holder of the title for 28 years.\n\nIn the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) as part of the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection storyline, feuding with Cyndi Lauper and Wendi Richter, the latter of whom defeated her for the WWF Women's Championship\n\nIn the 1990s, she returned to the WWF in a comedic role with longtime friend Mae Young. Ellison became the first woman to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, when she was inducted with the class of 1995 and became the oldest champion in the history of professional wrestling when she won the WWF Women's Championship at age 76, in 1999. In 2010, WWE recognized her as the 43rd best wrestler ever.\n\nMary Lillian Ellison was born in 1923 in Kershaw County, South Carolina, and grew up in Tookiedoo, 12 miles from Columbia. The youngest of five children, Ellison was the only daughter of a part Cherokee father and an Irish mother. Her parents owned a farm, a grocery store, and a service station.\n\nWhen her mother died of cancer, eight-year-old Ellison went to live with her paternal grandmother and worked on her cousin's cotton farm to make money. At age 10, Ellison was still deeply distraught over her mother's death; to cheer her up, her father took her to the local wrestling matches. Ellison liked the matches, but it was not until she saw Women's Champion Mildred Burke wrestle that \"they began to mean much more\" to her.\n\nEllison returned to the Columbia home of her father and brothers. She graduated Columbia High School, but at age 14 married 21-year-old Walter Carroll. They soon became parents to a daughter. A few months after the birth of her daughter, she divorced Carroll. Still only 15, she left her daughter with a friend and set out on a wrestling career of her own.\n\nEllison began her wrestling career with Mildred Burke's husband Billy Wolfe, the dominant women's promoter of the time. She competed with many other female wrestlers, stepping into the ring with the likes of Mae Young, Cecilia Blevins and Mildred Burke. Wolfe was notorious for advising his wrestlers to enter into sexual relationships with either himself or competing promoters to ensure additional bookings, a practice with which Ellison refused to go along. She, however, soon began a romance with wrestler Johnny Long. Long later introduced Ellison to Jack Pfefer who gave her the moniker \"Slave Girl Moolah\". By the early 1950s, Moolah was a valet for \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, accompanying him to the ring while providing eye candy for the male audiences and assisting Rogers against his opponents. Ellison broke up the partnership because Rogers kept pushing her to begin a sexual relationship. She then served as the valet for the Elephant Boy (Tony Olivas). Olivas was Mexican, but had very dark skin, which caused controversy when Ellison, a white woman, would kiss him on the cheek during their ring entrance routine. At one show in Oklahoma City, a man, who thought that Olivas was a black man, attempted to stab Ellison with a knife for kissing him. Moolah later left Pfeffer's promotion and began wrestling under Boston promoters Tony Santos and Paul Bowser. In 1955, she began working for Vince McMahon, Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation.\n\nOn September 18, 1956, Moolah defeated Judy Grable in a 13-woman battle royal to win the vacant World Women's Championship, which shares a lineage with the NWA World Women's Championship. She was not immediately recognized by everyone as the NWA Champion because Billy Wolfe, with whom she had conflict earlier in her career, still controlled the promotion. After the match, Vince McMahon, Sr. dubbed Ellison with a new ring name – The Fabulous Moolah. Subsequently, June Byers came out of retirement to challenge Moolah to a match for the title. During the match, Moolah acted as the aggressor and pinned Byers to retain the championship. Moolah's first World Championship reign lasted over ten years. Moolah successfully defended the belt against the top female wrestlers in the world, such as Judy Grable and Donna Christanello, while also purporting to befriend some of the biggest celebrities of the day. Moolah claimed in her book, \"First Goddess of the Squared Circle\", that she formed friendships with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nAfter June Byers retired in 1964, Moolah was subsequently recognized as official NWA Champion, thus making her the undisputed Women's World Champion. Nevertheless, Moolah dropped the belt on September 17, 1967 to Bette Boucher, although she regained the title just weeks later. She also traded the belt with Yukiko Tomoe during a tour of Japan in 1968. On July 1, 1972, Moolah became the first woman allowed to wrestle at Madison Square Garden, which had previously banned women's wrestling. In fact, Moolah helped overturn the ban on women's wrestling in the entire state of New York, which the New York State Athletic Commission lifted in June 1972. During her quest to overturn the ban, she flipped football player Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Grier onto his back on \"The Mike Douglas Show\". Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight-year reign before losing to Sue Green at Madison Square Garden in 1976. Moolah regained her title a short time later. She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s, and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978, began another long reign, defending her title for another six years. Also in the 1970s, Moolah held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice with Toni Rose.\n\nIn 1983, Vince McMahon, Jr. began expanding the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) nationally, and Moolah sold him the rights to her Women's World Championship. Moolah agreed to appear exclusively for the WWF, and thus became the first WWF Women's Champion. The following year, singer Cyndi Lauper began a verbal feud with manager \"Captain\" Lou Albano, who long had a reputation of being a villain, that brought professional wrestling into mainstream culture in a storyline that became known as the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection.\" When it was finally time for Lauper and Albano to settle their differences in the ring, a match-up was scheduled with Albano representing Moolah against the challenge of Lauper's protégé, Wendi Richter. After much buildup and hype, the Fabulous Moolah lost the championship when defeated by Richter, who had Lauper in her corner, on July 23, 1984 in the main event of \"The Brawl to End It All\", which was broadcast live on MTV. Prior to the match, the WWF promoted Moolah as holding the championship for the previous 28 years.\n\nAfter losing the title to Richter, Moolah aided Leilani Kai in defeating Richter for the title in February 1985. Richter won it back at the inaugural WrestleMania, but when Richter's relationship soured with the WWF, Moolah donned a mask as \"The Spider Lady\" and regained the belt on November 25, 1985, in a controversial decision. Richter was never told she would be losing the title and fell victim to a real-life \"screwjob\" finish known as \"The Original Screwjob\". Richter promptly quit the WWF afterward, while Moolah continued to be champion for another two years—excluding a six-day reign by Velvet McIntyre during a tour of Australia in 1986—before losing the belt to Sherri Martel on July 24, 1987. She later captained a team at the inaugural Survivor Series. Her team (Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels) defeated champion Martel and her team (Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie).\n\nThroughout the early 1990s, she made appearances in video packages and at live WWF events. On June 24, 1995, she was the first female wrestler to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame. In the late 1990s, Pat Patterson and Ellison began jokingly discussing a comeback for her, which resulted in Patterson contacting WWF Chairman Vince McMahon about the possibility. In 1998, Moolah and Mae Young re-emerged in the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE). The WWF women's division, however, had since moved away from the traditional athletic match-ups of the past and now featured women competing in sexually-themed bikini contests and strip matches.\n\nMoolah received a call from McMahon in late 1998 about returning to the company. On the September 9, 1999 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Jeff Jarrett invited Moolah, 76, into the ring and smashed a guitar over her head. Moolah and Young then began appearing regularly in comedic roles. On the September 27, 1999 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Moolah and Young defeated Ivory in a Handicapped Evening Gown match, which led to a title match at No Mercy on October 17, 1999. The match saw seventy-six-year-old Moolah defeat Ivory to regain the WWE Women's Championship, thus becoming the oldest WWF Women's Champion ever, though she lost the title to Ivory eight days later.\n\nOn the September 15, 2003 episode of \"Raw\", Moolah won a match against Victoria. Moolah had been promised the match for her eightieth birthday and became the first octogenarian to compete in a WWE ring. After Moolah's victory, the \"Legend Killer\" Randy Orton came out and performed an \"RKO\" on her. Moolah and Young made another appearance at New Years Revolution in 2006, during a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match attacking Victoria and stripping her of her top. She also made brief appearances at WrestleMania 23 and the 2007 Draft Lottery on June 11, 2007. Her last WWE appearance before her death was at SummerSlam in August 2007, in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon and Raw General Manager William Regal.\n\nEllison and her second husband Johnny Long began training women to become female wrestlers, which included Ella Waldek, Daisy Mae, and Katherine Simpson. Long later contacted promoter Jack Pfefer, who agreed to book some of the wrestlers at his shows. After marrying wrestler Buddy Lee, he began helping Ellison train the female wrestlers. After she left Pfeffer's promotion in the 1950s, Ellison found it difficult to book her trainees in shows due to Pfeffer's influence over other National Wrestling Alliance promoters. Ellison claimed Pfeffer would threaten to reveal the pre-planned nature of wrestling if any other promoters did not do as he liked. As a result, Ellison began selling cosmetics door-to-door and Lee opened a service station to make enough money to pay their bills. They later began to book their wrestlers, including Judy Grable in Boston, under promoter Paul Bowser.\n\nIn the late 1950s when the once-dominant promoter of women's wrestling, Billy Wolfe, was out of business, Ellison and Lee began to book their female wrestlers for more and more shows. They began calling their promoting business Girl Wrestling Enterprises (GWE). Ellison demanded a lot from the girls of GWE, including that they had to keep their hair and make-up done, act like a lady, and not date men who were in the professional wrestling business. In addition to women, Ellison also trained midget professional wrestlers, including Katie Glass in the 1960s. Ellison founded the Ladies' International Wrestling Association, a non-profit organization to help retired professional wrestlers, in the late 1980s. In the 1990s, she spent most of her time training female wrestlers at her school in Columbia, South Carolina. She also began training men, including Del Wilkes, and in 1995 trained more men than women. She also spent time training in Los Angeles at Verne Langdon's Slammers Gym.\n\nJournalist Dave Meltzer wrote an obituary for Moolah in which he stated that \"different promoters had very different ideas of what being professional meant.\" Wrestling historian Tim Hornbaker said that Moolah \"chose not to\" break the \"dishonest, greedy\" practices established by her mentor Billy Wolfe. Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy, in their book \"Sisterhood of the Squared Circle\", wrote that Moolah's \"tactics could be just as ruthless and cutthroat as those of 'The Godfather,'\" Don Corleone.\n\nWendi Richter and Mad Maxine both claimed that Ellison did not actually train the wrestlers at her wrestling school. According to Richter, Ellison accepted payment of the training fee (which at the time of Richter's training was $500) and had other female wrestlers within her camp (including Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Winona Littleheart, and Joyce Grable) train the new recruits; these women did not get paid for their additional work as trainers. Richter also claimed that Ellison required all women that received training at her camp to sign a contract that allowed Ellison to function as their booker and receive 25% of their booking fee. Trainees were also required to rent duplex apartments on Ellison's property and they were responsible for paying her for rent and utilities. The training lasted six months and took place up to five hours per day inside a wrestling ring in a barn that lacked heating and air conditioning or fans. Mad Maxine said that due to owing Moolah both rent and training fees amounting to $1,500, the trainees \"went into debt to [Moolah] and she controlled their lives... It was an environment ripe for abuse.\" Maxine also said that when she went to work for WWF, Moolah was taking at least half of Maxine's earnings. Debbie Johnson, another former trainee of Ellison's, stated that she was required to give Ellison 30% of her booking fee, and her paycheck was further reduced as Ellison deducted travel expenses, food, rent, and utilities before paying her. As a result, Johnson worked for Ellison for two years before she received any money. Johnson stated that Ellison would refuse to book certain women in her training camp if they angered her, and that Ellison monitored her and refused to let her leave the physical constraints of the training camp unless she was accompanied by someone else.\n\nOver the years, various female wrestlers have come forward with stories accusing Ellison of being a pimp who often provided various wrestling promoters with unsuspecting female wrestlers that would be used as sex objects. Penny Banner directly described Moolah as a pimp who \"in return for money,\" rented her female trainees out \"in bulk\" to wrestling promoters so that the promoters and the male wrestlers could have sex with them. Banner said the women who were \"sent on these tours were not told of this 'arrangement' ahead of time,\" and that \"those who refused to have sex with wrestlers and promoters were raped.\" One of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy). McCoy, who was trained and booked by Ellison and her then-husband Buddy Lee, told her daughter that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her. Ida Martinez, who wrestled during the 1960s, also recalls that many of the regional promoters \"demanded personal services\" before they would pay the female wrestlers. Mad Maxine described Moolah as an \"evil person,\" saying Moolah made money by sending trainees \"out to this guy in Arizona and pimped them out.\" In a 2002 interview, Luna Vachon claimed that when she was sixteen years old and training at Ellison's camp, Ellison sent her out of state to be photographed by an older man. Although she remained clothed during the photo shoot, Vachon stated she felt taken advantage of by Ellison and the older man. Vachon also stated that her aunt, Vivian Vachon, witnessed Ellison abusing alcohol and having sex with her female trainees. Sandy Parker, a lesbian former pupil of Ellison's, also claims that Ellison forbade her from going to any gay bars and tried to press her to date men. Parker says this enraged her, because \"(Moolah) was two faced because she had her own little dalliances that we all knew about.\"\n\nHowever, several former co-workers have spoken out in Ellison's defense. Professional wrestler Shane Douglas said he never heard anybody speaking against Moolah during his career. Bruce Prichard said she was a \"wonderful human being\" and \"She was always good to me, and she treated me well.\" Former female wrestler Beverly Shade also defended Moolah, claiming \"Moolah wasn't that kind of person.\" Jerry Lawler also said he \"never heard or saw anything like that when I was in the business around Moolah and her girls.\" Former trainee Princess Victoria said Moolah never pimp any women or use drugs, but she did take money from them.\n\nAs well as allegedly exploiting female wrestlers sexually, Ellison was accused of using her influence to control the women's wrestling scene and ensure that other women did not gain greater recognition. In addition to being a key participant in the original screwjob on Wendi Richter, Ellison used her influence to take over the spot originally held by her protégé Mad Maxine on the animated series \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". Maxine was about to receive a big push by Vince McMahon but left the WWF shortly afterwards, as Ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings. Maxine said that Moolah never told her about WWF's plans for Maxine's character to be included on \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". Numerous other former trainees defected from Ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with Ellison. Women wrestlers including Vivian and Luna Vachon, Ann Casey, and Darling Dagmar moved into other regions where Ellison had less control and negotiated their own payouts with promoters.\n\nBoth Judy Martin and Leilani Kai told in later interviews that Moolah would collect the women wrestlers' pay from promoters, and after taking out her own pay, would only give the girls half of the money they were owed (keeping half of their pay for herself, plus her own pay) and telling them that was all the promoter gave her to give them. Martin stated that shortly before Ellison left the WWF in 1988 (shortly after falling out with Martin and Kai due to Ellison no longer receiving their booking fees), she sabotaged the duo while they were touring Japan. Martin stated that Ellison contacted Japanese promoters and informed them that the Jumping Bomb Angels were supposed to drop the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship to The Glamour Girls before Martin and Kai returned to the United States. This was contrary to the booking decision made by Pat Patterson before the Japanese tour began. Unable to reach Patterson by telephone, Kai and Martin agreed to win the titles from the Angels since Ellison had already misinformed the Japanese promoters. Martin stated that upon returning to the United States, Patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within the WWF made the decision for the title change and that due to her long-standing relationship with the company, the WWF refused to listen to their explanation of Ellison's deceit. Shortly thereafter, the WWF phased out the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. In a later shoot interview, Leilani Kai told that had things gone as the WWF originally planned, The Glamour Girls would have had a title match against the Jumping Bomb Angels at WrestleMania IV and that Ellison's actions had cost the four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday.\n\nWomen that chose to continue allowing Ellison to work as their booker were kept under tight control. Velvet McIntyre was forced to compete against Ellison (whom McIntyre stated she didn't care for) at WrestleMania 2 instead of competing during an all-women tour of Kuwait with a group of Ellison's other female wrestlers. Their WrestleMania 2 match lasted less than two minutes with the referee ignoring McIntyre's leg being on the ropes while she was being pinned. Women that did not agree to Ellison's booking fees faced limited options. Rhonda Sing stated that Ellison contacted her and offered to let her wrestle Richter in a couple of pay-per-view matches for the WWF in 1985, but demanded she receive half of Sing's pay check; a stipulation Sing was unwilling to accept. Penny Banner stated that her retirement was due in large part to Ellison refusing to allow any of her female wrestlers to accept bookings against Banner, which severely limited the number of bookings that Banner was offered by promoters.\n\nDavid Bixenspan of \"Deadspin\" pointed out that Moolah wrestled an \"in-ring style low on athleticism and heavy on hair-pulling\", and taught this style to her students. This \"worsened the in-genre gender divide\" and resulted in American women's wrestling becoming \"much more of a sideshow\" instead of the women's world title being a \"legitimate headline attraction\" in the era before Moolah. As such, he rejected WWE's characterization of Moolah as someone who \"challenged the gender norms of a once male-dominated sport\".\n\nDave Meltzer described that women's wrestling \"went way way down\" under Moolah's \"tutelage\", but he also said he did not know if it was her fault. Meltzer said that although women \"used to headline and they were successful\", \"during the period Moolah controlled women's wrestling, the popularity and product didn't evolve.\" However, Meltzer noted that Moolah herself \"stood the test of time\" to remain culturally relevant long after the Japanese female wrestlers of the 1980s (more popular at that time) had faded from relevance.\n\nIn March 2018, WWE announced \"The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal\", a battle royal for the female wrestlers of the company scheduled for WrestleMania 34 named in honor of Moolah. The decision to hold a battle royal in honor of Moolah drew controversy after the allegations of exploitation against Moolah surfaced. Two days after the announcement, WWE renamed the match \"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\", removing Moolah's name from the event.\n\nAn animated version of Moolah was included on a CBS Saturday morning cartoon during this lucrative time, titled \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". In addition, she appeared in one of Cyndi Lauper's music videos, \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\". An illness in the mid-1970s meant Ellison had to pull out of the Bill Cosby movie \"Mother, Jugs & Speed\", which had a role written specifically for her. In 2002, Moolah wrote her autobiography, \"The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle\". The book has been criticized for keeping kayfabe (the stance that wrestling storylines are real) and did not reveal a lot about her time controlling women's wrestling. Defending herself against these claims, Ellison retorted it was hard to fit all of her almost five decade career into one book.\n\nMoolah and Young, along with several other female wrestlers, starred in the 2004 film \"\" a documentary about the female wrestlers from the 1950s era. They also appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" promoting the film.\n\nEllison's first husband was Walter Carroll, who became the father of her daughter Mary. Mary wrestled briefly but decided against pursuing the profession. Ellison had six grandchildren. Ellison and Carroll divorced shortly after their daughter's birth. Later, Ellison married wrestler Johnny Long. Marital conflicts developed when Long wanted Ellison to be a housewife instead of a career woman. In addition, Ellison accused Long of being a \"womanizer\". Ellison and Long divorced. Ellison also says that she dated country singer Hank Williams for four months in 1952. According to Ellison, Williams proposed to her, but Williams's drinking and heroin abuse forced the couple to go separate ways. She further claimed that he wanted Ellison to quit her wrestling career, which she did not want to do. Two months after the breakup, Williams died due to an overdose.\n\nLater, Ellison met a wrestler named Buddy Lee, whom she regarded as the \"love of her life.\" They were eventually married, and after divorcing in 1970 after nine years of marriage, they remained friends until Lee's death in 1999. The divorce was attributed to Lee's affair with Rita Cortez, one of the wrestlers the duo was training. In the early 1980s, Ellison opened Moolah's Hideaway, a bar and grill which was operated by her daughter Mary and frequented by André the Giant.\n\nBeginning in 1991, Ellison lived with Mae Young in a house in Columbia, South Carolina. Her estate was located on a road named Moolah Drive. A midget professional wrestler named Katie Glass also lived with Moolah for over 40 years. Another wrestler, Donna Christanello, also lived with Ellison on-and-off for 40 years, ending in May 1999.\n\nDuring her return to the ring in 1999, Ellison began experiencing occasional dizziness, and as a result, her doctor requested that she begin to wear a heart monitor. A few days later, Ellison was admitted to the hospital for what turned out to be two clogged arteries and viral pneumonia. She stayed at the intensive-care unit of the hospital for 24 days, during which she was unconscious for fifteen days. After leaving the hospital, she again slipped into unconsciousness in the bathroom at her home, crushing several vertebrae. She underwent successful back surgery in mid-December.\n\nEllison died on November 2, 2007 at the age of 84 in Columbia, South Carolina. According to her daughter Mary, the possible cause of death was a heart attack or blood clot related to a recent shoulder replacement surgery. Mary Ellison is buried in a grave plot at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia, South Carolina. The plot appears to be a family plot designed for The Fabulous Moolah, her daughter Mary, Mae Young, Katie Glass, and add-ons for the rest of her family.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The tendency is for the prose folktale versions to have male dragons, and the byliny poetry to have the females. This will affect the behavior of the dragons. For instance, only the male dragons will capture or captivate a princes or a maiden as a love interest.\n\nThe zmei is often depicted with multiple heads, and the number of heads may be 3, 6, 9, or 12.\n\nA three-, six-, nine-, and twelve-headed dragon are defeated on successive nights by the hero of the tale \"Ivan the Peasant's Son and the Little Man the Size of a Finger\" (Afanasyev #138). The twelve-headed one was hardest to kill, and although the hero beheaded it nearly completely, the last head had to be taken by six men provided to Ivan by the Tsar.\n\n\nIn the variant \"Ivan Bykovich (Ivan Buikovich)\" (# 137), an equivalent sets of these multi-headed creatures appear, but are not called \"zmei\", but a Chudo-Iudo (Chudo-Yudo). These are humanlike creatures, each one is riding a horse. Even when decapitated, if the heads picked up the grow back on once a line is drawn on it with the dragon's fiery finger. As is pointed out below, a \"zmei\" can take human-form, and in the variant \"Storm-bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son\" (#136), the multi-headed Chudo-Iudo are described as using the word \"zmei\" also.\nThe creature's appearance is not described in \"bylinas\". In more recent sources, the Russian zmei is described as being covered with either green or red scales, and having iron claws.\n\nThe \"zmei\" may turn into a handsome youth. In that form he enthralls the sister or wife of Ivan Tsarevich in different versions of (Afanasyev #204, #205), as described below. In one of these (#204) the \"zmei\" also transforms into kitchen implements to avoid detection: he becomes a broom, a sort of mop ( \"pomelo\") and . But Ivan's obedient animals are able to detect the presence of an intruder in these implements.\n\nThe \"zmei\" assumes the form of a golden goat in another tale (\"The Crystal Mountain\", Afanasyev #162).\n\nThe \"zmei\" occurs in the literature of [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] in numerous wondertales (\"\") such as those in [[Alexander Afanasyev]]'s compilation \"[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]\", and in the byliny (epic ballads), and rendered as \"serpent\" or \"dragon\". They may also appear as a character with \"Zmei\" or \"Zmeyevich\" (Zmeevich, etc.) in their proper name, and these may exhibit more human-like qualities, such as courting women.\n\nThe \"zmei\" slain by the [[bogatyr]] [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] in the bylina \"Dobrynya and the Zmei\" can be male or female. It may happen to be Zmei Gorynishche (\"Dragon, the Son of a Mountain\"). This name is a variant form of \"Zmei Gorynych\" found in fairy tales. Or it may be she-dragon without a name, as in the byliny collected from [[Republic of Karelia|Karelian Russia]]. The \"Puchai River\" was its haunt, but in the caves of the \"Saracen Mountains\" it raised its pups and kept hostages. It was capable of flight, and abducted a princess from [[Kiev]] by flying there.\n\nZmei Gorynych (Russian: [[:ru:Змей Горыныч|Змей Горыныч]]) has decidedly dragon-like characteristics, such as having [[Multi-headed animal|multiple heads]] (from 3 to upwards of 12), spitting fire, and being associated with a body of water.\n\nHowever, \"Zmei Gorynych\" is not consistently beast-like, and he may appear in the guise of a human thoroughout in some works (See [[#Milk of Wild Beasts|§Milk of Wild Beasts]], [[#Dobrynya and Marinka|§Dobrynya and Marinka]]) below.\n\nSometimes there are \"Sons of Zmei\" (Zmeyevich being their [[patronymic]] surname) who are recognized as monsters with human qualities, or vice versa.\n\n[[Tugarin Zmeyevich]] is one such with [[anthropomorphic]] characteristics. The half-human quality is borne out by the \"zmei-[[bogatyr]]\" (serpent-hero) given him, and from him being able to ride a horse like a human being in the folktale \"[[Alyosha Popovich]]\". Tugarin thus faces off against the bogatyr Alyosha, and is slain.\n\nTugarin is a great glutton, which is suggestive of a dragon; however Tugar still retains human form, even in the scene where he displays the extraordinary feat of devouring a whole swan, moving it from cheek to cheek, and spitting out the bones. Tugarin also has flying wings like a dragon, but some songs rationalize these a paper wings, a device attached to the horse.\n\nTugarin is referred to as a pagan and he has been given overlays of a [[Tatar people|Tatar]] tyrant around the folkloric dragon. Some support the conjecture that Tugarin's name derives from \"Tugar-Khan\", or Tugor-Khan, of the Turkic [[Polovtsi|Polovets]], but this etymology has been discounted by later commentators.\n\nThe \"zmei\" also transforms into a handsome youth to seduce women (folktale , #204, 205). In one version, Zmei Gorynych seduces the sister of [[Ivan Tsarevich]]. She feigns illnesses and asks Ivan to perform the precarious task of retrieving the milk of the wolf, bear, and lioness. This plan fails. Later however, when Ivan is separted from his trusty pack of animals, zmei reveals his true nature and poises to devour him with his gaping mouth. In another version, Zmei Zmeyevich (\"Serpent, Son of Serpent\") and Ivan's adulterous wife play out a similar plot.\n\nZmei Gorynych or Tugarin Zmeyevich, in \"Dobrynya and Marinka\", play fleeting roles as the lover of Marinka the sorceress, and are instantly killed.\n\nIn some tales, this Zmei Zmeyevich is a [[tsar]].\n\nThere is also the three-headed \"zmei\" defeated by [[Yeruslan Lazarevich|Eruslan Lazarevich]], hero of the story material found in [[popular print]] ([[Lubok|lubki]]).\n\nIt was a \"zmei\", and not a \"drakon\" () that was defeated by Saint George, or St. Egorii, as he was popularly known in Russia. The saint appears as \"Egorii the brave\" (, with the epithet \"chrabryii\") in religious verses. This can be seen in popular \"[[lubok]]\" prints of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]in Russia. The scene is also often depicted in [[Russian icons]].\n\n\n\n[[Category:Slavic legendary creatures|zmei (Russian)]]\n[[Category:Russian mythology]]\n[[Category:European dragons]]\n[[Category:Magic (paranormal)]]\n[[Category:Characters in Bylina]]\n[[Category:Legendary serpents]]"}
