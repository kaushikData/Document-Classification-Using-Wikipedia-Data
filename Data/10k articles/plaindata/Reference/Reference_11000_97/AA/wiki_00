The story was conceived by Allison Deegan and she co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and Jeremy Brock. The film stars Kate Winslet, Matthias Schoenaerts, Alan Rickman, Stanley Tucci, Helen McCrory, Steven Waddington, Jennifer Ehle and Rupert Penry-Jones. The film was financed by the Lionsgate UK and produced by BBC Films. It was the second film directed by Rickman, after his 1997 directorial debut \"The Winter Guest\". It was the second collaboration of Rickman and Winslet after their 1995 film \"Sense and Sensibility\". Production took place in London in mid 2013. The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as the closing night film on 13 September 2014.\n\nKing Louis XIV of France assigns the design and construction of the Gardens of Versailles to André Le Nôtre. Le Nôtre interviews several other gardeners who submitted designs for the project, including one woman who works alone, Sabine de Barra. He sees her move a potted plant in his garden prior to her interview, and questions her deference to order in design. Sabine affirms her respect for his work and suggests that she would like to create something uniquely French rather than follow classical and renaissance styles. He shows her the door in record time, and she leaves disheartened.\nOn the night after her interview, André surprises Sabine at her home and tasks her with responsibility for an outdoor ballroom surrounded by a fountain and landscaping. André's plans had called for a constant supply of water from a great distance at great expense. Sabine devises another engineering solution based on a reservoir from which water can be continuously recycled through the fountains she has designed. She makes little progress at first, with workmen recommended by one of the men rejected by André, until another competitor, Thierry Duras, intervenes and offers the use of his crew.\n\nAs a beautiful commoner Sabine stands out at court, attracting attention, and is befriended by the King's brother Duc Philippe d'Orleans and his wife Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine. At times, Sabine appears haunted by brief glimpses of a young girl or a girl's voice she hears calling. She is attracted to André but does not act on her feelings, while André quietly endures the infidelities of his wife Françoise, who insists that her husband's success is founded on her influence at court. When Françoise warns him against an affair with Sabine, he quotes her own speech declaring their right to seek comfort elsewhere, and becomes resolute in his intention to pursue a relationship with Sabine.\n\nQueen Maria Theresa dies suddenly. André informs his wife, who is shaken at the prospect that this will lessen her influence at court. The king is shocked at the loss of his wife and takes refuge in his gardener's work area, amongst the pear trees. Sabine finds the king there as she delivers perennials for a trade, first mistaking him for the gardener. After she recognizes him she agrees to continue their conversation as equals. She finds great favour in the king's eyes, and he invites her to travel with him and his court to his palace and gardens at Fontainebleau.\n\nSabine is visited by Françoise, who tells her that André's passionate intentions are only a whim and will prove short-lived. After they both leave, Françoise's lover opens the sluice gates from the reservoir and floods the work site, destroying much of the earthworks. Sabine nearly drowns trying to close the gate, and André saves her. The next morning, Sabine works vigorously to mend some of the damage done by the storm. That same day, Louis XIV visits Sabine's work site and assesses the project skeptically but allows it to proceed. \n\nAfterwards, André finds a glove at the worksite that belongs to his wife Françoise. He realizes she is behind the sabotage of the project; returns the glove and ends their relationship.\n\nSabine goes to court again, where Duc de Lauzun introduces her to the king's mistress, the Marquise de Montespan, who in turn introduces her to the women of the court. At first they tease her, but when they learn she is widowed and lost her 6-year-old daughter, they reveal their own losses and welcome her into their circle, where they often discuss topics the king forbids at court, including the deaths of their children. The Marquise formally presents Sabine to the King when he arrives, and Sabine offers him a four-seasons rose. They converse about the nature of the rose and its life cycle, beauty, hardships and death, and the gardener's responsibilities. It is Sabine's veiled defense of the aging Madame de Montespan, who has begun to lose the king's favor.\n\nAndré waits for Sabine outside her room that night, and they finally make love. In the morning, André finds himself alone in bed. Sabine is upstairs, lost in the memory of the day her daughter and husband died. He is taking their daughter with him on a business trip. Before leaving, he admits to Sabine that he has a mistress. Soon after, he grabs their daughter and gets into the carriage. As they are leaving Sabine sees that the carriage has a faulty wheel and learns that her husband is taking their daughter to his mistress's home, causing her to race after them; when she stops in front of the carriage it topples off the road and down a hill, killing both father and daughter. André finds Sabine in the grip of this memory and convinces her to stop blaming herself for their deaths.\n\nWhen Sabine's project is complete, the king and his court arrive for its inauguration. To the music of a hidden orchestra, everyone begins dancing as the fountains send water coursing down the tiers around the ballroom floor. Sabine and André leave the others dancing and walk into the garden together.\n\nThe story was conceived by Allison Deegan, who co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and Jeremy Brock. The film was financed by the Lionsgate UK and produced by BBC Films.\n\nProduction began in March 2013. Producer Zygi Kamasa of Lionsgate said that \"we are delighted to be working with the best of British actors and directors like Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman as we move forward in doubling our investment in British films in 2014.\" Rickman said: \"The film is not just frills at the wrists and collars. It's about people getting their hands dirty and building something in order to entertain the other world they serve. It's about how one world maintains the other, often at the cost of women.\"\n\nOn 17 January 2013, it was announced that Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts had been cast as the leads in the film. Rickman had Winslet in mind for the lead role of Sabine de Barra and continued with her when two weeks into shooting, Winslet announced that she was pregnant. In addition to directing, Rickman took the role of King Louis XIV. He explained that \"the only way I could do it was because in a way, he's like a director, Louis, so you kind of keep the same expression on your face. As a director, you see everything somehow. It's like a huge all-encompassing eye that sees everything, and it's able to cherry pick; \"Move that,\" \"Don't do that,\" \"Do it this way,\" \"Change this colour\". And I don't know where that comes from, but it does, once you're given the job, and I have a feeling Louis probably would've been a great film director\".\n\nDespite being set in France, complete filming took place in England. Principal photography commenced on 27 March 2013 and continued over eight weeks in Black Park, Cliveden House, Pinewood Studios, Blenheim Palace, Waddesdon Manor, Hampton Court Palace, Ham House, Ashridge and Chenies Manor. Filming ended on 8 June 2013 in Richmond, London.\n\nAccording to Rickman, filming \"wasn't easy, though; throwing Kate into freezing water at 1am, the carriage crash, scenes with 80 extras, tight schedules in venues like Blenheim Palace. It's a constant tap dance between control and freedom and of course the budget guides everything.\"\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Peter Gregson. It was the first feature film for Gregson, who previously composed music for a 2014 short film \"Every Quiet Moment\". Veigar Margeirsson's 2008 composition \"Rise above\" was used in the trailer of the film but was not part of soundtrack album. It was released by Milan Records on 16 April 2015.\n\nBBC Films revealed footage from the film as part of their \"BBC Films Sizzle Showreel 2013\" on 25 November 2013. First stills of Kate Winslet were released on 22 July 2014 with the announcement of film's premiere at 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. Three images from the film featuring Winslet, Alan Rickman and Jennifer Ehle were released on 27 August 2014. A scene from the film featuring Winslet and Rickman was revealed on 9 September 2014. The full-length official trailer was revealed on 19 December 2014. The first poster and another trailer were released on 20 January 2015. On 11 June 2015, another scene from the film featuring Stanley Tucci was released.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as the closing night film on 13 September 2014. It was then shown in gala screenings as \"Love Gala\" at the 2014 BFI London Film Festival on 17 October 2014. Rickman presented the film at Camerimage film festival in November 2014. The United States premiere was held at the Sonoma International Film Festival on 25 March 2015. It had a theatrical release in Australia on 26 March 2015 and in UK on 17 April 2015.\n\nIt was initially set for a theatrical release on 27 March 2015 in the United States but it was later pulled out. Focus Features finally gave the film a theatrical and VOD release simultaneously in United States on 26 June 2015.\n\nAs of July 2015, the film has been opened in fourteen territories including Australia and UK and had grossed $10,084,623 worldwide.\n\nThe film generated mixed reviews from critics, with the performances from the cast being highly praised. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 40% rating based on reviews from 75 critics, with an average score of 5.3/10. The site's consensus states that \"Stylish and well-acted without ever living up to its dramatic potential, A Little Chaos is shouldered by the impressive efforts of a talented cast.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 51, based on 15 reviews, which indicates \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nCatherine Shoard of \"The Guardian\" gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that \"Winslet manages emotional honesty within anachronistic confines, and Schoenaerts escapes with dignity.\" Mark Adams in his review for \"Screen International\" said, \"the film is a gracefully made delight, replete with lush costumes, fruity performances, love amongst the flowerbeds and even a little mild peril. Yes it lacks real dramatic edge and may be seen as a typical British period costume film, but it is also a classily made pleasure that will delight its target audience.\" David Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" felt that \"This decently acted film is agreeable entertainment, even if it works better on a scene by scene basis than in terms of overall flow.\" Tim Robey in The Telegraph said in his review: \"If you see only one film about 17th-century French landscape gardening this year, it probably ought to be \"A Little Chaos\", a heaving bouquet of a picture.\"\n\nHowever, David Sexton of the \"London Evening Standard\" gave the film a negative review, saying that \"Kate Winslet charms as a gardener at the Court of Louis XIV, but it's not enough to keep this inauthentic piece from wilting.\" Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\" also criticized the film, writing that \"A Little Chaos\" is \"all too tidy as it imposes a predictable, pat modern sensibility on a most unconvincing depiction of late 17th-century French aristocratic life.\" Kaleem Aftab of \"The Independent\" gave the film two out of five stars, noting that while the performances were exceptional, but the talents of the players were wasted. He wrote that \"it all starts off so promisingly\" and praised the camera work and language, but found it quickly fails as \"a melancholic look at grief\" where \"at least four different genres [clash] against each other, occasionally in the same scene\" and \"the romance seems to take place off-screen.\" She concluded: \"There was a 17 year gap between Rickman's first and second film and on this evidence it's easy to see why. While he can get performances out of the actors, he lacks command of pacing and plot.\"\n\nSome of the film's characters are fictional, including Kate Winslet's Sabine de Barra. The film is set in 1682, but André Le Nôtre, began work at Versailles in 1661. Le Nôtre was nearly 70 in 1682, twice the age he appears to be as portrayed by Schoenaerts in the film. A garden much like that in the film exists at Versailles, the \"Salle de Bal\" or \"Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal\".\n\n"}

He enjoys a status as a figure of an archetypal outlaw antihero, critiquing the hypocrisies of his society from his position as an outsider.\n\nWhat is known about al-Shanfarā is inferred from the poems which he is believed with confidence to have composed. He seems fairly certainly to have belonged to the Yemenite al-Azd tribe, probably specifically to the Al-Khazraj clan.\n\nAl-Shanfarā attracted a number of pseudo-historical \"akhbār\" (reports) in texts like the \"Kitāb al-aghānī\" by Abū al-Faraj, al-Anbārī's commentary on the \"Mufaḍḍaliyāt\", mostly focusing on explaining how he came to be exiled from his tribe. He and his companion Ta’bbaṭa-Sharran were thought to be among the few people of pre-Islamic Arabia who could run down an antelope.\n\nAl-Shanfarā is named as the author of a scattering of individual verses as well as a long passage known as \"The Ta’iyya of al-Shanfarā\" preserved in the seminal collection of pre-Islamic verse, the \"Mufaḍḍaliyāt\". His works are discussed in at least twenty medieval and early medieval scholarly commentaries.\n\nAl-Shanfarā is most famous for, supposedly, composing the \"Lāmiyyāt ‘al-Arab\". Although its attribution has been disputed ever since medieval times, the memorable first-person figure of the misanthropic brigand celebrating his position on the edge of society that the poem draws has strongly influenced views of al-Shanfarā. We can if nothing else say that if the \"Lāmiyyāt\" is a later composition, it positions al-Shanfarā as the archetypal outlaw of a pre-Islamic heroic age, viewed nostalgically from a later era.\n\nOf works considered likely actually to have been by Al-Shanfarā, \"The Ta’iyya of al-Shanfarā\" (\"Mufaḍḍaliyya\" no. 20) is the most renowned. As translated by Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, it runs as follows.\n\n"}

It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting Hercules' struggle between virtue and vice, personified here by the figures of the two women physically pulling him in different directions. \n\nIn the painting, Virtue appears to be winning the struggle over Hercules, but Vice has torn Hercules' stocking and still reaches out her hand toward him. Concealed behind her skirt is a dagger and a statue of a sphinx. On the stonework above the scene, an inscription reads \"[HO]NOR ET VIRTUS/[P]OST MORTE FLORET (Honor and Virtue Flourish after Death).\" As an allegory, the job of this painting is to convey a moral message, that of the superiority of virtue over vice. \n\nThe genre of allegory contrasts with Veronese's well-known tableaus of historical and biblical scenes, such as the Marriage at Cana as well as with the less formal works of other Renaissance Venetian painters like Giorgione or Titian. This work, along with \"Wisdom and Strength,\" also in the Frick Collection, is believed to be Veronese's first in this style. These two works are also thought by scholars to be his first to cross the Alps.\n\n\"The Choice Between Virtue and Vice\" and \"Wisdom and Strength\" have traveled together since their creation, through many prestigious owners and collections. Because of this, many scholars assumed that Veronese painted them as a pair. In 1970, Edgar Munhall was the first scholar to suggest that they were simply made at the same time, not as pendants. Work undertaken by scholars at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 2000s confirmed that the two were made individually.\n\nFrom its creation in Venice, this painting traveled through the hands of Emperor Rudolph II of the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Christina of Sweden, the Odesalchi family, the famous collection of Philippe II, Duke of Orleans, and then through the hands of various Englishmen and art dealers before arriving at its current home in the Frick Collection.\n\n"}

{"id": "4571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4571", "title": "Baku (mythology)", "text": "Baku (mythology)\n\nThe Japanese term \"baku\" has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the Malayan tapir. In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.\n\nThe traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in Chinese folklore about the \"mo\" 貘 and was familiar in Japan as early as the Muromachi period (14th-15th century). Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as amulets. Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database, citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.\n\nAn early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the \"Sankai Ibutsu\" (), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical chimera with an elephant’s trunk, rhinoceros' eyes, an ox's tail, and a tiger's paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities. However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws. The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-Meiji) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and netsuke carvings.\n\nWriting in the Meiji period, Lafcadio Hearn (1902) described a baku with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.\nLegend has it, that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to baku. A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times, \"Baku-san, come eat my dream.\" Legends say that the baku will come into the child's room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the baku must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one's nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. In the 1910s, it was common for Japanese children to keep a baku talisman at their bedside.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55024725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55024725", "title": "Black Museum (Black Mirror)", "text": "Black Museum (Black Mirror)\n\n\"Black Museum\" is the sixth and final episode of the fourth series of anthology series \"Black Mirror\". It was written by Charlie Brooker, with one part adapted from Penn Jillette's short story \"The Pain Addict\", and directed by Colm McCarthy. The episode first premiered on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.\n\nThe episode is presented as a series of three stories told by Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge), proprietor of the remote \"Black Museum\" to his solitary visitor Nish (Letitia Wright), all involving various exhibits related to cutting edge technological connections and transfers with the human brain that Rolo had developed in his scientific career.\n\nWhilst waiting for her car to charge in a remote charging station, Nish (Letitia Wright) comes across the neighbouring Black Museum, which houses \"authentic criminological artefacts\". She meets the proprietor, Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge), and explains she is out this way as her father lives nearby and her mother suggested she stop by to surprise him. Haynes offers to give her a tour, in which he recounts the stories of the artefacts he has collected, shown in flashback during the episode.\n\nIn his past, Haynes was a neurological research recruiter and persuaded Dr. Peter Dawson (Daniel Lapaine) to get an experimental neurological implant that would allow him to feel the physical sensations of others. Dawson used this to feel the pain of his patients, which allowed him to become an expert at diagnosing and treating them. Meanwhile, Dawson also used the interface to enhance sex with his girlfriend. A senator who had been poisoned was brought into the hospital one night and as he died, Dawson remained connected to him, experiencing his death via the implant. After passing out, Dawson awoke with the side effect that he now experienced pain as pleasure. He begins to use his patients' suffering for personal sexual arousal. He was removed from the hospital and, addicted to pain, began mutilating himself. Realising that he could not inflict fear (and thus, further pleasure) on himself, Dawson tasered, tortured, and killed a homeless man with a drill. He was arrested, but fell into a coma.\n\nIn the present, Nish offers Haynes water since the museum's air conditioning is broken and they are both sweating profusely, and Haynes tells another story about a plush toy monkey. Haynes convinced a man named Jack (Aldis Hodge) to transfer the consciousness of his comatose wife Carrie (Alexandra Roach) into his own brain. Carrie initially enjoyed sharing the sensations that Jack felt in the real world, particularly hugs with their toddler son Parker. However, shared consciousness began to take a toll on the couple, as Jack lacked privacy and Carrie had no agency in the real world. Haynes allowed Jack to put Carrie on \"pause\", infuriating her whenever he allowed her consciousness again. Jack met Emily (Yasha Jackson), and the two began dating, to Carrie's impotent fury. Emily pressured Jack to have Haynes transfer the consciousness of Carrie into a stuffed monkey, which was then given to Parker. The toy could only speak two phrases, \"Monkey loves you\" and \"Monkey needs a hug\". Carrie was furious, but Emily threatened her with deletion if she did not behave. Eventually, Parker grew tired of the toy and abandoned it, with Carrie trapped inside. In the present, Haynes tells Nish that the transfer of Carrie into the stuffed monkey was declared illegal and led to his firing. Haynes then reveals that Carrie is still inside the stuffed monkey in the exhibit, since it is also illegal to delete her.\n\nHaynes and Nish move on to the main attraction of the museum: a dismal hologram projection of Clayton Leigh (Babs Olusanmokun), a convicted murderer, the details of whose crime were briefly shown in the previous segments on TVs. While Leigh was on death row, Haynes coaxed him to sign over the rights to his post-death consciousness in exchange for money to help support his family, despite the objections of his wife, who feared for his safety. After his execution, Clayton found himself reborn as a hologram inside Haynes' museum. Haynes set Leigh up in an execution display, in which visitors could pull a lever to make Clayton experience the agony of the electric chair and feel like they were electrocuting him all over again. They could then leave with a key chain souvenir containing a preserved, and fully independent, copy of Clayton eternally in agony. Each electrocution is set to last 10 seconds, as 15 seconds or more would disrupt the hologram and erase it.\n\nIn the present, Haynes begins to asphyxiate. Nish reveals herself to be Clayton's daughter: she sabotaged the museum's AC so that Haynes would become thirsty and accept her poisoned water. She asserts that her father was actually innocent, but the state never overturned the conviction. Protesters argued against the torments Haynes was subjecting Leigh's hologram to, which hurt the popularity of the museum, but not enough to shut it down. The exhibit attracted wealthy sadists and racists to torture Clayton to the limit of his virtual consciousness, turning him into an empty shell. This caused Nish's mother to take \"a bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka\". Haynes passes out, and Nish transfers his consciousness into Clayton's hologram. She pushes the electric chair simulation to its maximum, allowing Haynes to experience the full force of the torture and finally putting Clayton's consciousness to rest. Taking along with her the stuffed monkey and a \"souvenir\" of Haynes in eternal agony (thereby preserving a copy of his consciousness), and before returning to the car, Nish removes the device disabling the AC, which causes a short. Nish converses with her mother, who is revealed to share her consciousness with Nish, as Carrie did with Jack. Nish drives away, her mother shedding joyful tears as the museum is engulfed in flames.\n\nWhilst series one and two of \"Black Mirror\" were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes, and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the third series, with a bid of $40 million. The 12-episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each.\nThe first story, involving Dr. Dawson, was based on a short story, \"The Pain Addict\", written by magician Penn Jillette early in his career. Jillette had written the story based on the personal experience of being ill in a Spanish welfare hospital in 1981, where it was difficult to get a diagnosis due to the language barrier. Jillette came up with \"The Pain Addict\" from this experience, where there would be technology that allowed a doctor to understand what pain a person was suffering, but, as described by Jillette \"this guy gets addicted to it and starts beating people to feel their pain. He also goes through S&M and all he wants to do is jack into Jesus on the cross. He wants to feel that pain.\" Jillette had planned to use the story in one of his first books along with his show partner Teller, but the publisher rejected it for being too dark. Jillette had been trying to shop for a venue for this story, and brought up the idea when he had an opportunity to talk with Charlie Brooker. Around two years later, Brooker contacted Jillette to explain that \"Black Museum\" would be an anthology episode, and wanted to use \"The Pain Addict\" as part of it. Jillette allowed him to use the story, though Brooker did the necessary modifications for his show. Jillette then worked with Brooker to help suggest the idea of a framing story, which would involve a washed-up Las Vegas carny running the Black Museum outside of Vegas. Jillette wanted to audition for the role of the carny, but the production was too far along to change the casting. Brooker still took Jillette's past performances as part of Penn & Teller and his documentary series \"\" as inspiration for Rolo. The episode took a month to film; locations include Nevada and Spain.\n\nBrooker had previously looked to cast Letitia Wright in an episode of the third series of \"Black Mirror\", but she became unavailable. During the casting process for \"Black Museum\", Brooker considered Wright ideal for the run, but at the time she was finishing shooting on \"Black Panther\". She was able to provide a self-tape audition with help from Daniel Kaluuya, who had previously starred in \"Fifteen Million Merits\" and was co-starring with her in \"Black Panther\".\n\nDaniel Lapaine appears in this episode as Dr. Peter Dawson, after appearing in an unrelated role in the series one episode \"The Entire History of You\".\n\nThe episode is structured similarly to \"White Christmas\", a previous episode of \"Black Mirror\", as both feature three separately told stories that progress towards an overarching plot line by the end.\n\nIn May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of \"Black Mirror\". The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.\n\nBeginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the \"13 Days of \"Black Mirror\"\". On December 6, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.\n\n\"Black Museum\" includes Easter egg references back to each previous \"Black Mirror\" episode, according to director Colm McCarthy; many were placed by set designer Joel Collins. Collins said that he wanted to make the set a \"hidden celebration of six years of \"Black Mirror\"\". For example, Jack is seen reading a \"Fifteen Million Merits\" comic, and the museum's entrance includes a screen showing a picture of Victoria Skillane and later a mannequin with a black balaclava and the white two-pronged symbol from \"White Bear\". Many museum artefacts are taken from previous episodes, for instance: an autonomous drone insect (ADI) from \"Hated in the Nation\"; the lollipop Daly uses to clone Walton's son in \"USS Callister\"; the tablet used by Marie in \"Arkangel\"; the bloodied bathtub where Shazia's husband was murdered in \"Crocodile\". The two rats shown to Dawson by Haynes are named Kenny and Hector, referencing the characters from \"Shut Up and Dance\". The episode also makes multiple allusions to \"San Junipero\", featuring the company TCKR, naming a hospital Saint Juniper's and showing Yorkie and Kelly's dresses in the museum.\n\nSeparately, one wall of the museum includes a number of death masks; Brooker identified these as busts of the various crew that have worked on the show.\n\nCristobal Tapia de Veer composed the music for the episode, which was released through Lakeshore Records on January 19, 2018. A music sampler was released earlier, December 27, 2017, on both his YouTube and SoundCloud.\n\nde Veer commented on the score, stating “The beginning, discovering the Black Museum, that was going to set the tone for the rest of the show. The music morphed in many ways throughout the three stories, then goes back to where it started with the Black Museum, although with a sense of accomplishment, but also a sense of doom.”\n\nThe episode received generally mixed reviews from critics. A \"Guardian\" review stated the ending \"seemed to retread old ground\", but \"given that there's nothing like \"Black Mirror\" on TV, it's a minor quibble.\" A review from \"The A.V. Club\" called the episode \"a dud\" that \"seems to confirm all of the series' most dismissive criticism\". Sophie Gilbert of \"The Atlantic\" considered the three narratives to be uninteresting. An \"Entertainment Weekly\" review called it \"the only outright stinker of the season\". A \"Boston Globe\" review dismissed it as \"riddled with needless callbacks to episodes past\". A \"Telegraph\" review stated \"the performances are serviceable although seldom spectacular\". \"The Economist\" stated the narratives \"illuminate nothing interesting, settling instead on the claim that everyone enjoys inflicting cruelty, given the chance\"; similarly, a \"Variety\" review complained that the episode \"hinges on people repeatedly choosing to be stupid and/or evil\".\n\nOther critics were more positive.

An \"Independent\" review stated the three narratives were \"engrossing\".\n\nAn \"NPR\" review called the episode \"solid\", though not as good as \"USS Callister\" and \"Hang the DJ\".\n\nCritics were divided on whether they joined in with celebrating Nish's revenge. Parham approved her actions as \"a way to fight for what you believe is right\", while Gilbert rejected the \"eye-for-eye justice\" of Nish's deliberate torturing of Haynes.\n"}

S. Ladislaus Endlicher 1827), deriving the name from its magnificent illustrations and the fact that it was kept in the Viennese Imperial Library.\n\nA popular chronicle partly based on the \"Chronicon Pictum\" (entitled just \"Chronica Hungarorum\") was circulated in a printed form. It is also known as the \"Buda Chronicle\". It was produced in 1473 by András Hess and is the first incunabulum ever printed in Hungary (Buda, András Hess, 1473, 70 fol., 2º.)\n\nIt relates the history of Hungary from the earliest times to the coronation of King Matthias. Eleven copies of the chronicle are known to survive, two of them in Hungary: one in the National Széchényi Library and another in the Budapest University Library.\n\nThe third chronicle entitled \"Chronica Hungarorum\", partly based on the \"Chronicon Pictum\", was produced by Johannes de Thurocz Hungarian: Thuróczy János, c.1435-90, ed.

It covers the period of 1375-1425 and focuses on the ascent of the Tocco family, and especially Carlo I Tocco, Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, to the rule over the Despotate of Epirus, as well as Carlo's conquest of territories in the Morea.\n\nThe author, who remains unknown, described events that occurred during his own lifetime and must have been present in some of them. He possibly belonged to the court of Carlo I Tocco and came from Ioannina. From the text we can deduce that he was not particularly educated since he was using simple language.\n\nThe author describes the Toccos as fair governors, who care for the rights of their people. It is remarkable, that he does not mention the Latin descent of the noble family. He appears to cultivate a sense of early Greek nationalism and to hate the Albanians. \n\nThe \"Chronicle\" was published for the first time in 1975 by Giuseppe Schirò (\"Cronaca dei Tocco di Cefalonia; prolegomeni, testo critico e traduzione\", Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae 10. Rome: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1975). It comprises 3923 verses and was found in the \"codex Vaticanus Graecus\" 1831. The beginning and the end of the text is missing. This codex was written before June 1429, possibly from the author, as G. Schirò believed. There is also a 16th-century copy of it, \"codex Vatic. gr.\" 2214. Elisabeth Zachariadou proved that the first pages of the codex were placed in a wrong order and suggested a different order for the first 1,000 verses, which makes the text more coherent and easier to understand. \n\nThe \"Chronicle\", despite its unimportant literary quality, has significant value as an historical source, as well as a linguistic source for the language of that era.\n\n"}

The project will establish the technological building-blocks needed for the evolution of today’s diverse G2P databases into a future seamless G2P biomedical knowledge environment, by the projects end. This will consist of a European-centred but globally networked hierarchy of bioinformatics GRID-linked databases, tools and standards, all tied into the Ensembl genome browser. The project has the following specific objectives:\nThe GEN2PHEN Consortium members have been selected from a talented pool of European research groups and companies that are interested in the G2P database challenge. Additionally, a few non-EU participants have been included to bring extra capabilities to the initiative. The final constellation is characterised by broad and proven competence, a network of established working relationships, and high-level roles/connections within other significant projects in this domain...\n\nBy providing a complete Homo sapiens ‘parts list’ (the gene sequences) and a powerful ‘toolkit’ (technologies), the Human Genome Project has revolutionised mankind’s ability to explore how genes cause disease and other phenotypes. Studies in this domain are proceeding at a rapid and ever-increasing pace, generating unprecedented amounts of raw and processed data. It is now imperative that the scientific community finds ways to effectively manage and exploit this flood of information for knowledge creation and practical benefit to society. This fundamental goal lies at the heart of the “Genotype-To-Phenotype Databases: A Holistic Solution (GEN2PHEN)” project.\n\nPrevious genetics studies have shown that inter-individual genome variation plays a major role in differential normal development and disease processes. However, the details of how these relationships work are far from clear, even in the case of most Mendelian disorders where single genetic alterations are fully penetrant (essentially causative, rather than risk modifying). Background genetic effects (modifier genes), epistasis, somatic variation, and environmental factors all complicate the situation. This is particularly the case in complex, multi-factorial disorders (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia) that will affect most of us at some stage in our lifetime. Strategies do, however, now exist to study the genetics of these disorders, and such investigations are a major focus of research throughout Europe and beyond. A common thread in these studies is the need to create ever-larger datasets and integrate these more effectively.\n\nSuccess in deciphering the mechanisms and pathways underpinning genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) relationships will bring about radical new opportunities for predicting, preventing, diagnosing, and treating all forms of illness. It will launch an era of truly effective personalised medicine. Extensive research is therefore being conducted worldwide to characterise genetic variation in normal and disease contexts. Sadly though, the resulting flood of primary information is not yet being managed or utilised as effectively as it should be - due simply to the lack of a sufficiently organised and mature database infrastructure by which the discoveries can be gathered, stored, integrated and queried as a composite whole in the electronic (internet) domain. Furthermore, whilst new positive findings are being handled sub-optimally, ‘negative’ observations are in most cases not even reported in any way, shape, or form – despite the fact that they constitute an essential part of any complete and accurate G2P depiction. This needs to change, and an international ‘Human Variome Project’ (HVP) has emerged to help argue this case.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the GEN2PHEN project aims to become the key European contribution to the challenges listed above, harmonised with similar projects elsewhere, and dovetailed into many related European programmes of work. It will provide an important and timely solution to a current research need that was highlighted by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) - Priority area: ‘Upgrade of European Bio-Informatics Infrastructure (Shared platform for data resources in the Life Sciences)’. It will provide European G2P research and biotech industries with the proper support they need in terms of database technologies and data integration systems. Only then can our societies maximally benefit from the current exponentially increasing rate of genetic data generation in disease research and clinical settings.\n\nLooking to the future, one can imagine a world wherein ‘omics’ biomedical sciences are commonplace, even to the point of having one’s genome sequenced in routine medical checkups. In this envisaged world, phenomenally large amounts of G2P data will be produced daily, much of which would flow effortlessly into the internet to be fully absorbed into a sophisticated and powerful ‘biomedical knowledge environment’. Some of this information will be secured for restricted access, whilst much of the raw data and the derived knowledge should be free for everyone to search and exploit.\n\nThe system will enable extensive scientific reporting and discussions, it will provide a core reference platform for medical practice, and it will open exciting new operational vistas for journals, industry, and funders. It will provide for and underpin activities in biomedical research, biotechnology, drug development, and personalised healthcare. And it will probably even impact our basic cultural practices (e.g., insurance, the law, employment policies) as society comes to grips with the immense power and relevance of genetics to the human state. But this envisaged future is nothing like the world we presently live in.\n\nNo system yet exists that even begins to approximate to a ‘biomedical knowledge environment’ properly able to support G2P data gathering and analysis. There are instead a limited number of unconnected G2P databases that are mostly at rather early stages in their development, with no agreed structured way of effectively modelling phenotype data or G2P relationships, and no convenient mode for passing data from discovery laboratories into the database world. A few recent initiatives are building large databases to host individual-specific genotypes and phenotypes to support some high-throughput disease association studies, but these do not have a global remit, have not engaged with the extensive existing knowledge from Medelian disorders, and are not focused on all the research and clinical communities around G2P. Most progress has arguably been made with locus-specific databases (LSDBs) that target specific diseases or genes, but the vast majority of the several hundred LSDBs that do exist are rudimentary in design and implementation, and operationally isolated from one another. This all contrasts with the situation for databases concerned with purely genetic data (without phenotype association), of which there are many, including several large data warehouses and genome browsers that act as central repositories and search centres for all the human and model organism genome sequences, variants, and feature annotations yet produced.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the G2P database field is so poorly developed. Problems include the complexity/diversity of the pertinent data elements, the contemporary nature of the challenge, and certain practical/cultural issues. However, perhaps the most critical obstacle is the overwhelming scale of the problem. Whereas the genome is a bounded domain of only ~3,000,000,000 nucleotides and ~25,000 genes (in man), there is essentially no limit to the number of G2P relationships that can be examined, each by multiple different procedures. The former is thus relatively straightforward and can be managed and hosted in one or a few large data depositories (as has been accomplished). In contrast, the latter is too large in scale and scope to handle in this way.\n\nThere is virtually no limit to how many G2P data will eventually be created, or to their diversity or purpose. The database solutions for G2P information must therefore be based upon new ways of thinking and organising the field’s development - emphasising standards, integration, federation, and broad community participation from the very outset.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jürgen Prochnow, David Warner and Charlton Heston. Informally, the film is the third installment in Carpenter's \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", preceded by \"The Thing\" and \"Prince of Darkness\".\n\nIn the midst of an unspecified disaster, Dr. Wrenn (David Warner) visits John Trent (Sam Neill), a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and Trent recounts his story:\n\nTrent, a freelance insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague, an owner of an insurance company, who asks Trent to work on his largest insured: investigating a claim by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who, after asking him if he reads Sutter Cane, is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent. The man was Cane's agent, who went insane and killed his family after reading one of Cane's books.\n\nTrent meets with Arcane Publishing director Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston), who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), and recovering the manuscript for Cane's final novel. He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in \"less stable readers\". Trent is skeptical, convinced that the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on Cane's book's covers which, when aligned properly, form the outline of New Hampshire and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.\n\nThey set out to find the town. Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.\n\nLinda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, \"In the Mouth of Madness\", which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing Cane passionately. A man (Wilhelm von Homburg) approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent drives away from Hobb's End, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of \"In The Mouth of Madness\" to Arcane Publishing, furthering the end of humanity.\n\nAfter giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He trips and falls, then suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. \"In the Mouth of Madness\" has been on sale for weeks, with a film adaptation in post production. Trent encounters a reader of the newly released novel, who is bleeding from his altered eyes. Trent asks if he is enjoying the book, and when the dazed reader nods, Trent tells him he should not be surprised before swinging the axe. Trent is arrested for the murder.\n\nAfter Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the \"In the Mouth of Madness\" film and discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, including a scene where he insisted to Linda \"This is reality!\", Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying; finally realizing he was a character in the book all along.\n\nMichael De Luca wrote the script in the late 1980s and one of the first directors he offered it to was John Carpenter, who initially passed on the project. New Line Cinema later announced production in 1989 with director Tony Randel attached to direct. Later Mary Lambert was also attached to direct. A few years later, Carpenter signed on as director in December 1992 and filming took place from August to October 1993.\n\nThe town scenes in Hobb's End were filmed on Main Street Unionville, and the exterior of the Black Church is actually the Cathedral of the Transfiguration. Both are located in Markham, Ontario.\n\nThe film pays tribute to the work of seminal horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, with many references to his stories and themes. Its title is a play on Lovecraft's novella, \"At the Mountains of Madness\", and insanity plays as great a role in the film as it does in Lovecraft's fiction. The opening scene depicts Trent's confinement to an asylum, with the bulk of the story told in flashback, a common technique of Lovecraft's. Reference is made to Lovecraftian settings and details (such as a character that shares the name of Lovecraft's Pickman family). Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories : \"The Whisperer of the Dark\" (\"The Whisperer in Darkness\"), \"The Thing in the Basement\" (\"The Thing on the Doorstep\"), \"Haunter out of Time\" (\"The Haunter of the Dark\"/\"The Shadow Out of Time\"), etc.\n\nThe film can also be seen as a reference to Stephen King, who, like Lovecraft, writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets. King is mentioned towards the beginning of the movie; it is suggested that Cane's work is more frightening than King's and outsells it.\n\n\"In the Mouth of Madness\" was released in December 1994 in Italy, and on February 3, 1995 in the U.S. In the U.S., it grossed $3,441,807 in its first weekend, and $8,946,600 total during its run. It was a financial disappointment, but it did earn enough to cover the film's budget.\n\nA Blu-ray Disc of the film by New Line Cinema was released on October 15, 2013.\nIn 2016, the film was re-released on DVD by Warner Archive Collection.\nShout! Factory re-released the film on Blu Ray in a collector's edition form on July 24, 2018.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.6/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nFrench magazine Cahiers du Cinéma listed the film as #10 on their 1995 Top 10 List.\n\n"}
{"id": "14614512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14614512", "title": "Infrahumanisation", "text": "Infrahumanisation\n\nInfrahumanisation (or infrahumanization) is the tacitly held belief that one's ingroup is more human than an outgroup, which is less human. The term was coined by Jacques-Philippe Leyens and colleagues in the early 2000s to distinguish what they argue to be an everyday phenomenon from dehumanization (denial of humanness) associated with extreme intergroup violence such as genocide. According to Leyens and colleagues, infrahumanisation arises when people view their ingroup and outgroup as essentially different (different in essence) and accordingly reserve the \"human essence\" for the ingroup and deny it to the outgroup. Whether a \"subhuman\" classification means \"human but inferior\" or \"not human at all\" may be academic, as in practice it corresponds to prejudice regardless (for example, compare the Nazi idea of the Untermensch).\n\nThe belief that the outgroup is less human than the ingroup is seldom consciously endorsed by individuals and instead is reflected in the way people tacitly think about the outgroup. Researchers have typically investigated infrahumanisation by looking at the types of emotions people believe ingroup and outgroup members possess. Some emotions are considered unique to humans (e.g., love, regret, nostalgia), whereas others are viewed as common to both humans and animals (e.g., joy, anger, sadness). In a series of studies, Leyens and colleagues have widely replicated the finding that people attribute uniquely human emotions to the ingroup, but not the outgroup. According to infrahumanisation theory, the denial of uniquely human emotions to the outgroup is reflective of the belief that they are less human than the ingroup.\n\nRecent research has investigated how infrahumanisation influences behaviour. In a series of studies, Jeroen Vaes and his colleagues investigated people's reactions to outgroup members who attempt to \"humanise\" themselves through the use of uniquely human emotions. They found that ingroup members reacted negatively to outgroup members' attempts to humanise, offering less help and withdrawing faster than when the same uniquely human emotion was expressed by an ingroup member \"or\" when the outgroup member expressed a non-uniquely human emotion. In an American context, Cuddy and colleagues have investigated the influence of infrahumanisation on intergroup helping behaviour. Examining helping in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Cuddy et al. found that people believed outgroup members experienced less negative uniquely human emotions than ingroup members. The more participants infrahumanised the outgroup member, the less likely they were to help.\n"}

Marx's Theses on Feuerbach were available as a poster thanks to Guy Debord. The situationists did much of the fly postering and along with Pouvoir Ouvrier who turned up for the opening party.\n\nIn 1966 the Situationists fell out with La Vieille Taupe and withdrew their publications. The bookshop continued as a focus of ultraleft activity until its closure in 1972. In 1973 La Vieille Taupe published \"La gauche allemande: Textes du KAPD, de L'AAUD, de L'AAUE et de la KAI (1920-1922) \"with La Vecchia Talpa (Naples) and Invariance.\n\nIn 1979 Pierre Guillaume approached Gérard Lebovici with a proposal to publish the Holocaust denial text \"Le Mensonge d'Ulysse\" by Paul Rassinier. Lebovici refused, so in 1980 Guillaume relaunched La Vieille Taupe as a negationist publishing house. Rassiner's book was the first published. Many of Guillaume's former associates deplore his reuse of the name for a purpose they regard as completely at odds with their former involvement. Some also regard Guillaume's suggestion that Guy Debord was a secret negationist as obscene. Some people view ultra-left negationism as evidence that the ultra-left and ultra-right are very similar - the meeting of the extremes. However most ultra left activists would distance themselves from all forms of negationism, and regard Guillaume's more recent development as a sad decline. Guillaume sees La Vieille Taupe as a genuine ultra left venture which concentrates on \"exposing the lies of the capitalist victors of the Second World War\", even if most of the people who listen to him are from the far-right.\n"}

It is a psalter commissioned by the Mainz archbishop in 1457. The Psalter introduced several innovations: it was the first book to feature a printed date of publication, a printed colophon, two sizes of type, printed decorative initials, and the first to be printed in three colours. The colophon also contains the first example of a printer's mark. It was the first important publication issued by Johann Fust and Peter Schoeffer following their split from Johannes Gutenberg.\n\nThe Psalter combines printed text with two-colour woodcuts: since both woodcuts and movable print are relief processes, they could be printed together on the same press. The Psalter is printed using black and red inks, with two-colour initials, and large coloured capitals printed in blue and red inks. These capitals were partly the work of the artisan known as the Fust master, who later also worked for Fust and Schöffer on the 1462 Bible. The musical score accompanying the psalms was provided in manuscript, and may have been the model for the type style. Printing in two colors, although feasible on the moveable press of Gutenberg's time (as illustrated by the Mainz Psalter), was apparently abandoned soon afterward as being too time-consuming, as few other examples of such a process are extant.\n\nTwo versions were printed, the short issue and long issue. The short has 143 leaves, and the long has 175 and was intended for use in the diocese of Mainz. All surviving copies and fragments are on vellum, and it is not known if any paper copies were printed. At least one copy was still being used in services in a monastery in the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nThe Psalter is the earliest European book with a printed date of publication, though not the first printed book to feature a date associated with its production: in August 1456 the binder and rubricator of a copy of the Gutenberg Bible added handwritten dates to show when these tasks were completed.\n\nThe colophon can be translated as follows:\n\nNew editions, using the same type, were printed in 1459 (dated August 29), 1490, 1502 (Schöffer's last publication) and 1516.\n\nIt is \"the second printed book ever published, and the first with rubricated (red as well as black) printing\".

He was one of the founders of the western academic field of Indian studies and the discipline of comparative religion. Müller wrote both scholarly and popular works on the subject of Indology. The \"Sacred Books of the East\", a 50-volume set of English translations, was prepared under his direction. He also promoted the idea of a Turanian family of languages.\n\nFriedrich Max Müller was born into a cultured family on 6 December 1823 in Dessau, the son of Wilhelm Müller, a lyric poet whose verse Franz Schubert had set to music in his song-cycles \"Die schöne Müllerin\" and \"Winterreise\". His mother, Adelheid Müller (née von Basedow), was the eldest daughter of a prime minister of Anhalt-Dessau. Carl Maria von Weber was a godfather.\n\nMüller was named after his mother's elder brother, Friedrich, and after the central character, Max, in Weber's opera \"Der Freischütz\". Later in life, he adopted Max as a part of his surname, believing that the prevalence of Müller as a name made it too common. His name was also recorded as \"Maximilian\" on several official documents (e.g. university register, marriage certificate), on some of his honours and in some other publications.\n\nMüller entered the gymnasium (grammar school) at Dessau when he was six years old. In 1839, after the death of his grandfather, he was sent to the Nicolai School at Leipzig, where he continued to his studies of music and classics. It was during his time in Leipzig that he frequently met Felix Mendelssohn.\n\nIn need of a scholarship to attend Leipzig University, Müller successfully sat his abitur examination at Zerbst. While preparing, he found that the syllabus differed from what he had been taught, necessitating that he rapidly learn mathematics, modern languages and science. He entered Leipzig University in 1841 to study philology, leaving behind his early interest in music and poetry. Müller received his degree in 1843. His final dissertation was on Spinoza's \"Ethics\". He also displayed an aptitude for classical languages, learning Greek, Latin, Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit.\n\nIn 1850 Müller was appointed deputy Taylorian professor of modern European languages at Oxford University. In the following year, at the suggestion of Thomas Gaisford, he was made an honorary M.A. and a member of the college of Christ Church, Oxford. On succeeding to the full professorship in 1854, he received the full degree of M.A. by Decree of Convocation. In 1858 he was elected to a life fellowship at All Souls' College.\n\nHe was defeated in the 1860 election for the Boden Professor of Sanskrit, which was a \"keen disappointment\" to him. Müller was far better qualified for the post than the other candidate (Monier Monier-Williams), but his broad theological views, his Lutheranism, his German birth and lack of practical first-hand knowledge of India told against him. After the election he wrote to his mother, \"all the best people voted for me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the \"vulgus profanum\" made the majority\".\n\nLater in 1868, Müller became Oxford's first Professor of Comparative Philology, a position founded on his behalf. He held this chair until his death, although he retired from its active duties in 1875.\n\nIn 1844, prior to commencing his academic career at Oxford, Müller studied in Berlin with Friedrich Schelling. He began to translate the \"Upanishads\" for Schelling, and continued to research Sanskrit under Franz Bopp, the first systematic scholar of the Indo-European languages (IE). Schelling led Müller to relate the history of language to the history of religion. At this time, Müller published his first book, a German translation of the \"Hitopadesa\", a collection of Indian fables.\n\nIn 1845 Müller moved to Paris to study Sanskrit under Eugène Burnouf. Burnouf encouraged him to publish the complete Rigveda, making use of the manuscripts available in England. He moved to England in 1846 to study Sanskrit texts in the collection of the East India Company. He supported himself at first with creative writing, his novel \"German Love\" being popular in its day.\n\nMüller's connections with the East India Company and with Sanskritists based at Oxford University led to a career in Britain, where he eventually became the leading intellectual commentator on the culture of India. At the time, Britain controlled this territory as part of its Empire. This led to complex exchanges between Indian and British intellectual culture, especially through Müller's links with the Brahmo Samaj.\n\nMüller's Sanskrit studies came at a time when scholars had started to see language development in relation to cultural development. The recent discovery of the Indo-European language group had started to lead to much speculation about the relationship between Greco-Roman cultures and those of more ancient peoples. In particular the Vedic culture of India was thought to have been the ancestor of European Classical cultures. Scholars sought to compare the genetically related European and Asian languages to reconstruct the earliest form of the root-language. The Vedic language, Sanskrit, was thought to be the oldest of the IE languages.\n\nMüller devoted himself to the study of this language, becoming one of the major Sanskrit scholars of his day. He believed that the earliest documents of Vedic culture should be studied to provide the key to the development of pagan European religions, and of religious belief in general. To this end, Müller sought to understand the most ancient of Vedic scriptures, the \"Rig-Veda.\" Müller was greatly impressed by Ramakrishna Paramhansa, his contemporary and proponent of Vedantic philosophy, and wrote several essays and books about him.\nFor Müller, the study of the language had to relate to the study of the culture in which it had been used. He came to the view that the development of languages should be tied to that of belief-systems. At that time the Vedic scriptures were little-known in the West, though there was increasing interest in the philosophy of the Upanishads. Müller believed that the sophisticated Upanishadic philosophy could be linked to the primitive henotheism of early Vedic Brahmanism from which it evolved. He had to travel to London to look at documents held in the collection of the British East India Company. While there he persuaded the company to allow him to undertake a critical edition of the Rig-Veda, a task he pursued over many years (1849–1874). He completed the critical edition for which he is most remembered.. \"Scientific American\" carried his obituary in the December 8th, 1900 edition of the magazine. It was revealed that Max Muller had in fact usurped the full credit for the translation of the Rig veda which was actually not his work at all, but of another unnamed german scholar whom Muller had paid to translate the text. To quote from his obituary in \"Scientific American\", \"What he constantly proclaimed to be his own great work, the edition of the \"Rig Veda,\" was in reality not his at all. A German scholar did the work, and Muller appropriated the credit for it.\"\n\nFor Müller, the culture of the Vedic peoples represented a form of nature worship, an idea clearly influenced by Romanticism. Müller shared many of the ideas associated with Romanticism, which coloured his account of ancient religions, in particular his emphasis on the formative influence on early religion of emotional communion with natural forces. He saw the gods of the Rig-Veda as active forces of nature, only partly personified as imagined supernatural persons. From this claim Müller derived his theory that mythology is \"a disease of language\". By this he meant that myth transforms concepts into beings and stories. In Müller's view, \"gods\" began as words constructed to express abstract ideas, but were transformed into imagined personalities. Thus the Indo-European father-god appears under various names: Zeus, Jupiter, Dyaus Pita. For Müller all these names can be traced to the word \"\"Dyaus\",\" which he understood to imply \"shining\" or \"radiance\". This leads to the terms \"deva\", \"deus\", \"theos\" as generic terms for a god, and to the names \"Zeus\" and \"Jupiter\" (derived from deus-pater). In this way a metaphor becomes personified and ossified. This aspect of Müller's thinking was later explored similarly by Nietzsche.\n\nIn 1888, Müller was appointed Gifford Lecturer at the University of Glasgow. These Gifford Lectures were the first in an annual series, given at several Scottish universities, that has continued to the present day. Over the next four years, Müller gave four series of lectures. The titles and order of the lectures were as follows:\n\n\nIn 1881, he published a translation of the first edition of Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\". He agreed with Schopenhauer that this edition was the most direct and honest expression of Kant's thought. His translation corrected several errors that were committed by previous translators. In his Translator's Preface, Müller wrote \nMüller continued to be influenced by the Kantian Transcendentalist model of spirituality, and was opposed to Darwinian ideas of human development. He argued that \"language forms an impassable barrier between man and beast.\"\n\nHe was also influenced by the work \"Thought and Reality\", of the Russian philosopher African Spir. \n\nIn his career, Müller several times expressed the view that a \"reformation\" within Hinduism needed to occur, comparable to the Christian Reformation. In his view, \"if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed... Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states\".\n\nHe used his links with the Brahmo Samaj to encourage such a reformation on the lines pioneered by Ram Mohan Roy. Müller believed that the Brahmos would engender an Indian form of Christianity and that they were in practice \"Christians, without being Roman Catholics, Anglicans or Lutherans\". In the Lutheran tradition, he hoped that the \"superstition\" and idolatry, which he considered to be characteristic of modern popular Hinduism, would disappear.\n\nMüller wrote: \nThe translation of the \"Veda\" will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.\n\nMüller hoped that increased funding for education in India would promote a new form of literature combining Western and Indian traditions. In 1868 he wrote to George Campbell, the newly appointed Secretary of State for India:\n\nIn his sixties and seventies, Müller gave a series of lectures, which reflected a more nuanced view in favour of Hinduism and the ancient literature from India. In his \"What can India teach us?\" lecture at University of Cambridge, he championed ancient Sanskrit literature and India as follows:\n\nHe also conjectured that the introduction of Islam in India in the 11th century had a deep effect on the psyche and behaviour of Hindus in another lecture, \"Truthful Character of the Hindus\":\n\nSwami Vivekananda, who was the foremost disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, met Müller over a lunch on 28 May 1896. Regarding Müller and his wife, the Swami later wrote:\n\nDuring the course of his Gifford Lectures on the subject of \"natural religion\", Müller was severely criticised for being anti-Christian. In 1891, at a meeting of the Established Presbytery of Glasgow, Mr. Thomson (Minister of Ladywell) moved a motion that Müller's teaching was \"subversive of the Christian faith, and fitted to spread pantheistic and infidel views amongst the students and others\" and questioned Müller's appointment as lecturer. An even stronger attack on Müller was made by Monsignor Alexander Munro in St Andrew's Cathedral. Munro, an officer of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland (and Provost of the Catholic Cathedral of Glasgow from 1884 to 1892), declared that Müller's lectures \"were nothing less than a crusade against Divine revelation, against Jesus Christ, and against Christianity\". The blasphemous lectures were, he continued, \"the proclamation of atheism under the guise of pantheism\" and \"uprooted our idea of God, for it repudiated the idea of a personal God\".\n\nSimilar accusations had already led to Müller's exclusion from the Boden chair in Sanskrit in favour of the conservative Monier Monier-Williams. By the 1880s Müller was being courted by Charles Godfrey Leland, medium and Freemason Helena Blavatsky, and other writers who were seeking to assert the merits of \"pagan\" religious traditions over Christianity. The designer Mary Fraser Tytler stated that Müller's book \"Chips from a German Workshop\" (a collection of his essays) was her \"Bible\", which helped her to create a multi-cultural sacred imagery.\n\nMüller distanced himself from these developments, and remained within the Lutheran faith in which he had been brought up. According to G. Beckerlegge, \"Müller's background as a Lutheran German and his identification with the Broad Church party\" led to \"suspicion by those opposed to the political and religious positions that they felt Müller represented\", particularly his latitudinarianism.\n\nAlthough Müller took a strong religious and academic interest in Hinduism and other non-Christian religions, and often compared Christianity to religions that many traditional Protestants would have regarded as primitive or false, he grounded his Perennialism in a belief that Christianity possessed the fullest truth of all living religions. Twenty-first century scholars of religion, far from accusing Müller of being anti-Christian, have critically examined Müller's theological project as evidence for a bias towards Christian conceptions of God in early academic religious studies.\n\nMüller attempted to formulate a philosophy of religion that addressed the crisis of faith engendered by the historical and critical study of religion by German scholars on the one hand, and by the Darwinian revolution on the other. He was wary of Darwin's work on human evolution, and attacked his view of the development of human faculties. His work was taken up by cultural commentators such as his friend John Ruskin, who saw it as a productive response to the crisis of the age (compare Matthew Arnold's \"Dover Beach\"). He analysed mythologies as rationalisations of natural phenomena, primitive beginnings that we might denominate \"protoscience\" within a cultural evolution. Müller also proposed an early, mystical interpretation of theistic evolution, using Darwinism as a critique of mechanical philosophy.\n\nIn 1870 Müller gave a short course of three lectures for the British Institution on language as the barrier between man and beast, which he called \"On Darwin's Philosophy of Language\". Müller specifically disagreed with Darwin's theories on the origin of language and that the language of man could have developed from the language of animals. In 1873, he sent a copy of his lectures to Darwin reassuring him that, though he differed from some of Darwin's conclusions, he was one of his \"diligent readers and sincere admirers\".\n\nMüller's work contributed to the developing interest in Aryan culture, which often set Indo-European (\"Aryan\") traditions in opposition to Semitic religions. He was \"deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms\", as this was far from his intention. For Müller the discovery of common Indian and European ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that \"an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar\" and that \"the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians\".\n\nMüller put forward and promoted the theory of a \"Turanian\" family of languages or speech, comprising the Finnic, Samoyedic, \"Tataric\" (Turkic), Mongolic, and Tungusic languages. According to Müller these five languages were those \"spoken in Asia or Europe not included under the Arian (sic) and Semitic families, with the exception perhaps of the Chinese and its dialects\". In addition, they were \"nomadic languages,\" in contrast to the other two families (Aryan and Semitic), which he called State or political languages.\n\nThe idea of a Turanian family of languages was not accepted by everyone at the time. Although the term \"Turanian\" quickly became an archaism (unlike \"Aryan\"), it did not disappear completely. The idea was absorbed later into nationalist ideologies in Hungary and Turkey.\n\nIn 1869 Müller was elected to the French \"Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\" as a foreign correspondent (\"associé étranger\").\n\nIn June 1874 Müller was awarded the \"Pour le Mérite\" (civil class), much to his surprise. Soon after, when he was commanded to dine at Windsor, he wrote to Prince Leopold to ask if he \"might\" wear his Order, and the wire came back, \"Not \"may\", but \"must\".\"\n\nIn 1875 Müller was awarded the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. The award is given to acknowledge excellent and outstanding achievements in the field of science and art. In a letter to his mother dated 19 December, Müller wrote that the award was more showy than the \"Pour le Mérite\", \"but that is the best\".\n\nIn 1896 Müller was appointed a member of the Privy Council.\n\nMüller became a naturalized British citizen in 1855, at the age of 32.\n\nHe married Georgina Adelaide Grenfell on 3 August 1859. The couple had four children – Ada, Mary, Beatrice and Wilhelm Max – of whom two predeceased them.\n\nGeorgina (died 1919) had his papers and correspondence bound; they are at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\n\nMüller's health began deteriorating in 1898 and he died at his home in Oxford on 28 October 1900. He was interred at Holywell Cemetery on 1 November 1900.\n\nAfter his death a memorial fund was opened at Oxford for \"the promotion of learning and research in all matters relating to the history and archaeology, the languages, literatures, and religions of ancient India\".\n\nThe Goethe Institutes in India are named Max Müller Bhavan in his honour, as is a street (Max Mueller Marg) in New Delhi.\n\nMüller's biographies include those by Lourens van den Bosch (2002), Jon R. Stone (2002) and Nirad C. Chaudhuri (1974), the last of which was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for English by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. Stephen G. Alter's (2005) work contains a chapter on Müller's rivalry with the American linguist William Dwight Whitney.\n\nMüller's scholarly works, published separately as well as an 18-volume \"Collected Works\", include:\n\n\n\n"}

He was a learned alchemist, epigramist and amateur composer.\n\nMaier was born in Rendsburg, Holstein, the son of a specialist in beadwork in embroidery named Peter Maier. He studied philosophy and medicine at Rostock (1587–1591), Frankfurt (Oder) (M.A. 1592), and Padua (1595–1596). Maier left Padua abruptly after getting involved in a fight, injuring the other party, and being arrested. He went on to the University of Basel, where he attained a doctorate in medicine in October 1596. His doctoral thesis, \"De epilepsia\" was dedicated to Matthias Carnarius. Maier then returned to Holstein to practice medicine. Around 1599, he became interested in alchemy and attempted to create an alchemical concordance, synthesizing the works of different authors.\n\nIn 1608, he went to Prague, and on 19 September 1609, he formally entered the service of Rudolf II as his physician and imperial counsellor. Ten days later, Rudolf raised him to the hereditary nobility and gave him the title of Imperial Count Palatine. He was granted a coat of arms which depicted a bird, bonded together with frog by a golden chain. Around this time, Maier published an extremely limited print run of \"De Medicina Regia et vere Heroica, Coelidonia\" (1609), including in it his autobiography. The interest of the emperor in the occult was the reason of his high esteem for Maier. However, by April 1611, Rudolf's political position had substantially deteriorated, and he was more or less imprisoned in his castle in Prague Maier left the city that month. He corresponded with Moritz of Hessen-Kassel, and visited Hessen-Kassel's brother-in-law, Count Ernst III of Holstein-Schauenburg. He was also a guest of Christoph Reinhard, Doctor of Laws and town syndic of Mühlhausen, to whom he later dedicated his book \"Atalanta Fugiens\".\n\nFirst Maier visited the Netherlands where he stayed with Petrus Carpenterius in Rotterdam. Carpernterius had previously been the rector of a Walloon school in Norwich in 1598. From there he continued on to London arriving in 1611 or 1612. Whether he had arrived in person or not by Christmas 1611 is unknown, but he did send Christmas cards to both James I and his son Prince Henry.\n\nHe composed a wedding song for the nuptials of Frederick V of the Palatinate to Elizabeth Stuart daughter of James I. He was in London on 6 November 1612, attending the Funeral of Prince Henry in the retinue of Frederick of the Palatinate.\n\nHis first well-known book, \"Arcana arcanissima\", was published in London in 1613 or 1614, and he dedicated copies to a number of notables, including the Bishop of Ely and Sir Thomas Smith of the East India Company.\nMaier returned to Germany in September 1616, settling in Frankfurt am Main. His \"Atalanta Fugiens\", an alchemical emblem book, was published in 1617. Alongside images, poems, and discussion, it included fifty pieces of music in the form of fugues, the form itself being a pun on Atalanta \"fleeing\". In 1619, Maier became the physician of Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). In 1620, he moved to Magdeburg to practice medicine, where he died at the age of 54, leaving a noteworthy quantity of unpublished works.\n\nA devout Lutheran all his life, Michael Maier had a strong influence on Sir Isaac Newton. He was also involved in the Rosicrucian movement that appeared around this time, which afforded part of the matter of his \"Themis aurea\".\n\nThe 1656 English translation of Themis Aurea appeared as \"Themis Aurea: The Laws of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross\", and was dedicated to Elias Ashmole. Under the initials N.L.T.S. and H.S. the dedicators justified their dedication over three pages; they are now identified as Nathaniel Hodges, and Thomas Hodges (either his father or his brother, both of that name). Ashmole, they said, began to learn seal engraving, casting in sand, and goldsmith's work when living in Blackfriars, London, at which time he was initiated into rosicrucian \"secrets\" by William Backhouse of Swallowfield in Berkshire. While illustrating the chain of Rosie Cross links from Michael Maier and Robert Fludd, via Backhouse to Ashmole, the details given about Ashmole's training as a craftsman could illustrate the background of the latter's acception in operative masonry.\n\nJames Brown Craven, who gave detailed descriptions of the works above in his \"catalogue raissonée\" (1910) of Michael Maier, also included the 1654 English translation of \"Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passtime. A Philosophical Discourse ...wherein Hermes or Mercury is declared King of all Worldly things\". The copy from the Bodleian Library described by Craven was dedicated \"To the Honourable Cary Dillon, Esq., Son to Robert, late Earle of Roscommon by J. de la Salle\" [i.e., John Hall of Durham]. This is a fair example of the intellectual circle in which Maier's work circulated contemporary with the association of Rosie Cross with Elias Ashmole.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "618928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=618928", "title": "Monoculturalism", "text": "Monoculturalism\n\nMonoculturalism is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group. It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups. In this context, it may also involve the process of assimilation whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of cultural diversity, is the opposite of multiculturalism.\nRather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country's national culture via the exclusion of external influences. Japan, China, South Korea, and North Korea are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. For instance, some European countries such as Finland are still effectively monocultural because of the people's shared culture and ethnicity.\n\nThe idea of monoculturalism can be expanded to that of ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism being the idea that one's ethnic background is superior to that of others. A feeling of superiority is one that can project mono-cultural ideals in an attempt to justify intrinsic ways of thinking. In nations with a majority of the population being native, ethnocentrism is blindly put upon those of other cultural backings. The idea of ethnocentrism being combined with monoculturalism yields many examples from history. Most obvious is the Holocaust, but further from that is any instance of genocide or simple racism. In defining genocide you can find the correlation it has with monoculturalism, and how it can be a resultant of mono-cultural, as well as, ethnocentric thinking.\n\nIn many of the genocides practiced throughout history, some of them were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutu's and Tutsi's from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.\n\nA similar example to that of the Rwandan Genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from England, in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn't involve many of Burma's Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them. Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the Karen, have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.\n\nGlobalization involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar world views, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale. Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.\n\n\n"}

The online edition is updated regularly.\n\nThe book contains information on the state, city, county, and federal governments in Oregon, educational institutions, finances, the economy, resources, population figures and demographics.\n\nThe 1919 edition contained a \"statement of registered motor vehicles, chauffeurs, and dealers from 1905 to 1919\", and \"a general summary of in the taxable property in Oregon from 1858 to 1918\".\n\nSecretary of State Ben Olcott published the first edition in 1911 in response to an \"increased demand for information of a general character concerning Oregon\".\n\nEarly editions of the book were available free from the State.

This was following complaints by Representative Monroe Sweetland that the book was \"obsolete, carelessly edited, and only of limited use.\" Calling the book \"an inferior job\", Sweetland criticized the timing of book's publication long after elections, as well as the map in the back. As a result, the 1953 Legislative Assembly passed a law requiring the book be published soon after the legislature convenes.\n\nThe 1993–94 edition of the book contained a four-page erratum.

It has been published every year since 1948. Its main purposes are to review the previous English season and to provide detailed career records and potted biographies of current players. It is produced in a \"pocket-sized\" format, being approximately 5×4 in (i.e., about 13×10 cm), so that it is a convenient size for carrying to cricket matches. The front cover of each edition has featured a photograph of a prominent current cricketer. There is a popular myth that this \"honour\" has a \"hex\" or \"curse\" associated with it, as the player featured then invariably has a poor season.\n\nThe original publisher was Playfair Books Ltd of London, which had its office at Curzon Street when the first edition was published in April 1948; the company relocated soon afterwards to Haymarket. The name Playfair was chosen because it reads as \"play fair\", as confirmed by C B Fry who began his foreword to the first edition in 1948: \"This Playfair Annual (and what a proper title for a book about the Noble Game) will commend itself to innumerable readers\". The first editor was Peter West who was succeeded in 1954 by Gordon Ross. Roy Webber was the statistician at Playfair for many years and was described by West as \"that ace of statisticians\".\n\nThe \"Playfair Cricket Annual\" is one of a series of similar pocket sized sporting annuals published under the Playfair name. Others have included \"Playfair Football Annual\", \"Playfair Rugby League Annual\" and \"Playfair Racing Annual\". In addition the Playfair name was used for record books produced by Roy Webber and for the magazine Playfair Cricket Monthly. A number of tour brochures were also produced by Playfair Books.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1962 the annual was a larger size, 4¾×7¼ in (12×18 cm) and had a different style, being printed on glossy paper and including numerous photographs. In 1962 the Playfair titles were acquired by Dickens Press which had just published \"The Cricket Annual\", edited by Roy Webber. In 1963, Dickens published a new style \"Playfair Cricket Annual\", keeping the same name but basing the size, format and price on \"The Cricket Annual\". Therefore, the 2013 edition is the 66th in total, but the annual has been published in its current compact size only since the 1963 edition (the 16th).\n\nIn addition, \"Playfair Cricket World Cup Guide\", in 1996, and \"Playfair Cricket World Cup 1999\" were published in the same format as the regular annual to cover the International limited overs competitions in India/Pakistan/Sri Lanka and England/Scotland/Ireland/Netherlands in those years respectively. Both of those were also edited by Bill Frindall.\n\nThe current publisher is Headline Publishing Group with Ian Marshall, who succeeded Bill Frindall on an acting basis in 2009 and permanently for the 2010 edition, as editor. There are several specialist contributors, notably Philip Bailey who compiles the career records.\n\nThe following tables provide a summary of each annual by reference to editor, size and price:\n\nIn each of the first 15 editions there was a 16-page photographic section in addition to the numbered pages. The 1948 annual was actually called \"Playfair Books Cricket Annual\" but subsequent years were simply called \"Playfair Cricket Annual\". There were two issues of the 1948 annual with a difference in the back cover. One had a Playfair logo, the other a Schweppes advertisement.\n\n\nFrom the 1998 edition onwards a thumbnail picture also appeared on the spine of the annual. This has been a smaller version of the front cover photograph except in 1998 and 2008, when it was the back cover picture, and in 2006 and 2010 when the Ashes urn was depicted.\n\nApart from those on the covers, there are no photographs in any of the annuals from 1963.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1962 the annual produced a list of its Eleven Cricketers of the Year for the previous season. Tony Lock was selected 7 times, Peter May 6 times.\n\n\nSince the first compact edition of 1963, the core of the publication has been a section providing a county by county list of current cricketers with potted biographies, their county averages in the previous season together with some introductory notes on the county and the major county records.\n\nThe county clubs are listed in alphabetical order. Until 1962, the biographies occupied less space and were not sorted by county club. Introductory information about each county club has expanded, largely because of the introduction of limited overs cricket competitions. A much longer list of officials is now given; originally only the secretary and captain were given. Until 1972 most editions gave potted scores for each club's home matches but lack of space caused this to be removed.\n\nCurrently, the annual's contents typically include:\n\nAs one of the leading statistical cricket publications, Playfair has to take a view on the status of Test, One Day International, first-class and domestic one-day (i.e. List A) matches. It generally complies with the statistics published by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and will sometimes ignore official rulings: e.g., the ICC ruling that South African rebel tours between 1981–82 and 1989–90 were not first-class matches. The 2010 edition overturned Frindall's long-held view that the match between Australia and an ICC World XI in 2005/06 should not be regarded as a Test Match and now includes it in its Test record section.\n"}

Founded in May 2006 under the stewardship of Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist political theorist and former University of Nevada, Las Vegas Business School professor, PFS presents itself as a more radically right-libertarian alternative to the free-market Mont Pelerin Society. The PFS holds annual conferences where paleolibertarian and paleoconservative intellectuals deliver speeches and exchange ideas in what Hoppe suggests is a \"political-correctness-free zone\".\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals: \nOn the one hand, positively, it was to explain and elucidate the legal, economic, cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free, state-less natural order.\nOn the other hand, negatively, it was to unmask the State and showcase it for what it really is: an institution run by gangs of murderers, plunderers, and thieves, surrounded by willing executioners, propagandists, sycophants, crooks, liars, clowns, charlatans, dupes and useful idiots – an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches.\n\nConferences have been held annually since 2006, in Bodrum, Turkey. The tenth conference was held in September 2015. Since 2013 they have been held in September. \n\nThe PFS annual meeting explicitly aims to promote discrimination as logical choice, affirming individual responsibility - attracting growing support from intellectuals and entrepreneurs from around the globe due to their purported realisation that there is no practical difference between discrimination and choice. In addition to the formal proceedings of the conferences, there are integrated activities such as a boat trip into the Aegean Sea, excursions to local fishing villages, and firework displays followed by gala nights.\nThe evolution of the nature of the conferences was described in a talk on the History of the Property and Freedom Society in 2015 at the 10th Anniversary Meeting.\n\nThe Eighth Annual Meeting of PFS was held in from September 19–24, 2013. Topics on the agenda included \"The Myth of American Exceptionalism,\" \"World War Two Revisited,\" and \"Why are the Jews So Smart?,\" as well as a presentation on the history of race relations in the United States delivered by white nationalist and segregationist Jared Taylor. PFS Founder Hans-Hermann Hoppe presented his remarks \"On the Nature of Man, Truth, and Justice.\" It featured lectures by LSU law school graduate Stephan Kinsella on the legal structure of an anarchist society; lectures by Hoppe on Rothbardian economics; and discussions on the role of race in America by racialist scientist Richard Lynn and white nationalists Jared Taylor and Richard B. Spencer. Other speakers who have spoken at PFS include: Paul Gottfried, Peter Brimelow, John Derbyshire, and Justin Raimondo. English classical liberal and Libertarian Alliance Director Sean Gabb has spoken at a number of meetings on a variety of topics including the link between conservatism and liberty, the case against the War of American Independence, and the life and politics of Enoch Powell.\n\nSean Gabb has produced a record of several meetings of the Property and Freedom Society.\n\nNoting the racialist affiliations of Richard Lynn and Jared Taylor, the Southern Poverty Law Center condemned the PFS as a \"serious academic racist event\" populated by the \"movers and shakers\" of the racialist movement. A May 11, 2007 \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" article described the Anti-Defamation League's criticism of PFS and noted that Lynn has described black people as \"more psychopathic than whites\".\n\nA 2013 Anti-Defamation League report about \"increased cooperation\" between European and American racists referred to Taylor as a white supremacist and cited his appearance at the 2013 PFS conference.\n\n"}
{"id": "32158773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32158773", "title": "Ralph Townsend", "text": "Ralph Townsend\n\nRalph Townsend (27 November 1900 – 25 January 1976) was an American author, consul and political activist noted for his opposition to the entry of the United States into World War II. He served in the foreign service as a consul stationed in Canada and China from 1931 to 1933. Shortly after returning to the United States he came to prominence through his book \"\", a harsh critique of Chinese culture which became a widely controversial bestseller. Townsend became a prominent advocate of non-interventionism, and in the 1930s and 1940s was well known for his vocal opposition to the Roosevelt administration's foreign policy from a pro-Japanese and pro-neutrality point of view.\n\nFollowing the US entry into World War II Townsend was arrested for acting as a Japanese agent without registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He pleaded guilty, admitting that he had accepted payments before the war from a propaganda organization funded by the Japanese government, but denying that he was a Japanese agent. He received a prison sentence and while serving was involved in the Great Sedition Trial. After the war Townsend moved to Fairfax, Virginia, where he died on 25 January 1976. His writings continue to be influential in far-right circles.\n\nRalph Townsend was born on 27 November 1900 in Raynham, North Carolina to \"one of Robeson county's oldest and most prominent families.\" He was the son of Richard Walter Townsend (1859–1937) and Mara Aurora McDuffie Townsend (1866–1906). He had four sisters and brothers, including Dallas Townsend, Sr.. After graduating from Mount Hermon Preparatory School in Massachusetts, he attended Columbia University in New York City and in 1924 received his degree from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He worked as a journalist in San Francisco for several years before returning to New York where he taught English at Columbia University from 1927 to 1930. On 11 November 1930 he passed the foreign service test and was posted to Montreal, Canada, as vice-consul on 20 December 1930.\n\nHis second assignment was to Shanghai, where he officially served as vice-consul between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932, though a two-month temporary detail kept him in the city long enough to witness the Shanghai Incident firsthand. After that he was stationed in Fuzhou up to his resignation from the service on 1 March 1933.\n\nTownsend's experiences in China formed the basis of his first book \"Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China\", the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally. Billed as doing \"for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India\", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip of civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of critical thinking skills. He concludes that the \"outstanding characteristics\" of the Chinese people \"neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves\" and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country. He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively \"sentimentalist\" ones adopted by the United States.\n\n\"Ways That Are Dark\" became a bestseller and attracted vociferous reactions from both critics and supporters. Writing for \"Current History\", E. Francis Brown praised the book as \"a welcome antidote to much that has been written in recent years and some of its conclusions might be well pondered by those who shape America's Far Eastern Policy,\" but by contrast the prominent sinologist Owen Lattimore denounced the work as \"a general indictment of a whole race\" which lacked insight, relied on second-hand accounts, and would \"only convince people who are convinced already.\" The book itself was entangled in the political turmoil it discussed, being banned by the government of China but distributed free of charge by the government of Japan.\n\n\"The Robesonian\", a newspaper of Townsend's native county, reported in February 1934 that he had \"aroused more glowing praise and bitter abuse for his lectures and written comments on China than any other recent speaker and writer on Far East affairs.\" Townsend moved from New York back to San Francisco in 1934 where he continued to write and give lectures on Asian issues as well as teaching classes at Stanford University and advertising for the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation. Until 1941 he resided in a number of Californian cities near San Francisco.\n\nIn 1936, Townsend published his second book, \"Asia Answers\", in which he heaps praise on what he deems to be Japan's thriving political, economic, and cultural model and its growing and positive influence in Asia. He attributes anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States to pro-communist \"liberals\", above all the sensationalist newspaper editors and journalists who, he believes, despise Japan due to its status as the leading capitalist nation in Asia. He condemns liberals for having already wrecked the US economy, warns of a possible communist takeover of the United States, and ends by advocating that America resist anti-Japanese warmongering and adopt a foreign policy of neutrality towards Asia.\n\nTownsend predicted that \"Asia Answers\" might have a frosty reception from reviewers because of what he alleged to be the pro-Soviet biases of the media, and indeed, the book received negative coverage in \"The China Weekly Review\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"The Times of India\", and \"The Living Age\", the last of which deemed \"Asia Answers\" a work \"suspiciously similar to press releases by the Tokyo Foreign Office\" which would appeal to \"none except avowed Fascists\". Among the book's detractors was also Pearl S. Buck who described it as \"so fraught with the prejudices and personality of the writer that it is impossible to criticize any of it without involving the author's whole scheme.\" On the other hand, the book was received more positively in Japan and in Manchukuo, where Sadatomo Koyama, a leader in the Manchuria Youth League, declared that \"[Townsend's] understanding of China is impeccable\" and strongly promoted the work. In 1937 Townsend made a trip to Japan coinciding with the release of the book's Japanese translation.\n\nAfter returning from Japan, Townsend, who described himself as a \"conservative\", was highly active in writing articles, delivering lectures, and making radio broadcasts in support of the movement to keep the United States out of the conflicts in Asia and Europe. In explaining the reason for his participation in the pro-neutrality movement, Townsend stated that while serving as a consul abroad he had \"learned enough of the rottenness of international politics ... to wish to do my part of peace for this country.\"\n\nClaiming that publishers would no longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets. Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists. Two of them, \"The High Cost of Hate\" and \"America Has No Enemies In Asia\", had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, \"There Is No Halfway Neutrality\" printed 30,000 copies. The last pamphlet in the series, \"Seeking Foreign Trouble\", attracted the attention of the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it.\n\nIn his pamphlets, Townsend speaks out against boycotting products from Japan, noting that America does considerably more trade with Japan than China and arguing that peaceful trade with Japan and Nazi Germany would serve the interests of American workers and consumers. He blames \"red elements\" within China for starting the Second Sino-Japanese War, but praises Japan for the \"humane\" manner in which its armed forces have behaved in China, believing that it is only the Soviet Union and \"a powerful minority\" of pro-communist Americans who are conspiring to push America to war with Japan. Townsend predicts that if the Chinese won their war with Japan, the result would be a communist takeover of China, but he dismisses the idea that Japan might launch an attack on the United States as \"simply too idiotic to discuss.\" On Europe he avers similarly that German conduct is largely a defensive reaction to British and French attempts to \"obliterate the Germans as an entity\".\n\nTownsend became an active member of America First after its formation in 1940, and was invited to speak at America First meetings on at least two occasions. Townsend, however, would appear as a private citizen when he came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 8 February 1941 in opposition to the Lend-Lease Act. In a widely publicized testimony, Townsend condemned the legislation as tantamount to \"a war bill\" that would \"assign dictatorial powers to the President\" and would \"make America the unmistakable aggressor against nations which have not sought objectively to molest us.\"\nTownsend's defense of Germany and Japan led him to be labelled as an \"agent\" and a \"propagandist\" by his opponents, charges which Townsend denied. His activism brought him to the attention of George Teeple Eggleston, editor of \"Scribner's Commentator\", an anti-interventionist magazine based in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and in June 1941 Townsend accepted an offer to move to Lake Geneva to serve as a contributor to the magazine. Shortly after Townsend became an assistant editor of \"The Herald\".\n\nTownsend's first run-in with the law occurred on 25 November 1941 when federal prosecutors investigating German-funded propaganda in the United States sought him to answer questions before a grand jury about \"Scribner's Commentator\". When he could not be found at his home in Lake Geneva a nationwide manhunt was launched, but three weeks later Townsend came forward willingly, claiming he had simply been on vacation in the southern United States and hadn't known he was wanted by the government. On 15 December he stated that he had no knowledge about how \"Scribner's Commentator\" was financed, but had strong confidence in the magazine's owners who he knew to be \"good Americans.\" He added that although he had worked to prevent the outbreak of a conflict, he was now fully supportive of the US war effort. It emerged later that Nazi German agents had been surreptitiously bankrolling the magazine.\n\nOn 28 January 1942, FBI agents arrived at Townsend's home and arrested him for having acted as a Japanese agent without registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information, a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940. Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and claimed to be a victim of political persecution, he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee, stating that it was merely a payment in exchange for the bulk sale of his pamphlets. Even so, Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal. Townsend also solicited the support of anti-interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator Rush D. Holt and his longtime friend Senator Gerald Nye, the latter of whom described Townsend as \"a loyal and patriotic American citizen\". The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was, however, unmoved, and deeming his crimes \"repulsive, obscene and macabre\", Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC.\n\nTownsend became a defendant during his prison term in what would become known as the \"Great Sedition Trial\". The trial arose from Roosevelt's conviction, against advice from his Attorney-General Francis Biddle, that the most vocal in defending Nazi Germany be tried for subversion. On 23 July 1942 Townsend and 27 other Americans were charged under the Smith Act and the Espionage Act with having participated in a German-backed conspiracy to publish seditious literature seeking to undermine the morale of members of the United States military. The indictment cited the following statement of Townsend's, which he had written in 1941 prior to US entry into the war, as proof that he had committed sedition: With a fifth of the earth's people kept under their rule by force, [the British] bleat of fighting to liberate subject populations. Fighting now for the triumph of the bloodiest dictatorship ever known – Soviet Russia – they microphone to listening Americans their pious horror of dictatorships.\n\nTownsend was arraigned on 20 August, but strongly questioned the view that his writings were subversive as well as the legal foundations of the charges. Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said the defendants were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war. In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about the validity of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the defendants were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.\n\nThese problems lead to repeated delays in the formal opening of the trial and the indictment had to be laid down a second time on 4 January 1943 after the first had expired. More delays arose, however, and when the indictment was laid down for a third time on 3 January 1944, Townsend's name had been dropped from the list. Although Francis Biddle initially said that Townsend would still be subject to prosecution in the future, in the end no further actions were taken. By then Townsend had was bankrupted by legal costs and was deserted by most of his friends. Biddle himself later called the sedition case \"a dreary farce\".\n\nAt the time \"The Washington Post\" reported that before the war Townsend had accepted money from an individual connected to German agents in return for circulating anti-British pamphlets. Despite all this Townsend still insisted that, \"I was never anybody's foreign agent. All I published was independently written and 100 per cent American\", a stance which he maintained for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn the early-1950s Townsend moved to Fairfax, Virginia and by the time of his death was considered a \"prominent resident\". He helped organize the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce, of which he was the executive director, and in this capacity played a leading role in lobbying the CIA to locate its headquarters in Virginia. He also worked in advance of conservation. In 1967 he appeared before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs as a member of Defenders of Wildlife and between 1972 and 1976 served on that organization's board of directors where he was known for \"his insistence on sound financial management.\"\n\nTownsend maintained friendships with far-right figures after the war, including Harry Elmer Barnes and Willis Carto, and for a time he worked as an editor and contributor to Carto's anti-Semitic magazine, \"The American Mercury\", which introduced Townsend as \"a former Foreign Service officer who made the mistake of fighting FDR's war plans\". Townsend died in Fairfax on 25 January 1976 at the age of 75.\n\nHistorians have noted the stridency with which Townsend put forward his pro-Japanese views before World War II. Justus Doenecke, for instance, described Townsend as \"The most adamant and extreme of the voices in America defending Japanese policy.\" Judith Papachristou concurs that \"Few anti-imperialists were as extreme as isolationist Ralph Townsend\", though Townsend himself rejected the \"isolationist\" label during his life, and instead called himself a \"realist\" and \"Pro-Peace\".\n\nTownsend is still held in esteem by many members of the extreme right in the United States, and recently in Japan as well. After his death his widow Janet turned over his papers to Larry Humphreys, an Oklahoma multimillionaire and supporter of right-wing militia and Christian Identity groups, who referred to Townsend as a man who \"knew FDR was trying to entice Japan into attacking the United States, and FDR had him jailed\". Humphreys stored Townsend's papers in his so-called \"Heritage Library\", though today many of them are held by Barnes Review, an anti-Semitic organization under the leadership of Townsend's old friend Willis Carto. In 1997, Barnes Review re-published \"Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China\" for the first time since World War II with a new foreword written by Carto, who praised Townsend as \"a profound, genuinely courageous and painfully honest writer\". In 2004 a Japanese translation of the Barnes Review edition of \"Ways That Are Dark\" was released in Japan where it became a runaway success and quickly elevated Townsend to \"hero\" status among the Japanese far right.\n\nThe opinion of recent scholars on the quality of his writing have been mixed. Limin Chu, who analyzed his articles on China for the \"Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine\", considered some of the claims as \"either incredibly gullible or deliberately vicious\", while historian Justus Doenecke described his pamphlets as \"crudely written\". In contrast, Peter O'Connor, professor at Musashino University, found the same pamphlets \"well-argued and researched.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1114532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1114532", "title": "Registration authority", "text": "Registration authority\n\nRegistration authorities exist for many standards organizations, such as ANNA (Association of National Numbering Agencies for ISIN), the Object Management Group, W3C, IEEE and others. In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use. This may be by applying the standard, where appropriate, or by verifying that a particular application satisfies the standard's tenants. Maintenance agencies, in contrast, may change an element in a standard based on set rules – such as the creation or change of a currency code when a currency is created or revalued (i.e. TRL to TRY for Turkish lira). The Object Management Group has an additional concept of certified provider, which is deemed an entity permitted to perform some functions on behalf of the registration authority, under specific processes and procedures documented within the standard for such a role.\n\nAn ISO registration authority (RAs) is not authorized to update standards but provides a registration function to facilitate implementation of an International Standard (e.g. ISBN number for books). Frequently, facilitating the implementation of an ISO standard’s requirements is best suited, by its nature, to one entity, an RA. This, de facto, creates a monopoly situation and this is why care needs to be taken with respect to the functions carried out and the fees charged to avoid an abuse of such a situation. In most cases, there is a formal legal contract in place between the standards body, such as the ISO General Secretariat, and the selected registration authority.\n\nISO registration authorities differ from a maintenance agency. Maintenance agencies are authorized to update particular elements in an International Standard and as a matter of policy, the secretariats of MAs are assigned to bodies forming part of the ISO system (member bodies or organizations to which a member body delegates certain tasks in its country). The membership of MAs and their operating procedures are subject to approval by the Technical Management Board.\n\nWhile registration authorities for a particular standard typically do not change, the position is not formally guaranteed and is subject to review and reassignment to a different firm or organization. In some cases, the concept of a registration authority may not exist for a standard at all.\n\nBy further example, the equivalent registration authority organization for Internet standards is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n\nISO standards having registration authorities are:\n\n\n"}

The organization committed 103 known armed robbery, assassination, and bombing attacks, during which 23 people were killed. 17N was designated a terrorist group by Greece, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the United States, and disbanded in 2002 after the arrest and trial of many of its members.\n\nThe group's name, 17N, refers to the final day of the 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising, in which a protest against the Greek Military Junta (1967–1974), also known as the Regime of the Colonels, took place. The uprising was bloodily suppressed by the army. In addition to assassinations, kidnappings, and symbolic attacks on corporate and government offices, 17N supported its operations with at least 11 bank robberies, netting approximately US$3.5 million. Members of 17N kept detailed financial records, found in one of their safe houses in 2002, to document that the stolen money was used for revolutionary purposes.\n\n17N's first attack, on 23 December 1975, was against the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Athens, Richard Welch. Welch was gunned down outside his residence by three assailants, in front of his wife and driver. 17N's repeated claims of responsibility were ignored until December 1976, when it murdered the former intelligence Chief of the Greek security police, Evangelos Mallios and left its proclamation at the scene. In January 1980, 17N murdered Pantelis Petrou, the deputy director of the riot police (MAT), and his driver. It also intervened with two long proclamations offering theoretical guidance to the Greek armed struggle and criticizing a rival group, Revolutionary People's Struggle (ELA) for poor target selection and operational incompetence.\n\n17N resumed its attacks in November 1983, killing the deputy chief of the Joint United States Military Aid Group to Greece George Tsantes. In 1985, it broadened its targeting with the murder of conservative newspaper publisher Nikos Momferatos. The proclamation left near his body accused Momferatos of CIA connections and complained that Greece \"remained a puppet regime in the hands of the American imperialists and the economic establishment.\" In 1986, 17N murdered Dimitris Angelopoulos, one of Greece's leading industrialists, charging that he and other members of Greece's \"lumpen big bourgeoisie class\" were plundering Greece at the expense of workers.\n\n17N responded to the 1988 George Koskotas scandal with a wave of murders and kidnappings. In the 1989 parliamentary elections, 17N urged voters to deface their ballots with the 17N star. The assassination of New Democracy member of parliament Pavlos Bakoyannis in September 1989 prompted public outrage, including among Greek communists who respected Bakoyannis as a courageous anti-Junta journalist. The group abandoned its electoral pretensions and took a more nationalist turn.\n\nOther victims included US Navy Captain William Nordeen, the U.S. defense attache, whose car was destroyed by a car bomb a few meters from his residence on 28 June 1988, and U.S. Air Force Sergeant Ronald O. Stewart, who was killed by a remotely-detonated bomb outside his apartment on 12 March 1991.\n\nIn addition to its anti-American and anti-capitalist agenda, the group was also opposed to Turkey and NATO. Çetin Görgü, the Turkish press attaché, was shot in his car on 7 October 1991; Ömer Haluk Sipahioğlu, a Turkish embassy counselor, was shot on an Athens street on 4 July 1994; ship and shipyard owner Constantinos Peratikos was shot leaving his office on 28 May 1997; and British military attaché Brigadier Stephen Saunders was shot on 8 June 2000.\n\n17N used two .45 M1911 semi-automatics as its \"signature weapons\". While face-to-face assassination was the early modus operandi, in 1985 the group exploded its first bomb, targeting a bus full of riot police; a long cable was used to detonate explosives made of stolen quarrying explosives, which killed one.\n\nIn October 1986, 17N bombed four tax offices in its first low-level attack against property. In December 1988, 17N stole 114 obsolete anti-tank rockets from a poorly-guarded Greek military depot. Between 1990 and 1999, 17N conducted 24 rocket attacks, all but three of them aimed at property rather than human targets. In November 1990, a rocket attack against the armored limousine of shipowner Vardis Vardinogiannis failed. In 1991, 17N rocketed a riot police bus, killing one officer and wounding 14. In July 1992, a young passerby, Thanos Axarlian, was killed in a failed rocket attack on Economy Minister Ioannis Paleokrassas.\n\nAfter their inaugural attack on the CIA station chief, the group tried to get mainstream newspapers to publish their manifesto. Their first proclamation, claiming the murder of Richard Welch, was first sent to \"Libération\" in Paris, France. It was given to the publisher of \"Libération\" via the offices of Jean-Paul Sartre, but was not published. After subsequent attacks, 17N usually sent a communique to the Eleftherotypia newspaper. The group argued in its communiques that it wanted to rid Greece of U.S. bases, to remove the Turkish military from Cyprus, and to sever Greece's ties to NATO and the European Union.\n\nOn 7 April 1998, the group used a stolen anti-armor rocket to attack a downtown branch of the American Citibank, which caused damage but no injuries, as the warhead did not explode. The rocket was fired by remote control from a private car parked outside the bank on Drossopoulou street in the downtown district of Kypseli.\n\n17N's known murder and kidnapping victims include:\n\n\nOn 29 June 2002 Greek authorities captured an injured suspect, Savvas Xiros, following a failed bombing attempt on the Minoan Flying Dolphins ferry company in Piraeus. A search of Xiros' person and interrogation led to the discovery of two safe houses and to the arrests of six more suspects, including two brothers of Savvas. A 58-year-old former mathematics student living underground since 1971, Alexandros Giotopoulos, was identified as the group leader and was arrested on 17 July 2002 on the island of Lipsi. On 5 September, Dimitris Koufodinas, identified as the group's chief of operations, surrendered to the authorities. In all, nineteen individuals were charged with some 2,500 offenses relating to the activities of N17.\n\nThe trial of the terrorist suspects commenced in Athens on 3 March 2003, with Christos Lambrou serving as the lead prosecutor for the Greek state. Because of the 20-year statute of limitations, crimes committed before 1984 (such as the killing of the CIA station chief) could not be tried by the court. On 8 December, fifteen of the accused, including Giotopoulos and Koufodinas, were found guilty; another four defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence. The convicted members were sentenced on 17 December 2003. All those convicted defendants appealed. On 3 May 2007, the convictions were upheld.\n\nIn early January 2014, Christodoulos Xyros, one of the imprisoned leaders of the organization, escaped from prison. On 6 January, he failed to report to the police after leaving prison under the condition to report to the police everyday, which he did six times in 18 months. He was taken into custody while riding a bicycle in the southern suburb of Anavyssos in early January 2015.\n\nIn 2018 the groups alleged hitman Dimitris Koufodinas was moved from Korydallos prison to a low security agricultural facility after the prison council approved his parole request, citing exemplary behaviour.. \n\nSome Greek officials considered Revolutionary Struggle (EA), the group that fired a Chinese-made RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade at the U.S. Embassy in Athens in January 2007, to be a spin-off of 17N. However, three self-admitted EA members arrested in April 2010 claimed that they were anarchists—a designation 17N rejected in its proclamations. For many years, leading politicians of the right-wing New Democracy party, as well as the conservative press, falsely claimed that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was the mastermind behind 17N. Virginia Tsouderou, who became Deputy Foreign Minister in the Mitsotakis government, and journalist Giorgos Karatzaferis (later the founder and leader of a right-wing party, LAOS) claimed that terrorism in Greece was controlled by Papandreist officers of Hellenic National Intelligence Service (the Greek security and intelligence service), and named Kostas Tsimas (the head of EYP) and Colonel Alexakis as two of the supposed controllers of 17N. However, after 17N members were arrested, the only connection between the terrorist organization and PASOK was the fact that Dimitris Koufontinas was a member of PAMK (the PASOK high school students organization) and an admirer of Andreas Papandreou in his late teens.\n\nOther writers have also claimed that 17N may have been a tool of foreign secret services. In December 2005, Kleanthis Grivas published an article in \"To Proto Thema\", a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused \"Sheepskin\", the Greek branch of Gladio, NATO's stay-behind paramilitary organization during the Cold War, of the 1975 assassination of Welch, as well as of the 2000 assassination of Saunders. This was denied by the US State Department, which responded that \"the Greek terrorist organization '17 November' was responsible for both assassinations\", and asserted that Grivas' central piece of evidence had been the \"Westmoreland Field Manual,\" which the State Department, as well as a Congressional inquiry, had dismissed as a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, \"Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials\" as well as the Greek government's statements to the effect that the \"stay behind\" network had been dismantled in 1988.\n\n\n"}

Over 150,000 works are exhibited in 39 exhibition buildings, 25 of which are historic and were relocated to the Museum grounds. It is located on near Lake Champlain.\n\nImpressionist paintings, folk art, quilts and textiles, decorative arts, furniture, American paintings, and an array of 17th- to 20th-century artifacts are on view. Shelburne is home to collections of 19th-century American folk art, quilts, 19th- and 20th-century decoys (\"see\" Waterfowl decoy collecting), and carriages. \n\nElectra Havemeyer Webb was a pioneering collector of American folk art and founded Shelburne Museum in 1947. The daughter of Henry Osborne Havemeyer and Louisine Elder Havemeyer, important collectors of Impressionism, European and Asian art, she exercised an independent eye and passion for art, artifacts, and architecture celebrating a distinctly American aesthetic. \n\nWhen creating the Museum she took the step of collecting 18th and 19th century buildings from New England and New York in which to display the Museum's holdings, relocating 20 historic structures to Shelburne. These include houses, barns, a meeting house, a one-room schoolhouse, a lighthouse, a jail, a general store, a covered bridge, and the 220-foot steamboat Ticonderoga.\n\nIn Shelburne Mrs. Webb sought to create \"an educational project, varied and alive.\" Shelburne's collections are exhibited in a village-like setting of historic New England architecture, accented by a landscape that includes over 400 lilacs, a circular formal garden, herb and heirloom vegetable gardens, and perennial gardens.\n\nIn 2013, the Pizzagalli Center for Art and Education was opened with two galleries, an auditorium and classroom, transforming the institution from seasonal (mid-May through October) to year-round operation. While the main campus operates seasonally, the Pizzagalli Center and Museum Store are open year-round. \n\nThe museum's collection was begun by Electra Havemeyer Webb, one of the first people to recognize the applied and decorative arts of rural America as collectible. Webb was an avid collector of American folk art and founded the Museum in 1947. She took the step of relocating historic buildings from New England and New York to Shelburne, Vermont in which to display the Museum's holdings.\n\nThe museum has lost money and was said to have had a deficit of more than $300,000 in 1994.\n\nThe core of the collection was formed by Electra Havemeyer Webb, a pioneering collector of American folk art who founded Shelburne Museum. Mrs. Webb exchanged ideas with other major early collectors, including Katherine Prentis Murphy, Henry and Helen Flynnt and Henry Francis du Pont (who founded Winterthur Museum and credited Mrs. Webb with inspiring him to collect American decorative arts).\n\nSince Mrs. Webb’s death in 1960, the collections have developed with an emphasis on folk art and contemporary art as it relates to the collection. Artifacts provide insight into the craftsmanship and artistic quality of objects made and used by three centuries of Americans. Visitors experience these objects in galleries and period rooms and through interactive exhibitions and demonstrations. Transportation, farming and trade artifacts illustrate America’s industrial development from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. These collections are increasingly relevant to regional audiences from varied backgrounds as the economic base of the community shifts away from farming and small-scale production.\n\nShelburne Museum’s purpose is to enrich people’s lives through art, history and culture. The collection of approximately 150,000 objects is one of the most extensive and varied collections in the US and is notable for its great range, quality and depth. The outstanding collections of fine, folk and decorative art celebrate American ingenuity, creativity and craftsmanship. \n\nShelburne’s folk art collection includes 1,400 wildfowl decoys and miniature carvings, 150 trade figures and signs, 120 weathervanes and 50 carousel figures, including all 40 animals from an early Dentzel carousel. The circus collection includes 600 historic posters, letters and memorabilia from P.T. Barnum and the hand-carved 3,500 piece Kirk Brothers Miniature Circus. The Roy Arnold Circus Parade recreates in miniature 112 attractions from the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Yankee Circus, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 525 linear feet of a special exhibition building.\n\nTextiles include 770 bed coverings (including 500 quilts), 400 hooked and sewn rugs, early household textiles (1,800 samplers, laces and linens) and 2,800 costumes and accessories. The decorative arts collection has 6,650 pieces, including glass, ceramics, pewter, metalwork, scrimshaw and one of the country’s best regional collections of 18th- and 19th-century painted furniture. Over 1,000 dolls, 27 dollhouses and 1,200 doll accessories echo in miniature the museum’s collections of ceramics, furniture and other household furnishings. A major reinterpretation and related publication of the doll collection was completed in 2004. The collection of American and European toys dates from the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nAt the museum there are some 3,200 American prints, paintings, drawings and graphics that relate to daily life. American paintings include works by Bierstadt, Church, Mary Cassatt, Copley, Daubigny, Field, Heade, Hicks, Homer, Lane, Grandma Moses, Peto and Andrew Wyeth. A significant group of European paintings and pastels from the renowned Havemeyer collection includes works by Corot, Degas, Manet and Claude Monet; they are exhibited in furnished rooms re-created from the Webbs’ New York apartment, c. 1930, and are the only Impressionism pictures on public view in Vermont.\n\nCollections also include 225 horse-drawn vehicles (described as one of the best in the nation by Merri Ferrell, formerly curator of vehicles at The Long Island Museum of Art, History and Carriages); 1,000 farming implements; and 5,000 hand tools that document woodworking, metalsmithing, coopering, weaving and spinning, leatherworking and woodcarving trades. Craftspeople staff working exhibits of blacksmithing, printing, spinning and weaving. An apothecary shop/physician’s office displays 2,000 patent medicines and turn of the 20th century medical instruments.\nThe collections are exhibited in a setting of 38 exhibition buildings, 25 of which were relocated to the Museum; the 1871 Colchester Reef Light; 3 historic and 3 replica barns, including a 1901 Vermont round barn; a vintage operating carousel; blacksmith and wheelwright shops; a weaving shop with an operating Jacquard loom; a working exhibit of late 19th-century printing equipment; an 1840 one-room schoolhouse; an 1890 Vermont slate jail; an 1840 general store; a rare 18th-century up-and-down sawmill; a 19th-century covered bridge with 2 lanes and a footpath; general store; the reconstructed doctor's office of noted Vermont physician D. C. Jarvis; an 1890 railroad station; a 1914 steam locomotive and 1890 private rail car; and the 1906 220-foot steamboat \"Ticonderoga\", which is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1996 the museum sold $30 million of its art to pay expenses. J. Watson Webb, Jr., the son of Electra Havemeyer Webb, resigned in protest. Webb believed that the sale violated the code of ethics of the American Alliance of Museums, which forbids the selling of artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art. The funds from the sale were used to establish a Collections Care Endowment which is used to support the ongoing remedial and preventative conservation, storage and management of the Museum's collection.\n\n\n\n\n"}

CCTV is a state-owned media organization and under supervised by SARPPFT. The organization and directors inside the media company are assigned by the government. The government control the news and supervised the directors in order to show their perspectives to the world.\n\nSoft power, according to Joseph Nye, who coined the term in his book in 1990: “ is the ability to get others to want the outcomes that you want, and the ability to achieve goals through attraction rather than coercion”(Nye, 1990). Indeed, soft power enables a change of behavior in others, without competition or conflict, by using persuasion and attraction. In this modern day, soft power becomes vital for a country. Media industry plays an essential role among all the industries, and it’s the most influential power.\n\nChina Central Television (CCTV) is a state-owned ministerial level institution of China, used to be called Beijing Television before 1978. China Central Television owns 50 television channels, and the broadcaster provides programming in six different languages. Among the 50 television channels, 16 of them are public while 21 are pay channels, and with 13 channels of foreign languages, which are English, French, Russian, Arabic as well as Spanish. It is one of the largest official mouthpieces of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and under the supervision of State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television of the People’s Republic of China (SAPPRFT), a department within the State Council. State Council is the main department that supervising and censoring the whole China’s television industry. SAPPRFT is an executive branch under the State Council. Its main task is the administration and supervision of state-owned enterprise engaged in the television, radio and film industries. It performs the actual daily oversight, including censorship of sensitive content. Government related media organizations like CCTV, Xinhua News Agency and China National Radio must have permissions from SAPPRFT to broadcast the new content to the public.\n\nIn June 2017, CCTV \"relaunched and rebranded its stable of foreign-language TV channels. The six are now labeled as China Global Television Network (CGTN) with CGTN English as its flagship channel. \"\n\nThe directors on CCTV also have positions in related government organizations and all of them are the members of Communist Party of China. Nie Chenxi, who is the main director of CCTV since 2015. He’s also the vice director of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC), main director of SAPPRFT as well as the director of the National Copyright Administration of the People’s Republic of China. Nie was born in 1957 and from Hebei Province. He worked for the local government since 1974. In the duration, he studied a master degree in management and engineering. In February 1993, He joined the Communist Party of China and worked towards to the CCP. During Nie’s time, the government has issued repeated orders telling television channels to focus on “uplifting, patriotic programs and screen out ‘base and vulgar’ content” (Reuters, 2015). Historically, directors of CCTV made cultural revolutions. In December 1991, Yang Weiguang was assigned as president of CCTV. With his peasant family background, it’s no doubt helped him secure a steady position in the government related broadcaster organizations. He left his CCTV post in 1999, and the ten years of his management of CCTV were considered as the best days. In Yang’s decade, CCTV was “unquestionably the network’s high point in terms of party approval, market position, and public sphere” (Zhu, 2012). It was the first decade of CCTV’s transformation from state-funded proselytizer to commercial broadcaster.\n\nThe main financial support to CCTV is from advertising. In 2013, CCTV earned a total of 15.88 billion Yuan, and increased its revenues 11.4% each year. The graph (Figure 2) showing the most of the advertisers is liquor companies. Within those companies, liquor company JNC Group had spent the most money on advertising. The company spent 608 million Yuan by placing their logo on four daily slots on the news bulletins for eight months. Other liquor companies like Kweichow Moutai Co and Wuliangye Group Co also are the main advertiser of CCTV. Kweichow Moutai Co spent 352 million Yuan on placing their advertising on CCTV before Xinwen Lianbo (National News broadcasting, which airing the CCTV news in local channel everyday between 7pm to 7:30pm), and Wuliangye Group Co spent 499 million Yuan on the same time slots (China Daily, 2012). Those companies provided a steady financial support to CCTV. CCTV’s New Year’s Gala is popular and attracted among the country, even internationally. CCTV’s New Year’s Gala is on Chinese New Year’s Eve and it’s a tradition that nearly every family in China participates in to ring in the New Year. The tickets of Gala doesn’t open for the public, but CCTV sennd invitations to some celebrities, such as people who hold a high post in the government, annually influenced people like Jack Ma (CEO of Alibaba) as well as their family members. At the same time, CCTV will air the Gala on every local channel as well as in its foreign channels. People over the world will have a chance to watch this well-known performance. As a result, the advertisings during Gala are incredibly expensive but it still attracts a lot of companies to engage. CCTV also orients different kinds of event that open to the public, such as Skits, Xiangsheng, and Chinese Opera. (Mack, 2017), which tickets are available to the public. CCTV earns profits mainly through advertisements as well as its events.\n\nChina Central Television, China Radio International (CRI), Xinhua news agency, and \"The China Daily\" newspaper and website are the largest four state-owned media corporations. They all under control by SAPPRFT and rely on each other for producing news to the public. Xinhua News Agency is the main news source of CCTV. As they both are the official press agencies of the state, they have been tightly controlled and packaged by the government. In 2008, an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan Province. China Central Television was reporting on the disaster within minutes of the quake and had reporters airing with the updates within half an hour. “Domestic disaster of any sort were too hot to handle without instruction from the state and could harm the national image” (Zhu, 2012). This earthquake was a milestone of China as the Olympics was opened in a few months later in Beijing. In the chaos of the disaster, the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China requested other Chinese news organizations not to broadcast their reports of the disaster, but instead only used information released by either CCTV or the Xinhua News Agency. This process reveals that the government controls the news.\n\nIn 2001, a project called “Going Out” came up by president Jiang Zemin and launched by Xu Guangchun, who was the deputy head of the Propaganda Ministry and the head of SAPPRFT. This was a new start for CPC develop its power overseas. The project aims to bring China’s voice to the world. “Going Out” program was proposed to “land China’s TV and radio channels overseas within five years and provide multi languages and regionalized broadcasting and coverage by 2011” (Zhu, 2012). The image of China globally was misrepresent and misunderstand by other international medias like BBC, as result CPC wishes to erase its national image and present its voice to the world.\n\nAt the beginning of the “Going Out” Program CPC realized CCTV would meet some obstacles in western countries, because media organizations like CNN and BBC are dominants in western world while CCTV is an Asian broadcaster. Besides, westerners have some kind of stereotyped opinions to Asian, especially to Chinese. It is not an easy job to change their perspective to Chinese, as a result China moved to Africa, where western medias did not cover too much. That’s why CCTV moved their attention to Africa in 2012. As Zhang mentioned that “the Africa-oriented ‘channel’ is a ‘testing ground’ for the construction of an expand state-centered Sino centric media discourse aimed at showcasing China’s soft power and challenging the perceived Western-centric world order” (Zhang, 2013). China understands that the Africans are facing the same problem, which is the misrepresenting image in the world, so it is much easier for CPC to bring the voice there. It is an essential as well as a significant step that push Chinese media steps to global.\n"}

Besides translating the first edition of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" (1860), he wrote a great number of works popularising science, particularly the life sciences.\n\nWinkler was born in 1822, in the Frisian capital of Leeuwarden. There, he attended primary school until his 12th or 13th year. His father subsequently arranged his apprenticeship to a grain merchant. He used his wages to educate himself in French, then German, and then English. This desire for self-education and self-discipline would characterise Winkler throughout his life.\n\nHe married in 1844 and began to study medicine in order to become a surgeon. In 1850, Winkler moved to Haarlem with his wife and four children, to begin his education at the local surgeons' college. He graduated two years later, and set up practice in Nieuwediep. His first patient, a fisherman, complained of being stung by a weever fish. His studies took him to the library of Teylers Museum in Haarlem, and his subsequent article on the weever in the popular journal \"Album der Natuur\" established him as an expert on fishes.\n\nAt the Museum, he also developed an interest in paleontology and geology. The curator, professor Van Breda, approached him to describe the fossil fishes from his own and Teylers' collections. This set Winkler up at the museum and his work, duly lauded, was published in the \"Verhandelingen\" ('Transactions') of Teylers' Society in 1859. This was followed up by further work on fishes from the German Solnhofen limestone, and completion of the catalogue of the museum's fossil fish collection.\n\nThis achievement so impressed the Museum's directors that they approached Winkler to do the same for their other fossil and mineral collections. A year later he finished the catalogue, despite being forced to work in an unheated room and continuing with his general medical practice. In 1864 Winkler was asked to become curator of Teylers' paleontological and mineralogical cabinet, a post he kept until his death in 1897.\n\nHe immediately set to work to catalogue the Museum's entire collection of fossils, which at the time was unnumbered and, frequently, undocumented. On the advice of the prominent Utrecht natural historian Pieter Harting, he applied a numerical system in which the fossils were divided into Periods (Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Caenozoic) and sorted from 'high' to 'low'. This system, and the way in which Winkler applied it, already showed the influence of Darwin's theory of evolution.\n\nCompleting this catalogue would take until 1896, by which time six volumes and five supplements had been published, documenting a total of 15,458 fossils. Winkler also catalogued the museum's mineral collection.\n\nWinkler was very active as a populariser of science. He wrote more than a hundred articles, many of them aimed at educating the general public, much as he had educated himself. Many of these works appeared in \"Album der Natuur\" ('Album of Nature') and the proceedings of the Dutch Literature society.\n\nJust as importantly, Winkler translated numerous scientific works into Dutch. Most famous among these was Charles Darwin's seminal \"Origin of Species\", which appeared in Dutch one year after its English release in 1859. Winkler also proved himself to be a vocal defender of the theory of evolution, to the extent that he did not wish to question - unlike, at the time, Darwin himself - man's place in evolution.\n\nWinkler was an active supporter of Volapük, a constructed language invented by the Catholic priest Johann Martin Schleyer.\n\n"}

The theorem allows researchers to understand how the optimal value for a choice variable changes when a feature of the environment changes. The result states that if \"f\" is supermodular in (\"x\",\"θ\"), and \"D\" is a lattice, then formula_1 is nondecreasing in \"θ\". The result is especially helpful for establishing comparative static results when the objective function is not differentiable.\n\nThis example will show how using Topkis's theorem gives the same result as using more standard tools. The advantage of using Topkis's theorem is that it can be applied to a wider class of problems than can be studied with standard economics tools.\n\nA driver is driving down a highway and must choose a speed, \"s\". Going faster is desirable, but is more likely to result in a crash. There is some prevalence of potholes, \"p\". The presence of potholes increases the probability of crashing. Note that \"s\" is a choice variable and \"p\" is a parameter of the environment that is fixed from the perspective of the driver. The driver seeks to formula_2.\n\nWe would like to understand how the driver's speed (a choice variable) changes with the amount of potholes: \n\nIf one wanted to solve the problem with standard tools such as the implicit function theorem, one would have to assume that the problem is well behaved: \"U\"(.) is twice continuously differentiable, concave in \"s\", that the domain over which \"s\" is defined is convex, and that it there is a unique maximizer formula_4 for every value of \"p\" and that formula_4 is in the interior of the set over which \"s\" is defined. Note that the optimal speed is a function of the amount of potholes. Taking the first order condition, we know that at the optimum, formula_6. Differentiating the first order condition, with respect to \"p\" and using the implicit function theorem, we find that\nor that \n\nSo, \n\nIf \"s\" and \"p\" are substitutes, \n\nand hence \n\nand more potholes causes less speeding. Clearly it is more reasonable to assume that they are substitutes.\n\nThe problem with the above approach is that it relies on the differentiability of the objective function and on concavity. We could get at the same answer using Topkis's theorem in the following way. We want to show that formula_12 is submodular (the opposite of supermodular) in formula_13. Note that the choice set is clearly a lattice. The cross partial of \"U\" being negative, formula_14, is a sufficient condition. Hence if formula_15 we know that formula_11.\n\nHence using the implicit function theorem and Topkis's theorem gives the same result, but the latter does so with fewer assumptions.\n\n"}

He first predicted the Second Advent of Jesus Christ would occur before March 21, 1844. When this date passed a new date was predicted, April 18, 1844. Again the date passed and another Millerite, Samuel S. Snow, derived the date of October 22, 1844. The non-fulfillment of these predictions has been named the Millerite Great Disappointment.\n\nCertain Anabaptists of the early 16th century believed that the Millennium would occur in 1533. Another source reports: \"When the prophecy failed, the Anabaptists became more zealous and claimed that two witnesses (Enoch and Elijah) had come in the form of Jan Matthys and Jan Bockelson; they would set up the New Jerusalem in Münster. Münster became a frightening dictatorship under Bockelson's control. Although all Lutherans and Catholics were expelled from that city, the millennium never came.\"\n\nIn volume II of \"The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers\", author Leroy Edwin Froom tells us about a prominent Anglican prelate, who made a relevant prediction: \"Edwin Sandys (1519–1588), Archbishop of York and Primate of England was born in Lancashire... Sandys says, 'Now, as we know not the day and time, so let us be assured that this coming of the Lord is near. He is not slack, as we do count slackness. That it is at hand, it may be probably gathered out of the Scriptures in diverse places. The signs mentioned by Christ in the Gospel which should be the foreshewers of this terrible day, are almost all fulfilled.'\"\n\nDuring World War I, \"The Weekly Evangel\", an official publication of the Assemblies of God, carried this prediction: \"We are not yet in the Armageddon struggle proper, but at its commencement, and it may be, if students of prophecy read the signs aright, that Christ will come before the present war closes, and before Armageddon...The war preliminary to Armageddon, it seems, has commenced.\" Other editions speculated that the end would come no later than 1934 or 1935.\n\nThe founder of the Calvary Chapel system, Chuck Smith, published the book \"End Times\" in 1979. On the jacket of his book, Smith is called a \"well known Bible scholar and prophecy teacher.\" In this book he wrote:\n\nThis same viewpoint was published by the popular pastor Hal Lindsey in his widely published book \"The Late Great Planet Earth\".\n\nThe well known Scottish cleric, Edward Irving, was the forerunner of the Catholic Apostolic Church. In 1828 he wrote a work headed \"The Last Days: A Discourse on the Evil Character of These Our Times, Proving Them to be the 'Perilous Times' and the 'Last Days\"'. On pages 10–22 we find some telling information which includes the following:\n\nCharles Taze Russell, the first president of the Watch Tower Society, calculated 1874 as the year of Christ's Second Coming, and taught that Christ was invisibly present and ruling from the heavens since that year. Russell proclaimed Christ's invisible return in 1874, the resurrection of the saints in 1875, and predicted the end of the \"harvest\" and the Rapture of the saints to heaven for 1878, and the final end of \"the day of wrath\" in 1914. 1874 was considered the end of 6,000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ. A 1917 Watch Tower Society publication predicted that in 1918, God would begin to destroy churches and millions of their members.\n\nJ.F. Rutherford, who succeeded Russell as president of the Watch Tower Society, predicted that the Millennium would begin in 1925, and that biblical figures such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David would be resurrected as \"princes\". The Watch Tower Society bought property and built a house, Beth Sarim, in California for their return.\n\nFrom 1966, statements in Jehovah's Witness publications raised strong expectations that Armageddon could arrive in 1975. In 1974 Witnesses were commended for selling their homes and property to \"finish out the rest of their days in this old system\" in full-time preaching. In 1976 \"The Watchtower\" advised those who had been \"disappointed\" by unfulfilled expectations for 1975 to adjust their viewpoint because that understanding was \"based on wrong premises\". Four years later, the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding 1975.\n\nThe founder of the Lutheran Church was the reformer, Martin Luther (1483–1546 A.D.). According to one authority, Luther ventured to predict: \"For my part, I am sure that the Day of Judgement is just around the corner. It doesn't matter that we don't know the precise day... perhaps someone else can figure it out. But it is certain that time is now at an end.\" Another author says: \"In all of [Luther's] work there was a sense of urgency for the time was short... the world was heading for Armageddon in the war with the Turk.\"\n\nEven after Luther's death in 1546, Lutheran leaders kept up the claim of the nearness of the end. About the year 1584, a zealous Lutheran named Adam Nachenmoser wrote the large volume '[Prognosticum Theologicum]' in which he predicted: \"In 1590 the Gospel would be preached to all nations and a wonderful unity would be achieved. The last days would then be close at hand.\" Nachenmoser offered numerous conjectures about the date; 1635 seemed most likely.\n\nThe Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod issued a study in 1989 refuting any end times claim, declaring that \"repeatedly taught by Jesus and the apostles is the truth that the exact hour of Christ's coming remains hidden in the secret counsels of God (Matt. 24:36).\"\n\nJoseph Smith, founder of the Mormon faith, made several dozen prophecies during his lifetime, many of which are recorded in the sacred texts of the Mormon faith. The prophecies included predictions of the Civil War, the coming of Jesus, and several less significant predictions. Church apologists cite prophecies that they claim came true, and church critics cite prophecies that they claim did not come true.\n\nRussian Mennonite minister Claas Epp, Jr. predicted that Christ would return on March 8, 1889, and, when that date passed uneventfully, 1891.\n\nMontanus, who founded the Montanist movement in 156 AD, predicted that Jesus would return during the lifetime of the group's founding members.\n\nThomas Brightman, who lived from 1562 to 1607, has been called \"one of the fathers of Presbyterianism in England.\" He predicted that \"between 1650 and 1695 [we] would see the conversion of the many Jews and a revival of their nation in Palestine...the destruction of the Papacy...the marriage of the Lamb and his wife.\"\n\nChristopher Love who lived from 1618–1651 was a bright graduate of Oxford and a strong Presbyterian. Love predicted that: (1) Babylon would fall in 1758 (2) God's anger against the wicked would be demonstrated in 1759 and (3) in 1763 there would occur a great earthquake all over the world.\n\nWhen in 1525 Martin Luther, an ex-monk, married Katharina von Bora, an ex-nun, his enemies said that their offspring would fulfill an old tradition that the Antichrist would be the son of such a union. The Catholic scholar and theologian Erasmus remarked that the tradition could apply to thousands of such children.\n\nIn 1771 Bishop Charles Walmesley published, under the nom de plume of \"Signor Pastorini\", his \"General History of the Christian Church from Her Birth to Her Final Triumphant State in Heaven Chiefly Deduced from the Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist\". In it he attributed to what he called the fifth age of the Church a duration of 300 years, beginning with the Protestant Reformation in 1520 or 1525. This was widely interpreted as predicting the downfall of Protestantism by 1825. In fact, just four years later, the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 brought to a culmination the process of Catholic Emancipation throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\n"}

{"id": "22468364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22468364", "title": "Volume (thermodynamics)", "text": "Volume (thermodynamics)\n\nIn thermodynamics, the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state. The specific volume, an intensive property, is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature. For example, volume is related to the pressure and temperature of an ideal gas by the ideal gas law.\n\nThe physical volume of a system may or may not coincide with a control volume used to analyze the system.\n\nThe volume of a thermodynamic system typically refers to the volume of the working fluid, such as, for example, the fluid within a piston. Changes to this volume may be made through an application of work, or may be used to produce work. An isochoric process however operates at a constant-volume, thus no work can be produced. Many other thermodynamic processes will result in a change in volume. A polytropic process, in particular, causes changes to the system so that the quantity formula_1 is constant (where formula_2 is pressure, formula_3 is volume, and formula_4 is the polytropic index, a constant). Note that for specific polytropic indexes a polytropic process will be equivalent to a constant-property process. For instance, for very large values of formula_4 approaching infinity, the process becomes constant-volume.\n\nGases are compressible, thus their volumes (and specific volumes) may be subject to change during thermodynamic processes. Liquids, however, are nearly incompressible, thus their volumes can be often taken as constant. In general, compressibility is defined as the relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure, and may be determined for substances in any phase. Similarly, thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature.\n\nMany thermodynamic cycles are made up of varying processes, some which maintain a constant volume and some which do not. A vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, for example, follows a sequence where the refrigerant fluid transitions between the liquid and vapor states of matter.\n\nTypical units for volume are formula_6 (cubic meters), formula_7 (liters), and formula_8 (cubic feet).\n\nMechanical work performed on a working fluid causes a change in the mechanical constraints of the system; in other words, for work to occur, the volume must be altered. Hence volume is an important parameter in characterizing many thermodynamic processes where an exchange of energy in the form of work is involved.\n\nVolume is one of a pair of conjugate variables, the other being pressure. As with all conjugate pairs, the product is a form of energy. The product formula_9 is the energy lost to a system due to mechanical work. This product is one term which makes up enthalpy formula_10:\nwhere formula_12 is the internal energy of the system.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics describes constraints on the amount of useful work which can be extracted from a thermodynamic system. In thermodynamic systems where the temperature and volume are held constant, the measure of \"useful\" work attainable is the Helmholtz free energy; and in systems where the volume is not held constant, the measure of useful work attainable is the Gibbs free energy.\n\nSimilarly, the appropriate value of heat capacity to use in a given process depends on whether the process produces a change in volume. The heat capacity is a function of the amount of heat added to a system. In the case of a constant-volume process, all the heat affects the internal energy of the system (i.e., there is no pV-work, and all the heat affects the temperature). However, in a process without a constant volume, the heat addition affects both the internal energy and the work (i.e., the enthalpy); thus the temperature changes by a different amount than in the constant-volume case and a different heat capacity value is required.\n\nSpecific volume (formula_13) is the volume occupied by a unit of mass of a material. In many cases the specific volume is a useful quantity to determine because, as an intensive property, it can be used to determine the complete state of a system in conjunction with another independent intensive variable. The specific volume also allows systems to be studied without reference to an exact operating volume, which may not be known (nor significant) at some stages of analysis.\n\nThe specific volume of a substance is equal to the reciprocal of its mass density. Specific volume may be expressed in formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, or formula_17 .\n\nwhere, formula_3 is the volume, formula_20 is the mass and formula_21 is the density of the material.\n\nFor an ideal gas,\nwhere, formula_23 is the specific gas constant, formula_24 is the temperature and formula_25 is the pressure of the gas.\n\nSpecific volume may also refer to molar volume.\n\nThe volume of gas increases proportionally to absolute temperature and decreases inversely proportionally to pressure, approximately according to the ideal gas law:\n\nformula_26\n\nwhere:\n\nTo simplify, a volume of gas may be expressed as the volume it would have in standard conditions for temperature and pressure, which are 0 °C and 100 kPa.\n\nIn contrast to other gas components, water content in air, or humidity, to a higher degree depends on vaporization and condensation from or into water, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviating from predicted by the ideal gas law.\n\nTherefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed excluding the humidity content: \"V\" (volume dry). This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary \"V\" (volume saturated) is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).\n\nTo compare gas volume between two conditions of different temperature or pressure (1 and 2), assuming nR are the same, the following equation uses humidity exclusion in addition to the ideal gas law:\n\nformula_27\n\nWhere, in addition to terms used in the ideal gas law:\n\nFor example, calculating how much 1 liter of air (a) at 0 °C, 100 kPa, \"p\" = 0 kPa (known as STPD, see below) would fill when breathed into the lungs where it is mixed with water vapor (l), where it quickly becomes 37 °C, 100 kPa, \"p\" = 6.2 kPa (BTPS):\n\nformula_28\n\nSome common expressions of gas volume with defined or variable temperature, pressure and humidity inclusion are:\n\nThe following conversion factors can be used to convert between expressions for volume of a gas: \n\nThe partial volume of a particular gas is the volume which the gas would have if it alone occupied the volume, with unchanged pressure and temperature, and is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.\n\nIt can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:\n\n"}
