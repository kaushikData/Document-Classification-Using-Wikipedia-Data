After considering the idea of establishing a maritime museum, the federal government announced that a national maritime museum would be constructed at Darling Harbour, tied into the New South Wales State government's redevelopment of the area for the Australian bicentenary. The museum building was designed by Philip Cox, and although an opening date of 1988 was initially set, construction delays, cost overruns, and disagreements between the state and federal governments over funding responsibility pushed the opening back to 1991.\n\nOne of six museums directly operated by the federal government, the ANMM is the only one located outside of the Australian Capital Territory. The museum is structured around seven main galleries, focusing on the discovery of Australia, the relationships between the Australian Aborigines and the water, travel to Australia by sea, the ocean as a resource, water-based relaxation and entertainment, the naval defence of the nation, and the relationship between the United States of America and Australia. The last gallery was funded by the United States government, and is the only national museum gallery in the world funded by a foreign nation. Four additional gallery spaces are used for temporary exhibits. Three museum ships – the HM Bark \"Endeavour\" Replica, the destroyer , and the submarine – are open to the public, while smaller historical vessels berthed outside can be viewed but not boarded.\n\nOf the six museums operated directly by the Federal government (the ANMM, the Australian War Memorial, the National Museum of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery, and Questacon), the ANMM is the only one located outside the Australian Capital Territory. The museum is administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts on behalf of the Australian Government.\n\nIn June 1985, the federal government announced the establishment of a national museum focusing on Australia's maritime history and the nation's ongoing involvement and dependence on the sea. Proposals for the creation of such a museum had been under consideration over the preceding years. After lobbying by New South Wales Premier Neville Wran, the decision was made to situate the new museum at Darling Harbour, and construct it as part of the area's redevelopment. The building of the ANMM was seen by both the federal and New South Wales State governments as an important feature of the redevelopment, as it would be a major drawcard, and help fuel the commercial success of the precinct.\nThe museum building was designed by Philip Cox, Richardson Taylor & Partners. The roof was shaped to invoke the image of billowing sails: the corrugated metal roof stands over tall on the west side, but drops significantly on the east.\n\nDuring development, the museum ran into a series of difficulties. In March 1998, the three top members of the ANMM interim council were sacked by the federal government and replaced. Later in the year, the Department for the Arts informed the museum that its staff would be reduced by 30% and it would undergo budget cuts, forcing the ANMM to rely on contracted security and conservation staff, along with volunteer guides and attendants. The acceptance of a US$5 million grant for a dedicated gallery showing the links between the US and Australia resulted in the displacement of much of the staff and research areas. Most of these were later established in the nearby Wharf 7 building.\n\nThe museum was initially slated to open in 1988, but by October that year, construction delays had pushed the planned opening date to September 1989, and the project was already $12.5 million over the $30 million budget. Construction was completed on 17 November 1989; the cost of the museum's construction had increased to $70 million, and although the Federal government was willing to pay the initial $30 million, there were disagreements between the state and federal governments over who had to supply the additional $40 million. It was resolved that New South Wales was responsible for the additional funding, and in October 1990, the museum building was handed over to the Federal government. The ANMM was opened on 30 November 1991.\n\nIn order to achieve commercial sustainability, the ANMM was directed by the federal government to institute entry fees: the second Australian national museum to do so after Questacon was opened in 1988. The entry fee for the museum itself was dropped in 2004 (although access to the museum ships was still charged), then was re-added in December 2011.\n\nDuring the museum's first ten years of operation, 3.3 million visitors attended.\n\nIn 2010, London's \"The Sunday Times\" listed the ANMM in its \"World's 10 Coolest Museums\".\n\nAt the start of 2014, the ANMM announced that it would build a pavilion to showcase exhibits related to the Royal Australian Navy. The pavilion, which will be located near the museum's naval vessels, will be built between July 2014 and September 2015.\n\nPermanent exhibitions at the museum are focused around six gallery spaces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are four other gallery spaces in the museum. The Tasman Light gallery contains the original lenses from the Tasman Island Lighthouse, and is used for temporary photographic exhibitions and as hireable space for functions. The other three galleries (two along the eastern side of the top level, and a third offset from the main body of the museum) are used separately or together to host temporary exhibitions.\n\nOther items on display inside the museum, but not associated with any particular gallery, include \"Spirit of Australia\", the Water Speed Record-holding motorboat, and an anchor from , flagship of the First Fleet.\n\nThe ANMM's collection of museum ships focuses on three vessels that are open for public inspection: the HM Bark \"Endeavour\" Replica, the destroyer , and the submarine . In addition, the 19th century barque James Craig is moored nearby and can be toured with a museum ticket.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, it was proposed that a replica of explorer James Cook's ship, HM Bark \"Endeavour\" be constructed for the museum. Funding for construction was initially provided by the Bond Corporation, and construction began at the start of 1988. However, in 1990, the company ran into financial difficulties, and construction was unable to continue until a charitable trust was established in 1991 to complete and operate the replica \"Endeavour\". The vessel was completed in 1994, and spent the next ten years sailing around Australia and the world before ownership was transferred to the ANMM in 2005.\n\nThe \"Daring\"-class destroyer HMAS \"Vampire\" is the only ship of her class to be preserved, and was the last gun-destroyer to serve in the Royal Australian Navy. \"Vampire\" was commissioned into the RAN in 1959, and served until 1986. The destroyer was loaned to the ANMM on its opening in 1991, and was transferred completely to museum ownership in 1997. The \"Oberon\"-class submarine HMAS \"Onslow\" was introduced into RAN service in 1969. She was operated until early 1999, and was given to the ANMM that year. Despite no longer being in naval commission, \"Vampire\" and \"Onslow\" have permission to fly the Australian White Ensign. Prior to \"Onslow\"s acquisition, the former Russian submarine Foxtrot-540 was on display at the museum from 1995 to 1998. The submarine had been purchased in 1994 by a group of Australian businessmen, and was placed on display for the duration of the lease purchase contract, after which the submarine was relocated to California.\n\nOther vessels on display (but not open for public boarding) include:\n\nThe 1874-built Cape Bowling Green Lighthouse, originally located at Cape Bowling Green, near Townsville, Queensland, was relocated to the ANMM site in 1987.\n\nThe Vaughan Evans Library is the research library attached to the ANMM, and is a collecting agency on maritime matters.\n\nThe Welcome Wall is a bronze wall located on the northern side of the museum, which lists the names of immigrants who arrived by sea to settle in Australia. Having a name engraved on the wall requires an application to the ANMM, and the paying of a fee. As of the end of 2011, the wall contained 24,000 names.\n\nA Harding safety lifeboat and davit is fitted on the water's edge. This lifeboat, of a design commonly used aboard offshore drilling platforms and tanker ships, is used by the Sydney Institute of TAFE for maritime training.\n\nThe Australian Maritime College conducts some postgraduate programs from the precinct.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28353060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28353060", "title": "Berggruen Museum", "text": "Berggruen Museum\n\nThe Berggruen Museum (also known as the Berggruen Collection) is a collection of modern art classics in Berlin, which the collector and dealer Heinz Berggruen, in a \"gesture of reconciliation\", gave to his native city. The most notable artists on display include Pablo Picasso, Giambattista Pittoni, Alberto Giacometti, Georges Braque, Paul Klee and Henri Matisse. The Berggruen Collection is part of the National Gallery of Berlin.\n\nThe collection arrived in Berlin in 1996, with Berggruen's return to his native city after six decades in exile. In 1988 he had given about 90 Klees to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in 1990, he had agreed to make a five-year loan (renewable by mutual agreement) to the National Gallery in London of 72 paintings and drawings by Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Joan Miró. Also in 1990, negotiations with Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía for the Berggruen collection to be shown in Madrid fell through. Berggruen initially lent the collection, which he had assembled over 30 years, to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation (PCHF). He finally sold it to the PCHF in December 2000, for the \"symbolic\" price of 253 million marks, well below its then estimated value of 1.5 billion marks. Today it is exhibited under the title \"Berggruen Collection – Picasso and His Time\" as part of the National Gallery of Berlin, in the West Stüler Building on Schloßstraße, opposite Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nThe centrepiece of the collection is the work of Picasso, with over 100 exhibits, together with over 60 pictures by Paul Klee. Henri Matisse is represented by over 20 works, including more than half a dozen of his famous cutouts. Sculpture ensembles by Alberto Giacometti and examples of African sculpture round out the core of the collection.\n\nBerggruen continued to purchase works after the museum's opening in 1996, including Picasso's important 1909 painting \"Houses on the Hill\" (\"Horta de Ebro\") from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A total of 165 works were transferred from Berggruen to the PCHF in the 2000 sale.\n\nIn 2005 the Berggruen family acquired Picasso's \"Nu Jaune\" (1907) for $13.7 million at Sotheby's in New York. This gouache is one of the first studies for \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", a milestone in 20th-century art.\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of the museum, and his permanent retirement from public life at the age of 92, Berggruen donated a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, \"Standing Woman III\", to the collection in December 2006. It had in fact already been on loan at the museum until then, standing in the Stüler Building's rotunda. To keep the two-metre high bronze statue within the collection – his life's work – Berggruen quickly purchased it and donated it to the PCHF. Several weeks later, on 23 February 2007, he died in Paris.\n\nThe museum received 1.5 million visitors during its first decade from 1996 to 2006. Besides the permanent exhibition \"Picasso and His Time\", the museum hosts numerous special exhibitions on themes of classic modern art.\n\nIn July 2007 the heirs to Berggruen's estate announced that they would present a further 50 classic modern works to the museum, in order to continue in their father's tradition of reconciliation with Germany. Since the transfer at Christmas 2000 Berggruen had continued to purchase paintings, including works by Picasso, Matisse, Klee and Cézanne, among others. To make an expansion possible, the state of Berlin announced that it would endow the PCHF with a new building for its 50th anniversary: the Kommandantenhaus, adjacent to the West Stüler Building.\n\nA society for friends of the Berggruen Museum (\"Förderkreis Museum Berggruen e. V.\") was founded at the same time, with members including Berggruen's widow Bettina, his children Nicolas, Olivier, John and Helen, as well as Michael Blumenthal, Michael Naumann and Simon de Pury. The PCHF agreed to take on the running costs of the society.\n\nPlans were announced in 2008 to connect the two buildings with a glass pergola, chosen from an architectural competition, to be paid for by the government and installed by the state of Berlin.\n\nIn May 2008 a further 70 paintings were added to the collection.\n\n"}

Its name comes from its system of chronology based on the Christian paschal cycle; its Greek author named it \"Epitome of the ages from Adam the first man to the 20th year of the reign of the most August Heraclius\".\n\nThe Chronicon Paschale follows earlier chronicles. For the years 600 to 627 the author writes as a contemporary historian—that is, through the last years of emperor Maurice, the reign of Phocas, and the first seventeen years of the reign of Heraclius.\n\nLike many chroniclers, the author of this popular account relates anecdotes, physical descriptions of the chief personages (which at times are careful portraits), extraordinary events such as earthquakes and the appearance of comets, and links Church history with a supposed Biblical chronology. Sempronius Asellio points out the difference in the public appeal and style of composition which distinguished the chroniclers (\"Annales\") from the historians (\"Historia\") of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nThe \"Chronicon Paschale\" is a huge compilation, attempting a chronological list of events from the creation of Adam. The principal manuscript, the 10th-century \"Codex Vaticanus græcus\" 1941, is damaged at the beginning and end and stops short at 627. The Chronicle proper is preceded by an introduction containing reflections on Christian chronology and on the calculation of the Paschal (Easter) cycle. The so-called 'Byzantine' or 'Roman' era (which continued in use in Greek Orthodox Christianity until the end of Turkish rule as the 'Julian calendar') was adopted in the Chronicum as the foundation of chronology; in accordance with which the date of the creation is given as 21 March 5507.\n\nThe author identifies himself as a contemporary of the Emperor Heraclius (610–641), and was possibly a cleric attached to the suite of the œcumenical Patriarch Sergius. The work was probably written during the last ten years of the reign of Heraclius.\n\nThe chief authorities used were: Sextus Julius Africanus; the \"Fasti consulares\"; the \"Chronicle and Church History\" of Eusebius; John Malalas; the \"Acta Martyrum\"; the treatise of Epiphanius, bishop of Constantia (the old Salamis) in Cyprus (fl. 4th century), on \"Weights and Measures\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has a strong presence among parents of children under six years old, the target of Grolier's direct mail-to-the-home business.\n\nIn June 2000 Grolier became part of Scholastic Corporation, which now maintains \"Grolier Online\".\n\nWalter M. Jackson (1863–1923) was the founder of encyclopedia publisher Grolier, Inc., and he was the partner of Horace Everett Hooper in publishing the 10th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and in developing its 11th edition. He split with Hooper in 1908-1909 in a nasty legal fight after failing to wrest control of the \"Britannica\" from Hooper.\n\nJackson had founded the \"Grolier Society\", which specialized in making extra-fine editions of classics and rare literature. The Society was named after the Grolier Club, which had been founded in 1884 to advance the arts involved in making books and which was named after a well-known French bibliophile, Jean Grolier de Servières.\n\nAfter the split with Hooper he acquired the rights to publish the British \"The Children's Encyclopædia\" under the name \"The Book of Knowledge\".\n\n\"Grolier, Inc.\" subsequently became a large publisher of general encyclopaedias, including \"The Book of Knowledge\" (1910), \"The New Book of Knowledge\" (1966), the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" (1945), the \"Academic American Encyclopedia\" (1980), \"The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia\" (1985 CD-ROM), and the \"Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia\" (1995).\n\nGrolier had a US$100 million international business, primarily located in the UK, Canada and Asia. It had 1999 revenues of $450 million and earnings of approximately $45 million, with $4.5 million in Internet revenues.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Grolier has moved its operations to Danbury, Connecticut. In 1988 Grolier was purchased by the French media company Hachette, which owned a well-known French-language encyclopedia, the \"Hachette Encyclopedia\". Hachette was later absorbed by the French conglomerate the Lagardère Group. In 1996, Grolier acquired the Chicago-based Children's Press.\n\nGrolier was then purchased by Scholastic for US$400 million in 2000. The new owners projected a 30% increase in operating income, although historically Grolier had experienced earnings of 7% to 8% on income.\n\nStaff reductions as a means of controlling costs followed soon thereafter, even while an effort was made to augment the sales force. Cuts occurred every year between 2000 and 2007, leaving a much-depleted work force to carry out the duties of maintaining a large encyclopedia database. Scholastic, which specializes in works for the K-8 market (Kindergarten-to-8th grade), has sought to position the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" as a reference resource for schools. It remains to be seen whether that strategy, applied to a venerable upper-level (even adult-level) publication, will work in the long run.\n\nThe name \"Grolier\" is retained as the Scholastic website \"Grolier Online\". The company exists as Grolier Incorporated.\n\nFranklin Watts Inc. was formed in 1942. The company was sold to Grolier in 1957. When the namesake founder retired in 1967, he moved to London to start Franklin Watts Ltd. in 1969. Franklin Watts retired again in 1976.\n\nWhen Grolier acquired Children's Press in 1996, much of Franklin Watts were published under the Children's Press imprint. When Hachette sold Grolier to Scholastic Corporation in 2000, Scholastic took U.S. rights to Children's Press and Franklin Watts as well. The UK branch exists today as an imprint of Hachette UK's Hachette Children's Books.\n\nOrchard Books was founded in 1986 by Grolier as a children's publisher. Hachette, which acquired Grolier in 1988, sold Grolier to Scholastic Corporation in 2000, along with the U.S. branch of Orchard Books, while retaining the UK branch.\nThe company produced the \"Disney Christmas Magic Collection\", a popular Christmas ornament line for Disney Consumer Products. This part of the business was sold to Early Moments.\n\nGrolier's first CD-ROM publication was the text-only \"Academic American Encyclopedia on CD-ROM\" in 1985, and was one of the first commercial CD-ROM titles. The text was based on the \"Academic American Encyclopedia\", which comprised 30,000 entries and 9 million words. The editions were updated quarterly—a rate which outpaced the print edition. Eventually the CD-ROM edition was quite different from the print edition.\n\nGrolier published the encyclopedia with numerous name variations: \"The Electronic Encyclopedia\" (1986), \"The Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia\" (1987), \"The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia\" (1988–91), \"The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia\" (1992). The 1990 edition was the first to feature pictures, and the 1992 edition was the first to deliver video and sound. The last CD-ROM edition published was the 2003 \"Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia\".\n\nIn 1982 Grolier formed a subsidiary called Grolier Electronic Publishing Inc. Grolier Electronic Publishing Inc was renamed Grolier Interactive Inc in February 1996. They made electronic encyclopedias for the Amiga and video games for DOS, Windows, Macintosh and the PlayStation.\nThe video games they released include:\n\nGrolier Interactive stopped releasing video games when Grolier was bought by Scholastic.\n\n\n"}

He began his education at Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts, after which point he entered Hofstra College to pursue a career in music. He then transferred to the College of Puget Sound where he earned an undergraduate degree in biology with minors in music and history in 1950, and a subsequent degree in education. Irwin was then a Fulbright teacher of botany and zoology at Queen's College in British Guiana from 1952 until 1956. During that time he was a coorespondent from TIME magazine. In 1956 he began work on his PhD in taxonomic botany at the University of Texas, earning his degree in 1960.\n\nIrwin first began his association with the New York Botanical Garden while a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin. During his time as a PhD student, Irwin traveled to Brazil and collected botanical specimens on behalf of NYBG, with the bulk of his collecting as a student taking place in 1958. Irwin's field notebooks from his time in Brazil (in total eight expeditions between the 1950s and the 1970s) are held by the Archives of the New York Botanical Garden, along with earlier notebooks documenting his time in Guyana and notebooks for an expedition to Surinam between 1960 and 1972. Irwin's vouchers were also deposited at NYBG and many can be viewed through the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium.\n\nIrwin was hired as a Research Associate at NYBG in 1960, promoted to Associate Curator in 1963, Curator and Administrator of the Herbarium in 1966, Head Curator in 1968, Executive Director in 1971, and President in 1973, a position that he held until 1979 to embark on a sabbatical to pursue scientific research and writing projects. The tenure of his administration is remembered as the most difficult financial period for NYBG, and Irwin is credited with leading the organization during a very challenging time.\n\nDonald J. Bruckmann, Chairman of the Board of Managers of the New York Botanical Garden wrote of Irwin upon his departure: \"Under his stewardship he brought the Garden to new eminence in the world of horticulture and plant science, and made it a great cultural institution in the city with the highest standards in the world. During his tenure the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory was restored and The Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, NY was established.\"\n\nIn addition to his administrative work, Irwin is credited with initiating the Planalto do Brasil Program for the botanical study of the Brazilian Highlands region.\n\nIrwin was appointed Vice Chancellor of Long Island University from 1980 until 1983 and Director of Clark Botanic Garden of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden from 1983 until 1991. He is Trustee Emeritus of the Truro Conservation Trust in Truro, MA, elected in 2008 after serving on the Trust Board from 2003 until 2008.\n\n\n\nIrwin and Marian Campbell Sterne married in the early 1950s and have two daughters.\n\nIrwin and Anne Lieb Wolff (now Anne Lieb Irwin) married on April 22nd, 1979 at the New York Botanical Garden's Enid A.

{"id": "49430884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49430884", "title": "Jijiupian", "text": "Jijiupian\n\nThe (c. 40 BCE) Jijiupian 急就篇, which was compiled by Han dynasty scholar Shi You 史游 (fl. 48-33 BCE), was a Chinese primer and a prototype for Chinese dictionaries. This Chinese character abecedarium \ncontains a series of orthographic word lists, categorized according to character radical, and briefly explained in rhymed lines. In the Qin and Han dynasties, several similar othographic primers were in circulation, such as \"Cangjiepian\", but the \"Jijiupian\" is the only one that survived for two millennia.\n\nThe \"Jíjiùpiān\" \"Quickly Master [Character] Chapters\" is also called the \"Jíjiùzhāng\" 急就章 \"Quickly Master [Character] Sections\" and simply \"Jíjiù\" 急就.\n\nThe title \"Jíjiùpiān\" uses the word \"piān\" 篇, which originally meant \"bamboo strips used for writing (before the invention of paper)\" and was semantically extended to \"sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book\". Several other Chinese dictionary titles use \"pian\", for example, the (c. 500? BCE) \"Shizhoupian\" \"Historian Zhou's Chapters\", (c. 220 BCE) \"Cangjiepian\" \"Cangjie's Chapters\", (c. 543) \"Yupian\" \"Jade Chapters\", and (1066) \"Leipian\" \"Categorized Chapters\".\n\n\"Jíjiù\" has several possible interpretations, depending on the meanings of \"jí\" 急 \"urgent; hurrying; rapid; fast; hasty; distress\" and \"jiù\" 就 \"proceed; advance; accomplish; achieve; accomplish; finish\". The \"Science and Civilisation in China\" collaborators Joseph Needham, Lu Gwei-djen, and Huang Hsing-Tsung (1986: 194) say, \"One hardly knows how to render its title, unless 'Handy Primer'.\" Thomas Lee (2000: 437) translates \"jijiu\" as \"quickly getting to\". The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 57) say that \"jijiu\" 急就 \"instant success\" suggested \"fast learning\", as seen in the first words of the \"Jijiupian\" preface.\nQuickly learn the rarely seen drinking vessels and many different things: listing the names of objects, people, and family names; classify them into different sections so that they will not be easily mixed up. Occasional consultation will definitely be a great delight—for it is quick to retrieve, and, if hard effort is put into it, there will surely be surprising rewards. Please follow the guidelines in each chapter. \nThis passage is notably the earliest recorded discussion of how to classify characters into different textual sections (Yong and Peng 2008: 144).\n\nWhile the title is usually transliterated \"Jijiupian\", \"Chi-chiu-p'ien\", etc., some English translations are:\n\nThe first reference to the \"Jijiupian\" and Shi You 史游 is found in the \"Yiwenzhi\" \"Treatise on Literature\" bibliographical section of the (111 CE) \"Hanshu\" \"Book of Han\", listed among early dictionaries: \"In the time of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48-33 BCE), the court scholar Shi You composed the \"Jijiupian\"\" (元帝时黄门令史游作急就篇). This section also uses the \"Jijiu\" title; \"Jijiu yipian\" 急就一篇 \"The \"Jijiu\", in one chapter\" (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 194).\n\nIn the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-25 CE), the teaching of characters was emphasized, and scholars compiled other character glossaries and wordbooks besides the \"Jijiupian\", for instance, the \"Fanjiangpian\" 凡將篇 \"The General Primer\" by Sima Xiangru and \"Yuanshangpian\" 元尚篇 \"The Yuanshang Primer\" by Li Chang 李長, both of which are lost works. These proto-dictionaries facilitated the development of Chinese \"xiǎoxué\" 小學 \"minor learning; pre-modern 'linguistics'; philology\" (which now means \"primary school\"), and laid the academic foundation for the compilation of wordbooks, vocabularies, and dictionaries (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 25). The Han dynasty experienced the transition of Chinese lexicography from wordlists and glossaries to character dictionaries and word dictionaries. The \"Jijiupian\" generalized the practice of logically classifying characters into different sections, which inspired the \"macro-level stylistic format of the Chinese dictionary\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 144).\n\nFrom the Han to the Six Dynasties (220-589), the most popular character textbook was the \"Jijiupian\" (Wilkinson 2000: 49). During the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589), several other popular textbooks appeared, such as the \"Qianziwen\" \"Thousand Characters Text\", \"Baijiaxing\" \"Myriad Family Surnames\", and \"Sanzijing\" \"Three-character Classic\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 57). By the Tang, the \"Jijiupian\" had been replaced by the \"Qianziwen\" and \"Baijiaxing\", both of which were deliberately written so that few characters they contain occur more than once. They were memorized generation after generation for over 1,000 years. In the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) and Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the most popular primer was the \"Sanzijing\" (Wilkinson 2000: 49). Contemporary Chinese scholarship admires the \"Jijiupian\" because of its high factual content as contrasted with the much more moralistic tendencies of similar later works such as the \"Sanzijing\" (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).\n\nThe \"Jijiupian\" was one of several similar wordbooks that circulated widely during the Qin and Han periods, but it alone survived to the present day, owing to several factors. One reason for its preservation was a model version written by the famous Jin dynasty Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi (303–361), which was copied by generation after generation of literati eager to perfect their calligraphy (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The Yuan dynasty calligrapher Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) also produced an orthographic model \"Jijiupian\". Another factor was the textual explanations written by famous authors in later dynasties. The Tang scholar Yan Shigu wrote a (620) commentary, and the Song scholar Wang Yinglin 王應麟 wrote the (1280) \"Xingshi Jijiupian\" 姓氏急就篇 (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).\n\nModern archeological excavations have found fragments of the \"Jijiupian\", and even some tablets on which the inscriptions were evidently exercises in copying characters (Loewe 1967 2: 418; Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197).\n\nThe original \"Jijiupian\" consisted of 32 sections (\"zhang\" 章), each with 63 Chinese characters, totaling 2,016. Some later editions of the text add two more sections, each with 64 characters, thus totaling 2,144. The text was designed to include as many different characters as possible, with little repetition, in order to maximize the student's exposure to and learning of new words. The text is described as a sort of abecedarium (Goodrich 1975: 220, Yates 2011: 358).\n\nThe \"Jijiupian\" collation puts together characters written with the same radical or signific, and then divides them into chapters. Within each chapter, the style consisted mainly of 3-, 4-, or 7-syllable rhyming lines, as in Chinese poetry. Rhyme makes it easy to read, memorize, and recite (Yong and Peng 2008: 57).\n\nChina's first \"word books\" were written to meet the needs of literacy education (Allan 2013: 212). Shi You's \"Jijiupian\" was intended to be used for learning the meanings of basic characters and how they should properly be written. It formed a basis for verbal elaborations by teachers, and could have served as a handy reference manual for scribes and copyists (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The original Han edition \"Jijiupian\" was written in clerical script, but it was later used for learning to write in other calligraphic styles of characters, such as regular script and cursive script.\n\nThe \"Jijiupian\" has historical linguistic value as a record of common words that were current during the Han dynasty. It preserved many technical terms and names of plants, animals, tools, and objects, which are important for the histories of science, medicine, and technology. For instance, the \"Jijiupian\" was the first text to describe the trip hammer and waterwheel.\n\nTo illustrate the types of lists that the \"Jijiupian\" contains, and their value for those who wished to write correctly, consider the Section 24 list of traditional Chinese herbal medicines, written in rhymed 7-character lines (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195).\n灸刺和药逐去邪 By moxa, acupuncture and the compounding of drugs we may drive out the malign (\"qi\" that cause illness).

{"id": "10694905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10694905", "title": "John Pesek", "text": "John Pesek\n\nJohn Pesek (February 21, 1894 – March 12, 1978) was an American professional wrestler and greyhound racing dog breeder.\n\nPesek was born to Bohemian parents near Ravenna, Nebraska, the fifth of seven children, and grew up living the hard life of the American pioneer. His father Martin died in an accident when John was twelve.\n\nPesek originally planned a career in boxing but took to professional wrestling instead, with which he became familiar by attending the traveling carnivals of the era. His first high-profile match was in 1914 when he defeated Wladek Zbyszko.\n\nPesek was nicknamed \"The Nebraska Tiger Man\" for his ferocity and catlike dexterity. He was also legitimately strong and could hold his own on the mat against opponents that frequently outweighed him considerably. Pesek is recorded as losing only about 20 matches in his entire career, which he began undefeated until January 16, 1920 when he lost to fellow Nebraskan Joe Stecher. Among the few other men to ever defeat Pesek were Jim Londos and Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis. A true \"hooker\" who believed in wrestling as legitimate competitive sport, Pesek disliked the wrestling \"trust\" that emerged in the 1920s for its booking of pre-determined match outcomes. His reluctance to co-operate with promoters isolated him from the wrestling mainstream for much of his career.\n\nOne important wrestling figure with whom Pesek did agree to work was Ed Lewis, for whom he became a \"policeman\" to ward off the so-called \"trustbusters\", outlaw wrestlers who posed threats to promotions and their champions by refusing to co-operate (fix matches) during matches. On November 14, 1921, Pesek squared off against one of the most prominent trustbusters, Croatian-born wrestler Marin Plestina at Madison Square Garden. Pesek proceeded to administer such a severe beating (through continual fouling) that Plestina was hospitalized. All three falls of the match were forfeited due to repeated head butting and eye gouging by Pesek. His repeated fouling caused a near riot. The New York Times credits Plestina with \"intensified fairness\" in the face of Pesek's continued fouling. This is the reason Pesek was banned from wrestling for life in New York. These comments are taken from a New York Times article dated November 15, 1921. New York's athletic commission refused to award Pesek his prize money and banned him from wrestling in the state, but the Tiger Man had done his job.\n\nOn another occasion, Pesek was hired to give Lewis' ally, Boston-area promoter Paul Bowser, a hand in his battle with rival promoter Jack Curley. Curley was aggressively promoting Olympic wrestling medalist Nat Pendleton and issued a series of haughty challenges, among them boasting that Pendleton could beat Lewis and any other wrestler on the same night. Pesek was enlisted to face Curley's protégé, and in a legitimate contest held on January 25, 1923, Pesek defeated and injured Pendleton to claim an $8000 purse and give Bowser a major financial and publicity victory.\n\nPesek would memorably cross paths with Joe Stecher again, wrestling him three times in 1926. Stecher, now the world champion, won the first meeting on April 29, and the second match on August 25 ended in a draw. Then, on October 6 at Los Angeles' Olympic Auditorium, subbing for Ed Lewis, Pesek diverted from the planned result and trapped Stecher in a wrist lock. Stecher appeared to submit, but in order to save face the referee disqualified Pesek under the pretense that he had used an illegal choke hold, allowing Stecher to retain the title. Stecher was said to have cried after the match.\n\nDespite making a good living in America, Pesek eventually grew tired of backroom politics and opted to go overseas for a while in 1929. Traveling to New Zealand and Australia, he became a sensation there, winning 47 consecutive bouts.\n\nPesek's reputation as a maverick held him back from holding many championships in his career, and he has been characterized as a \"trustbuster\" in his own right. It turned out that none of the titles he did hold were either won or lost in the ring. From 1931 to 1933, he was the recognized Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) champion, until he forfeited the title to wrestle for another promotion. Later, Pesek was recognized for a time as National Wrestling Association champion. He was belatedly given the vacant NWA championship on September 13, 1937, as he had been the only man to post a $1000 bond for a proposed tournament one year earlier. However, he was soon stripped of the title when he refused to meet two challengers. Pesek was again awarded the vacant MWA championship in 1938, but was stripped of it in June 1940 for, once again, failing to meet the top contenders.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Pesek had begun turning his focus towards racing greyhounds, and on of his Nebraska farm he built up one of the nation's leading stables. He won several national titles, and the pedigree of one of his greatest dogs, Australian-born \"Just Andrew\", could be found in 95 percent of American greyhound stock by 1975.\n\nPesek continued to appear occasionally in exhibition matches through the 1950s, long enough to wrestle on the same card as son Jack, who would go on to enjoy a lengthy wrestling career of his own. He wrestled his final match in 1959.\n\nPesek married Myrl Mahoney (died 1966) on February 14, 1921. The couple had seven children: Elizabeth, Jack, Virginia, Mary Lee, Kevin, Catherine and Steve. Jack Pesek went on to become a professional wrestler like his father.\n\nPesek died at his home on March 12, 1978 from a heart attack. He was buried at the Highland Cemetery outside Ravenna. A bronze statue of Pesek with two greyhounds was being created at the time of his death, and it was posthumously unveiled in front of Ravenna Bank on May 28, 1978.\n\nAlthough lesser known than some of his contemporaries, John Pesek is recognized today as one of the best wrestlers of his era. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2005, as well as the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996; Pesek had earlier been inducted into the \"Lincoln Journal\"'s Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1957. His contributions to the sport of greyhound racing have also been recognized by his induction to the Greyhound National Hall Of Fame in 1978 – his dogs \"Gangster\" and \"Just Andrew\" were inducted in 1964 and 1975, respectively.\n\n\n"}

The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 as part of the preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.\n\nIn total, 21 people have held the position. Of Philip Bliss, who was Keeper of the Archives for 31 years in the 19th century, it was said that \"his penchant for accumulation seems to have impeded administrative efficiency\". Reginald Lane Poole, who was in office from 1909 to 1927, took a much narrower view on what should be kept, and criticised his predecessors for their \"fatal inability ... to destroy things when they are done with\". The third to hold the position, John Wallis (who was also Savilian Professor of Geometry), prepared an index of the collection that was still used into the 20th century. The present holder, Simon Bailey, is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives: he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor, David Vaisey, but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000. The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010, and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director.\n\nThe position of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it claims to have one of the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended to them in the 17th century. As part of his work as a member of the committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.\n\nThe 1634 statutes stated that \"the careless keeping of the archives of our University, and the gross ignorance of our privileges\" had led to \"many mischiefs and losses\", particularly in the \"almost daily contests with the citizens of Oxford\" described by it as \"ancient rivals\" who \"catch at every occasion of impugning our privileges\". The statutes provided that \"hereafter and for ever, some person shall be sought for\", to collect and guard the archives, \"that he may produce them without delay whenever occasion requires it\". This person was to assist the senior officers of the university and be \"an unembarrassed and ready champion in guarding and defending the University privileges and rights.\" Students at the university (unless exempted by poverty) were to pay 1 shilling towards defence of Oxford's rights, and £40 from this fund was to be paid to the Keeper of the Archives as his salary. Under the 1634 statutes, Convocation (the main governing body of the university at the time) chose the Keeper of the Archives, and there were sometimes contested elections for the position; under the modern statutes, the position is filled by decision of the Committee for the Archives.\nThe scope of the archives is defined by a university regulation. It includes charters, title deeds, copies of university statutes and regulations, records maintained by the university's Registrar and minutes of meetings, as well as any other official material from the university or its departments that is not in current use and whose preservation is \"desirable\" in the opinion of the Committee for the Archives. The university archives do not contain material from the colleges of the university, which hold their material separately. The earliest document held, dating from 1214, is a decision of a Papal legate in a dispute between the town of Oxford and the university. The majority of the archives date from the 19th and 20th centuries, and are mainly in paper format, with only a few photographs and no sound or video recordings. The archives became part of the Bodleian Library in August 2010, and the Keeper of the Archives now reports to the library's Keeper of Special Collections and Associate Director. The present holder, Simon Bailey, works with an Assistant Keeper (a role split between two people each working part-time) and an Archives Assistant. Bailey is the first full-time Keeper of the Archives: he was previously the Archivist under his predecessor, David Vaisey, but a decision was taken to combine the two posts in 2000. Some of the holders of the position have been appointed to a Fellowship of one of the colleges; unlike some of the professorships at Oxford, it is not linked to a particular college.\nIn the table below, \"college\" indicates the college or hall of the university (if any) at which the individual held an official position, such as a fellowship, during his time as Keeper of the Archives.\n"}

{"id": "22006582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22006582", "title": "Pabst Plan", "text": "Pabst Plan\n\nThe Pabst Plan (, \"New German city of Warsaw\") was a Nazi German urban plan to reconstruct the city of Warsaw as a Nazi model city. Named after its creator Friedrich Pabst, the Nazis' \"Chief Architect for Warsaw\", the plan assumed that Warsaw, the historical capital of Poland and a city of 1.5 million inhabitants, would be completely destroyed and rebuilt as a small German town of not more than 130,000 inhabitants. \n\nIn modern historical works the term is used to denote any of the German World War II plans concerning the destruction and reconstruction of Warsaw. In particular the \"Pabst Plan\" refers to a plan prepared by Hubert Gross and Otto Nurnberger in 1940 and another plan, prepared by Pabst himself in 1942. Both plans envisioned the destruction of most of Warsaw with its historical monuments and residential areas. In its place a new model city was to be created as a seat for the German ruling class of the occupied Polish territories. It was to house a large \"Parteivolkshalle\" (\"People's Party Hall\") in place of the Royal Castle in Warsaw and serve as a major transportation hub.\n\nAfter the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the Germans decided to destroy the city in its entirety.\n\nThe destruction of the city was already planned long before its almost total destruction in 1944, even prior to the start of World War II. On 20 June 1939, while Adolf Hitler was visiting an architectural bureau in Würzburg, his attention was captured by a project to create a future \"German\" town – Warsaw (, ), which later became known as the Pabst Plan. Friedrich Pabst prepared a technical plan for the annihilation of Warsaw and the complete ethnic cleansing of its native Polish population, with Polish Jews condemned to be the first destined for extermination. It envisaged the transformation of the Polish capital into a new, provincial German town, containing an exclusively ethnic German population of no more than 130,000 people on the left bank supported by a slave labour camp of 80,000 Poles on the right bank of the Vistula. Warsaw’s total population in 1935 was around 1.3 million, consisting of Poles, Jews and other minorities, which meant that putting the new urbanization plan to work would require the complete removal of its entire population. The project included 15 separate plans and photos, and solid pre-build documentation. Among all the pages of the project the most important is a colored plan of the future town which was created by German architects in 1:20 000 scale titled: \"Die neue deutsche Stadt Warschau\" (Warsaw, the New German City). The final table bore the caption \"Der Abbau der Polenstadt und der Aufbau der Deutschen Stadt\" (The Destruction of the Polish City and the Construction of the German City).\n\nSome parts of the project that were showing Warsaw’s urban development from the half of 17th century until the year 1935 were based on Polish documentation from 1935 and presumably on scientific sources prepared for \"Warsaw’s Territorial Development of Communication and Transportation\" by Prof. O. Sosnowski. All these sources were skillfully extracted long before the war. At an early stage, thanks to German deception based on the false pretense of doing scientific research, the German planners concealed the hidden agenda necessary for creating such a plan. German scholars, historians, conservators and professors of architecture and other experts were enlisted to catalogue all of the most important and culturally significant landmarks of the city, the most exquisite churches and public buildings, key library collections, artworks and sculptures.\n\nThe \"German Varsavia\" was planned to be a built on the crossroad of German highways and railroad networks. It covered a 6 km² built-up area plus 1 km² of the centuries-old Warsaw’s Prague district, for a combined 7 km² area, with parks and green areas bringing to a total of 15 km². The 7 km² of buildings was just 1/20 of the existing Polish capital city and was very different from the actual existing road network of 1939. The whole town center was to be built into a net of narrow, picturesque streets, resembling the planning of a typical German town. The modern and wide Polish capital avenues (like Ulica Marszałkowska, Twarda, Mokotowska, Dzika, Oś Saska, Oś Stanisławowska) would have been erased forever with all their monumental and beautiful buildings and palaces. Only the remains of the Old Town district (without the Polish King’s Castle), the King’s Baths Palace () and Belvedere (), and modified parts of the Vistula riverside buildings would have been saved.\n\nAfter the start of military operations and the fall of the capital into German hands the project was updated, incorporating the city's partial destruction in the September offensive of 1939. The project was soon to be included as a part of the overall Germanization plan of the East, the genocidal Generalplan Ost. \n\nOn October 8, 1939 western areas of Poland were annexed by the Third Reich, and on October 12, 1939 the central areas of Poland were incorporated into the General Government by Hitler’s decrees. The capital of the Gubernia was placed in Kraków (Krakau, Cracow) for security reasons. The occupying German elite was afraid of unsubdued Warsaw.\n\nThe plan was to be implemented in several stages. One of the parts for the plan, the \"Demolition of the Polish City and the Construction of the German City\" (\"Abbau der Polen-Stadt und der Aufbau der Deutschen Stadt\") included a list of the Polish capital’s centers of life destined for destruction, put in chronological order based on planned liquidation date. The planners also decided to use the destruction caused by bombings and fires during the September 1939 seizure of the city as a pretext for the urbanistic changes. Another part of the plan included a detailed map of the anticipated destruction showing almost all buildings destroyed coincidentally according to the original plan. In reality only 10 percent of the buildings were destroyed in 1939, with total civilian and military losses of around 12,000 killed and 66,000 wounded.\n\nIn the \"Small Plan\" (\"Kleine Planung\"), the population of Warsaw was to be limited to 500,000 people. The first group affected by this measure was Warsaw's Jewish population, which the German planners assumed would be removed (\"Judenaussiedlung\") from an area of around 482 hm² and forcibly relocated to a \"Jewish Quarter\" (\"Judenviertel\") which was 3.5 times smaller, i.e. 143 hm² surrounded by walls and watchtowers. In 1940, the Nazis turned the northern part of mid-town Warsaw (Wola and Muranow) into a Jewish ghetto. The Jewish Ghetto was planned to accommodate around 30,000 of the capital's inhabitants that were of Jewish origin; however it eventually held nearly 400,000 people living in deplorable conditions. The next step for decreasing the original population of the city was the systematic displacement of people captured and destined for either slave labor in the Third Reich or extermination in concentration and labor camps. As early as 1940 all inhabitants of Warsaw were subject to round-ups (łapanki) and mass shootings in the streets. Nearly 250,000 civilians were eventually murdered this way. Memorial plaques can be seen throughout Warsaw today commemorating this indiscriminate program of ethnic cleansing men, women and children. Those who did not manage to escape were sent to death camps at Auschwitz or Majdanek or forced into labour in Germany. Among the 2,857,500 Poles working as slave labor in the Third Reich during World War II, a significant percentage was composed of Warsaw and Warsaw province inhabitants.\n\nOn 6 February 1940 the German mayor of the city presented an unusual gift to Hans Frank, the Governor-General of the Occupied Polish Territories. The gift was a full documentation of the new German town Warsaw (\"Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau\"), the so-called Pabst Plan, prepared by German architects Hubert Gross and Otto Nurnberger.\n\nOn October 9, 1942 Heinrich Himmler ordered the creation of the Warsaw concentration camp (\"Konzentrationslager Warschau - KL Warschau\") which consisted of the Koło district camp (\"Kriegsgefangenenlager Warschau\", 1939) and two other camps in the proximity of Dworzec Zachodni (Western Train Station, 1942): the Gęsia camp (Gęsia Street Camp, 1943) and the Bonifraterska camp (Bonifraterska Street Camp, 1943). KL Warschau was functioning until August 28, 1944 when the German government of the city ordered the evacuation of its prisoners into the Third Reich, out of fear that the ongoing Warsaw Uprising might result in freeing them. The prisoners were transported to concentration camps in Third Reich: Dachau, Landsberg, Mühldorf, Kaufering, Gross-Rosen and Ravensbrück.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23727586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23727586", "title": "Posek", "text": "Posek\n\nPosek ( , pl. Poskim, ) is the term in Jewish law for a \"decisor\" — a legal scholar who determines the position of \"Halakha\" in cases of law where previous authorities are inconclusive, or in those situations where no clear \"halakhic\" precedent exists.\n\nThe decision of a posek is known as a psak din or psak halakha (\"ruling of law\"; pl. \"piskei din\", \"piskei halakha\") or simply a \"psak\". In Hebrew, פסק is the root implying to \"stop\" or \"cease\"—the posek brings the process of legal debate to finality. \"Piskei din\" are generally recorded in the responsa literature.\n\nIn formulating a ruling, a posek will base the \"psak din\" on a careful analysis of the relevant underlying legal principles, as well as a careful study of the application of these principles. A Posek must therefore be thoroughly versed in rabbinic literature, from the Babylonian Talmud, through the major medieval codifications of the Law and up to recent decisors.\n\nThe process of analysis usually entails today:\n\nThe ruling itself is an attempt to apply the precedents and principles of the Tradition to the question being asked. One common goal of poskim in this regard is, as far as possible, to be consistent with the codified law, as well as with the maximal relevant legal precedents, generally being decisions recorded in the responsa literature.\n\nPoskim play an integral role in Orthodox Judaism in general and Haredi Judaism in particular. \nThe approach taken here will, generally, be as above. Thus \"poskim\" will not overrule a specific law, unless based on an earlier authority: a posek will generally extend a law to new situations, but will not \"change\" the Halakhah; see further under Orthodox Judaism.\n\nIn 2014 the first ever book of halachic decisions written by women who were ordained to serve as poskim (Idit Bartov and Anat Novoselsky) was published. The women were ordained by the municipal chief rabbi of Efrat, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, after completing Midreshet Lindenbaum women’s college’s five-year ordination course in advanced studies in Jewish law, as well as passing examinations equivalent to the rabbinate’s requirement for men.\n\nConservative Judaism approaches the idea of \"Posek\", and Halakha in general, somewhat differently, and Poskim here apply a relatively lower weighting to precedent, and will thus frequently re-interpret (or even change) a law through a formal argument; see Conservative Halakha. Although there are some \"poskim\" in the Conservative movement - e.g. Rabbis Louis Ginzberg, David Golinkin, Joel Roth, and Elliot Dorff - the rulings of any one individual rabbi are considered less authoritative than a consensus ruling. Thus, the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly maintains a Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, whose decisions are accepted as authoritative within the American Conservative movement. At the same time, every Conservative rabbi has the right as \"mara d'atra\" to interpret Jewish law for his own community, regardless of the responsa of the Law Committee.\n\nBoth Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism do not regard the halakha as binding.\n\nAlthough Reform stresses the individual autonomy of its membership, it never completely abandoned the field of Responsa literature, if only to counter its rivals' demands. Even Classical Reformers such as Rabbi David Einhorn composed some. Rabbi Solomon Freehof, and his successor Rabbi Walter Jacob, attempted to create a concept of \"Progressive Halacha\", authoring numerous responsa based on a methodology laying great emphasis on current sensibilities and ethical ideals. Full text collections of Reform responsa are available on the website of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. \n\nThe Reconstructionist position is that if Jews would have formed cohesive communities again, their rulings would be binding, yet presently Judaism is in a \"post-Halakhic state\". Therefore, their basic policy is to allow tradition \"a vote, not a veto\" in communal and personal affairs.\n\nPre-20th Century\n\nOrthodox\n\nConservative and Reform\n\n\n\n"}

However, Duterte insisted that it will not be any different from martial law under President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nWhile the declaration does not currently affect citizens and government units in Luzon or the Visayas, Duterte suggested that he might extend the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to Visayas and martial law to the entire country if needed to \"protect the people.\"\n\nThe Congress approved of a resolution supporting the measure on May 31, 2017\n\nOn July 23, 2017, lawmakers voted 261–18 (with no abstention among those present) in favor of the President Rodrigo Duterte's request to give extension to Proclamation Order No. 216 during a special joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This extension was valid until December 31, 2017.\n\nThe majority number required for the approval of martial law is at 158 of the 314 members of Congress.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the President can declare martial law for an initial period of 60 days and ask for its extension in case of rebellion, invasion or when public safety requires it.\n\nThe incumbent Senators who voted for NO are as follows:\nThe incumbent Representatives who voted for NO are as follows:\nThe incumbent Senators who were ABSENT are as follows:\n\nOn December 13, 2017, a special joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate was held in order to respond to President Rodrigo Duterte's request to extend the declaration of martial law in Mindanao until December 31, 2018. In his letter addressed to the Congress, President Duterte cited the remaining threats of ISIS-inspired terrorist groups. Congress voted 240–27 (14–4 from the Senate, 226–23 from the House) in favor of the second extension.\n\nFour petitions were filed before the Philippine Supreme Court questioning the year-long extension of martial law in Mindanao. Among the petitioners were one of the framers of the 1987 Philippine Constitution Christian Monsod, a former Commission on Elections chairperson, and opposition lawmakers. Petitioners contended that the extension lacked factual basis, citing government reports that Marawi City had been liberated. \n\nOn December 5, 2017, the Supreme Court voted 10-3-1 upholding the implementation of martial law in Mindanao, with Supreme Court Justice Noel Tijam saying that the extension was necessary because of persisting rebellion. Dissenting opinion by Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Leonen stated that the re-extension of martial law \"enables the rise of an emboldened authoritarian.\"\nPresident Duterte's declaration of martial law in the entire Mindanao region was met with polarized views from the citizens with some reports indicating mixed reactions. However, actual surveys on the ground indicate that majority of Filipinos are in favor of its imposition.\nSome lawmakers from Mindanao expressed their views on the president's declaration of martial law. Mindanao lawmakers led by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said Wednesday, May 24 that the declaration of martial law in Mindanao is justifiable, given the other security problems faced by the region. Surigao del Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel shared the same sentiment. He said martial law will help address his province’s longstanding \"insurgency problem\". Davao City 1st District Representative Karlo Nograles, who called the crisis in Marawi as a “clear case of rebellion,\" said martial rule will help confine the fighting. Alvarez and Nograles also noted that the 1987 Constitution has safeguards against abuse in relation to martial law. Senator Manny Pacquiao said “I fully support the declaration of martial law in Mindanao by President Rodrigo Duterte. I believe this is timely and necessary in the light of political turmoil perpetrated by the Moro extremists in Marawi City.” Senators Antonio Trillanes IV and Bam Aquino, on the other hand, questioned President Duterte's declaration of a martial law in Mindanao. According to former President Fidel Ramos, \"the martial law that will happen could be more harmful\" (compared to Ferdinand Marcos's time).\n\nOn May 30, 2017, the majority bloc of the Senate adopted a resolution expressing support for President Duterte's declaration of martial law in Mindanao, saying that the proclamation is required for public safety while at the same time clarifying the operation of the 1987 Constitution. The resolution passed the Senate in a 17–5 vote. The opponents of the resolution, all minority bloc senators, filed another resolution calling for a joint session of Congress to decide on the proclamation. Their resolution failed the Senate in a 12–9 vote.\n\nCatholic bishops in Mindanao believe that President Duterte's declaration of martial law in the region should only be temporary. Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, the Archbishop of Cotabato, said that the Church is aware of the declaration's necessity to solve issues of peace and order and that the Church does not have \"solid and sufficient\" facts to protest the declaration as \"morally reprehensible\". He urged the Mindanaoan people to remain calm but vigilant as to ensure that the implementation of martial law would not be abused. Quevado added that the Church is prepared to fully condemn the declaration of martial law \"if it goes in the way of evil.\" Ozamiz Archbishop Martin Jumoad supports the declaration of martial law, but believes that there should be a \"mechanism\" to ensure that the implementation would not violate human rights.\n\nA group of lawyers from the Philippine Muslim Society is planning to oppose before the Supreme Court the president's declaration of martial law in Mindanao.\n\nPhilippine financial markets weakened in early trading on March 24, 2017 as the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index (PSEi) was down 0.42 percent to 7,779.73, before rallying to close at 7,837.82, up by 0.33 percent or 25.68 points, which a trader attributed to investors remaining positive on the domestic market despite the developments in Mindanao.\n\nInvestors are monitoring closely how Duterte will use martial law to fight the long-running extremist problem in the south, analysts said. BPI Securities research head Haj Narvaez told Cathy Yang on ANC's \"Market Edge\" that the incident caused uncertainties which made investors to be more conservative in their decisions. Narvaez projects \"some downward pressure\" probably in the next 1 to 2 weeks and says that investors will assess if the situation in Mindanao can be controlled. Tycoon and philanthropist Washington SyCip said the President cutting short a foreign visit due to security worries was \"not the publicity that we need. I think worldwide, the word martial law is not the best thing.\"\n\nAmidst fighting in Marawi and fears of martial law, numerous overseas tourists have cancelled hotel and resort bookings in the Visayas region.\n\nThe Department of National Defense issued a guidance to the Armed Forces of the Philippines and its attached bureaus regarding the proper implementation of martial law in Mindanao. The memorandum states:\n\nOn May 25, 2017, after authorities received information on the presence of unidentified and suspicious-looking persons, around 250 individuals have been rounded up in the barangays of Bucana and Mini-Forest in Davao City as \"persons of interest\" for not being able to present proof of identification. According to Davao City Police Office Senior Supt. Alexander Tagum, they were at DPCO headquarters to undergo \"a verification process\" and were not under arrest. He said their operation is part of their efforts to prevent the entry of terrorists in one of Mindanao's biggest cities.\n\nOn Friday, May 26, 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines stated that it would censor the press and social media to \"protect national security\" across Mindanao, and warned that violators would be arrested. According to military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla, \"We'll exercise the right to censure, (sic)\" and that it would be based on 3 conditions: to ensure the safety of lives, to ensure operational security and to ensure the safety of men in uniform who are fighting, and for other national security considerations.\n\n\"\"Kaya ngayon umaapela kami maaga pa lang na i-exercise 'nyo ang common sense, na 'pag alam ninyo na ito’y nakakasama at hindi nakakatulong, ‘wag 'nyo na ‘ho i-post. Baka minsan na lang, kakatukin na lang kayo ng pulis at aarestuhin kayo,\"” (This early, we’re appealing to the public to exercise their common sense. If you know that what you're posting does harm and does not help, don’t post it. You might just find the police knocking on your door to arrest you.) according to Padilla.\n\nLikewise, the Philippine National Police in Davao region (Police Regional Office 11, or PRO-11) stated that the right to form a public assembly such as protests or rallies against the government would be curtailed with the declaration of Martial Law in Mindanao. PRO-11 said that leaders and organizers of groups that will stage protests or rallies would be arrested if caught making a public nuisance.\n\nOn the same Friday, Duterte expressed his intention to take responsibility for the actions of soldiers in Mindanao during the implementation of martial law. He assured soldiers that they had his full support and stated: \"If you go down, I go down. But for this martial law and the consequences of martial law and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible. \"Trabaho lang kayo. Ako na ang bahala. Ako na ang magpakulong sa inyo\" (Just do your job. I will take care of things. I'll be the one to be imprisoned for you)\".\n\nHe then joked that soldiers would be free to rape and that he would be the one to go to jail for it. \"Pag naka-rape ka ng tatlo, aminin ko na akin iyon,\" (If you were to rape three, I'll admit that it was mine) according to Duterte.\n\nAmidst outrage from citizens, women's groups, human rights groups, and personalities like Chelsea Clinton and Senator Risa Hontiveros, Malacañang Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella defended Duterte's rape joke as \"heightened bravado\". Senator Manny Pacquiao, likewise defended Duterte by stating \"Just because he is the President, he can’t crack jokes anymore?\"\n\nOn Saturday, May 27, 2017, Duterte vowed that he would ignore Congress and the Supreme Court on the duration limits of martial law. He said: \"Hanggang hindi sinabi ng pulis pati Armed Forces na safe na ang Philippines, this martial law will continue. Hindi ako makinig sa iba. 'Yang Supreme Court, 'yang mga congressmen, wala naman sila dito. Bakit, sila ba ang nagpapakamatay? Sila ba ang naghirap dito? Sila ba 'yung – have they suffered the wounds of war? Sila ba 'yung nagtitiis?\" (Until the police and the Armed Forces say the Philippines is already safe, this martial law will continue. I won't listen to others. The Supreme Court, the congressmen, they're not here. Why, are they the ones risking their lives? Are they the ones suffering here? Are they – have they suffered the wounds of war? Are they the ones enduring this battle?)\n\nOn May 31, 2017, the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) released a cartoon video with the hashtag \"#DefendRepublic\" promoting Martial Law on the Internet via its official Twitter and Facebook accounts. In it, a fearful boy is seen holding a shield with the words \"Martial Law\" inscribed on it, as silhouettes of professional-looking soldiers labeled \"Extremist\" march upon him, while a voiceover narrates:\n\nThe video was derided by netizens and senators due to its content, grammar and poor graphics and message that Martial Law should be treated as \"the new normal\", as well as for being a waste of taxpayer money. The video was deleted by the PCOO shortly thereafter and disowned by the palace.\n\nOn May 25, 2017, the Communist Party of the Philippines called on its armed wing, the New People's Army, to \"plan and carry out more tactical offensives across Mindanao and the entire archipelago\" in response to the Philippine government's declaration of martial law. The party said that the \"martial law imposition was made on narrow pretext of armed clashes in Marawi City between the AFP and Maute group,\" which the party referred to as a bandit group whose leaders, the party claim, \"have known links with military officials.\" The CPP also called on Filipinos to fight the imposition of martial law in Mindanao and demand its immediate lifting.\n\nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana warned the New People's Army not to get involved with the Marawi crisis as he reiterated that the implementation of martial law in Mindanao will not target local communists. Lorenzana said that martial law was declared to address radical Islamic terrorism and narco-terrorism in Mindanao according to the directives of the President and that they will fully comply with them. He urged the communists not to force the government's hand and to immediately stop all illegal activities and abide by the true spirit of the peace process.\n\nPeace talks between the Government of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front in the Netherlands were suspended following these developments. It was the second time that it was put on hold since the Duterte administration started negotiations with the communist rebels in 2016, with Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza saying the administration \"will not proceed to participate in the scheduled fifth round of peace negotiations until such time as there are clear indications that an enabling environment conducive to achieving just and sustainable peace in the land shall prevail.\" Dureza cited the continuing attacks by the NPA and the communist leadership's order for its armed wing to \"accelerate and intensify attacks against the government in the face of martial law in Mindanao.\"\n\nLumads, or the non-Muslim indigenous peoples of Mindanao, have been vocally against the imposition of martial rule due to the past experience of martial law during the Marcos dictatorship. After 3 months since the imposition of martial rule, numerous human rights violations were recorded by independent human rights organizations. Among these violations caused by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police were the bombing of Lumad schools, the food blockade against Lumad communities which forced Lumads to go hungry and move away from their ancestral lands, the capturing of ancestral lands from indigenous Lumads, the killing of suspected Lumads who are reportedly part of the NPA despite no concrete investigation, the censorship of various media outlets in Lumad communities, and the killing of numerous Lumad leaders, which has led to a blow in Lumad morale. Since the declaration of martial law in Mindanao, there was a heightened presence of government security forces which discouraged Lumad children from going to schools. Linking Lumad schools to communist rebels, President Rodrigo Duterte in a public speech threatened to bomb the schools which he says are promoting \"subversion\" and communism ideology.\n\nReports also surfaced during and after the Battle of Marawi, stating that six soldiers looted stole jewelries and cash from houses in the city. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "4113674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4113674", "title": "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare", "text": "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare\n\nPsychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare (\"\") was a manual written by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the Nicaraguan Contras, who were involved in a civil war with the Nicaraguan government. It was revealed by the Associated Press on October 15, 1984. The ninety-page book of instructions focused mainly on how \"Armed Propaganda Teams\" could build political support in Nicaragua for the Contra cause through deceit, intimidation, and violence. The manual also discussed assassinations.\nThe ICJ case \"Nicaragua v. United States\" found that the publication of this manual had \"encouraged acts ... contrary to general principles of humanitarian law.\"\nHowever, the CIA claimed that the purpose of the manual was to \"moderate\" the extreme violence already being used by the Contras.\n\nThe manual was written in October 1983 by a CIA contract employee who used the alias John Kirkpatrick, who \"was a U.S. Army counterinsurgency specialist, with experience in the Vietnam War-era Phoenix Program, working under contract to the CIA's International Activities Division.\" Duane Clarridge, who oversaw the writing of the manual, claimed in his 2009 book that John Kirkpatrick was brought in to prepare a course for the Contras on how to interact with the civilian population and outline the rule of engagement, and that he also produced a manual consisting of this curriculum material. Kirkpatrick based his work off of existing US Army manuals, particularly 1968 Green Beret lesson plans used at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, the Green Berets' Lesson Plan 643, \"Armed Psyop: Implicit and Explicit Terror\" (April 1968), and Field Manual 30–104, Collaborators on developing the manual included CIA Contra coordinator Ray Doty, Nicaraguan Democratic Force director of communications Edgar Chamorro, Noel Ortiz, and Laura Ortiz.\n\nThe manual was written in English, and then translated into Spanish by Edgar Chamorro. It was printed in ninety pages under the pseudonym Tayacán in late 1983. Chamorro objected to two portions in the document, namely the sections on hiring professional criminals for special jobs and killing colleagues to create martyrs for the cause. He arranged for these two pages to be physically torn out from 2000 copies. However, 5000 copies were printed, so some commentators have reasoned that some copies were distributed with these sections intact.\n\nA Reagan administration official stated privately that the manual had been written by an \"overzealous\" independent low-level employee under contract to the CIA. Further, the manual had not been cleared for publication, was \"clearly against the law\", and that it violated Reagan's 1981 Executive Order banning political assassinations. On October 18, 1984, President Ronald Reagan ordered CIA Director William Casey to initiate an investigation by the agency's Inspector General. Reagan stated that \"whoever is guilty [of preparing the manual], we will deal with that situation and they will be removed.\"\n\nIn a news conference on November 7th, the day after his reelection victory, Reagan dismissed the entire controversy as \"much ado about nothing\". Shortly thereafter, a White House spokesman said Reagan had approved the Inspector General's report recommending discipline of several mid-level officials. Five mid-level CIA employees received punishments ranging from written reprimands to suspension without pay for \"poor judgment and lapses in oversight\" because of the manual. In 1987, it was found that Casey blocked any punishment of the two senior CIA officials involved with producing and distributing the manual, including one, Duane Clarridge, who after initially denying that he had anything to do with the manual, admitted he was \"fully responsible\" for the document. In closed testimony to a congressional committee, Casey reportedly declared, \"There's no reason to discipline them for one little slip-up.\" Under political pressure to remove Clarridge from his role, he was promoted to chief of the CIA's European operations.\n\nThe manual recommended \"selective use of violence for propagandistic effects\" and to \"neutralize\" (i.e., kill) government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to:\n\n[lead] demonstrators into clashes with the authorities, to provoke riots or shootings, which lead to the killing of one or more persons, who will be seen as the martyrs; this situation should be taken advantage of immediately against the Government to create even bigger conflicts.\n\nThe manual also recommended:\n\nselective use of armed force for PSYOP [psychological operations] effect... Carefully selected, planned targets — judges, police officials, tax collectors, etc. — may be removed for PSYOP effect in a UWOA [unconventional warfare operations area], but extensive precautions must ensure that the people \"concur\" in such an act by thorough explanatory canvassing among the affected populace before and after conduct of the mission.\n\nThe manual was one of the issues the International Court of Justice (IJC) analyzed in the \"Nicaragua v. United States\" 1986 ICJ 1 case. The court's jurisdiction for this case was disputed by the United States, an issue that has never been resolved.\n\nThe ICJ statements included: \"Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled \"Operaciones sicológicas en guerra de guerrillas\", and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law; but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed are to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America.\"\n\n\"The Court has to determine whether the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was such that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government. The Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to demonstrate the total dependence of the contras on United States aid. A partial dependency, the exact extent of which the Court cannot establish, may be inferred from the fact that the leaders were selected by the United States, and from other factors such as the organisation, training and equipping of the force, planning of operations, the choosing of targets and the operational support provided. There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf.\"\n\n\"Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law. For the United States to be legally responsible, it would have to be proved that that State had effective control of the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\"\n\n\n"}

It was built in several stages, the most important of which took place after the death of the saint Sidi Ali Karray at the end of the 15th century.\n\nIt was the first religious building in the medina of Sfax to combine both prayer and funerary structures (\"turba\") in its architecture, a characteristic that inspired the construction of later mausoleums with the same structure such as the Sidi Belhassen Karray Mausoleum (in the 16th century) and Sidi Amar Kammoun Mausoleum (in the 17th century).\n\nBetween 1978 and 1982, the monument underwent a radical transformation that destroyed all its historical features.\n\nThe mausoleum was built in three stages:\n\nThe original part of the mausoleum was the prayer room on the southeast side of the building. It is a rectangular room, ten meters by seven meters, with the floor divided into six aisles, three of which are parallel to the wall of the qibla and three narrower perpendicular ones. This arrangement is based on four central columns from which extend two rows of tripled arches following an east–west axis.\n\nThe second stage was an extension of the prayer hall on the eastern side and the addition of a burial chamber to the north. The latter is a rectangular room of 5.75 meters by 4.7 meters.\n\nThe dome of this room is a typical example of a specific Sfax construction technique, which involves is the using a wooden tool to press the plaster more firmly onto the underlying structure, leaving small square indentations on the surface.\n\nAccording to Faouzi Mahfoudh, towards the end of the 18th century, the building underwent restoration and a small patio was added as part of the construction of a house (probably that of Saint Abdallah Jammoussi) on the northeast side of the oratory. This patio has a covered gallery near the entrance and stairs to an upper floor, giving the whole mausoleum a domestic feel.\n"}
{"id": "3195969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3195969", "title": "Sleepytime Gorilla Museum", "text": "Sleepytime Gorilla Museum\n\nSleepytime Gorilla Museum (often abbreviated to SGM) was an American experimental rock band, formed in 1999 in Oakland, California. The band fuses classical, industrial, and art-rock themes throughout their music. They are known to perform elaborate routines on stage and discuss possibly fictitious stories of dada artists and mathematicians.\n\nAfter the disbanding of Idiot Flesh, Nils Frykdahl and Dan Rathbun joined with Carla Kihlstedt (with whom Frykdahl and Rathbun had played in the band Charming Hostess) to form Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, along with percussionists Moe! Staiano and David Shamrock. Their first performance, on June 22, 1999, was given to a single banana slug (\"Ariolimax dolichophallus\"). The following night's performance was their first to a human audience.\n\nSome time during the recording of \"Grand Opening and Closing\" (2001), drummer David Shamrock left the band and was replaced by Frank Grau. Grau also co-released the album, instigated their first tour and managed the band.\n\nDuring the recording of the follow-up, \"Of Natural History\" (2004), Grau left the band and was replaced by new drummer Matthias Bossi, formerly of Skeleton Key. The \"Of Natural History\" tour saw Moe! Staiano's exit, and new multi-instrumentalist Michael Iago Mellender's entrance. In January 2006 Sleepytime Gorilla Museum signed to The End Records who re-released their début \"Grand Opening and Closing\" with three bonus tracks.\n\nDuring early 2007, the title and track list for their third studio album, \"In Glorious Times\" was announced with the release date set for May 29, 2007. Prior to the release, an mp3 and music video of the song \"Helpless Corpses Enactment\" were made available online.\n\nIn February 2011, the band announced that they would play three final shows in California. It was also their intention to release a final album, a short film, and a live DVD.\n\nIn 2013, Matthias Bossi and Mike Patton, Scott Amendola and William Winant performed a live score for the 1924 silent film Waxworks, with the performance said to be filmed.\n\nNils Frykdahl, Dan Rathbun, Michael Iago Mellender, and David Shamrock, along with Drew Wheeler, formed a new band called Free Salamander Exhibit in 2013.\n\nIn a July 2014 press release for Rabbit Rabbit Radio, Carla Kihlstedt announced that a new track featuring almost all members of Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, including Michael Mellender who \"penned the architecture of this one,\" was to be released in August of 2014. The track, titled \"The Perfect Abomination\" was released on YouTube on July 31, 2014 and featured Kihlstedt and Bossi (of Rabbit Rabbit Radio, to whom the song is credited) with Michael Mellender and Dan Rathbun performing guitar and bass, respectively.\n\nAnnouncing a 2016 re-issue of the band's catelogue, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum wrote \"And so it shall come to pass that the SGM back catalogue will see the light of Vinyl.\" Official announcements for \"Of Natural History\", \"In Glorious Times\" and \"Grand Opening and Closing\" vinyl re-issues were made by distributor \"Blood Music\" in September and October 2015.\n\nAccording to their extensive liner notes for \"Grand Opening and Closing\", their official history and repeated in interviews, the name \"Sleepytime Gorilla Museum\" comes from a small group of Dadaists, Futurists, and artists named the Sleepytime Gorilla Press who owned and operated what they called a \"museum of the future\" which was \"anti-artifact, non-historical and closed.\"\n\nThe \"museum\" opened on June 22, 1916 (the same date as the bands' first concert, 83 years later). The exhibit was a fire which caused wide chaos and confusion. The following day the museum was closed (hence the name of the first album). The name itself apparently comes from a poem called \"Of the Future Hides the Past,\" written by Museum members Lala Rolo and Ikk Ygg.\n\nThe only source of information on the internet regarding the Sleepytime Gorilla Press, Lala Rolo, and Ikk Ygg arises from the band's interviews.\n\nTheir live performances have featured puppet shows, pseudo-scientific scholarly presentations, and performances by members of the Butoh group inkBoat.\n\nThe band uses many homemade devices as instruments, such as the Viking Rowboat. Dan Rathbun — who has created most of the band's idiosyncratic instruments — plays, among other custom-made instruments (though he uses a common bass guitar most of the time), a custom-stringed bass instrument referred to as the Sledgehammer Dulcimer (or, alternately, the Slide Piano Log), which uses piano strings and is possibly more than 7 feet long; it is played with two sticks: one in the left hand generally used as a fret, and another in the right hand to strike the strings.\n\nPercussionist Michael Iago Mellender's instruments consist of restaurant kitchen equipment, trash can lids, and other \"found\" metal objects, in addition to traditional percussion instruments. One of the more infamous instruments used by the band was Moe! Staiano's Popping Turtle (now residing in Brooklyn, NY). It can be heard about 1:21 into the song \"Sleep is Wrong\".\n\nSGM's music can be likened to experimental rock or avant-garde metal; however, as inherent to the music, the band attempts to escape any categorization. Some influences include Henry Cow, Swans, Einstürzende Neubauten, King Crimson, Mayhem, Bauhaus, The Art Bears, Igor Stravinsky, Thinking Plague, and Univers Zéro. In a review for SGM's second album \"Of Natural History\", David Moore of Pitchfork Media states that SGM's debut album \"Grand Opening and Closing\" was an amalgam of Meshuggah and Secret Chiefs 3, resulting in \"some truly cracked prog-metal anthems.\"\n\nTony Levin, known for his work with progressive rock pioneers King Crimson and also with Peter Gabriel, stated that he is a \"huge fan of\" Sleepytime Gorilla Museum and chose the track \"Sleep is Wrong\", which he calls \"very, very powerful\" as one of the pieces which most influenced his current project, Stick Men. Levin also credited Sleepytime Gorilla Museum as doing \"things that we never dreamed of doing in Crimson or in any band that I've been in,\" specifically their \"radical\" and \"organic\" shifts in tempo.\n\nSome of the instruments are custom instruments built by the band. \nMatthias Bossi\n\nNils Frykdahl\n\nCarla Kihlstedt\n\nMichael Iago Mellender\n\nDan Rathbun\n\n\n\n\n"}

It advocates the establishment of a Syrian nation state spanning the Fertile Crescent, including present day Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Cyprus, Sinai, southeastern Turkey (Alexandrette and Cilicia), based on geographical boundaries and the common history people within the boundaries share.\n\nWith over 100,000 members as of 2016, it is the second largest legal political group in Syria after the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, In Lebanon, it has been a major secular and highly organised elite party in the political history of the country for over 80 years. Until recent times it was a key group in the March 8 Alliance.\n\nFounded in Beirut in 1932 as an anticolonial and national liberation organization hostile to French colonialism, the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted coups d'etat in 1949 and 1961 following which it was thoroughly repressed. It was active in resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000 while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon out of both belief in Syrian irredentism but also due to the decades-long repression it endured at the hands of the Baath Party in Syria. In Syria, the SSNP had become a major Right-wing political force in the early 1950s, but was thoroughly repressed in 1955-56. It remained organized, and by the late 1960s had joined the Left and allied itself with the PLO and the Lebanese Communist Party, despite the ideological rivalry that persists among them. In 2005, it was legalized in Syria and joined the Ba'ath Party-led National Progressive Front. From 2012 to 6 May 2014, the party was part of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation.\n\nDuring the course of the Syrian Civil War the party has seen its relevance increasing in Syria, where almost 12000 fighters of the Party's armed branch, the Eagles of the Whirlwind, fight alongside the Syrian Armed Forces against the Syrian opposition and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nIn the mid Nineteenth Century Butrus al-Bustani was one of the first to assert the existence of a Natural Syrian nation that should be accommodated in a reformed Ottoman Empire. He belonged to the Nahda, thinkers influenced by the Arabic Literary Renaissance and the French Revolution and who wished to shape the Tanzimat reforms, which were an attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy with religious freedom to reverse the Ottoman state's creeping economic marginalisation and which would lead to the Young Turks and the Second Constitutional Era.\n\nAn influential follower of al-Bustani was the Belgian Jesuit historian, Henri Lammens, ordained as a priest in Beirut in 1893, who claimed that Greater Syria had since ancient times encompassed all the land between the Arab peninsula, Egypt, the Levantine corridor and the Taurus Mountains, including all the peoples within the Fertile Crescent.\nThis was also accompanied with the rise of a profoundly idealistic patriotism, largely resembling European romantic nationalism, idealizing the coming of a National Revival to the Levant, that would shake off the Ottoman past and propel back what many started to see again as the cradle of civilization into the modern world's front stage. In that aspect, the works of Khalil Gibran who began expressing his belief in Syrian nationalism and patriotism are central. As Gibran said, \"I believe in you, and I believe in your destiny. I believe that you are contributors to this new civilization. [...] I believe that it is in you to be good citizens. And what is it to be a good citizen? [...] It is to stand before the towers of New York and Washington, Chicago and San Francisco saying in your hearts, \"I am the descendent of a people the builded Damascus and Byblos, and Tyre and Sidon and Antioch, and I am here to build with you, and with a will.\"\n\nThe late 1920s and the early 1930s were also a period of cultural and political effervescence that greatly contributed to the emergence of Syrian nationalism as a distinct ideology. In 1920, the French army toppled the first Arab Kingdom of Syria and the Hashemite King Faisal, who had been proclaimed \"King of all-Syria\" by the Syrian National Congress at the Battle of Maysalun. The British and the French dissected the region into spheres of influence in what later became known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, setting up colonial administrations throughout the Levant. \n\nThe Great Syrian Revolt was brutally repressed in 1925 while a small clique of traditional landowners and notables coalesced around the newly founded administration of the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Greater Lebanon was established on the ruins of the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon with arbitrarily drawn borders and with a state structure largely dominated by the Christian Maronites, a community whose elite were historically well-disposed to the French, and who would ensure the French colonial empire a strong foothold in the Arab World. Jewish immigration to Palestine was increasing at an alarming speed, bringing to the shores of Palestine Zionist migrants who had little affinity to (Revisionist Zionism) or similarities with (Marxist and Labor Zionism) the local populace, be it the Palestinian Arabs or the traditional local Jewish communities. Class tensions sharpened as some Palestinian landowners sold their lands to the Jewish National Fund, with little regard to the national aspirations and plight of the peasantry. As the Balfour Declaration became public, fears in the Levant of the parceling out of the region along Colonial borders implied in the minds of many the need for concerted action throughout the Levant that would transcend traditional sectarian divides. Similarly, Communism, perceived by many as an alien ideology that did not resonate much with the socioeconomic conditions of the early 20th century Levant, was looked upon with suspicion, particularly since many Zionist migrants settling in Palestine were coming from the Soviet Union.\n\nMany Syrian and Lebanese youth saw these events as omens of an ill future in which the Levant, which had until then been a single economic and social entity within the Ottoman Empire referred to as Bilad al-Sham, would be dismembered along religious, ethnic, and class lines. As the traditional elite stirred away from the people and slowly sought the good offices of the French High Commissioner, and given the repression with which the French Mandate was applied, Secret societies flourished in the late 1920s. Similarly, many begin to see the devastating effect that sectarianism was bringing upon the people of the region, be it pro-Christian Separatism in Lebanon or the radicalism of Islamist elements in Syria, which pitted each faction against the other and benefited no other than the colonial administration, and began to condemn the mixing of religion with politics. The path was hence laid down for the emergence of a political ideology that would simultaneously fight against the dismemberment of the region, Zionism, and Colonialism, through Anti-colonialism, Liberation War, and National Revival, while keeping communism in check. It also represented a clear departure from the Arab nationalist current that advocated the unification of the entirety of the Arab World, and which had implicit Islamic nationalist undertones. This ideology was to be that of a Romanticized Secular Greater Syria based upon the natural geographical boundaries that defined the region loosely dubbed as the Fertile Crescent, an ideology that Antun Saadeh would come to assert with the foundation of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, where it found its full expression.\n\nThe SSNP was founded by Antun Saadeh, a Lebanese journalist and lecturer from a Greek Orthodox family who had lived in South America from 1919 to 1930 who in November 1932 secretly established the first nucleus of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which operated underground for the first three years of its existence, and in 1933 started publishing the monthly journal \"Al-Majalla\" which was distributed in the American University of Beirut and developed the party's ideology. In 1936 the party's open hostility to colonialism led to the French authorities banning the party and the imprisoning Saadeh for six months for creating a clandestine party, although an accusation of having been in contact with the German and Italian fascist movements was dropped after the Germans denied any relationship. During his time in prison Saadeh wrote \"The Genesis of Nations\" to lay out the SSNP's ideology. At that time, the Party joined ranks with other nationalist and patriotic forces including the National Bloc, whereas it began militating, in secret, for the overthrow of the Mandate. Nonetheless, the alliance between the SSNP and the National Bloc did not last long: The National Bloc refrained from engaging in actual militant activities against the French, deciding instead to cooperate with the High Commissioner. Many SSNP members also felt that the NB refused to cooperate with them due to the fact that their founder was Christian.\n\nSaadeh emigrated again to Brazil in 1938 and afterwards to Argentina, only to return to Lebanon in 1947 following the country's independence from the French in 1943. On his way to Argentina, he visited Italy and Berlin, which increased the suspicions of the French that the SSNP might have been entertaining relations with the Axis. Coming back shortly to Lebanon in 1939, he was questioned by the French authorities who accused him of plotting with the Germans. The charge was dropped when no evidence of collaboration had been found and after that Saadeh declared that even the French rule to which he was vehemently opposed would be better than German or Italian rule. Having afterwards left for Argentina, Saadeh found out that the Argentinian branch of the SSNP newspaper had been voicing its outright support for Nazi Germany and to the Axis powers, which led Saadeh to issue a lengthy letter to the editor-in-chef, restating that the SSNP is not a National Socialist party and that no stance should be taken vis-à-vis the Allies or the Axis. By that time, the SSNP had grown exponentially and had clashed on many occasions with its primary ideological rival, the Kataeb Party, a Spanish Fascist-Inspired party that had been founded by Pierre Gemayel, a pharmacist and athlete after his return from the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Being vehemently anti-communist in its early days, a position that would later change, it had also clashed with the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, the latter accusing the SSNP of Nazi sympathies.\nWhile the Kataeb was committed to the notion of Lebanon as a nation state defined as an entity presiding over the borders outlined first by the Sykes–Picot agreement in 1916, and afterwards by the French administrative division of its mandate into six states including the state of Greater Lebanon, and had espoused a strong bond between the nation and the church as well as outright social ultraconservatism, the SSNP rejected these national claim on the basis that the borders outlining the newly created states were fictitious, resulting from colonialism, and do not reflect any historical and social realities. The party claimed that Greater Syria as defined by Saadeh represents the national ideal encompassing the historical people of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, bound together by a clearly defined geography and a common historical, social and cultural development path away from all sectarianism.\n\nThe Party took a radical stance against the traditional notable class in Syria and Lebanon, including the large landowners and feudal lords, and called for the emancipation of the working class and the peasantry away from religion and sectarianism, into a socialist-inspired production-based economy. The SSNP also called for the reclamation of Alexandretta which had been arbitrarily given to Turkey by France. With the start of the Arab–Israeli conflict in 1948, Saadeh radicalized the party's Anti-Zionist stance by declaring that \"Our struggle with the enemy is not a struggle for borders but for existence\", and called on Party members to fight in the Arab Liberation Army, although many regular Lebanese and Syrian army officers were already Party members.\n\nWhen the Lebanese Communist Party, which had fought against Saadeh's return in 1947 and which had been fighting for the title of head of the country's Anti-Zionist movement, declared its acceptance of the Partition Plan, infuriated and increasingly zealous SSNP members burned down a Communist headquarters. As communists defected away after the Communist Party's sudden pivot upon orders from the Soviet Union, the SSNP's ranks swelled.\n\nWhen the Arabs lost the war in 1948, Saadeh propelled the Party into a fully confrontational stance: He deemed Arabism as a purely rhetorical gimmick, condemned the incompetence and hypocrisy of the Arab leaders, and asserted that the creation of the State of Israel and the expulsion of the Palestinians was the direct result of this incompetence.\n\nOn July 4, 1949, a year after the declaration of the establishment of the state of Israel and the 1948 Palestinian exodus (the Nakba), and a response to a series of aggressions perpetrated by the Kataeb-backed Lebanese government, the SSNP attempted its first revolution. Following a violent crackdown by government forces, Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za'im in an attempt to obtain his support. A decision was taken by King Farouk, Riad el Solh and Husni al-Za'im to eliminate Antoun Saadeh, under the patronage of British Intelligence and the Mossad. As a result, Al-Za'im handed Saadeh over to Lebanese authorities, who had him executed on July 8, 1949. It was the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.\n\nAfter Saadeh was executed and its high-ranking leaders were arrested, the party remained underground until 1958 when it sided with the pro-Western president Camille Chamoun against the Arab nationalist rebels. This occurred right after the Party was accused of having plotted the assassination of Adnan al-Malki, a Left-leaning Baath Party army officer in Syria, and after Party members had fled to Beirut. The Party at that time still viewed the Soviet Union with contempt, and opposed the Arab Nationalist current of Nasser, while retaining its commitment to Syrian Nationalism. Indeed, the idea of having Greater Syria subsumed under the creed of Arab Nationalism founded on the Arabic language, Arab and Islamic culture was abhorred by the SSNP, which retained its profound belief in Syrian social and anthropological historicism, namely the process of national and social association that characterizes the Fertile Crescent and that differentiates it from the Arabian Peninsula or North Africa.\n\nIn 1961 two SSNP members, company commanders in the Lebanese army, tried to carry off a lightning coup against Fouad Chehab and failed. Among the main reasons cited by the perpetrators was the increasingly dictatorial aspects of the rule of General Chehab, his expansion of the state surveillance and intelligence apparatus, but also his Nasserist orientation.\n\nThis resulted in a renewed proscription and the imprisonment of many of its leaders. Most of the party's known activists remained in prison or exile until a general amnesty in 1969.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the SSNP formed a military squad that allied with the leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM), against the Phalangists and their allies of the Lebanese Front. The SSNP saw the Lebanese Civil War as the inevitable result of the divisions of the Syrian nation into small states and away from a liberation war against Israel. After the defeat of leftist forces in the 1982 Lebanon War, the SSNP joined a number of the leftist organizations who regrouped to resist the Israeli occupation, including the killing of two Israeli soldiers in a Wimpy Cafe in west Beirut by party member Khalid Alwan. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation blames the SSNP for the assassination, in 1982, of Bachir Gemayel, Lebanon's newly elected president supported by the Israelis besieging Beirut. In 1983 the party joined the Lebanese National Salvation Front. In 1985, a member of the party, Sana'a Mehaidli, detonated a car bomb next to an Israeli military convoy at Jezzin, South Lebanon. She killed two Israeli soldiers and become one of the first known female suicide bombers.\n\nThe SSNP participated in a number of general elections in Lebanon, winning six seats in 1992, although seeing a decline in subsequent elections winning two seats in both 2005 and 2009. The SSNP were involved in the 2008 conflict in Lebanon, with gunmen attacking an SSNP office.\n\nIn Syria the SSNP grew to a position of considerable influence in the years following the country's independence in 1946, and was a major political force immediately after the restoration of democracy in 1954. It was a fierce rival of the Syrian Communist Party and of the radical pan-Arab Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, the other main ideological parties of the period. In April 1955 Colonel Adnan al-Malki, a Ba'athist officer who was a very popular figure in the Syrian army, was assassinated by a party member. This provided the Communists and Ba'athists with the opportunity to eliminate their main ideological rival, and under pressure from them and their allies in the security forces the SSNP was practically wiped out as a political force in Syria.\n\nThe SSNP's stance during the Lebanese civil war and in Lebanese politics—where it has become a close ally of Hezbollah—was consistent with that of Syria, and that facilitated a rapprochement between the party and the Syrian government. During Hafez al-Assad's presidency, the party was increasingly tolerated. After the succession of his son Bashar in 2000, this process continued. In 2001, although still officially banned, the party was permitted to attend meetings of the Ba'ath-led National Progressive Front coalition of legal parties as an observer. In Spring 2005 the party was legalised in Syria, in what has been described as \"an attempt to allow a limited form of political activity\".\n\nOver time, the SSNP and the Syrian Baathist regime experienced a dramatic turnabout in their historical relationship, from enemies to allies. The process started as the party reckoned that Hafez al-Assad regional goals such as consolidating Syria's control over Lebanon and the PLO were consistent with the SSNP's goal of establishing Greater Syria, while the SSNP reciprocated acting as a Syrian proxy in Lebanon. The alliance has strengthened on the face of the Syrian Civil War.\n\nIn the 22 April 2007 election for the People's Council of Syria, the party gained 3 out of 250 in the parliament.\n\nNotable SSNP politicians in Syria include Issam Al Mahayri, Joseph Sweid, Bushra Massouh, and Issam Bagdi\n\nDuring the Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War the SSNP participated in counter demonstrations in support of the government. Once the war broke out, the Syrian government reciprocated providing weaponry and training. In the meantime, SSNP officials had become a target for rebel militants and were kidnapped and assassinated. Bashar al-Yazigi, head of the political SSNP bureau in Syria stated that the \"opposition is seeking to create sharp sectarian rifts and fragment Syrian society\" with the party regarding both the ongoing Syrian Civil War and the Iraq War as attempts to partition those countries—and, eventually Lebanon—along ethno-sectarian lines.\n\nEstimates of the number of SSNP fighters in Syria range from 6,000 to 8,000. Lebanese fighters are included in their ranks, even though the party claims that \"their proportion within the group's total fighting force has decreased steadily, as more Syrians sign up\".\nBy February 2014, SSNP fighters were primarily deployed in the governorates of Homs and Damascus and were said to be the most formidable military force other than the Syrian Army in Suweida. SSNP fighters have participated in the battles of Sadad, Ma'loula or al-Qaryatayn, among others. Party officials say its membership has increased \"by the thousands\" since the start of the war as a result of its alleged \"reputation as an effective fighting force in Syria\".\n\nThe party is taking on a larger role in Syria's official political system: it fielded 30 candidates for the 2016 parliamentary election, winning 7 seats.\n\nIn 1966 King Hussein had his security services sent into action to eradicate the SSNP from Jordan. The party had been active among the Palestinian population.\n\nIn 2013 followers of the party established the \"Movement of Syrian Social Nationalists in Jordan\".\n\nWhile in jail from early February to early May 1936, Saadeh completed \"The Genesis of Nations\" which he had started writing three months before the French authorities in Lebanon discovered the secret organization and arrested its leader and his assistants. In his book, Saadeh formulated his belief in the existence of a Syrian nation in a homeland defined as embracing all historic Syria extended to the Suez Canal in the south, and that includes modern Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The boundaries of the historic environment in which the Syrian nation evolved went much beyond the scope usually ascribed to Syria, extending from the Taurus range in the north-east and the Zagros mountains in the north-west to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian desert and the Persian Gulf in the east. According to Saadeh, this region is also called the Syrian Fertile Crescent, the island Cyprus being its star.\n\nGreater Syria corresponds to the Mesopotamian basin of Bilad al-Sham before it was arbitrarily dissected by the colonial powers. According to Saadeh, geographical factors play an important role in setting the parameters for the process of association and thus for the establishment of a nation. He held that the process of human evolution from hunter-gatherer to settled agriculture was among the most important factors that led to the creation of private property and the class system. Saadeh highlighted the role that the class system played in the flourishing of trade and commerce and the creation of wealth, ascribing it to be a characteristic of the Semitic peoples, namely the coastal Phoenicians. He also stressed the link between the economic modes of production and the establishment of cultural norms and values, a view he shared with Karl Marx.\n\nHowever, Saadeh believed that while the economic modes of production can create culture, culture acquires a life of its own with time and eventually becomes embedded and perpetuated in its people, who come to recognize themselves as a living organism. Hence comes the importance of the state in serving the interest of the nation, and of national democracy as the legitimate source of political legislation. The party espouses the idea that the fundamental basis of nation is the territory or geographical region, not the ethnical bond. The natural environment and geographical specifications of a certain land is what eventually allows, or disallows, its transition from a socio-economic phase to another.\n\nThese natural geographical factors hence create the societal framework in which man establishes his existence, beliefs, habits, and value systems. Saadeh's critique of ethnic nationalisms led him to hence develop a framework of geographical nationalism, the idea of the \"natural homeland\". When he applied this model to the case of the Fertile Crescent, the conclusion he reached was straightforward: the natural geographical factors of the basin lying east of the Mediterranean is what has allowed it to become the cradle of civilizations, what has driven throughout the course of human history movements seeking to unify it, what has allowed it to establish, through ethnic, religious and cultural assimilation and mixing, a high culture and civilization, and what has made it the prize coveted by all imperialist powers. Saadeh advocated for all ethnoreligious groups to consider themselves as descendants of the pre-Christian era empires of Babylon and Assyria, of the Hittites and the kings of Aram, then of the Islamic empires, all the way up until the present. The SSNP claimed that the Greater Syria is the natural home of the Syrian people with clearly defined geographic boundaries, yet that its people are suffering from an identity crisis due to Ottoman occupation, colonialism, and sectarianism. Saadeh claimed that the \"renaissance\" of the Syrian nation is inevitably linked to the purge of these \"decadent\" forces through the reinforcing of national solidarity, resistance against colonialism, and adoption of secularism.\n\nIn Saadeh's vision of \"harmony\" among the country's ethnic and religious communities through a return to a so-called Syrian \"racial unity\" which was itself in fact a mixture of races, neither Islam nor pan-Arabism was important, and therefore religion wasn't either. Saadeh's concept of the nation was shaped mainly by historical concrete interactions amongst people over the centuries in a given geography, rather than being based on ethnic origins, race, language or religion. This led him also to conclude that the Arabs could not form one nation, but many nations could be called Arab.\n\nThe SSNP's Greater Syria ideal posed a problem for all of the existing nationalist movements because of its clear departure from Arab nationalist and Islamic undertones, and its inextricable link with what the party leader defined as \"the Syrian people\", Greater Syria being its natural homeland. The notion of a Syrian people is the cornerstone of the SSNP, and is defined according to the Party as the people inhabiting the Fertile Crescent, whose culture and socio-economic conditions have been a direct consequence of its own interaction with the natural environment.\n\nThe Syrian people, according to the Party's founder, is a cultural and socio-economic body of people hailing from a very heterogeneous background, but whose social mixing and assimilation over time within the Levantine basin has allowed for the emergence of a high settled civilization and for the extension of this people over the entirety of Natural Syria. In a clear departure from ethnic, racial and religious understandings of a nation, the Syrian people is a \"mixture of races generated by migrations and intermarriages\", its social life and cohesion having been shaped and determined by the environment and geography in which it developed. Hence the SSNP rejects racial notions of nationalism, Saadeh himself having ridiculed European racial doctrines in the opening chapters of the Genesis of Nations.\n\nThe attitude of the party and its founder towards minority separatism and movements calling for ethnically-separate homelands was one of outright hostility. Saadeh was also hostile to all religiously-motivated political movements, or movements that did not call for the separation between Church (or Mosque) and State. Thus he called Wahhabism and Islamism a \"return to the desert\", a \"dry ideology of Arabian tribes\" that had no commonalities with the high civilization of the Fertile Crescent. The incoming Jewish migrants to Southern Syria (Palestine) and the Jewish communities were criticized for their \"foreign and racial loyalties\", their unwillingness to assimilate, and their active willingness to create an ethnically Jewish state in Palestine, with Saadeh deeming the Jews as the community unable and unwilling to assimilate, and having criticized the notion that Jewishness can be a cornerstone for a nation-state. For the SSNP, the Jews do not constitute a nation as they are a heterogeneous mixture of peoples in a similar sense that Muslims and Christians do not constitute a nation. Similarly, the Kurds were attacked for their communitarianism and their disposition to establish a Kurdish state in the north. In what relates to the Arab–Israeli conflict, the party has since its establishment adopted a hard-lined anti-Zionist stance, while retaining its belief that a secular and democratic state in Palestine is the only proper solution to the conflict.\nThe societal cohesion of the Syrian people and its ability to properly assimilate newcomers, minorities, and migrations, is essential to its survival to its progress, and any movement that seeks to assert ethnic, religious, or racial separatism within the Syrian homeland is one that ought to be met with outright hostility. The answer to these threats, according to the Party, lay in the rebirth of the Syrian people, the Renaissance.\n\nThe Syrian people, as outlined above, is, according to Saadeh, among the first people to have historically moved from the tribal phase into the settled agricultural phase and towards the establishment of private property and social classes. This first transition allowed the Syrian people to prosper exponentially and to excel in most of the crafts of the ancient world. Saadeh and the party espoused the belief that a new transition has to take place, a transition to the modern age, which ought to have two prerequisites: the secular unity of the Syrian people and its renaissance. The unity of the Syrian people firstly implies debarring the clergy from interfering in state affairs, and enacting a full separation between Church-Mosque and State. This would inevitably allow the Syrian people to regain its unity and social cohesion.\n\nThe second task of the party is to work towards the Renaissance, which the party leader described as being a dynamic undertaking that would shatter what he described as the old regime. The Renaissance ideal, which Saadeh traces back to the ingenuity of the first Syrians – the Assyrians and the Phoenicians, among others, lies in the mastery of the Syrian people over the sciences and the crafts, which he eulogizes in The Genesis of Nations while attacking what he deemed as the antiquated notions of religious fatalism. In order to regain its mastery over the crafts and over its own destiny, Saadeh underlines the need for intellectualism, education, and the pursuit of knowledge as cornerstones of the future Syrian society, a notion he summarizes in his famous quote, \"Society is knowledge, and knowledge is power\".\n\nWhile the Renaissance is underlined as a romanticized notion of spiritual, intellectual, and patriotic elevation, the SSNP elaborated a simple yet straightforward doctrine pertaining to how the Syrian People ought to organize itself once the Renaissance has begun, albeit the fact that Saadeh had not developed the idea completely. The social-nationalist model elaborated by Saadeh is reflected in the \"Communiqué of the First Social Nationalist Revolution of 1949\".\n\nThe first of these principles is the abolition of feudalism and of the rule of the traditional notables and landowners, which the Party deems responsible for the \"desolate state of things to which the country had gotten to\", including maintaining educational levels at an all-time low and being instrumental in the loss of Palestine. The second principle is \"opposing capitalist tyranny\". Despite its belief in the necessity of private property, the SSNP declared defending workers' rights and establishing a framework that guarantees these rights as an inalienable right. This is coupled with the need to establish mandatory education, universal healthcare, the nationalization of vital areas of the economy such as the production of raw materials, and a strong centralized state that is able to give economic directions. The third principle stated is combating communism. This is particularly true in the early days of the Party, from 1932 until 1961, and before the Party began to slowly shift further towards the Left – which epitomized in its joining the Left-wing parties during the Lebanese Civil War, and becoming a founding member of the Lebanese National Resistance Front, and a close ally of the Lebanese Communist Party and the PLO. This remains a topic of debate, however, as the strongly pronounced nationalistic features of SSNP ideology would permit scholars to interpret \"social nationalism\" as a distinctive breed of National Syndicalism.\n\nPerhaps one of the most striking feature of the Party throughout its history, and which has led it to be respected by some, dreaded by others, is the zealous and the almost mystical devotion of its members to the notion of Liberation War. Most Party members have historically conducted military, guerilla, and assassination operations with little concern for their personal safety or survival. Saadeh himself had a very revolutionary view of life and death, whereas the Renaissance and the \"New Generation\" would not see the light of day without sacrifice: \"we love life because we love freedom, and we love death when death is a path to life\" is among the few quotes of Saadeh which the SSNP reveres.\n\nSince its foundation in 1932, the SSNP adopted direct action and violence against those it deemed as the enemies of the Syrian People, to which it referred to as the \"forces of darkness\", while the founder referred to the Party as the \"Sons of Life\" (Abna` al-Hayat): Colonialism and particularly French colonialism in Syria and Lebanon, the feudal landowning and notable class, politicians it deemed to be traitors or corrupt, Zionist settlement of Palestine, Christian separatism in Lebanon, Islamic fundamentalism in Syria, a list to which could be added the communists, although this last addition would change in the course of the years as both would join ranks in the LNRF. \n\nIn 1949, it declared the \"First Renaissance Revolution\" against the Lebanese government, an armed confrontation with the Lebanese and Syrian security forces that ended in a disaster and the execution of Antun Saadeh by the Lebanese authorities on the 8th of July. Not too long later, Party members assassinated the Lebanese Prime Minister Riad al-Solh who was instrumental in Saadeh's death penalty. To avoid being caught, the assailants committed suicide. When one of the assailants survived and woke up in the hospital, he completed his suicide attempt by tearing up his wounds and falling from the bed. The assassination of the general prosecutor who judged Saadeh was also conducted by a Party cell, and Party members are believed to have been involved in the assassination of Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian dictator who captured Saadeh and handed him over to the Lebanese authorities.\n\nIn 1982, Party member Habib al-Shartouni assassinated the Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Forces, who had asked for the Israelis to invade Lebanon all the way up to Beirut, and with the consent of whom the Siege of Beirut was effectuated. The Party also undertook many operations against Israeli presence in Lebanon, including a military operation in broad daylight against Israeli officers stationed in Beirut, which triggered the beginning of the generalized armed struggle for Lebanese liberation. Sana'a Mehaidli, whose family had been displaced and was forced to live homeless after the Israeli occupation, detonated herself in her car along with an Israeli convoy in South Lebanon. The Party joined arms with the communists, the PLO, the Arab nationalists, and other left-leaning groups to fight against the Israeli invasion, leading to the break of the siege and to the withdrawal of the Israelis from Beirut. Today, the Party's military wings fights alongside the Syrian Arab Army against the FSA and ISIS.\n\nThe SSNP was organised with a hierarchical structure and a powerful leader. Its ideology was an entirely secular form of nationalism; indeed, it posited the complete separation of religion and politics as one of the two fundamental conditions for real national unity. The other condition was determined economic and social reform.\n\nThe party's emblem is the whirlwind (in Arabic Zawba'a زوبعة). It was designed by the SSNP students at the American University of Beirut while the party was still clandestine and before the French authorities had uncovered it in 1936. Saadeh stated the whirlwind was found engraved on ancient Syrian artifacts, and it is known from for example Sumerian art. The SSNP emblem has been said to be a combination of the Islamic crescent and the Christian cross. The party flag features a red hurricane, called the \"Zawba'a\", within a white disc on a black background. Each arm symbolizes one of the four virtues of the party's mission: freedom, duty, discipline and power. According to SSNP lore, the black color symbolizes the Dark Ages of Ottoman rule, colonialism, sectarian division, national division, and backwardness. The \"Zawba'a\" allegedly represents the blood of the SSNP martyrs bound together as Muslims and Christians through freedom, duty, discipline and power as a hurricane to purge the Dark Ages and spark their nation's rejuvenation and renaissance. Critics claim that the symbol was modeled after the Nazi swastika a claim that the party denies.\n\nDespite Saadeh's claims, some authors state that when the party began overt activity, it was the object of many critiques due to having many ideological and organizational resemblances to European fascism, and due to the resemblance of its external symbols to those of German Nazism. Such resemblances went against the idea that it was an authentic national ideology and couldn't be acknowledged by the party. The party's founder Saadeh was aware of these accusations and he addressed them during his speech of 1 June 1935 (long before the events of World War II, and before the party was given publicity and the accusations started appearing in the press):\n\nSome scholars were however bent on ascribing the blame of collusion of Saadeh with fascism, hence, Reeva Simon writes: \"the party's 'leader for life', was an admirer of Adolf Hitler influenced by Nazi and fascist ideology\". The party adopted a reversed swastika as the party's symbol, sang the party's anthem to \"Deutschland über alles\", and included developing the cult of a leader, advocating totalitarian government, and glorifying an ancient pre-Christian past and the organic whole of the Syrian \"Volk\" or nation.\n\nArab nationalist thinker Sati' al-Husri considered that Saadeh \"misrepresented\" Arab nationalism, incorrectly associating it with a Bedouin image of the Arab and with Muslim sectarianism. Palestinian historian Maher Charif sees Saadeh's theory as a response to the religious diversity of Syria, and points to his later\nextension of his vision of the Syrian nation to include Iraq, a country also noted for its religious diversity, as further evidence for this. The party also accepted that due to \"religious and political considerations\", the separate existence of Lebanon was necessary for the time being.\n\nFrom 1945 on, the party adopted a more nuanced stance regarding Arab nationalism, seeing Syrian unity as a potential first step towards an Arab union led by Syria.\n\nLebanese historian Kamal Salibi gives a somewhat contrasting interpretation, pointing to the position of the Greek Orthodox community as a large minority in both Syria and Lebanon for whom \"the concept of pan-Syrianism was more meaningful than the concept of Arabism\" while at the same time they resented Maronite dominance in Lebanon. According to Salibi,\n\nProf. Salibi remarks on the beginnings of Saadeh's party in the 1930s: \"[A]mong its first members were students and young graduates of the American University of Beirut.\" This early party was \"mainly Greek Orthodox and Protestants with some Shi'ites and Druzes...\" In Lebanon as a whole the party was not popular. \"Christians were generally opposed to their Syrian unionism, while Moslems were suspicious of their reservations with regard to pan-Arabism. The Lebanese authorities were able to suppress them without difficulty.\"\n\nAccording to historian Stanley G. Payne, the Arab nationalism was influenced by European fascism, with the creation of at least seven Arab nationalist shirt movements similar to the brown shirt movement by 1939, with the most influenced ones being the SSNP, the Iraqi Futawa youth movement and the Young Egypt movement. These three movements would share characteristics like being territorially expansionist, with the SSNP wanting the complete control of Syria, belief in the superiority of their own people (with Saadeh theorizing a \"distinct and naturally superior\" Syrian race), being \"nonrationalist, anti-intellectual, and highly emotional\" and \"[emphasizing] military virtues and power [and stressing] self-sacrifice\". Also according to Payne, all these movements received strong influence from European fascism and praised the Italian and German fascism but \"[they never became] fully developed fascist movements, and none reproduced the full characteristics of European fascism\"; the influence in Arab nationalism remained long after 1945. Also, Saadeh's superior race was not a pure one, but a fusion of all races in Syrian history. The SSNP would be \"[a] elite group, with little structure for mobilization\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "558698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=558698", "title": "Taslima Nasrin", "text": "Taslima Nasrin\n\nTaslima Nasrin (also Taslima Nasreen, born 25 August 1962) is a Bangladeshi-Swedish author and former physician who has been living in exile since 1994. From a literary profile as a poet in the late 1970s, she gained global attention by the beginning of 1990s owing to her essays and novels with feminist views and criticism of what she characterizes as all \"misogynistic\" religions including Islam.\n\nAfter living more than a decade in Europe and the USA, Taslima moved to India in 2005, but was banished from the country in 2008, although she has been staying in Delhi, India on a resident permit long-term, multiple-entry or 'X' visa since 2004.\n\nShe advocates freedom of thought and human rights by publishing, lecturing, and campaigning. She has been unable to return either to her home in Bangladesh or to her adopted home of West Bengal, India.\n\nNasrin was born to Dr. Rajab Ali and Edul Ara in the town of Mymensingh. Her father was a renowned physician, and a professor of Medical Jurisprudence in Mymensingh Medical College, also at Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College. Taslima studied medicine and became a physician.\n\nAfter high school in 1976 (SSC) and higher secondary studies in college (HSC) in 1978, she studied medicine at the Mymensingh Medical College, an affiliated medical college of the University of Dhaka and graduated in 1984 with an MBBS degree; In college, she demonstrated her propensity for poetry by writing and editing a poetry journal called \"Shenjuti\". After graduation, she worked at a family planning clinic in Mymensingh for a while, then practised at the gynecology department of Mitford hospital and at the anesthesia department of Dhaka Medical College hospital. While she studied and practised medicine, she saw girls who had been raped; she also heard women cry out in despair in the delivery room if their baby was a girl. She was born into a Muslim family; however, she became an atheist over time. In course of writing she took a feminist approach\n\nEarly in her literary career, she wrote mainly poetry, and published half a dozen collections of poetry between 1982 and 1993, often with female oppression as a theme, and often containing very graphic language. She started publishing prose in the early 1990s, and produced three collections of essays and four novels before the publication of her 1993 novel \"Lajja\" ( \"Lôjja\"), or \"Shame\", in which a Hindu family is being attacked by Muslims. This publication changed her life and career dramatically.\n\nNasrin suffered a number of physical and other attacks following the publication of \"Lajja\". She had written against Islamic philosophy, angering many Muslims of Bangladesh, who called for a ban on her novel. In October 1993, a radical fundamentalist group called the Council of Islamic Soldiers offered a bounty for her death. In May 1994 she was interviewed by the Kolkata edition of \"The Statesman\", which quoted her as calling for a revision of the Quran; she claims she only called for abolition of the Sharia, the Islamic religious law. In August 1994 she was brought up on \"charges of making inflammatory statements,\" and faced criticism from Islamic fundamentalists. A few hundred thousand demonstrators called her \"an apostate appointed by imperial forces to vilify Islam\"; a member of a \"militant faction threatened to set loose thousands of poisonous snakes in the capital unless she was executed.\" After spending two months in hiding, at the end of 1994 she escaped to Sweden, consequently ceasing her medical practice and becoming a full-time writer and activist.\n\nAfter fleeing Bangladesh in 1994, Nasrin spent the next ten years in exile in Europe and America. She returned to the east and relocated to Kolkata, India, in 2004, where she lived until 2007. After renewed unrest broke out, and after spending several months in hiding, Nasrin left for Europe and America again in 2008.\n\nLeaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted citizenship by the Swedish government and took refuge in Germany. She allegedly had to wait for six years (1994–1999) to get a visa to visit India. In 1998 she wrote Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood her biographical account from birth to adolescence. She never got a Bangladeshi passport to return to the country when her mother, and later her father, were on their death beds.\n\nIn March 2000, she visited Mumbai to promote a translation of her novel \"Shodh\" (translated by Marathi author Ashok Shahane, the book was called \"Phitam Phat\"). Secular \"atheist\" groups seized upon the occasion to celebrate freedom of expression, while \"radical fundamentalist groups...threatened to burn her alive.\"\n\nIn 2004, she was granted a renewable temporary residential permit by India and moved to Kolkata in the state of West Bengal, which shares a common heritage and language with Bangladesh; in an interview in 2007, after she had been forced to flee, she called Kolkata her home. The government of India extended her visa to stay in the country on a periodic basis, though it refused to grant her Indian citizenship. While living in Kolkata, Nasrin regularly contributed to Indian newspapers and magazines, including \"Anandabazar Patrika\" and \"Desh\", and, for some time, wrote a weekly column in the Bengali version of \"The Statesman\".\n\nAgain her criticism of Islam was met with opposition from religious fundamentalists: in June 2006, Syed Noorur Rehaman Barkati, the imam of Kolkata's Tipu Sultan Mosque, admitted offering money to anyone who \"blackened [that is, publicly humiliated] Ms Nasreen's face.\" Even abroad she caused controversy: in 2005, she tried to read an anti-war poem titled \"America\" to a large Bengali crowd at the North American Bengali Conference at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and was booed off the stage. Back in India, the \"All India Muslim Personal Board (Jadeed)\" offered 500,000 rupees for her beheading in March 2007. The group's president, Tauqeer Raza Khan, said the only way the bounty would be lifted was if Nasrin \"apologises, burns her books and leaves.\"\n\nIn 2007, elected and serving members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen made threats against Tasleema Nasreen, pledging that the \"fatwa\" against her and Salman Rushdie were to be abided by. While she was in Hyderabad releasing Telugu translations of her work, she was attacked by party members led by 3 MLAs- Mohammed Muqtada Khan, Mohammed Moazzam Khan and Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri - were then charged and arrested.\n\nOn 28 August 2007, Nasrin was in Hyderabad to present the Telugu translation of one of her novels, \"Shodh\", when she was allegedly attacked by a mob, allegedly led by legislators from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, an Indian political party. A week later, on 17 August, Muslim leaders in Kolkata revived an old fatwa against her, urging her to leave the country and offering an unlimited amount of money to anybody who would kill her. On 21 November, Kolkata witnessed a protest against Nasrin. A protest organised by the militant islamist \"All India Minority Forum\" caused chaos in the city and forced the army's deployment to restore order. After the riots, Nasrin was forced to move from Kolkata, her \"adopted city,\" to Jaipur, and to New Delhi the following day.\n\nThe government of India kept Nasrin in an undisclosed location in New Delhi, effectively under house arrest, for more than seven months. In January 2008, she was selected for the Simone de Beauvoir award in recognition of her writing on women's rights, but declined to go to Paris to receive the award. She explained that \"I don't want to leave India at this stage and would rather fight for my freedom here,\" but she had to be hospitalised for three days with several complaints. The house arrest quickly acquired an international dimension: in a letter to London-based human rights organisation Amnesty International, India's former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey urged the organisation to pressure the Indian government so Nasrin could safely return to Kolkata.\n\nFrom New Delhi, Nasrin commented: \"I'm writing a lot, but not about Islam, It's not my subject now. This is about politics. In the last three months I have been put under severe pressure to leave [West] Bengal by the police.\" In an email interview from the undisclosed safehouse, Nasrin talked about the stress caused by \"this unendurable loneliness, this uncertainty and this deathly silence.\" She cancelled the publication of the sixth part of her autobiography \"Nei Kichu Nei\" (\"No Entity\"), and—under pressure—deleted some passages from \"Dwikhondito\", the controversial book that was the boost for the riots in Kolkata. She was forced to leave India on 19 March 2008.\n\nNasrin moved to Sweden in 2008 and later worked as a research scholar at New York University. Since, as she claims, \"her soul lived in India,\" she also pledged her body to the country, by awarding it for posthumous medical use to Gana Darpan, a Kolkata-based NGO, in 2005. She eventually returned to India, but was forced to stay in New Delhi as the West Bengal government refused to permit her entry.. Currently her visa received a one-year extension in 2016 and Nasreen is also seeking permanent residency in India but no decision has been taken on it by the Home Ministry \n\nIn 2015 Nasrin was supposedly threatened with death by Al Qaeda-linked extremists, and so the Center for Inquiry assisted her in traveling to the United States, where she now lives. The Center for Inquiry (CFI) that helped evacuate her to USA on 27 May gave an official statement in June 2015 stating that her safety \"is only temporary if she cannot remain in the U.S., however, which is why CFI has established an emergency fund to help with food, housing, and the means for her to be safely settled\",\n\nNasrin started writing poetry when she was thirteen. While still at college in Mymensingh, she published and edited a literary magazine, \"SeNjuti\" (\"Light in the dark\"), from 1978 to 1983. She published her first collection of poems in 1986. Her second collection, \"Nirbashito Bahire Ontore\" (\"Banished within and without\") was published in 1989. She succeeded in attracting a wider readership when she started writing columns in late 1980s, and, in the early 1990s, she began writing novels, for which she has won significant acclaim. In all, she has written more than thirty books of poetry, essays, novels, short stories, and memoirs, and her books have been translated into 20 different languages.\n\nHer own experience of sexual abuse during adolescence and her work as a gynaecologist influenced her a great deal in writing about the alleged treatment of women in Islam and against religion in general. Her writing is characterised by two connected elements: her struggle with the Islam of her native culture, and her feminist philosophy. She cites Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir as influences, and, when pushed to think of one closer to home, Begum Rokeya, who lived during the time of undivided Bengal. Her later poetry also evidences a connection to place, to Bangladesh and India.\n\nIn 1989 Nasrin began to contribute to the weekly political magazine \"Khaborer Kagoj\", edited by Nayeemul Islam Khan, and published from Dhaka. Her feminist views and anti-religion remarks articles succeeded in drawing broad attention, and she shocked the religious and conservative society of Bangladesh by her radical comments and suggestions. Later she collected these columns in a volume titled \"Nirbachita Column\", which in 1992 won her first Ananda Purashkar award, a prestigious award for Bengali writers. During her life in Kolkata, she contributed a weekly essay to the Bengali version of \"The Statesman\", called \"Dainik Statesman\". Taslima has always advocated for Uniform Civil Code, and said that criticism of Islam is the only way to establish secularism in Islamic countries. Taslima said that Triple talaq is despicable and All India Muslim Personal Law Board should be abolished. Taslima used to write articles for online media venture The Print in India.\n\nIn 1992 Nasrin produced two novellas which failed to draw attention.\n\nHer breakthrough novel \"Lajja\" (\"Shame\") was published in 1993, and attracted wide attention because of its controversial subject matter. It contained the struggle of a patriotic Bangladeshi Hindu family in a Muslim environment. Initially written as a thin documentary, \"Lajja\" grew into a full-length novel as the author later revised it substantially. In six months' time, it sold 50,000 copies in Bangladesh before being banned by the government that same year.\n\nHer other famous novel is \"French Lover\", published in 2002.\n\nHer memoirs are renowned for their candidness, which has led to a number of them being banned in Bangladesh and India. \"Amar Meyebela\" (\"My Girlhood\", 2002), the first volume of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi government in 1999 for \"reckless comments\" against Islam and the prophet Mohammad. \"Utal Hawa\" (\"Wild Wind\"), the second part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2002. \"Ka\" (\"Speak up\"), the third part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi High Court in 2003. Under pressure from Indian Muslim activists, the book, which was published in West Bengal as \"Dwikhandita\", was banned there also; some 3,000 copies were seized immediately. The decision to ban the book was criticised by \"a host of authors\" in West Bengal, but the ban wasn't lifted until 2005. \"Sei Sob Ondhokar\" (\"Those Dark Days\"), the fourth part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2004.\nTo date, a total of seven parts of her autobiography have been published. \"Amibhalo nei tumi bhalo theko priyo desh\", \" Nei kichu nei\" and \"Nirbashito\". All seven parts have been published by Peoples's Book Society, Kolkata.\nShe received her second \"Ananda Purashkar\" award in 2000, for her memoir \"Amar Meyebela\" (\"My Girlhood\", published in English in 2002).\n\nNasrin's life is the subject of a number of plays and songs, in the east and the west. The Swedish singer Magoria sang \"Goddess in you, Taslima,\" and the French band Zebda composed \"Don't worry, Taslima\" as an homage.\n\nHer work has been adapted for TV and even turned into music. \"Jhumur\" was a 2006 TV serial based on a story written especially for the show. Bengali singers like Fakir Alamgir, Samina Nabi, Rakhi Sen sang her songs. Steve Lacy, the jazz soprano saxophonist, met Nasrin in 1996 and collaborated with her on an adaptation of her poetry to music. The result, a \"controversial\" and \"compelling\" work called \"The Cry\", was performed in Europe and North America. Initially, Nasrin was to recite during the performance, but these recitations were dropped after the 1996 Berlin world premiere because of security concerns.\n\nNasrin has been criticised by writers and intellectuals in both Bangladesh and West Bengal for targeted scandalisation. Because of \"obnoxious, false and ludicrous\" comments in \"Ka\", \"written with the 'intention to injure the reputation of the plaintiff'\", Syed Shamsul Haq, Bangladeshi poet and novelist, filed a defamation suit against Nasrin in 2003. In the book, she mentions that Haq confessed to her that he had a relationship with his sister-in-law. A West Bengali poet, Hasmat Jalal, did the same; his suit led to the High Court banning the book, which was published in India as \"Dwikhondito\".\n\nNearly 4 million dollars were claimed in defamation lawsuits against Nasrin by fellow writers in Bangladesh and West Bengal after the publication of \"Ka\" / \"Dwikhandita\". The West Bengal Government, supposedly pressured by 24 literary intellectuals, decided to ban Nasreen's book in 2003. Nasrin replied that she wrote about known people without their permission when some commented that she did it to earn fame. She defended herself against all the allegations. She wrote why she dared to reveal her sexual activities, saying that she wrote her life's story, not others'. Yet Nasrin enjoyed support from Bengali writers and intellectuals like Annada Shankar Ray, Sibnarayan Ray and Amlan Dutta.\n\nRecently she was supported and defended by personalities such as author Mahasweta Devi, theatre director Bibhas Chakrabarty, poet Joy Goswami, artist Prakash Karmakar and Paritosh Sen. In India, noted writers Arundhati Roy, Girish Karnad, and many others defended her when she was under house arrest in Delhi in 2007, and co-signed a statement calling on the Indian government to grant her permanent residency in India or, should she ask for it, citizenship. In Bangladesh Kabir Chaudhury (writer and philosopher) also supported her strongly.\n\n\nTaslima Nasrin has received international awards in recognition of her substantial contribution towards the cause of freedom of expression. Awards and honours conferred on her include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "86651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86651", "title": "William Chester Minor", "text": "William Chester Minor\n\nWilliam Chester Minor, also known as W. C. Minor (June 22, 1834 – March 26, 1920) was an American army surgeon and one of the largest contributors of quotations to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". He was held in a lunatic asylum for murder at the time. \n\nMinor was born on the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the son of Congregationalist Church missionaries from New England. He had numerous half-siblings, among them Thomas T. Minor, mayor of Seattle, Washington. At 14 he was sent to the United States. He subsequently attended Yale Medical School, graduating with a degree and a specialization in comparative anatomy in 1863.\n\nHe was accepted by the Union Army as a surgeon and served at the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864, which was notable for the terrible casualties suffered by both sides. Minor was also given the task of punishing an Irish soldier in the Union Army by branding him on the face with a \"D\" for \"deserter\" and his nationality later played a role in Minor's dementia delusions.\n\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, Minor saw duty in New York City. He was strongly attracted to the red-light district of the city and devoted much of his off-duty time to going with prostitutes. By 1867, his behavior had come to the attention of the Army and he was transferred to a remote post in the Florida Panhandle. By 1868, his condition had progressed to the point that he was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a lunatic asylum (as mental hospitals were then called) in Washington, D.C. After eighteen months he showed no improvement.\n\nIn 1871 he went to London, settling in the slum of Lambeth, where once again he took up a dissolute life. Haunted by his paranoia, he fatally shot a man named George Merrett, who Minor believed had broken into his room, on February 17, 1872. Merrett had been on his way to work to support his family of six children, himself, and his pregnant wife, Eliza. After a pre-trial period spent in London's Horsemonger Lane Gaol, Minor was found not guilty by reason of insanity and incarcerated in the asylum at Broadmoor in the village of Crowthorne, Berkshire. As he had his US army pension and was not judged dangerous, he was given rather comfortable quarters and was able to buy and read books.\n\nIt was probably through his correspondence with the London booksellers that he heard of the call for volunteers from what was to become the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED). He devoted most of the remainder of his life to that work. He became one of the project's most effective volunteers, reading through his large personal library of antiquarian books and compiling quotations that illustrated the way particular words were used. He was often visited by the widow of the man he had killed, and she provided him with further books. The compilers of the dictionary published lists of words for which they wanted examples of usage. Minor provided these, with increasing ease as the lists grew. It was many years before the \"OED\"s editor, Dr. James Murray, learned Minor's background history, and visited him in January 1891. In 1899 Murray paid compliment to Minor's enormous contributions to the dictionary, stating, \"we could easily illustrate the last four centuries from his quotations alone.\"\n\nMinor's condition deteriorated and in 1902, due to delusions that he was being abducted nightly from his rooms and conveyed to places as far away as Istanbul, and forced to commit sexual assaults on children, he cut off his own penis (autopenectomy) using a knife he had employed in his work on the dictionary. His health continued to worsen, and after Murray campaigned on his behalf, Minor was released in 1910 on the orders of Home Secretary Winston Churchill. He was deported back to the United States and resided at St. Elizabeths Hospital where he was diagnosed with dementia praecox. He died in 1920 in Hartford, Connecticut, after being moved in 1919 to the Retreat for the Elderly Insane there.\n\nThe book \"The Surgeon of Crowthorne\" (published in America as \"The Professor and the Madman\"), by Simon Winchester, was published in 1998 and chronicles both Minor's later life and his contributions to the creation of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\nThe movie rights for the book were bought by Mel Gibson's Icon Productions in 1998. In August 2016 it was announced that Farhad Safinia was to direct an adaptation, called \"The Professor and the Madman\", starring Gibson as Murray and Sean Penn as Minor.\n\nMinor's life was detailed in an episode of Drunk History. He was portrayed by Bob Odenkirk.\n\n"}
{"id": "1606714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1606714", "title": "Wine label", "text": "Wine label\n\nWine labels are important sources of information for consumers since they tell the type and origin of the wine. The label is often the only resource a buyer has for evaluating the wine before purchasing it. Certain information is ordinarily included in the wine label, such as the country of origin, quality, type of wine, alcoholic degree, producer, bottler, or importer. In addition to these national labeling requirements producers may include their web site address and a QR Code with vintage specific information.\n\nSome wineries place great importance on the label design while others do not. There are wineries that have not changed their label's design in over 60 years, as in the case of Château Simone, while others hire designers every year to change it. Labels may include images of works by Picasso, Chagall, and other artists, and these may be collector's pieces. The elegance of the label does not determine the wine's quality. Instead, it is the information contained within the label that can provide consumers with such knowledge.\n\nMost New World consumers, and increasingly European consumers, prefer to purchase wine with varietal labels and/or with brand name labels. A recent study of younger wine drinkers in the U.S. found that they perceived labels with châteaux on them to be stuffy or old-fashioned. Producers often attempt to make selecting and purchasing wine easy and non-intimidating by making their labels playful and inviting. The financial success of New World wine attributed to striking label designs has led some European producers to follow suit, as in the case of the redesign of Mouton Cadet.\n\nWine classification systems differ by country. Wines can be classified by region and area only. For example, there are 151 châteaux in Bordeaux with \"Figeac\" and 22 estates in Burgundy with \"Corton\" on their labels. In Burgundy, there are 110 appellations in an area only one-fifth the size of Bordeaux. Complicating the system is the fact that it is common for villages to append the name of their most famous vineyard to that of the village.\n\nIn Spain and Portugal, the authenticity of the wine is guaranteed by a seal on the label or a band over the cork under the capsule. This is promulgated by the growers' association in each area.\n\nGerman wine labels are particularly noted for the detail that they can provide in determining quality and style of the wine.\n\nAlmost every New World wine is labelled by grape variety and geographic origin. Semi-generic designations were once quite common in countries such as Australia and the US, but the wine authorities in areas such as Champagne have not been afraid to bring lawsuits against the use of their names outside their region, and semi-generic names are falling out of use.\n\nWines whose label does not indicate the name of the winery or the winemaker are referred to as \"cleanskin\" wine, particularly in Australia.\n\nDegree of sweetness information is particularly inconsistent, with some countries' manufacturers always indicating it in standardized fashion in their language (brut, dolce, etc.), some traditionally not mentioning it at all or referring to it informally and vaguely in a rear-label description, and yet other countries' regulators requiring such information to be included (commonly on a secondary label) even when such information has to be added by the importer. In certain cases of conflicting regulations, a wine may, for example, even be labelled \"sweet\" by a manufacturer, but also \"semi-sweet\" (as per a different law) in the local language translation on a supplementary label mandated by the jurisdiction where it is sold.\n\nThe information contained in labels is important to determine the quality of the wine. For example, great importance needs to be attached to vintage dates when there are differences in climate. The taste and quality of the wine can change from year to year depending on the climate. Knowing the vintage is specially important when buying fine wines because the quality of the wine can vary from year to year due to climatic differences. The quickest way to determine the quality of the year is to use a wine chart.\n\nVintage dates may not be important, for example, there are no vintage dates on bottles of sherry.\nOn the other hand, wines may or may not have vintages. Champagne is usually a blend from more than one year and only sometimes sold as a vintage wine. Also, Port is only sold with a vintage in years of exceptional quality.\n\nA wine label may include the producer, the bottler and the merchant's names. The bottler's name must always be included in the label. The importer's name must be included in the label only for countries outside the Common Market. While it is not necessary for a wine to be bottled at its place of origin, it is obligatory for classed growth claret and vintage port to be bottled in Bordeaux and Oporto. Also, bottling of Alsace must be done within the appellation. Thus, it is important to look for terms such as \"mis en bouteille au château\" or \"mis au domaine\" because they tell you the wine is estate bottled.\n\nLabels may include terms that may be perceived as misleading. The term \"Blanc de blancs\" may be included in a label. This term means \"white wine made from white grapes\". The fact is that white wines are predominantly made from white grapes, with the exception of many sparkling wines, the common use of the red Pinot noir in Champagne wines being a typical example.\n\nAlthough the word \"château\" is most associated with Bordeaux, it does not mean that the wine \"does\" come from Bordeaux, and there may not be any kind of building – let alone a château – associated with the vineyard. The name château can even be included in wines from Australia or California. Labels of Vin de pays never include the word château.\n\n\"Cru\", a word used to classify wines can mean different things. For example, in the Médoc part of Bordeaux, this terms means the château is one of the classified growths in the regions. In Saint-Émilion, the term \"cru\" is of little importance because it bears little relation to quality. For Provence the term \"cru classé\" is included only for historical reasons. On the other hand, the use of the term \"cru\" in Switzerland has no foundation and it is included at the producer's discretion.\n\nTo better reach the market of blind or sight-impaired wine consumers, labels have appeared printed in Braille. Currently the only known winemaker to print all their labels in Braille is Chapoutier winery in France, who began the practice in 1996. Other wineries in a number of countries have followed Chapoutier's lead and have braille available on at least some of their bottles.\n\nNeck and/or back labels may appear on a bottle. The neck label may include the vintage date and the back label usually gives extra (and usually optional) information about the wine. Government required warnings are usually found in the back label, as well as UPCs. For example, the United States requires alcoholic beverages to include a warning regarding the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The label also has to mention the possibility of a reduced ability to drive while intoxicated. Wine labels in the US must also disclose that the wine contains sulfites.\n\nThere are different reasons for wine laws. Labelling regulations can be intended to prevent wine from sounding better than it is. Also, it is illegal to say that a wine is made from one grape when it is actually from another.\n\nThe label must also include the name and address of the bottler of the wine. If the producer is not the bottler, the bottle will say that the wine was bottled by X bottled for Y producer. Table wines may carry the name of the bottler and the postal code. The label must also include the country of origin.\n\nThe size of the font is also regulated for mandatory information. Alcohol content must be included in the label, with some jurisdictions also requiring brief nutritional data, such as caloric value, carbohydrate/sugar content, etc. In Australia and the United States a wine label must also mention that it has sulfites in certain circumstances.\n\nRegulations may permit table wines to be labelled with only the colour and flavour, and no indication of quality. The use of words such as Cuvée and grand vin in labels is controlled. As mentioned above, a vin de pays must never be from a château, but from a domaine.\n\nNew Zealand and Australian labelling regulations have required an allergen warning to appear on wine labels since 2002 due to the use of egg whites, milk, and isinglass in the fining and clarifying of the wine. The United States is considering similar requirements. Winemakers in the US have been resistant to this requirement because the decision to put a wine through a fining process normally occurs after the labels have been ordered, which could lead to allergen warnings on wines that have had no exposure to allergens.\nWine labels from the member states of the European Union must also disclose after 30 June 2012 that the wine was treated with casein and ovalbumin, derived from milk and egg respectively, used as fining agents in the winemaking.\n\nPaper wine labels have long been collected. This can turn into a full-fledged hobby, with collections organized by theme, country, or region. For others, saving labels may be part of maintaining a wine tasting-notes journal, or just simply to remember a particular wine. Wine labels, or Bottle Tickets, are also an area of interest to collectors. The Wine Label Circle was formed in 1952. These objects of silver, mother-of-pearl, ivory or enamel were, in the 18th and 19th centuries, used to identify the contents of the decanter or bottle on which they were hung, the contents of which may have included in addition to wines and spirits, sauces, condiments, flavourings, perfumes, toilet waters, medicines, inks, soft drinks, preserves and cordials \n\nWhile labels were once easily steamed off, recent automatic bottling and labeling processes at wineries have led to the use of stronger glues. Removing these labels is often difficult and may result in considerable damage to the label. A recent, though by no means universal, innovation to bypass this problem is the use of bottles that come with the ability to tear off a small part of the label in order to remind the drinker of the name and bearing of the wine.\n\nIf full label removal is desired, a common approach involves putting hot water inside the bottle which makes the hold of the glue weaker. A knife can then be used to remove the label from one side by lifting it off with even pressure.\n\nCommercial label removal kits apply a strong, transparent sticker over the label surface. The goal is to carefully pull off the sticker and literally tear the front design of the label away from the glued back. In practice, varying degrees of success are encountered and extensive damage to the label can occur.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3539730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3539730", "title": "Writing Drama", "text": "Writing Drama\n\nWriting Drama (French: La dramaturgie) is a treatise by French writer and filmmaker Yves Lavandier, originally published in 1994, revised in 1997, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2014. The English version was translated from the French by Bernard Besserglik and published in 2005. The book exists also in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\"Writing Drama\" explores the mechanisms of dramatic story telling. The author makes a clear distinction between what is written to be seen and/or heard (theater, cinema, television, radio, opera and to a lesser extent comic books) and what is written to be read (literature).\n\nThe book's principle is the same as Aristotle's \"Poetics\". Yves Lavandier examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights (Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, Charles Chaplin, Hergé, Alfred Hitchcock, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Lubitsch, Molière, Dino Risi, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, etc.) in order to answer three questions:\n\nThe author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by Molière, \"The School for Wives\", and a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, \"North by Northwest\", are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc.\n\nIn the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him:\n\n\"Writing Drama\" is considered a reference textbook amongst European playwrights and scriptwriters.\n\nAccording to Jacques Audiard, \"Writing Drama\" is on par with Aristotle's \"Poetics\". Francis Veber said it is \"the most thorough and challenging work of its kind to come out since the birth of scriptwriting\". In 2006, Frédéric Beigbeder called Yves Lavandier the \"living god of screenwriters\".\n\n"}
