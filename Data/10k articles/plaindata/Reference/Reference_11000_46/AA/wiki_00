It has been described as a defining moment in the genre.\n\nBritish tourists were travelling through Europe in increasing numbers and the need for guidebooks was beginning to be supplied by publishers like John Murray.\nIn 1845 Ford, who had gained tremendous knowledge of Spain by extensive travel on horseback, wrote this account enlivened by humour and anecdotes.\n\nIn Ford's obituary, commonly attributed to Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, \"so great a literary achievement had never before been performed under so humble a title.\" Ford marked, with George Borrow the eccentric English traveller, an interest in Spain that would continue through the twentieth century on the part of British writers: Gerald Brenan, Norman Lewis and George Orwell were among the most eminent of these successors, with Jason Webster (the author of \"Duende\", \"Andalus\" and \"Guerra\") and Chris Stewart (the author of \"Driving Over Lemons\") being contemporary.\n\nThe original edition was published by John Murray in 1845 in two volumes. The following year in 1846 he prepared a more manageable version entitled \"Gatherings from Spain\" which included some extra material. Second and third editions of the original book appeared in 1847 and 1855 respectively. As of 1966 the book was still being reprinted.\n\nIn 1855 Richard Ford also wrote \"Andalucia, Ronda and Granada, Murcia, Valencia, and Catalonia; the portions best suited for the invalid\".\n\n\n"}

The building is located in Grant Park on the east side of Michigan Avenue, and marks the third address for the Art Institute. The building was built for the joint purpose of accommodating the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and subsequently the Art Institute. The core of the current complex, located opposite Adams Street, officially opened to the public on December 8, 1893, and was renamed the Allerton Building in 1968.\n\nThere have been numerous building additions over the years. The most recent addition is the Modern Wing funded in part by Pat Ryan. This new building increases gallery space by 33% and accommodates new educational facilities. It opened to the public on May 16, 2009.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago opened as the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts on May 24, 1879, and changed to its current name on December 23, 1882. It was originally established as both a school and museum, and stood on the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and Monroe Street, where it rented space. Before taking over its current building it occupied a four-story Romanesque building by Burnham & Root at 81 East Van Buren Street, where the Chicago Club is now situated. The Art Institute, which moved there at the time it changed names, originally leased and later purchased the space. With the coming of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and its need for a new home for its expanding collection and growing student body, the Art Institute's trustees negotiated for a new structure at what has come to be the current building. Although Aaron Montgomery Ward opposed the development of Grant Park with public buildings along the lakefront, he did not oppose the Art Institute.\nThe new building was funded by the sale of the Van Buren Street building to the Chicago Club for $ 265,000, by donation of the land by the Chicago Park District, by $120,000 public subscription, and by $200,000 contribution of the Fair Corporation in cooperation with the Exposition. The World Congress Auxiliary of the World's Columbian Exposition occupied the new building from May 1 to October 31, 1893, after which the Art Institute took possession on November 1. The building was built in the place of William W. Boyington's Illinois Inter-State Industrial Exposition Building (1873), which had been intended as a temporary structure.\n\nUpon his death in 1905, lumber merchant Benjamin Franklin Ferguson bequeathed almost $1 million () for the purpose of establishing a public sculpture fund to be administered by the Art Institute. The first gift from this memorial fund was the Fountain of the Great Lakes, which was commissioned in 1907.\n\nThe current building is a classical Beaux-Arts building, by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, Massachusetts. The Fullerton Auditorium and Ryerson Library were added to the building in 1898 and 1901 respectively. The building is composed of 273 galleries that total . The following is a summary of all additions. The building has a grand Italian Renaissance facade with a pedimented 5-bayed central section that protrudes forward from the 7-bayed wings on either side. The arcaded entry loggia is topped by three grand palladian arches that are separated by Corinthian half-columns.\n\nFullerton Hall was originally built in 1898 by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge on the north side of the main floor in place of a formerly open court. It was built to seat an audience of 425. It has a stained glass dome and formerly had a crystal chandelier both made by Louis Comfort Tiffany.\n\nRyerson Library was built in 1901 to the south opposite Fullerton Hall in another open court by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge. The Burnham Library of Architecture, which opened on January 12, 1920, was added south of and adjacent to the Ryerson Library by Howard Van Doren Shaw.\n\nThe Grand Staircase was completed in 1910. However, the architectural ornamentation of the neighboring gallery continued intermittently until 1929 without ever being completed. Plans for a great dome over this staircase were abandoned when proper financing never arose.\nIn 1916, Gunsaulus Hall was built by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge as a two-story bridge addition spanning the Illinois Central Railroad tracks behind the original building.\nMcKinlock Court was landscaped in 1924. By 1931 the court was remodeled so the \"Fountain of the Tritons\" could be installed. Today, this court is open for dining during summer months and still contains the Carl Milles bronze fountain in its center.\n\nIn 1958, Blackstone Hall, which had been added adjacent to the east wall of the original building in 1903 and once housed over 150 plaster casts of architectural artwork, was redesigned (further redesign continued in 1959). After the redesign Blackstone Hall no longer exhibited the Greek and Roman, Renaissance and modern sculptures. Now the Hall is partitioned into several galleries. Also in 1958, the Benjamin F. Ferguson Memorial Building was constructed by Holabird & Root & Burgee to accommodate administrative and curatorial offices, which relieved space in the existing buildings for more gallery space.\n\nIn 1960, the Stanley McCormick Memorial Court (north garden) was constructed by Holabird & Root & Burgee. The south garden was constructed in 1965, when the \"Fountain of the Great Lakes\" was moved and reinstalled. Dan Kiley designed the South garden.\n\nIn 1962, The Morton Wing was added south of the central building to provide additional exhibition space and galleries. This balanced the Ferguson building by restoring symmetry.\n\nIn 1968, the original central building was named the Allerton Building after longtime trustee Robert Allerton.\n\nIn the 1970s, the growth of the school and visitor attendance necessitated the Rubloff Building to accommodate new studios, classrooms, and a film center for the school, and new public spaces for the museum. Ground was broken in 1974, and the dedication was held October 6, 1976.\n\nThe Adler & Sullivan-designed Chicago Stock Exchange Building (1893–1972) Trading Room was salvaged from demolition and installed in the Columbus Drive Addition in 1977. This building fragment, which includes Louis Sullivan's exquisite stenciling, is described as the \"Wailing Wall of Chicago preservationists\".\n\nIn 1988, the Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Building was added to show the dramatically increased contemporary art collection and to exhibit popular large traveling exhibitions.\n\nThe Modern Wing, opened in 2009, was designed by Renzo Piano and funded in part by Pat Ryan. It increases the museum's gallery space by 30 percent by adding of new galleries, and includes the Ryan Education Center on the first floor.\n\nThe new building incorporates cutting-edge green technologies, such as a modern sunshade to filter daylight.\n\nThe sunshade, dubbed \"The Flying Carpet\", is made of white extruded aluminum and is linked to the lighting system to adjust and compensate for incandescent fixtures. The Nichols Bridgeway, a 625-foot (190 m) pedestrian bridge also designed by Piano, links the building to Millennium Park.\n\nFlanking the exterior Michigan Avenue entrance stairs are two bronze lions by sculptor Edward Kemeys that were a gift from a Mrs. Henry Field for the Art Institute's opening at its current location in 1893. Although the lions have no official names, the sculptor designated the lions by their poses as \"stands in an attitude of defiance\" (south lion) and \"on the prowl\" (north lion). These lions, along with those pairs in front of the Main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue and the pair in the grand staircase of the Boston Public Library, are part of an Italian Renaissance revival by 19th-century Romantic artists. Guardian lions had been an important architectural theme of the World Columbian Exposition, where six pairs guarded the entrance of the Palace of Fine Arts. Kemeys had sculpted one of these pairs, which may have served as his model for the Art Institute lions. The lions were moved back toward the museum in 1909-10 in conjunction with the widening of Michigan Avenue and the addition of a balustrade and terrace to the south, west and north sides of the building.\n\nWhen a Chicago sports team makes the playoffs, the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. This has been done for the Chicago White Sox in 2005, the Chicago Bears in 1986 and 2007, the Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, and the Chicago Cubs in 2016.\n\n"}

The eyewitness accounts are individually known as the Vrba-Wetzler report, Rosin-Mordowicz report, and Polish Major's report.\n\nThe reports were compiled by prisoners who had escaped from the camp and presented in their order of importance from the Western Allies' perspective, rather than in chronological order. The escapees who authored the reports were Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler (the Vrba-Wetzler report); Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz (the Rosin-Mordowicz report); and Jerzy Tabeau (the \"Polish Major's report\").\n\nThe Vrba-Wetzler report was widely disseminated by the Bratislava Working Group in April 1944, and with help of the Romanian diplomat Florian Manoliu, the report or a summary reached—with much unfortunate delay—George Mantello (Mandel), El Salvador Embassy First Secretary in Switzerland, via Moshe Krausz in Budapest. Mantello immediately publicized it. This triggered large-scale demonstrations in Switzerland, sermons in Swiss churches about the tragic plight of Jews and a Swiss press campaign of about 400 headlines protesting the atrocities against Jews. The events in Switzerland and possibly other considerations led to threats of retribution against Hungary's Regent Miklós Horthy by President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and others. This was one of the main factors which convinced Horthy to stop the Hungarian death camp transports. The full reports were published by the United States War Refugee Board on 26 November 1944 under the title \"The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia\". They were submitted in evidence at the Nuremberg Trials as document number 022-L, and are held in the War Refugee Board archives in the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, New York.\n\nIt is not known when they were first called the \"Auschwitz Protocols\", but Randolph L. Braham may have been the first to do so. He used that term for the document in \"The Politics of Genocide: The Holocaust in Hungary\" (1981).\n\n\nThe contents of the \"Protocols\" was discussed in detail by \"The New York Times\" on 26 November 1944.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "925519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=925519", "title": "Autogram", "text": "Autogram\n\nAn autogram (Greek: αὐτός = self, γράμμα = letter) is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters. They were invented by Lee Sallows, who also coined the word \"autogram\". An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as “one”, “two”, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called ‘self-enumerating’ or ‘self-documenting’ sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:\n\nThe first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in Douglas Hofstadter's \"Metamagical Themas\" column in \"Scientific American\".\n\nThe task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.\n\nA type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic pangram, a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once. Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by Rudy Kousbroek. Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating ‘translation’ of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine. Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:\n\nSallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won't be exact integers. He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:\n\nAutograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:\n\nJust as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:\nA special kind of autogram is the ‘reflexicon’ (short for “reflexive lexicon”), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies. The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as “contains”, “comprises”, “employs”, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.\n\nFor example, “Sixteen e's, six f's, one g, three h's, nine i's, nine n's, five o's, five r's, sixteen s's, five t's, three u's, four v's, one w, four x's” is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls “dummy text” in the shape of “one g” and “one w”. The latter might equally be replaced with “one #”, where “#” can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist but three and only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.\n\n"}

Some servers are configured (usually for logging reasons) to perform a reverse DNS lookup\n\nTo deal with this problem, IANA has set up three special DNS servers called \"blackhole servers\". Currently the blackhole servers are:\n\nThese servers are registered in the DNS directory as the authoritative servers for the reverse lookup zone of the , and addresses. These servers are configured to answer any query with a \"nonexistent address\" answer. This helps to reduce wait times because the (negative) answer is given immediately and thus no wait for a timeout is necessary. Additionally, the answer returned is also allowed to be cached by recursive DNS servers. This is especially helpful because a second lookup for the same address performed by the same node would probably be answered from the local cache instead of querying the authoritative servers again. This helps reduce the network load significantly. According to IANA, the blackhole servers receive thousands of queries every second.\nBecause the load on the IANA blackhole servers became very high, an alternative service, AS112, has been created, mostly run by volunteer operators.\n\nThe AS112 project is a group of volunteer name server operators joined in an autonomous system. They run anycasted instances of the name servers that answer reverse DNS lookups for private network and link-local addresses sent to the public Internet. These queries are ambiguous by their nature, and can not be answered correctly. Providing negative answers reduces the load on the public DNS infrastructure.\n\nBefore 2001, the in-addr.arpa zones for the private networks were delegated to a single instance of name servers, \"blackhole-1.iana.org\" and \"blackhole-2.iana.org,\" called the blackhole servers. The IANA-run servers were under increasing load from improperly-configured NAT networks, leaking out reverse DNS queries, also causing unnecessary load on the root servers. The decision was made by a small subset of root server operators to run the reverse delegations; each announcing the network using the autonomous system number of 112. Later, the group of volunteers has grown to include many other organizations.\n\nAn alternative approach, using DNAME redirection, was adopted by the IETF in May 2015.\n\nThe name servers participating in the AS112 project are each configured to answer authoritatively for the following zones:\n\n\n"}

It started out as a squatted building in Skippergata 6 in downtown Oslo in 1981 and has since been a centre of socialist, communist and anarchist activism.\n\nIn 1982 the movement were kicked out of Skippergata and moved into Pilestredet 30c, where an agreement was made between the city and the squatters. They were allowed to rent the house for a symbolic rent, and in return they would maintain the building. In 2002 the city council, then led by the Conservative Party, put the Blitz house on sale. The activists responded with a massive action and, among other things, battered the entrance part of the Oslo City Hall, and the sale was stopped.\n\nAmong the activities of the house are a bookshop with political literature, the Anti Fascist Action (AFA) network, a group supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal, a feminist group, a children's power group, a non-profit printing office, a photo group and a feminist radio station, radiOrakel.

The museum began accessioning the collection in January 1985. The collection consists of nearly 32,000 objects, from toys to dolls to games to musical instruments to masks to clothing to folk art from over 120 different countries. The museum created a specific exhibit for the collection, entitled \"Passport to the World,\" which opened in 1986. Initially the Caplans had intended for the collection to be the basis of a new Museum of Fantasy and Play, but this never materialized and they donated their collection to the Children's Museum instead. The Caplans spent about US$1 million acquiring the objects from around 1965 to 1985; some of the countries strongly represented are Japan, Mexico, Russia, Germany, Indonesia, and India.\n\nTheresa Caplan had organized the entire collection, using 20,000 meticulously documented notecards in 28 shoe boxes. All of the cards were organized by country and category. The collection was moved in three semi trucks containing 1500 boxes from a warehouse and the Caplan's home in Princeton, New Jersey to Indianapolis. All the objects were temporarily housed in space provided by Eli Lilly & Co. where they were fumigated to prevent any insects from entering the museum storage area. Subsequent transport of the collection from the warehouse to the museum and unpacking all the 50,000 pieces took museum staff members 10 months to complete. Paul Richard, the Children's Museum's director of programs in 1985, said that the institution was \"thrilled\" to acquire the collection \"with our philosophy of inspiring creativity in children, which is exactly what the Caplans have strived for with their various endeavors\".\n\nThe Caplan Collection was extensively used within the exhibit Passport to the World which opened in 1986. The theme of the exhibit was: \"All people celebrate, communicate, imagine and create, but in different ways.\" The exhibit was divided into four areas that displayed artifacts showing how the four parts of the theme were depicted in cultures around the world.\n\nAn opening reception was held on December 6, 1986. Present that evening were Frank and Theresa Caplan, members of their family, local dignitaries, diplomats from the United Nations and several of the countries represented in the collection along with more than 500 invited guests and international entertainers. Members of Pedro Linares' family from Mexico demonstrated the making of alebrijes, their unique, fantasy, papier mache creatures while groups of international musicians and dancers performed throughout the museum.\n\nHighlights of the collection include shadow puppets from Indonesia and India, carved wood puppets from Mali and Burma, a gourd helicopter from Mexico, a gamelan orchestra from Indonesia, a beaded stool from Cameroon, a castanet rattle from Portugal, cornhusk figures from Czechoslovakia, toys made by children from Zaire, Tanzania and Brazil, weavings from Egypt, carved figures from Poland, and ceremonial masks from Sri Lanka, Japan, Guatemala, Nepal and Burkina Faso.\n\nSince the original donation by the Caplans, the museum has continued to collect objects that enhance and strengthen the collection. Of these acquisitions, highlights include a raven transformation mask of the Kwakiutl people, British Columbia and Day of the Dead figures from Mexico. Unique objects include figural coffins made by Kane Kwei and Paa Joe of the Ga people of Teshi-Accra, Ghana.\n\nWorks by many internationally renowned artists are contained in the collection: paper machéalebrijes by the Linares family of Mexico, soft sculpture by Andjelka Filipovic of Yugoslavia, carved wood figures by Tadeusz Adamski of Poland, a doll by Sasha Morganthaler of Switzerland, clay figures by Teodora Blanco of Mexico, Native American storyteller figures by Dorothy Trujillo of the Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico, well as thousands of anonymous craftspersons whose works were purchased by the Caplans in markets and bazaars of the countries they visited.\n"}

The scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished King James I's court with an image of corruption and depravity. There are variations in the spelling of Helwys: Helwis, Helwiss, Helewyse, Helwysse, Yelwys, Ellowis, Elwys, Elwis, Elvis, Elwes, and Elwaies.\n\nGervase Helwys was born on 1 September 1561 in Saundby, Nottinghamshire, the first child of parents John Helwys (1535–1600) and Mary Blagden of Thames Ditton. His cousin, Thomas Helwys (1575–1616), one of the joint founders, with John Smyth, of the Baptist denomination, was thrown into Newgate Prison by the king for libel, where he died in 1616. As a student Helwys studied law at Middle Temple after completing his studies at New Inn, at the University of Oxford. His uncle, Geoffrey Helwys, a successful merchant, Alderman and Sheriff of London, was also a member of the Inn. Soon after, he married Mary Brooke, daughter of Thomas Brooke of Norfolk.\n\nOn 7 May 1603, Helwys was knighted by King James I. A decade later, on 6 May 1613, he was appointed by the same king as Lieutenant of the Tower of London after being recommended to the post by Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. As was common practice at the time, Helwys had to pay for the title, in this instance £2,000; £1,400 going to Northampton and £300 to Sir Thomas Monson, Master of the Armory in the Tower and a friend of Helwys'. Whilst there, Helwys had been involved on 10 March 1614 in the \"examination\" of prisoner Edmond Peacham, a rector of Hinton St. George who had been charged with having written a libel against the king, at the request of the king's Attorney general, Sir Francis Bacon.\n\nWhen his Secretary of State, the Earl of Salisbury, died in 1612, the king had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young Scottish favourite, Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties. But James's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.\n\nThe Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard; Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk; his son-in-law William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Sir Thomas Lake, soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers, fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with the married Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr. Seeing as Overbury distrusted the Howards and still had Carr's ear, he tried to prevent the marriage. To remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to the queen. Then it was no small feat to persuade the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar Michael of Russia, with the Howards being fully aware that his refusal would be seen as tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, sensing the urgency to remain in England and at his friend's side. On 22 April 1613, Overbury was placed in the Tower at the king's \"request\", eventually dying there five months later on 15 September \"of natural causes.”\n\nIn July 1615, after rumours began circulating at court, it subsequently emerged that Overbury had in fact been poisoned the discovery of the crime being revealed by a boy in the employment of one of the apothecaries responsible. Investigations were made and proofs were abundantly forthcoming. At a dinner in Whitehall with the king's new Secretary of State, Sir Ralph Winwood, Helwys admitted that he suspected there might have been some foul play. He immediately became suspect after correspondence surfaced between himself and Northampton concerning Overbury's conduct and health. In his letters to Helwys Northampton wrote with contempt of Overbury and expressed a desire that his own name should not be mentioned in connection with his imprisonment. Northampton also introduced one of the royal physicians, John Craig, to Helwys to report on the prisoner's health. Helwys also made the mistake of corresponding with Howard, the chief suspect in Overbury's poisoning. When the matter was judicially investigated, Helwys felt his political enemies trying to credit him with a direct hand in the murder. On 1 October 1615, he was arrested and forced to exchange his lodgings for a cell in the Tower.\n\nIn 1615, Helwys was put on trial, along with Monson, Richard Weston (the gaoler and ex-servant of Howard and Carr's), Mrs Anne Turner (widow of a fashionable London doctor), and a disreputable apothecary named James Franklin, in Guildhall, London for complicity in the murder of Overbury. The hearings were presided over by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Sir Francis Bacon. It was ruled that \"poisons\" had been \"administered\" in the form of \"jellies\" and \"tarts\" by Weston, Turner and Franklin at the direction of Frances Howard.\n\nWhen Howard and Carr were tried she admitted a part in the murder, but her husband did not. Fearing what Carr might say about him in court, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon. \"It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime.\" Carr refused and the couple were found guilty and sentenced to death. The king commuted their sentence to life imprisonment and they were eventually pardoned along with Monson.\n\nThe only evidence against Helwys was that of Franklin, who asserted that the Lieutenant had been in league with Frances Howard. Through letters to Howard that were not read at the hearings, it was clear that Helwys initially had no idea that Overbury was being poisoned. He confessed later that he had entertained suspicions of this after discovering earlier attempts to poison Overbury on the part of the gaoler Weston, who had been placed in that position at the suggestion of Northampton. Considering the powerful people protecting Weston, and assuming him, indeed, to be no less than their agent, Helwys had hesitated to interfere in what seemed to him to be a matter of state. He had, however, done his utmost surreptitiously to save Overbury. It was plain both from Weston's statements and from Helwys' own, that the Lieutenant had done his very best to defeat the Turner-Essex-Northampton plot to poison his prisoner, throwing away the \"rosalgar\" and later \"draughts\", as well as substituting food for Overbury from his own kitchen for that \"sent in\" by Turner. He had made Weston recognise the \"hideousness\" of what he had done and made him promise to desist from further attempts upon the prisoner's life. Although Helwys maintained that he kept a close watch on Overbury after this event, he nevertheless suspected that the \"thing was done\" the moment his vigilance had been relaxed.\n\nOn 18 November, – Helwys, Weston, Turner and Franklin – were found guilty as \"accessories before the fact done\" and, lacking powerful connections, were sentenced to death. On the day of his execution on the following Monday, 20 November at Tower Hill, Helwys gave an impassioned speech to the crowd in attendance protesting his innocence:\n\n\"I was so far from thinking myself foul in the fact, that until these two Gentlemen, (Doctor Felton and Doctor Whiting, the physicians for my soul) told me how deeply I had imbrued my hands in the blood of (Overbury) making me, by God’s law, as guilty in the concealing (of it) as if I had been a personal actor in it. Till then... I held myself ignorant of the deed, and my conscience so clear, that I did never ask God forgiveness...\"\n\nHe did, however, beg God's forgiveness for both his guilt in the crime and for being “much addicted\" to gambling. Helwys left behind him eight children with his wife Mary: William, Thomas, Nathaniel Gervase John, Elizabeth Bridget, Maria, Jane, Anna and Francesca.\n"}

When Germany invaded Norway in 1940 as a part of World War II, the royal family fled the country and Haakon VII later spearheaded the Norwegian resistance in-exile in the United Kingdom. H7 became one of several symbols used by the Norwegian populace to mark solidarity with and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the Norwegian resistance movement.\n\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Affairs Bjørn Tore Godal, speaking at the 50th anniversary for Victory in Europe Day, Norway was the only country in which the initials of the head of state became a resistance symbol. The monogram, with H superimposed on 7, was drawn on fences, walls, houses, roads, in the snow and otherwise in the public sphere. It was also used in illegal art. Coins with the H7 symbol were also attached to clothes. Such coins were confiscated by the Nazi authorities. It was also used in the private sphere, among others on the inside of blinds.\n\nA symbol used in a similar way was the \"V for victory\", as popularised by Winston Churchill. However, the Axis attempted to usurp this sign, supposedly with the new meaning of \"V for Viktoria\". While this campaign was successful in most of Nazi-occupied Europe, it failed in Norway: Despite continued official use, the opposition also adopted the V-sign as an abbreviation of \"\" (German for \"to lose\"), and filled in the Nazi V's with the H7 monogram. In fact, this popularized the use of H7, which was soon drawn without the V.\n\nThe act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in German-occupied Norway was punishable by imprisonment. Another possible sanction was terror from Nazi paramilitary groups, to which the police were ordered not to respond.\n\nThe symbol was also evoked after World War II to have a commemorative effect, among others at the first post-war Holmenkollen ski jump event, when the symbol was formed in large scale by people. It was also used on post-war coins.\n"}

It is in part an extended Latin translation of the \"German Herbarius\", the \"Gart der Gesundheit\" of Peter Schöffer, published in 1485 but, unlike that earlier work, also deals with animals, birds, fish and stones. The author does not restrict himself to dealing only with real creatures, but also includes accounts of mythical animals such as the dragon, harpy, hydra, myrmecoleon, phoenix, and zitiron.\n\nThe \"Hortus Sanitatis\" was the third important herbal to be printed in Mainz before 1500.

It is believed that the mine was in operation anywhere between the late 17th and early 19th century. However, earlier estimates are likely to be more accurate, due to indications that the Jesuit priests who funded the creation of the mine were dignitaries of Spain or Mexico.\n\nThe mine is reportedly home to large deposits of unrefined gold and silver, coming from veins of quartz pushed into the Southern California mountains by glaciers roughly 1.8 million years ago. In addition, it is believed that the bodies of as many as 20 workers, mostly Native Americans, were buried in a cave-in. Upon its reported rediscovery in the 1800s, many of those seeking to return to the mine were killed in riding accidents on the way to the mine, either being thrown from their horses or falling down the cliffs of the San Emigdio region.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, several groups have searched for the mine. The most notable and prominent example is the Edwards family. John Edwards has become the primary source of researchers, as his father and grandfather were both reportedly experts on the topic. Edwards' grandfather had reportedly rediscovered the mine shortly after World War I, only disclosing its general vicinity within Doc Williams Canyon, near Eagle Rest Peak in the mountains of Kern County.\n\nThe most recent attempt at rediscovery is by Jake Allard, a local college student of Anthropology at Moorpark College. Allard has claimed to have made a total of 6 expeditions in the regions described by Edwards, following the San Emigdio Creek through the various canyons. During the most successful expedition, he was accompanied by three colleagues from Moorpark College and Carnegie Mellon University. The former include colleagues Austin Clarizio, Collin Chamberlain, and Roman Kaufman.\n\nAllard believes the vicinity outlined by Edwards is the only feasible option, based on clues and context given in historical records, including nearby veins of silver and quartz, as well as gold dust discovered during the search. Artifacts discovered by Allard back up this claim. These include a late 18th or mid 19th-century mining tool, although its origins have not been confirmed.\n\nHundreds of hours of charting and mapping have resulted in the location of the mine being narrowed down to roughly 8 square miles. As of May 2017, Jake Allard has discovered one physical mine in the vicinity of Eagle Rest Peak. Despite not being a part of the Lost Padre mine, it shows promise that an exposed vein of ore may be within a reasonable distance. Allard argues that an open pit mining operation would be the most probable structure of the mine, given the location and time it was operated.\n\nSome theories suggest the Red Rock Canyon mine, located near Castaic, is actually an offshoot vein of the Lost Padre mine. However, there are several issues with this claim. The Red Rock mine, for example, was discovered in the 19th century and worked until 1935, over one hundred years after the Lost Padre mine was said to be in operation. Some, including Jake Allard, dispute this claim, having mapped a path to the Red Rock mine in 2016 in an attempt to collect evidence of late Mexican or early American creation of the Red Rock Canyon mine, as opposed to by Jesuit missionaries.\n\nA film has been produced, entitled \"Lost Padre Mine\", directed by David Noble. The film centers on the legend of the Lost Padre mine, following the character of Wayne Braddock, a treasure hunter who arrives in El Paso in search of missing gold.\n"}
{"id": "74930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74930", "title": "Manhattan (film)", "text": "Manhattan (film)\n\nManhattan is a 1979 American romantic comedy film directed by Woody Allen and produced by Charles H. Joffe. The screenplay was written by Allen and Marshall Brickman. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl (Mariel Hemingway) but falls in love with his best friend's (Michael Murphy) mistress (Diane Keaton). Meryl Streep and Anne Byrne also star.\n\n\"Manhattan\" was filmed in black-and-white and 2.35:1 widescreen. The film features music composed by George Gershwin, including \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which inspired the idea behind the film. Allen described the film as a combination of his previous two films, \"Annie Hall\" and \"Interiors\".\n\nThe film was met with widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress for Hemingway and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (after adjusting for inflation). Often considered one of Allen's best films, it ranks 46th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list and number 63 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of images of Manhattan and other parts of New York City accompanied by George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", with Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer dealing with the women in his life who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a 17-year-old girl attending the Dalton School. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack (Michael Murphy), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah (Wallace Shawn), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis (Meryl Streep) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since come out of the closet as a lesbian and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an Equal Rights Amendment fund-raising event at the Museum of Modern Art hosted by Bella Abzug (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through Central Park.\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book \"Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood\". Emily proceeds to read passages of the book, and even discusses an incident covered in the book of a ménage à trois Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who stoically responds about the book, and the film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac responds by discussing Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily, but Yale told her that Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the dénouement, Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. He leaves his apartment and sets out on foot for Tracy's. He arrives at the lobby of her family's apartment just as she is leaving for London. He says that she does not have to go and that he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people.\" He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" playing again. An instrumental version of \"Embraceable You\" plays over the credits.\n\n\nAccording to Allen, the idea for \"Manhattan\" originated from his love of George Gershwin's music. He was listening to one of the composer's albums of overtures and thought, \"this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie\". Allen has said that \"Manhattan\" was \"like a mixture of what I was trying to do with \"Annie Hall\" and \"Interiors.\"\" He also said that his film deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essentially junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of his \"possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances,\" and adding that he has \"rationalized [his] way out of it so far, but [he] could conceive of doing it.\"\n\nAccording to actress Stacey Nelkin, \"Manhattan\" was based on her romantic relationship with Woody Allen. Her bit part in \"Annie Hall\" ended up on the cutting-room floor, and their relationship started when she was 17 years old and a student at New York’s Stuyvesant High School. Allen did not publicly acknowledge the relationship until 2014.\n\nAllen talked to cinematographer Gordon Willis about how fun it would be to shoot the film in black and white, Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1) because it would give \"a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film\". Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white because that was how he remembered it from when he was small. \"Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York.\" He always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In \"Manhattan\" he really thinks that he and Willis succeeded in showing the city. \"When seeing it there on that big screen, it's really decadent\". The picture was shot on location with the exception of some of the scenes in the planetarium which were filmed on a set.\nThe famous bridge shot was done at five in the morning. The production had to bring their own bench as there were no park benches at the location. The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and that he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterwards, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take.\n\nAfter finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it. He offered to make a film for free instead. He later said: \"I just thought to myself, 'At this point in my life, if this is the best I can do, they shouldn't give me money to make movies.'\"\n\nAll titles of the soundtrack were compositions by George Gershwin. They were performed by the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas.\nA part of the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is heard in a concert scene.\n\n\"Manhattan\" opened in 29 North American theaters on April 25, 1979. It grossed $485,734 ($16,749 per screen) in its opening weekend and earned $39.9 million in its entire run, making the film the 17th highest-grossing picture of the year. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival in May. Adjusted for ticket price inflation (as of 2017), \"Manhattan\" grossed $141,484,800, making it Allen's second biggest box-office hit, following 1977's \"Annie Hall\".\n\nThe film received largely positive reviews and currently holds a rating of 95% \"Certified Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 59 critics. Gary Arnold, in \"The Washington Post\", wrote: \"\"Manhattan\" has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes at the expense of his own parochialism. There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sellouts decorating the Hollywood landscape. The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness.\" In his review for \"Newsweek\" magazine, Jack Kroll wrote: \"Allen's growth in every department is lovely to behold. He gets excellent performances from his cast. The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen's yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental – a balance also expressed in his best screen play [\"sic\"] yet.\" In his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote, \"Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual. And Mariel Hemingway deserves some kind of special award for what's in some ways the most difficult role in the film.\" Ebert included the film in his list of \"The Great Movies\". Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" awarded a full four out of four stars, calling it \"a remarkable motion picture. 'Manhattan' may turn out to be the year's best comedy \"and\" drama.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"extraordinarily fine and funny\" with \"superb\" performances from Keaton and Hemingway. Charles Chaplin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"harder, harsher, crueler, deeper-going, more assertive but in the end no less life-affirming than 'Annie Hall,'\" and declared \"Manhattan\" \"even better\" than that film.\n\nAlexander Walker of the \"London Evening Standard\" wrote: \"So precisely nuanced is the speech, so subtle the behaviour of a group of friends, lovers, mistresses and cuckolds who keep splitting up and pairing off like unstable molecules\". In 2007, J. Hoberman wrote in \"The Village Voice\": \"The New York City that Woody so tediously defended in \"Annie Hall\" was in crisis. And so he imagined an improved version. More than that, he cast this shining city in the form of those movies that he might have seen as a child in Coney Island—freeing the visions that he sensed to be locked up in the silver screen.\"\n\nIn October 2013, readers of \"The Guardian\" newspaper voted it the best film directed by Woody Allen.\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle named Allen best director for \"Manhattan\". The National Society of Film Critics also named Allen best director along with Robert Benton, who directed \"Kramer vs. Kramer\". The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Best Original Screenplay (Allen and Marshall Brickman). It also won the BAFTA Award for Best Film.\n\nIn \"Empire\" magazine's 2008 poll of the 500 greatest movies ever made, \"Manhattan\" was ranked number 76. The film was number 63 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed it \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It is also ranked #4 on Rotten Tomatoes' 25 Best Romantic Comedies.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nAllen wanted to preserve Willis's compositions and insisted that the aspect ratio be preserved when the film was released on video (an unusual request in a time when widescreen films were normally panned and scanned for TV and video release). As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were letterboxed, originally with a gray border.\n\n\"Manhattan\" was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012, alongside Allen's 1977 film \"Annie Hall\". Both releases included the films' original theatrical trailer.\n\nIn her memoir \"Out Came the Sun\" (2015), Hemingway detailed Allen's visit to her family home in Ketchum, Idaho upon completion of filming. After intimating that he wanted to take her to Paris, Hemingway warned her parents “that I didn’t know what the arrangement was going to be, that I wasn’t sure if I was even going to have my own room. Woody hadn’t said that. He hadn’t even hinted it. But I wanted them to put their foot down. They didn’t. They kept lightly encouraging me.” When Hemingway stipulated the procurement of a separate hotel room, Allen \"called for his private jet the next morning and left Idaho.\" Following publication of the anecdote, conservative pundit and film critic John Podhoretz characterized Allen as a \"repugnant ephebophile\" on Twitter.\n\n\"Manhattan\"s screenplay was performed in front of a live audience at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 15, 2012, as part of Jason Reitman's Live Read series. Actors read the script, narrowed to six speaking parts, and still photographs from the movie were projected behind them. The cast included Stephen Merchant as Isaac Davis, Olivia Munn as Mary Wilkie, Shailene Woodley as Tracy, Michael Murphy as Yale Pollack, Mae Whitman as Emily Pollack, Erika Christensen as Jill Davis and Jason Mantzoukas as Dennis. In keeping with the project's focus on impermanence and spontaneity, there were no rehearsals, shows were announced only days prior, and the names of some cast members were withheld entirely; performances were not recorded.\n\n\"Manhattan\" inspired the song \"Remember Manhattan\" written by Richard Marx and Fee Waybill from Marx's debut album.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1165333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1165333", "title": "North Tyneside Steam Railway", "text": "North Tyneside Steam Railway\n\nThe North Tyneside Steam Railway and Stephenson Railway Museum are visitor attractions in North Tyneside, North East England. The museum and railway workshops share a building on Middle Engine Lane adjacent to the Silverlink Retail Park. The railway is a standard gauge line, running south for from the museum to Percy Main. The railway is operated by the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA). The museum is managed by Tyne and Wear Museums on behalf of North Tyneside Council.\n\nThe railway runs along the alignment of various former coal wagonways, which were later used by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre; the museum and workshop building used to be the test facility. The museum is dedicated to the railway pioneers George Stephenson and his son Robert, with one of George's early locomotives, \"Billy\", housed in the museum.\n\nAs the early coal seams of the Northumberland Coalfield near the River Tyne were exhausted, waggonways were laid to serve pits sunk further north. Coal would be unloaded into colliers (coal transport ships) via staithes. The first wagonways used wooden waggons on wooden rails drawn by horses. The first traffic began in 1755 on a line from Shiremoor to Hayhole staithes, and was soon followed by more lines. Wooden rails were eventually replaced by wrought iron. Rope haulage was introduced from 1821, with the museum site being at the top of Prospect Hill. By the 1820s coal was coming from pits further to the north in Seghill, Backworth and Cramlington, while a pit at Murton near Shiremoor had also been added. In 1826 it also became the preferred route for coal coming from Fawdon to the west, to make it unnecessary to use keel boats further upriver.\n\nTraffic increased as further pits opened, and the corridor from Middle Engine Lane down to Percy Main became congested as companies either shared lines or built their own within a hundred yards of each other, depending on which was more convenient. Once they crossed the line of the present A193 Wallsend Road, they fanned out to their respective unloading points. In 1839 the Cramlington wagonway built a new line away from the corridor further to the west, while still passing close to it at the Middle Engine Lane and Percy Main ends. By the 1840s, coal was also coming from Blyth and Bedlington on the east coast, although this ceased after improvements to Blyth harbour in the 1880s.\n\nThe opening of the route to Blyth also saw passenger services being run to Percy Main from 1841, for connections with the Newcastle and North Shields Railway. These were run by what eventually became the Blyth & Tyne Railway. Passenger services ceased around 1864 when they opened an alternative route further to the east via Monkseaton (now the present Metro route).\n\nAt its peak, there were four lines on the corridor, with three stationary engines in close proximity to the museum. Having already been in use on other parts of the lines, gradient improvements on the Blyth & Tyne's line allowed it to use steam locomotives throughout from the 1850s. Others persisted with rope haulage, the Seaton Burn Wagonway being the last to convert in 1900.\n\nCoal production began to decline after the First World War causing the Seaton Burn wagonway to close in the 1920s; a new route from the Rising Sun colliery to the west did open in 1939, although this was to replace a line on a different route. In the late 1940s the coal and railway companies were nationalised - the lines on the corridor were now controlled by either the National Coal Board (NCB) or British Rail (BR) (as the eventual owners of the Blyth & Tyne). Rationalisation saw with the Cramlington line to the west closed in the 1950s.\n\nAs volumes further declined, the last Percy Main staithes closed in 1971, leading to the closure of the NCB lines, although the BR lines persisted. In 1975, the Seaton Burn wagonway alignment was relaid for use by the Tyne and Wear Metro Test Centre, whose test track ran from Middle Engine Lane as far south as the A1058 Coast Road bridges (and north beyond Middle Engine Lane on the Backworth wagonway alignment to West Allotment). The two prototype Metrocars worked out of a two road maintenance shed constructed in Middle Engine Lane. Once the Metro system opened in 1979 the test centre closed and the track infrastructure was dismantled, leaving only the shed. The last BR line (Percy Main to Backworth) closed in 1983 and the tracks were lifted, ending over 200 years of railway use of the corridor.\n\nIn 1982/4 North Tyneside Council acquired the test sheds as the nucleus for a transport museum. A partnership was formed between Tyne and Wear Museums and the Council, to construct a steam hauled passenger railway rather than a static transport museum. The North Tyneside Steam Railway Association formed at the site after the Monkwearmouth Station Museum Association relocated to Middle Engine Lane, bringing with them some items of rolling stock they had been restoring in the Monkwearmouth station's goods shed, which was in a deteriorating condition. From 1987, volunteers under supervision conducted the works necessary to relay a single track from the museum to Percy Main. The line was completed in 1989 and the first passenger trains ran in early 1991.\n\nIn 1994, Tyne and Wear Development Corporation and North Tyneside City Challenge made a grant available to North Tyneside Council to extend the workshops, redesign the museum space and construct a new facilities block. In 2003 the facilities block was further modified to improve educational and toilet facilities.\n\nIn 2007, the Tyne and Wear Museums and North Tyneside Council's head of cultural services have submitted plans for feasibility study into developing the museum into a premier North East railway tourist attraction, with period buildings, a link to Percy Main Metro station, and all year round opening.\n\nThe museum is managed by Tyne and Wear Museums on behalf of North Tyneside Council. Volunteers of the North Tyneside Steam Railway Association (NTSRA) operate the railway and assist with the maintenance and conservation of locomotives and rolling stock. The NTSRA is managed by a committee that meets quarterly and has an Annual General Meeting yearly.\n\nThe building on Middle Engine Lane serves as the railway workshop and the museum's indoor exhibition space, the workshop being on the left-hand side. The railway yard has three sidings entering the building from the south, the westernmost being for the workshop, while the two others enter the exhibition space allowing operational stock to be put on display.\n\nThe running line of the railway consists of a single track line, with two open-air platforms at either end, both with a passing loop. The northern platform, \"Middle Engine Lane\", is just south of the museum building. The southern platform, \"Percy Main\", is immediately south of the point where the Metro crosses the railway, paralleling the length of Brunton Street, to which there is a pedestrian access for passengers wishing to leave the train there.\n\nEntry to the museum is free; rides on the trains requires purchase of a ticket. The museum building also contains a gift shop and toilet facilities, and a cafe which opens on certain event days. The cafe was renovated in Autumn 2017. The museum is only open at certain times of the year, and passenger trains are only run on some of those days.\n\nAs of 2018 two main timetables are in operation. Green timetable is used on Sundays/Bank Holidays which runs four round trips - departing at 11.30am, 12.30pm, 2.00pm and 3.00pm. The Blue timetable is used on Thursdays during school holidays which runs three round trips - departing at 12.30pm, 1.30pm and 2.30pm. Special event days include a Halloween Special, a 1940s weekend, Beer Festival (Ale by Rail), Winter Warmers and Santa Specials.\n\n\"Billy\" was built by George Stephenson in 1826, one of the various pioneering early designs now known as the Killingworth locomotives, as they were built for use in Killingworth colliery. It is often referred to as the Killingworth Billy to differentiate it from the Puffing Billy built by William Hedley in 1813 for Wylam Colliery. Killingworth Billy ran until 1881, when it was presented to the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is a stationary exhibit mounted on a short stretch of period track which features the block mounted rails, to remain compatible with horse-drawn trains (horses would be tripped up by conventional sleepers).\n\nAn 0-6-0 Side Tank believed to have been built in 1951 as works number 7683. It is thought she was delivered new to Meaford Power Station to shunt coal waggons. It was one of several of its type supplied to power stations by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns Ltd., Forth Banks, Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1950s. They were used to transport coal wagons from mainline sidings into the power station, supplying the boiler-house coal bunkers. Their small diameter wheels enabled heavy loads to be hauled at slow speeds. Larger wheeled versions were supplied when long journeys were needed - for example, some colliery systems. Locally they could be seen working at places in Northumberland and Durham including Ashington, Backworth, Stanley and Consett. This loco was purchased from the Power Station by the East Lancs Railway and hauled their first trains at Bury. After a period in store, she was overhauled at Bury and moved to Tyneside in 1996. In a blue livery, this loco carries the name \"Ted Garrett, JP., DL., MP.\" No.1's overhaul is planned to begin once No.401 is complete.\n\nThis 0-6-0 saddle tank was built in 1939 as works number 1979 by Peckett & Sons of Bristol for Ashington Coal Company which operated one of Britain's most extensive colliery railway systems. In 1939, two identical locomotives were delivered to one of Peckett's standard designs and they received the names Ashington No 5 & Ashington No 6. The former spent her entire industrial career on the railway for which she was built. In 1969 she was sold by the National Coal Board to North Norfolk Preserved Railway because the Ashington system was dieselised. However, she returned to Northumberland in 1991 and was repainted into the \"as delivered to Ashington Colliery\" livery. The loco was additionally named \"Jackie Milburn\" in honour of the local football hero.\n\n\"A.No.5\" is an 0-6-0 side tank built in 1883 by Kitson and Company. It was the last working example of the 1841 patented Stephenson 'long boiler' design, to produce higher steam pressure while retaining a small wheelbase. Unsuited for high speeds, they nonetheless satisfied a need for powerful shunters at certain industrial railways like the Consett Iron and Steel Company. Withdrawn in 1972 it passed to Beamish Museum and then theTyne & Wear Museums Service at Monkwearmouth Station, Sunderland, where the Monkwearmouth Station Museum Association began its overhaul from a very derelict condition. It returned to steam in 1986. It was overhauled in 1995/6 and again in 2013/14. Removed from service and placed back on static display in the museum in Summer 2018. \n\nNo. 401 was one of a class of three built for the Steel Company of Wales in 1951 to an advanced specification designed to provide a low maintenance competitor to the diesel shunters emerging. As such it had many advanced features not seen on other industrial steam locomotives. It was sold to Austin Motor Co. Ltd., of Longbridge, Birmingham in 1957 before passing in 1973 to the developing West Somerset Railway. Once it became surplus to larger locomotives there, the Stephenson Railway Museum purchased 2994 and repainted it from \"Kermit the frog\" green to a black livery similar to a NER style, and named after local MP Thomas Burt. It remained in regular use until 2009 when it was placed on static display to await funds for restoration to the firebox/boiler. The locomotive is now nearing the end of an extensive overhaul.\n\nNo.08915 (originally D4145) used to be of Allerton (AN) depot. It is the main standby for the passenger service should the steam locomotive be undergoing maintenance. Now restored to BR Blue.\n\nNo.03078 (originally D2078) used to be of Gateshead (GD) depot. It is in a similar livery to Bagnall No.401 but has a North Tyneside Council crest on either side.\n\nAn early diesel built in the 1950s, Consett Iron and Steelworks No.10 is the last example of in-house production of locomotives by industrial railways in the North East. It was conceived in their Templetown workshops to satisfy a need for a 300 hp shunter with mechanical transmission, and was based on a Hunslet design. It was built by reusing many parts from steam locomotives. Eventually redundant to Sentinel's with hydraulic transmission, it was donated in 1976 to the Tyne and wear Museums Service by the work's later owner, the British Steel Corporation. No.10 is operational, however is not frequently used.\n\nElectric locomotive No.E4 was built for the Harton coal system at South Shields. It was stored outside for many years, but after a successful lottery bid and sponsorship from the local Siemens Microchip Company has been restored to working order but uses battery power rather than an overhead supply. The batteries are carried in a converted coal wagon. It is used for demonstrations on several days each season.\n\nNo. 3267 is the sole surviving example of the stock built in 1904 for the Tyneside Electrics system, the first suburban electric railway in the country. The system used third rail power and trains formed into multiple units. The vehicle was one of two on the system fitted out as vans, with driving cabs at each end. They were used to carry fish and sundry goods, as well as acting as the locomotives for passenger services on the Riverside branch. After withdrawal in 1938, the two vans had their motors removed and were converted to de-icing vans, hauled along the system at night by steam locomotives. It has since been restored to NER livery, and is on static display in the museum, on loan from the National Rail Museum.\n\nThe three ex-British Rail Mk1 carriages are used for the passenger trains. They were had been used on the Kings Cross suburban lines. They wear BR Midland Maroon Livery. They were preserved by the Bluebell Railway between 1973 and 1975, and were obtained by the museum in 1986.\n\nThe former London and North Eastern Railway pigeon van was used to transport racing pigeons. It now sits in the head shunt at Middle Engine Lane awaiting funds for restoration. Formerly No. 70754 and 041366, it was preserved in 1991. A preliminary repaint to resemble its teak finish has since been weather worn.\n\nThe rail crane (No. DRS 81140, prev. DB 966401, 81/001, 24247) was designed for British Rail. It has been paired with an ex-LNER wagon converted to a crane runner (No. DE321051, ex-6282, 70130E) It is slowly being restored as a long-term project.\n\nThe 20-ton Dogfish Ballast Wagon, Salmon Rail Carrier and 20 Ton wooden brake van all see occasional used on engineering and permanent way trains.\n\nThe four-plank wagon was built in 1927 as an oil tank wagon for a private owner, presumably an industrial railway. It had the registration number LMSR 103136. It was later reduced to its underframe and sold to the Metro for use on the test track. Having been left on the site, the museum inherited it. They converted it into a four-plank open wagon for use as the carrier for the batteries needed to power the railway's electric locomotive E4. It has been given a fictitious brown livery and markings of \"No. 103 Boldon Colliery\" on one side and \"No. 136 Whitburn Colliery\" on the other.\n\nThe 12-ton Vanfit goods van has been converted into a Tool Van which houses an electrical generator.\n\nThe TTP flat wagon was built as a Tank Wagon for a private owner.\n\nThe 5 ton Type BD van and 12 ton Shocvan are stored in the open, as bodies only, i.e. demounted from their chassis.\n\nThe museum site includes a free car park. Bus stops on Middle Engine Lane itself provide direct connections west to Haymarket bus station in Newcastle or east to Blyth bus station via Whitley Bay. Other bus stops Atmel Way in the adjacent Cobalt Business Park provide other connections, including to the two nearest Metro stations - Percy Main five minutes away to the south and Northumberland Park ten minutes away to the north (on the southern and northern sections of the North Tyneside loop, respectively).\n\nNearly all of the railway is paralleled by the National Cycle Route 10, which continues north from Middle Engine Lane along the alignment of the former railway to Backworth. Near the southern end, at the crossing with the A193 Wallsend Road the cycle route diverges from the railway to head south east, past Percy Main Metro, on its way to meet the east-west running National Cycle Route 72 which shadows the River Tyne.\n\nOn days when passenger services are in operation, the museum can also be accessed by joining the trains at the southern terminus, Percy Main Metro being around a 300m walk away from the platform through the residential estate of the same name.\n\n"}

{"id": "1482394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1482394", "title": "Ranking", "text": "Ranking\n\nA ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either 'ranked higher than', 'ranked lower than' or 'ranked equal to' the second.\nIn mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie.\n\nBy reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see.\n\nAnalysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics.\n\nIt is not always possible to assign rankings uniquely. For example, in a race or competition two (or more) entrants might tie for a place in the ranking. When computing an ordinal measurement, two (or more) of the quantities being ranked might measure equal. In these cases, one of the strategies shown below for assigning the rankings may be adopted. \nA common shorthand way to distinguish these ranking strategies is by the ranking numbers that would be produced for four items, with the first item ranked ahead of the second and third (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of the fourth. These names are also shown below.\n\nIn competition ranking, items that compare equal receive the same ranking number, and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers. The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap is one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it. This ranking strategy is frequently adopted for competitions, as it means that if two (or more) competitors tie for a position in the ranking, the position of all those ranked below them is unaffected (i.e., a competitor only comes second if exactly one person scores better than them, third if exactly two people score better than them, fourth if exactly three people score better than them, etc.).\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\"), C also gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\").\n\nSometimes, competition ranking is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers \"before\" the sets of equal-ranking items (rather than after them as in standard competition ranking). The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less than the number of items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal to it or above it. This ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if they score higher than all but one of their opponents, third if they score higher than all but two of their opponents, etc.\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked head of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 3 (\"joint third\"), C also gets ranking number 3 (\"joint third\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\"). In this case, nobody would get ranking number 2 (\"second\") and that would be left as a gap.\n\nIn dense ranking, items that compare equally receive the same ranking number, and the next item(s) receive the immediately following ranking number. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it that are distinct with respect to the ranking order.\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\"), C also gets ranking number 2 (\"joint second\") and D gets ranking number 3 (\"Third\").\n\nIn ordinal ranking, all items receive distinct ordinal numbers, including items that compare equal. The assignment of distinct ordinal numbers to items that compare equal can be done at random, or arbitrarily, but it is generally preferable to use a system that is arbitrary but consistent, as this gives stable results if the ranking is done multiple times. An example of an arbitrary but consistent system would be to incorporate other attributes into the ranking order (such as alphabetical ordering of the competitor's name) to ensure that no two items exactly match.\n\nWith this strategy, if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\"), and either B gets ranking number 2 (\"second\") and C gets ranking number 3 (\"third\") or C gets ranking number 2 (\"second\") and B gets ranking number 3 (\"third\").\n\nIn computer data processing, ordinal ranking is also referred to as \"row numbering\".\n\nItems that compare equal receive the same ranking number, which is the mean of what they would have under ordinal rankings. Equivalently, the ranking number of 1 plus the number of items ranked above it plus half the number of items equal to it. This strategy has the property that the sum of the ranking numbers is the same as under ordinal ranking. For this reason, it is used in computing Borda counts and in statistical tests (see below).\n\nThus if A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) which are both ranked ahead of D, then A gets ranking number 1 (\"first\"), B and C each get ranking number 2.5 (average of \"joint second/third\") and D gets ranking number 4 (\"fourth\").\n\nHere is an example: \nSuppose you have the data set 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0.\n\nThe ordinal ranks are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nFor v = 1.0, the fractional rank is the average of the ordinal ranks: (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5.\nIn a similar manner, for v = 5.0, the fractional rank is (7 + 8 + 9) / 3 = 8.0.\n\nThus the fractional ranks are: 1.5, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 4.5, 6.0, 8.0, 8.0, 8.0\n\nIn statistics, \"ranking\" refers to the data transformation in which numerical or ordinal values are replaced by their rank when the data are sorted. For example, the numerical data 3.4, 5.1, 2.6, 7.3 are observed, the ranks of these data items would be 2, 3, 1 and 4 respectively. For example, the ordinal data hot, cold, warm would be replaced by 3, 1, 2. In these examples, the ranks are assigned to values in ascending order. (In some other cases, descending ranks are used.) Ranks are related to the indexed list of order statistics, which consists of the original dataset rearranged into ascending order.\n\nSome kinds of statistical tests employ calculations based on ranks. Examples include:\n\n\nThe distribution of values in decreasing order of rank is often of interest when values vary widely in scale; this is the rank-size distribution (or rank-frequency distribution), for example for city sizes or word frequencies. These often follow a power law.\n\nSome ranks can have non-integer values for tied data values. For example, when there is an even number of copies of the same data value, the above described fractional statistical rank of the tied data ends in ½.\n\nMicrosoft Excel provides two ranking functions, the Rank.EQ function which assigns competition ranks (\"1224\") and the Rank.AVG function which assigns fractional ranks (\"1 2.5 2.5 4\") as described above.\n\nA rank correlation can be used to compare two rankings for the same set of objects. For example, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is useful to measure the statistical dependence between the rankings of athletes in two tournaments. Another example is the \"Rank–rank hypergeometric overlap\" approach, which is designed to compare ranking of the genes that are at the \"top\" of two ordered lists of differentially expressed genes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12377782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12377782", "title": "Segregation in Northern Ireland", "text": "Segregation in Northern Ireland\n\nSegregation in Northern Ireland is a long-running issue in the political and social history of Northern Ireland. The segregation involves Northern Ireland's two main voting blocs – Irish nationalist/republicans (mainly Roman Catholic) and unionist/loyalist (mainly Protestant). It is often seen as both a cause and effect of the \"Troubles\".\n\nA combination of political, religious and social differences plus the threat of intercommunal tensions and violence has led to widespread self-segregation of the two communities. Catholics and Protestants lead largely separate lives in a situation that some have dubbed \"self-imposed apartheid\". \n\nEducation in Northern Ireland is heavily segregated. Most state schools in Northern Ireland are predominantly Protestant, while the majority of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the Catholic Church. In all, 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland still go to separate faith schools. The consequence is, as one commentator has put it, that \"the overwhelming majority of Ulster's children can go from four to 18 without having a serious conversation with a member of a rival creed.\" The prevalence of segregated education has been cited as a major factor in maintaining endogamy (marriage within one's own group). The integrated education movement has sought to reverse this trend by establishing non-denominational schools such as the Portadown Integrated Primary. Such schools are, however, still the exception to the general trend of segregated education. Integrated schools in Northern Ireland have been established through the voluntary efforts of parents. The churches have not been involved in the development of integrated education. However, both the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, along with state-run institutions, have supported and organized cross-community school projects such as joint field trips, educational classes and forums wherein pupils can come together to share their beliefs, values and cultures. The academic John H. Whyte argued that \"the two factors which do most to divide Protestants as a whole from Catholics as a whole are endogamy and separate education\".\n\nHistorically, employment in the Northern Irish economy was highly segregated in favour of Protestants, particularly at senior levels of the public sector, in certain then important sectors of the economy, such as shipbuilding and heavy engineering, and strategically important areas such as the police. Emigration to seek employment was therefore significantly more prevalent among the Catholic population. As a result, Northern Ireland's demography shifted further in favour of Protestants leaving their ascendancy seemingly impregnable by the late 1950s.\n\nA 1987 survey found that 80 per cent of the workforces surveyed were described by respondents as consisting of a majority of one denomination; 20 per cent were overwhelmingly unidenominational, with 95–100 per cent Catholic or Protestant employees. However, large organisations were much less likely to be segregated, and the level of segregation has decreased over the years.\n\nThe British government has introduced numerous laws and regulations since the mid-1990s to prohibit discrimination on religious grounds, with the Fair Employment Commission (originally the Fair Employment Agency) exercising statutory powers to investigate allegations of discriminatory practices in Northern Ireland business and organisations. This has had a significant impact on the level of segregation in the workplace; John Whyte concludes that the result is that \"segregation at work is one of the least acute forms of segregation in Northern Ireland.\" \n\nPublic housing is overwhelmingly segregated between the two communities. Intercommunal tensions have forced substantial numbers of people to move from mixed areas into areas inhabited exclusively by one denomination, thus increasing the degree of polarisation and segregation. The extent of self-segregation grew very rapidly with the outbreak of the Troubles. In 1969, 69 per cent of Protestants and 56 per cent of Catholics lived in streets where they were in their own majority; as the result of large-scale flight from mixed areas between 1969 and 1971 following outbreaks of violence, the respective proportions had by 1972 increased to 99 per cent of Protestants and 75 per cent of Catholics. In Belfast, the 1970s were a time of rising residential segregation. It was estimated in 2004 that 92.5% of public housing in Northern Ireland was divided along religious lines, with the figure rising to 98% in Belfast. Self-segregation is a continuing process, despite the Northern Ireland peace process. It was estimated in 2005 that more than 1,400 people a year were being forced to move as a consequence of intimidation.\n\nIn response to intercommunal violence, the British Army constructed a number of high walls called \"peace lines\" to separate rival neighbourhoods. These have multiplied over the years and now number forty separate barriers, mostly located in Belfast. Despite the moves towards peace between Northern Ireland's political parties and most of its paramilitary groups, the construction of \"peace lines\" has actually increased during the ongoing peace process; the number of \"peace lines\" doubled in the ten years between 1995 and 2005. In 2008 a process was proposed for the removal of the peace walls.\n\nThe effective segregation of the two communities significantly affects the usage of local services in \"interface areas\" where sectarian neighbourhoods adjoin. Surveys in 2005 of 9,000 residents of interface areas found that 75% refused to use the closest facilities because of location, while 82% routinely travelled to \"safer\" areas to access facilities even if the journey time was longer. 60% refused to shop in areas dominated by the other community, with many fearing ostracism by their own community if they violated an unofficial \"de facto\" boycott of their sectarian opposite numbers.\n\nIn contrast with both the Republic of Ireland and most parts of Great Britain, where intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics is not unusual, in Northern Ireland it has been uncommon: from 1970 through to the 1990s, only 5 per cent of marriages were recorded as crossing community divides. This figure remained largely constant throughout the Troubles. It rose to between 8 and 12 per cent, according to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Attitudes towards Catholic–Protestant intermarriage have become more supportive in recent years (particularly among the middle class) and younger people are also more likely to be married to someone of a different religion to themselves than older people. However, the data hides considerable regional variation across Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the 1970s, the British government took action to legislate against religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The Fair Employment Act 1976 prohibited discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of religion and established a Fair Employment Agency. This Act was strengthened with a new Fair Employment Act in 1989, which introduced a duty on employers to monitor the religious composition of their workforce, and created the Fair Employment Commission to replace the Fair Employment Agency. The law was extended to cover the provision of goods, facilities and services in 1998 under the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. In 1999, the Commission was merged with the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Northern Ireland Disability Council to become part of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.\n\nAn Equality Commission review in 2004 of the operation of the anti-discrimination legislation since the 1970s, found that there had been a substantial improvement in the employment profile of Catholics, most marked in the public sector but not confined to it. It said that Catholics were now well represented in managerial, professional and senior administrative posts, although there were some areas of under-representation such as local government and security but that the overall picture was a positive one. Catholics, however, were still more likely than Protestants to be unemployed and there were emerging areas of Protestant under-representation in the public sector, most notably in health and education at many levels including professional and managerial. The report also found that there had been a considerable increase in the numbers of people who work in integrated workplaces.\n"}

{"id": "378268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378268", "title": "The Great Milenko", "text": "The Great Milenko\n\nThe Great Milenko is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, released on June 24, 1997, by Hollywood Records, in association with Psychopathic Records. As the fourth Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology, the album's lyrics focus on the titular Great Milenko, an illusionist who tries to trick individuals into greed and other such sins.\n\nThe album was recorded and initially released by the Disney-owned record label Hollywood Records. The album was taken off shelves by Hollywood hours after its release, in response to criticism from the Southern Baptist Church of decisions that the church believed did not reflect Disney's family-friendly image, although Disney claimed that the album was released due to an oversight by its review board. After Hollywood terminated the group's contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with Island Records (whose parent at the time, PolyGram, distributed Hollywood releases in North America), which agreed to release the album as it was originally intended. Island then re-released the album on August 12, 1997.\n\nThe music of \"The Great Milenko\" features a rap rock sound and features guest appearances by popular rock stars Alice Cooper, Steve Jones and Slash. Although the album was poorly received by critics, it debuted at number 63 on the \"Billboard\" charts, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nFollowing the 1994 release of the album \"Ringmaster\", Insane Clown Posse started to attract a strong local following in Detroit, Michigan. The group began selling out large clubs such as St. Andrew's Hall and the State Theatre, and drew the attention of major record label Jive Records. The next year, Insane Clown Posse signed with the label Battery, a subsidiary Jive Records. Battery/Jive released the duo's third studio album, \"Riddle Box\" (1995), but showed little interest in promoting the album. The group's manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the Disney's Hollywood Records label, which reportedly paid $1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.\n\nThe expansion of the Juggalo fanbase into its own culture inspired Insane Clown Posse to write the songs \"What Is A Juggalo?\" and \"Down With The Clown\" for this album.\n\nThe group started recording \"The Great Milenko\" in 1996, and Violent J began thinking of a title for the album shortly after. Bruce later came up with the title \"The Great Milenko\". Bruce also admitted that he had always liked the ring name of professional wrestler Dean Simon (\"Dean Malenko\"), because he felt that the name Malenko had a \"carnival\" sound to it. Believing that he had created the name himself, Bruce later realized that he had unwittingly used the nickname of Dean's father, Boris \"The Great\" Malenko.\n\nThe band wanted to include famous rock stars on the album. Julian Raymond, the artists and repertoire representative for Hollywood Records, contacted Slash, Steve Jones, and Alice Cooper. Slash, who was a self-professed fan of the band's music, reportedly only asked for Wild Irish Rose as payment for his contributions. Bruce, who knew very little about the Sex Pistols or Steve Jones, declined to show up at the studio when Jones played his guitar part for \"Piggy Pie\". Although not knowing much about Alice Cooper either, Bruce decided to fly to Arizona and coach Cooper on his parts. Bruce and Clark also met George Clinton, who was staying in the same hotel, and recorded his voice in his room, but it did not fit anywhere on the album.\n\nAfter the recording sessions were finished, executives at Hollywood Records—and the label's parent company, Disney—expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. Disney requested that the tracks \"The Neden Game\", \"Under the Moon\", and \"Boogie Woogie Wu\" be removed because of lyrics referencing abuse of women, rape and murder, and the slaughter of children, respectively. Disney also asked that the lyrics of \"Piggy Pie\" be changed, due to lyrics about murdering police officers. Disney threatened not to release the album if their requests were not met. Begrudgingly, Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney's requests. The uncensored version of \"Piggy Pie\" was later released on \"Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\". After recording was finalized, the duo planned to go on a national tour with House of Krazees and Myzery as its opening acts. Several songs were recorded with the intention of releasing them on \"The Great Milenko\". One such song, \"House of Wonders\", was recorded but was later released on \"Mutilation Mix\" (1997) and \"Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\" (1998).\n\n\"The Great Milenko\" is the fourth Joker's Card in Insane Clown Posse's Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker's Cards. Each of the six Joker's Cards relate to a specific character — an entity of the Dark Carnival — that tries to \"save the human soul\" by showing the wickedness inside of one's self.\n\nThis Joker's Card is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into acts of greed, envy, and lust. The Card ultimately issues a warning against such acts of sin, and enlightens listeners that The Great Milenko is a part of every individual, and that they have the power to fall under his illusions or cast his hoaxes aside.\n\n\"The Great Milenko\" featured more rock influences than previous Insane Clown Posse albums, including an introduction performed by Alice Cooper and guitar tracks performed by Steve Jones (on \"Piggie Pie\"), and Slash (on \"Halls of Illusions\"). Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, in his review of \"The Amazing Jeckel Brothers\" (1999) that, \"\"The Great Milenko\" [...] was targeted at white-boy, adolescent metalheads -- really, how could any album that contained guest spots from Alice Cooper, Slash, Steve Jones and Legs Diamond be anything else?\"\n\nInsane Clown Posse hired renowned Detroit record producer and DJ Mike E. Clark to produce the record. Clark made the album sound more rock-oriented, as opposed to the duo's earlier material, which featured a more prominent hip-hop sound. To create the record, Clark utilized standard hip hop techniques such as record scratching, and mixed them with elements of rock and heavy metal.\n\nAccording to the group's mythology, The Great Milenko is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into greed and other such sins. He takes out the worst in an individual and creates powerful illusions in an attempt to cause them to become hedonistic and greedy. An honorable individual must fight his magic in order to make it to Shangri-La (as revealed in the track \"Pass Me By\").\n\nThe album's themes mostly revolve around those of death, morality, and everyday decisions. For instance, \"How Many Times?\" talks about annoying traffic jams and other everyday-life inconveniences. \"Piggy Pie\" references the Three Little Pigs and tells Violent J's story of murdering three kinds of people: an incest-prone redneck, cops who wrongly arrest and harass people, and stuck-up wealthy people. \"Under the Moon\" tells the tale of a man convicted after killing a man who tried to rape his girlfriend. \"Boogie Woogie Wu\" is told from the perspective of the boogie man and talks about the slaughter of children. The \"Neden Game\" takes the form of a \"Dating Game\"-esque show, albeit with added misogynistic banter for humor. Finally, the lyrics to \"Hellalujah\" target money-hungry preachers.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album: \"Halls of Illusions\" and \"Hokus Pokus.\" \"Halls of Illusions\" was the first single released in 1997. The single peaked at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart, and its accompanying music video peaked at number one on The Box video request channel. The album's second single, \"Hokus Pokus\", was released in June 1997. In 1998, it peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nInitially, Hollywood Records shipped 100,000 copies of \"The Great Milenko\" to various record stores. During a music-store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching number 63 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The group was also informed that its in-store signings and 25-city nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the music video for \"Halls of Illusions\" (which had reached number one on The Box video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church at the time because of Disney's promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland, in addition to producing and distributing the gay-themed television sitcom \"Ellen\". The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values. Although Abbiss told the press that Disney had stopped production of \"The Great Milenko\" to avoid further controversy, Disney claimed instead that the release of the album was an oversight by their review board, and that the album \"did not fit the Disney image\" because of its \"inappropriate\" lyrics, which they claimed were offensive to women. Although Hollywood Records had ordered record stores to return shipments of the now-deleted album, many record stores refused, including the Michigan-based Harmony House where 1,700 CDs were sold in 36 stores after the termination order.\n\nAfter the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, labels such as Interscope and Geffen Records wanted to sign the group, but Island Records' Chris Blackwell came to the group's rescue and agreed to release \"The Great Milenko\" as it was originally intended. As part of the deal, Island also agreed to rerelease the group's first two Joker's Card albums. \"Milenko\" was released in four colors: red, green, purple, and gold. Each color had a different secret message that would help reveal the title of the fifth Joker's Card, \"The Amazing Jeckel Brothers\". Music videos were filmed for \"Halls of Illusions\", \"How Many Times?\", and \"Piggy Pie.\" An unofficial music video for \"Down with the Clown\" was featured on the home-video release \"Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling Volume 1\". A music video for the Headhuntaz Remix of \"Hokus Pokus\" was produced after the release of the album. The video featured appearances by Twiztid and Myzery. Blackwell left Island Records shortly after the group released \"Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\", and the merger of PolyGram into Universal Music Group (which owned Interscope and Geffen) affected the way the label handled its next Joker's Card release. Despite the rough start, \"The Great Milenko\" has sold well over the years. On May 5, 1998, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A year later, on April 21, 1999, the album was certified platinum for shipments of over one million copies. As of 2007, the album has sold over 1.7 million copies in the United States.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" music critic David Browne gave the record a C-minus rating: \"[With] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly metal-rap tunes, the album feels oddly dated.\" AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that \"The Great Milenko\" is \"the sort of record you wish they would take off the stereo at excruciating frat parties.\" In \"The Great Rock Discography\", Martin Charles Strong gave the album five out of ten stars. The album received two out of five stars in \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\", in which Ben Sisario identified it as the album in which \"the group came into its own\".\n\nAlthough the reviews were mostly negative, some critics complimented the album's improved sound over its precursors. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album was \"a better record than [its] predecessors, boasting a tougher sound and some actual hooks, without losing the juvenile vulgarity that pleased their following\", and added that \"it is better than the rest of ICP's work.\" David Browne said that \"\"Milenko\" is better produced than the duo's earlier output (Slash grinds out metal chords on \"Halls of Illusions\"), and \"Pass Me By\" is a genuinely melodic song.\" In 2009, Fangoria named \"The Great Milenko\" an iconic horrorcore album.\n\n"}

While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. AFP/IPDS, PostScript, PCL), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of PDF, HTML, or XML.\n\nVariable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:\n\nVariable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document. In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires. Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos. Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats. The possibilities are vast.\n\nThe variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production. However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed. For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.\n\nMany organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document. This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require. When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.\n\nVariable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a personal computer to a mainframe system. However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.\n\nThe term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term \"variable-data printing\", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop 'mail merge', to complex mainframe applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.\n\n"}

It is also a highly-recognized think tank, ranked among the top ten in the world.\n\nNamed in honor of President Woodrow Wilson, the only President of the United States to hold a PhD, its mission is \"to commemorate the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson by: providing a link between the world of ideas and the world of policy; and fostering research, study, discussion, and collaboration among a full spectrum of individuals concerned with policy and scholarship in national and world affairs.\"\n\nThe Center was established within the Smithsonian Institution, but it has its own board of trustees, composed both of government officials and of individuals from private life appointed by the President of the United States. The Center's director and staff include scholars, publishers, librarians, administrators, and support staff, responsible to the trustees for carrying out the mission of the Center. The trustees and staff are advised by a group of private citizens called the Wilson Council. Interns, usually undergraduate or graduate students, support the activities of visiting scholars and staff while learning the business of top-level research.\n\nMost of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study. These programs and projects organize and host conferences and seminars, and support many kinds of research, communication, and publication on topics relevant to their areas.\n\nThe Center also publishes a digital magazine, the \"Wilson Quarterly\".\n\nIn 2013 and again in 2014, the Wilson Center was ranked by the Go To Think Tank Report at the University of Pennsylvania as one of the top ten think tanks in the world. The 2014 rankings named the Wilson Center as 5th best overall in the United States, 4th in the world for international development, 8th in the world for international affairs, and 27th in defense and national security. It was also ranked the \"#1 think tank to watch\" in the United States and 11th best-managed think tank in the world.\n\nThe Center is a public–private partnership. Approximately one-third of the Center's operating funds come annually from an appropriation from the U.S. government, and the Center itself is housed in a wing of the Ronald Reagan Building, a federal office building where the Center enjoys a 30-year rent-free lease. The remainder of the Center's funding comes from foundations, grants and contracts, corporations, individuals, endowment income, and subscriptions. Because of its historic reliance on congressional appropriations, the Center posts on its website a Plan for Federal Funding Hiatus.\n\nThe Board of Trustees, currently led by Chairman Frederic V. Malek, are appointed to six-year terms by the President of the United States. Trustees serve on various committees including executive, audit and finance, development, investment, fellowship, and investment policy.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nEach year, the Woodrow Wilson Center gives out several awards recognizing members of the community who have shown an outstanding commitment to President Woodrow Wilson's dream of integrating politics, scholarship, and policy for the common good. Recipients fall into two award categories, those receiving the award for Public Service, and those receiving the award for Corporate Citizenship. Awardees are selected by the Board, and distributed at dinners benefitting the Center in different locations each year.\n\nMost of the Center's staff form specialized programs and projects covering broad areas of study. There are approximately 14 programs, some of which are described below.\n\nEstablished in 1999, the Wilson Center's Africa Program focuses on international affairs issues as affect Africa, conducts programmatic work to train and mentor rising leaders in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and facilitates meetings between the policymaking communities of Washington, D.C., and Africa. Its current director is Monde Muyangawa.\n\nThe Wilson Center's Asia Program analyzes the politics, policy, culture, and issues of the broader Asia-Pacific region, encompassing a region stretching from Afghanistan to Japan.\n\nSince its founding in 2006, the Brazil Institute has focused on analyzing and convening panels to discuss Brazilian politics, economics, and the country's global profile.\n\nFounded in 2001, the Canada Institute analyzes Canada-U.S. relations, trade, and Canada's international role as polar ice melts.\n\nThe Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) supports the full and prompt release of historical materials by governments on all sides of the Cold War, seeking to integrate new sources, materials and perspectives from the former Eastern Bloc with the historiography of the Cold War. In particular, it disseminates new information and perspectives from previously inaccessible sources from the former Communist world on the history of the Cold War.\n\nIn 2011, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars partnered with East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, to launch the ECNU-Wilson Center Cold War Studies Initiative, it is supported by the Wilson Center's flagship Cold War International History Project (CWIHP) and ECNU's Cold War International Studies Center, the first Cold War Studies center in China.\n\nThe Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP) was founded in 1994 to explore the connections among environmental, health, and population dynamics and their links to conflict, human insecurity, and foreign policy.\n\nThe History and Public Policy Program (HAPP) at the Woodrow Wilson Center focuses on the relationship between history and policy-making and seeks to foster open, informed and non-partisan dialogue on historically relevant issues.\n\nThe Kennan Institute (KI), founded in 1974 as a division of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is committed to improving American understanding of Russia and the successor states to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Kissinger Institute analyzes the political, economic, historical, and cultural relationships between the United States and China. Named after Henry A. Kissinger, who as secretary of state was instrumental in opening diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China. Its current director is Robert Daly.\n\nThe Wilson Center's Mexico Institute conducts original research and analysis on Mexico's economy, convenes meetings, and proposes public policies. The institute focuses on five key areas: Mexico's security and rule of law, economic competitiveness (both of Mexico and the transnational economies along the border), migration, the U.S.-Mexico border, and energy issues.\n\nThe Middle East Program, launched in 1998, analyzes geopolitical, cultural, and social trends in the Middle East and North Africa region. From May 8 until August 21, 2007, Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, then-director of the Middle East Program, was imprisoned in Tehran, Iran, in the Evin Prison. She was released on bail and had her passport returned to her on September 2, 2007. Esfandiari was then permitted to leave Iran. The former director of the Middle East Program is Dr. Henri Barkey.\n\nThe North Korea International Documentation Project translates and disseminates newly declassified documents about North Korea, largely drawing from its former communist allies. The documents are then distributed on the Wilson Center's Digital Archive site and curated in the project's dossier series.\n\nThe Science and Technology Innovation Program (STIP) focuses on understanding bottom-up, public innovation; top-down, policy innovation; and, on supporting responsible and equitable practices at the point where new technology and existing political, social, and cultural processes converge. Many projects focus on the international nature of science and technology, such as the Global Mosquito Alert Consortium and upcoming Earth Challenge 2020 project. Key themes in STIP's work include citizen science; cyber security, through the Digital Futures Project; and serious games, through the Serious Games Initiative.   \n\n\n"}

Twelve episodes were filmed prior to the program's premiere. It first aired on 17 April 2012, the 500th day of the \"financial blockade\" of WikiLeaks, on Russia's state sponsored RT.\n\nThe show is produced by Quick Roll Productions, which was established by Julian Assange with the assistance of Dartmouth Films. It is distributed by Journeyman Pictures and broadcast internationally in English, Arabic, and Spanish by RT and Italian newspaper L'espresso, who both make the program available online. The theme for the show was composed by M.I.A..\n\nAssange stated that it had not been possible to interview Ai Weiwei or Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of RT, told the daily \"Moskovskii Komsomolets\" that Assange will resume making shows and allowing them to be broadcast on Russian television once his legal troubles are over.\n\nIn his \"The New York Times\" blog, Robert Mackey called RT \"a strange partner\" for Assange while Robert Colvile inveighed Assange's show by writing, \"After Wikileaks – and its mission to change the world – collapsed under the weight of its leader’s ego, Assange started hosting a TV show sponsored by that noted friend of freedom, Vladimir Putin.\" In an article for \"The Guardian\", Luke Harding described the show as proof that Assange was a \"useful idiot\". Another article in \"The Guardian\" unrelated to Harding's said that it was doubtful Russian \"revolutionaries\" will make the show's guestlist and reported a tweet by Alexander Lebedev lambasting Assange, tweeting that it was, \"Hard to imagine [a] more miserable final[e] for [a] 'world order challenger' than employee of state-controlled 'Russia Today'.\"\n\nGlenn Greenwald of \"Salon\" magazine praised the show and condemned the detractors writing for \"The New York Times\" and \"The Guardian\". Assange himself wrote a column published as a WikiLeaks press release that parodied some of the criticism.\n\nAt the end of the first season, Tracy Quan wrote an article called \"I Love the Julian Assange Show!\", describing the show as \"addictive, lively, wide-ranging, and informative\".\n\n"}
