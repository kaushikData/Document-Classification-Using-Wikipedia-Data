Written in the 10th century, this chronicle follows the history of Kartli (a core Georgian region known to the Classical authors as Iberia; sometimes archaically referred to all of Georgia) from the earliest times to the 7th century, making a particular focus on Christianization of Georgians by Saint Nino early in the 4th century.\n\nThe autograph of \"The Conversion of Kartli\" (CoK) has not survived and until recently there were only two manuscripts which have been extensively studied. These are the codices of Shatberdi and Chelishi.\n\nThe Shatberdi Codex, the oldest of the extant CoK manuscripts, was copied in 973 under the supervision of the monk John at the Georgian monastery of Shatberdi in what is now northeastern Turkey. It was discovered in 1888 and published in 1890 by the Georgian scholar Ekvtime Taqaishvili. The second variant, Chelishi Codex, so named after a monastery in Georgia where it was found in 1903, was copied in the 14th or 15th century. Following the 1975 fire at Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt, at least two hitherto unknown variants of CoK were discovered among a large number of Georgian manuscripts mainly dated to the 9th/10th century. They have not yet been completely studied, though.\n\nThe Shatberdi and Chelishi codices are basically linguistically similar and nearly contemporaneous. The latter, however, contains substantial variations including a number of elaborated passages. Its narrative is longer, but somewhat disfigured orthographically and phonetically by an anonymous copyist. Many passages of the Shatberdi Codex are more informative, but these details are probably later insertions as suggested by the occurrence of the word Baghdad, a post-8th century toponym.\n\nThe Shatberdi codex cites some of its sources (such as \"a brief account of the conversion of Kartli\" by Grigol the Deacon) most of which did not survive and are otherwise unknown. Modern specialists have also proposed Pseudo-Callisthenes’ apocryphal Alexander romance and Alexander of Cyprus’ \"Chronica\" as possible sources used by the authors of CoK. The work itself was exploited and some of its components were reworked by the later Georgian authors such as Leontius of Ruisi (11th century) and Arsenius the Metaphrast (12th century).\n\nFor all its contradictions – the elements of folklore, and religious reminiscences – \"The Conversion of Kartli\" is an essential historical source. It further possesses a detailed relative and absolute chronology, unparallel in hagiographic and patristic literature of Georgia. The noticeable influence of CoK on subsequent Georgian historical works proves the crucial role this work played in establishing a sense of Christian identity of medieval Georgia.\n\n\"The Conversion of Kartli\" consists of two major components. The first one is conventionally known as \"The Chronicle\" (ქრონიკა, \"k’ronika\"), a brief history of Kartli from the mythic expedition by Alexander the Great into Georgian lands down to the 7th century. Its core text, The Conversion of Kartli, from which the corpus derives its title, relates the story of proselytizing mission by St. Nino, who is also the subject of the last component of CoK, the hagiographic \"Life of Nino\" (ცხოვრება წმიდა ნინოსი, \"ts’xovreba ts’mida ninosi\"). The basic text is accompanied by the lists of the kings, presiding princes and prelates of Kartli.\n\n"}
{"id": "167810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167810", "title": "Defining vocabulary", "text": "Defining vocabulary\n\nA defining vocabulary is a list of words used by lexicographers to write dictionary definitions. The underlying principle goes back to Samuel Johnson's notion that words should be defined using 'terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained', and a defining vocabulary provides the lexicographer with a restricted list of high-frequency words which can be used for producing simple definitions of any word in the dictionary.\n\nDefining vocabularies are especially common in English monolingual learner's dictionaries. The first such dictionary to use a defining vocabulary was the \"New Method English Dictionary\" by Michael West and James Endicott (published in 1935), a small dictionary written using a defining vocabulary of just 1,490 words. When the \"Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English\" was first published in 1978, its most striking feature was its use of a 2,000-word defining vocabulary based on Michael West's General Service List, and since then defining vocabularies have become a standard component of monolingual learner's dictionaries for English and for other languages.\n\nUsing a defining vocabulary is not without its problems, and some scholars have argued that it can lead to definitions which are insufficiently precise or accurate, or that words in the list are sometimes used in non-central meanings. The more common view, however, is that the disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages, and there is some empirical research which supports this position. Almost all English learner's dictionaries have a defining vocabulary, and these range in size between 2000 and 3000 words, for example:\n\nIt is possible that, in electronic dictionaries at least, the need for a controlled defining vocabulary will disappear. In some online dictionaries, such as the \"Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners\", every word in every definition is hyperlinked to its own entry, so that a user who is unsure of the meaning of a word in a definition can immediately see the definition for the word that is causing problems. This strategy only works, however, if all the definitions are written in reasonably accessible language, which argues for some sort of defining vocabulary to be maintained in dictionaries aimed at language learners.\n\nIntermediate-level language learners are likely to have receptive familiarity with most words in a typical 2,000-word defining vocabulary. To accommodate beginning-level learners, the defining vocabulary can be divided into two or more layers, where words in one layer are explained using only the simpler words from the previous layers. This strategy is used in the \"Learn These Words First\" multi-layer dictionary, where a 360-word beginning-level defining vocabulary is used to explain a 2,000-word intermediate-level defining vocabulary, which in turn is used to define the remaining words in the dictionary.\n\n\n"}

Both buildings exhibit a variety of Horse-drawn vehicles, including carriages, trade wagons, stagecoaches, and sleighs.\n\nElectra Havemeyer Webb’s desire to provide a suitable setting for the carriage collection of her father-in-law, Dr. William Seward Webb, provided the inspiration for founding Shelburne Museum. She searched Vermont for a building to house these fine carriages and found a unique horseshoe-shaped dairy barn near Georgia, Vermont. When the owner declined to sell the barn, Electra Webb directed her staff to create a copy of the structure. Over a two-year period they located, moved, and assembled hand-hewn beams from twelve Vermont barns and stone from two gristmills to construct their own horseshoe barn on museum grounds.\n\nCompleted in July 1949, the massive structure, which is 238 ½ feet long and wide, incorporated 745 timbers, posts, and braces, of plank and other boarding, and of slate. Carpenters specially cut new clapboards for the exterior siding with an up-and-down saw \"(see Scroll Saw)\" to recreate the markings found on the original building. \n\nIn 1957, after the addition of 150 more vehicles to the transportation collection, the museum constructed the Horseshoe Barn Annex to exhibit key examples from the collection using a combination of old and new materials.\n\nIt appears that there are very few horseshoe-shaped barns in the United States. Of the two documented horseshoe barns in Vermont, only one still stands today. The Shelburne Museum houses the only remaining horseshoe barn in Vermont; the Georgia, Vermont barn it was modeled after burned to the ground. There is still a road named Horseshoe Barn Road in Saint Albans, Vermont.\n\nOther known horseshoe-shaped barns are:\n\nThe museum's carriage collection began with the vehicles owned by Dr. William Seward Webb and his wife Lila Vanderbilt Webb. Today it has come to include 225 horse-drawn vehicles. Since many of these vehicles came straight from their respective owners, many still retain their original upholstery and decoration.\n\nCarriages and coaches began to be widely used in Britain during the 17th century. However, real progress in carriage building was not made until the late 18th century, when Royal Mail coach service began. For the first time many carriages were designed for comfort and speed and were made alike, using interchangeable parts. Soon carriage driving became the fashionable way to travel, although for many years the cost of vehicles restricted their use primarily to the nobility and upper classes. \n\nThe manufacture of horse-drawn vehicles advanced more quickly in 19th-century America, where vehicles quickly became available to people of every social class. By the late 19th century, American coach builders had even developed light and practical vehicles that were available to the general public at low prices through mail order houses such as Sears and Roebuck. An elegant runabout made by Brewster & Co., America’s finest coach builder, cost $425 in 1900; a runabout sold by Sears was $24.95.\n\nShelburne Museum’s collection of horse-drawn vehicles ranges from examples of 19th and early 20th century carriages, farm and trade wagons, stagecoaches, and sleighs; early firefighting equipment and almost every other type of vehicle used in New England in the 19th century. One of the most comprehensive collections in the country, the museum is particularly important because most of the vehicles retain their original upholstery, lamps, and decorative finishes. \n\nMany of the museum's finest vehicles originally belonged to Dr. William Seward Webb, father-in-law of Electra Havemeyer Webb, including a number of elegant carriages and coaches by New York’s Brewster & Co. and a remarkable pair of custom-made vehicles – a caleche and a satin-trimmed Berlin – by Million et Guiet of Paris.\n\nRural Americans were often too busy to travel during the warm months, when farm chores kept them close to home. Winter brought more leisure time. Snow could be packed down with horse-drawn rollers to form a far smoother surface than was available on dirt roads at other times of the year. Sleighs were much easier to build and repair than wheeled vehicles; a home craftsperson without specialized training could construct and maintain them. For these reasons, the typical northern farm family owned three sleighs for every wheeled vehicle it kept.\n\nSleighs echoed wheeled vehicles in form. Some wheeled vehicles, like the museum’s hearse, could be converted from wheels to runners as the seasons changed. The museum’s sleighs range from small and simple homemade wooden cutters to elaborate, multi-passenger surreys, caleches, and victorias. The collection also includes a stage sleigh, a school bus sleigh, a butcher’s delivery sleigh and a police ambulance and paddy wagon sleigh.\n\nMulti-passenger stagecoaches and omnibuses provided public transportation for travelers within and between cities, from train stations to hotels, and on sight seeing trips. Businesses transported goods by horse, often using wagons and sleights that advertised their wares with decorative pictures and signage. Commercial vehicles in the museum’s collection include a Concord stagecoach used to transport hotel guests in the White Mountains, a butcher’s wagon complete with hanging scales and meat hooks, a Maine druggist’s patent medicine wagon and a Pennsylvania Conestoga wagon, used to haul produce from rural farms to city markets.\n\nVehicles were also essential to firefighters, who needed to transport water and equipment quickly. A variety of early firefighting vehicles are represented in the museum’s collection. The horse was a latecomer to firefighting, not pressed widely into service until the 1870s. To save precious time, horses were kept in the firehouse. Their stalls had break-away chains and, at the sound of the alarm, the horses raced to their places in front of the waiting equipment. Their collars and harnesses were suspended from the ceiling, poised like spiders in a web, ready to drop at a touch. \n\nThe steam-driven pumper, the hose wagon, and the hood-and-ladder truck became the three major horse-drawn firefighting vehicles. However, it was the steamer, usually driven with horses harnessed two or three abreast, that provided the most spectacular sight as it flew down the street with smoke pouring from the funnel of its boiler, building up a head of steam to run the pumps.\n\n\n\n"}

The term was coined in Latin by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his \"Novum Organum\", one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science.\n\nThe term is one of four such \"idols\" which represent \"idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein\". Because of them, \"truth can hardly find entrance\" in people's minds, and Bacon predicted that even after the \"instauration of the sciences\" which he proposes, they will \"meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\". They are in other words problems for science, and successful modern scientific method will need to try to avoid them.\n\nBesides \"idola fori\", there are also \"idola tribus\" (Idols of the Tribe, coming from human nature itself), \"idola specus\", (Idols of the cave, coming from the tendencies of particular individuals or groups of people) and \"idola theatri\" (Idols of the theatre, caused by the influence of philosophers and systems of thought). Together the four idols are referred to as the Idols of the Mind (\"idola mentis\").\n\nBacon said that the Idols of the Market Place were given this name by him \"on account of the commerce and consort of men there. For it is by discourse that men associate, and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding\".\n\nBacon said that there were two basic kinds of Idol of the Market Place:\n\n\nAccording to Bacon, it is the second class, \"which springs out of a faulty and unskillful abstraction\", is \"intricate and deeply rooted\". This is because it has to do with the way words themselves can guide thinking. Nevertheless, there are \"certain degrees of distortion and error\". Bacon says that \"some notions are of necessity a little better than others, in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.\"\n\nBacon recognized that the normal approach of \"learned men\" was to be careful about definitions and explanations, setting the matter right \"in some things\". But nevertheless, \"words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.\"\n\nThat errors inevitably come from the imperfect generalizations in natural languages, and that philosophers or scientists must be careful of this danger, is an ancient theme of philosophy. It was for example a problem appreciated by Aristotle, and had been noted by William of Occam in the Middle Ages. But Bacon's \"idola fori\" is the best-known example of the increased seriousness given by early modern humanists to problematic uses of language. After Bacon, this concern was further emphasized by authors such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.\n\n"}

Within these fields he has published several books in Spanish, French and English.\n\nJosé Manuel Losada holds a PhD from the University of the Sorbonne (1990) and a habilitation as Research Director (HDR) from the University of Nancy II (1998). He has been Visiting Scholar at Harvard University and the University of Montreal, is a member of the SCR at Oxford University (St John's College), and is an Adjunct Professor at the University of Navarre. Since 1992 he has been a lecturer at Complutense University of Madrid, where he teaches courses on French literature, comparative literature, and literature and religion. Losada is the principal investigator in several R&D projects related to myth criticism.\n\nJ.M. Losada is the founder and editor of \"Amaltea, Journal of Myth Criticism\"  (2008 –), a prestigious academic journal with a focus on analyzing the reception of ancient, medieval and modern myths in contemporary arts and literature. He is also founder and president of \"Asteria, International Association for Myth Criticism\",\na nonprofit cultural association with an aim to promote research on myth in contemporary arts and literature. Furthermore, he is the founder and director of \"Acis, a Myth Criticism Research Group\", a group which brings together numerous academics and doctoral researchers with an interest in analyzing the contemporary relevance of myth from an interdisciplinary perspective. With the support of the members of these groups, Losada has coordinated many international conferences, outreach activities (\"Mythological Walks\" programmed in the Madrid Science Week), and international art competitions on the subject of myth.\n\nHis academic production includes some twenty books and over two hundred articles published in academic books and journals.\n\nLosada defines myth thus:\n\nThis syncretic, expansive concept of myth allows the critic to embark on innovative analysis and synthesis of mythical narratives and their diverse processes. Myth criticism –a term coined by Gilbert Durand– is the study of myth; Losada's main contribution to literary theory is related to the updating of these studies into what he calls \"cultural myth criticism\". While still keeping an eye on the historical development of the field, this \"new myth criticism\" must develop an epistemology that enables the comprehension and elucidation of a global and imaginary reality, with an aim to better understand contemporary culture. This discipline develops out of the main hermeneutic principles embraced by J.M. Losada:\n\n\nConsequently with the last point, myth criticism is seen to apply to all forms of cultural expression, though not abandoning the analysis of the symbolic imaginary. This new myth criticism looks at mythical representations in such diverse fields as literature, film and television, drama, sculpture, painting, videogames, music, dance, journalism, the Internet and all other media of artistic and cultural expression:\n\nCultural myth criticism has proved to be particularly useful in the analysis of contemporary myths, the study of which necessarily differs considerably from previous work. Losada posits three distinct main factors or \"logics\" that must be taken into account in order to properly analyze myth in contemporary culture: the logic of globalization, the logic of immanence, and the logic of consumerism. These three factors modify myth’s traditional character, and must be carefully considered in order to understand both the current mythical epiphany and contemporary culture.\n\nGlobalization –particularly the logic of globalization, without which it is impossible to conceive our world– has tremendously impacted mythology. That is why cultural myth criticism must start out from two unquestionable realities: in the first place, that new technological platforms are now widely available to the general public; secondly, that traditional myths evolve, and therefore require new perspectives for analysis.\n\nAdaptations and rewriting of traditional myths, as well as the creation of new myths, compel researchers to widen their approach in order to adapt to the globalized realities of today. Myth criticism must take into account that information technologies are nowadays the source of a new cosmovision, and are strongly involved in the production of ideologies that reconfigure both the perception and the creation of art and literature.\n\nTraditionally, all religions have contained myths which, in the same way as their message and doctrine, were related to the concept of transcendence. Myth was a vehicle for cultural, social, political and ethical values. One of the objectives of myth criticism is to articulate adequate analytical tools to understand the transcendent element of each myth.\nCultural context has changed tremendously, especially from the 20th century onwards. According to Losada, at the moment \"the immanent cosmovision –the unspoken acceptance of a non-transcendental horizon in the social and individual imaginary– is prevalent in contemporary Western culture.\" \n\nIt is a job for cultural myth criticism to explore all the ideological perspectives that contemporary immanence projects onto traditional transcendence. The concept of immanence must be taken into account in order to analyze new forms of myth. In accordance with this change in ideological paradigm, mythical rewritings are mostly subversive.\n\nThe link between consumer society and its impact on mythical themes stems from one fact: myth has become a consumer good, even a basic and generic product, subject to commercial transactions and the supply and demand model. Losada explains that advertisers try to generate associations between their products and cultural myths that convey desirable values.\n\nAn inherent aspect of consumer society is the ephemeral nature of those celebrities and objects that undergo a mythification process and are turned into \"new myths\". This is remarkably significant in the case of film stars or musicians, who are often invested with a halo of exceptionality which they then lose as quickly as they acquired it.\n\n\n"}

Some Thruway Motorcoach stops include train stations that are not served by Amtrak trains (and occasionally any trains at all).\n\nAll current (and most former) Amtrak train stops (stations) and Thruway Motorcoach stops have a three-letter station code (sometimes also referred to as a city code). These codes do not necessarily correspond with the list of IATA-indexed train stations or the three-character IATA airport codes, although many are the same. Amtrak began using station codes in 1992, so stations closed or removed from all Amtrak service prior to 1992 will not have had a station code assigned. The station code \"ENP\" is used for \"any stop en route, not otherwise specified\". If a station code was used by more than one train station, each station is listed. However, if a station code was used for a Thruway Motorcoach stop that has changed locations, only information for the current location (or most recent location, if the stop is no longer in service) is included in the notes, unless one of the locations was an actual train station.\n\nRidership data and station ownership is from Amtrak's Great American Stations website. The ownership of many stations is shared, with one entity owning one or more of the following: the facility itself, the parking lot, the passenger platform, and the train tracks. In some instances, the owner of the bus station used for a Thruway Motorcoach stop is not the same as the connection service provider.\n\nWhile many stations do not offer full services (ticketing, baggage, etc.), all train stations, unless otherwise indicated, have an indoor waiting area. Some stations and Thruway Motorcoach stops, as indicated, are conditional or flag stops, with trains only stopping at the station if reservations for a pickup or drop off are made in advance. Some stations, also as indicated, are seasonal with trains or buses stopping only during certain times of the year.\n\nAlthough Amtrak operations are almost exclusively limited to the United States, there are three exceptions (all of which are in Canada). The first exception includes the six northwesternmost stations (in Ontario) served by the \"Maple Leaf\". (The \"Maple Leaf\" is a joint operation between Amtrak and Via Rail Canada. The \"International Limited\" was also a joint Via Rail Canada/Amtrak operation before it was discontinued in 2004.)

H. Mathews (1931) or Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary (1943), edited by the Australian Congregationalist missionary Robert Henry Mathews (1877-1970), was the standard Chinese-English dictionary for decades. Mathews originally intended his dictionary to be a revision of Frederick W. Baller's out-of-print (1900) \"An Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary, Compiled for the China Inland Mission\", but ended up compiling a new dictionary. Mathews copied, without any acknowledgment, from Herbert Allen Giles' (1892, 1912) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\". \n\nThe 1,250-page first edition contained 7,783 Chinese character head entries, alphabetically collated by romanized syllabic order in modified Wade-Giles system, and includes 104,000 words and phrases taken from the classics, general literature, and news media. Owing to a World War II shortage of Chinese-English dictionaries, Harvard University Press published a revised American edition (1943) \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\", which included 15,000 corrections, revisions, and new examples.\n\nThe Australian Congregationalist missionary and lexicographer Robert Henry Mathews was born in 1877 in Flemington, Victoria. After studying lithography at the Working Men's College of Melbourne, Mathews started a printing business, but in 1906 he abandoned it to join the China Inland Mission (CIM) and become a missionary. Mathews first sailed to China in 1908, and the CIM assigned him to stations in Henan, Anhui, where he became interested in studying the regional varieties of Chinese, and Sichuan.\n\nIn 1928, Mathews was assigned to the China Inland Mission headquarters in Shanghai, where he could fully utilize his printing and Chinese linguistic skills. They commissioned him to revise two out-of-print China Inland Mission publications by Frederick W. Baller, the (1900) \"Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary\" and (1900) \"Mandarin Primer\". Robert Mathews and his wife Violet worked intensively to complete the (1931) \"Chinese-English Dictionary\" in only 3 years (he calls it a \"rush job\"), and then, for westerners seeking a \"working knowledge\" of Chinese, the (1938) \"Kuoyü Primer: Progressive Studies in the Chinese National Language\" in 7 years during the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War (Brooks 2008). In 1943, Japanese occupation troops interned Mathews, commandeered the CIM compound in Shanghai to use as their headquarters, and destroyed both the dictionary printing plates and Mathews' manuscripts and proofs for a revised edition. \n\nThe 1931 first edition \"A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews\" began as a revision of Baller's (1900) \"Analytical Dictionary\", but ended up as \"a 'new' dictionary\" (Dunn 1997: 77). Robert Mathew's preface (1931: vi) says that in the 30 years since Baller's outdated dictionary, the \"influx of modern inventions and the advance of scientific knowledge\" in China have introduced many neologisms. Consequently Mathews compiled a replacement dictionary, keeping in mind Baller's original objective (1900: iii), \"to supply the demand for a dictionary at once portable and inexpensive and at the same time sufficiently large to meet the wants of an ordinary student.\" Mathews' Chinese title is \"Maishi Han-Ying da cidian\" 麥氏漢英大辭典 \"Mai's Chinese-English dictionary\".\n\nInstead of adopting the usual Wade-Giles system for romanizing Chinese pronunciation, Baller created his own system, now referred to as Baller's system or the China Inland Mission system. Another shortcoming of Baller's dictionary was inconsistent treatment of Chinese varietal pronunciations, furnishing \"the sounds of characters as given in West China\" (Southwestern Mandarin and Chang-Du dialect) and ignoring \"spoken in the south-eastern (Yong and Peng 2008: 390).\n\nAfter Japanese troops in Shanghai destroyed the Mathews' dictionary original printing plates, the lack of copies became an urgent matter for English-speaking Allies of World War II. The Harvard–Yenching Institute said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had \"grown from chronic to acute\", and selected Mathews' lexicon as one of two \"practical dictionaries\" to revise and reprint for \"the immediate demands of American students\". Both photolithographic reproductions were retitled: Henry Courtenay Fenn's (1926) \"The Five Thousand Dictionary\" was \"Fenn's Pocket Dictionary\" (November 1942) and Mathews' \"A Chinese-English Dictionary…\" was \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" (March 1943), which was a \"pirated\" edition since Mathews never received any payment (Stock 1956: 424). The revised edition made a total of 15,000 changes to the original, \"errors have been corrected, pronunciations and definitions revised, and new entries inserted\" (1943: v). In addition, the Chinese-American linguist Yuen Ren Chao wrote an Introduction on Pronunciation. The dictionary was reduced in size from 8x11 to 7x10 inches. In 1944, Harvard University Press also published \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary Revised English Index\". By 1984, the Press had sold more than 45,000 copies of Mathew's dictionary (Hall 1986: 84).\n\nUp through the 1970s, English-speaking students of Chinese relied chiefly on Mathews' \"Chinese-English Dictionary\" (Norman 1988: 173). Scholars published several companion pieces for \"Mathews\". Tse-tsung Chow (周策縱) of the University of Wisconsin compiled (1972) \"A New Index to Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary, Based on the \"Chung\" system for Arranging Chinese Characters\", referring to the obsolescent \"zhōng\" 衷 indexing system based on character strokes. Olov Bertil Anderson of Lund University published (1972) \"A companion volume to R. H. Mathews' Chinese-English dictionary\", which went into a 335-page third revision in 1988. Harry M. Branch developed a Five Willows system and published (1973) \"Mathews' and Fenn re-indexed\" (Yang 1985: 290). Raymond Huang (1981) wrote a descriptive \"Mandarin Pronunciation Explained with Diagrams: A Companion to R. H. Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\".\n\nMathews' Chinese-English dictionary has been reprinted time and again—but without his authorization—and became so prominent that it is often simply called \"Mathews\" (Huck 1986). The English diplomat and sinologist Endymion Wilkinson says Mathews' continues in use, especially by students of Classical Chinese, but for other purposes it has been outdated by excellent dictionaries such as John DeFrancis' (1996) \"ABC Chinese-English Dictionary\" (2000: 93).\n\nIn the history of Chinese lexicography, Mathews' dictionary was the last major compilation in the tradition of Christian missionaries in China. It began with Robert Morrison's (1815-1823) \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\", and continued with Walter Henry Medhurst's (1842) \"Chinese and English Dictionary\" and Samuel Wells Williams' (1874) \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\"—excepting the anti-clericalist Herbert Giles' (1892, 1912) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" (Aylmer 1977: 2). Thus, Mathews' dictionary signifies the end of missionaries compiling Chinese bilingual dictionaries and the beginning of a new era for Chinese and English bilingual dictionaries, \"based on stronger theoretical underpinnings and more sophisticated information technology as from the latter part of the twentieth century\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 390).\n\nMathews not only revised Baller's dictionary but augmented and innovated it as well. Baller included 6,089 character head entries (not including variant characters) and 40,000 word and phrase examples; Mathews increased the number of character entries to \"7,785\" (the last entry is number 7,783 \"yün\" 薀 \"Hippuris or mare's tail.\") and gave over 104,000 usage examples drawn from \"the classics, general literature, magazines, newspapers, advertisements, legal documents, and many other sources\", including technical terms \"relating to motors, electricity, aviation, [and] wireless\" (1931: vi, vii). \n\nMathews changed Baller's romanization system to Wade-Giles, and omitted Baller's explanations of Chinese character construction. For example, saying Number 5047, \"tao\" 道 \"A road; a way; a path…\" comes \"From Nos. 1036; 4771\", that is \"choh\" 辵 or 辶 \"Walking. The 162nd Radical\" and \"sheo\" 首 \"The head. A chief; a leader; first. The 185th Radical.\"\n\nMathews' 1164-page dictionary is collated alphabetically according to the Wade-Giles system of romanization (Dunn 1997: 82). It includes two appendices comprising 61 pages. Appendix A has tables including 29 Chinese dynasties, the celestial stems and earthly branches, Chinese calendar, and solar terms. Appendix B gives a list of the 214 Kangxi radicals, a radical-and-stroke index, and, for the dictionary frustrated user, a helpful list of characters having obscure radicals.\n\nScholars agree that Mathews' dictionary closely resembles Herbert A. Giles' (1912) \"Chinese-English Dictionary\", but differ over the degree of copying. Aylmer (1997: 5) says many definitions \"are taken, without acknowledgment\" from Giles, Wilkinson (2000: 93) says Mathews' is \"based on\" Giles’ dictionary, and (Kroll 2014) says \"heavily indebted\" to it.\n\nMathews occasionally cites Giles' dictionary, such as for the Chinese exonym \"Xiáyōusī\" 黠憂斯 \"Kyrgyz people\". \nThere are many cases where Mathews uses Giles' dictionary without citation, such as the \"Kuí\" 夔 \"legendary dragon-like monster with one foot\". The problem began with Giles' \"Zhuangzi\" translation (1889: 211-2), \"The walrus said to the centipede …\", which notes, \"'Walrus' is of course an analogue. But for the one leg, the description given by a commentator of the creature mentioned in the text applies with significant exactitude.\" Giles' dictionary (1892: 821) translates \"kui\" as \"A one-legged creature; a walrus. Grave; reverential.\" Mathews' dictionary (1931:538) gives \"A one-legged monster; a walrus; Grave, respectful\".\n\nAs noted above, the 1943 second edition \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" adds an introduction on Chinese pronunciation and over 15,000 editorial changes. Furthermore, it gives a 5-page List of Syllabic Headings for quick reference, since the original order of syllables \"is not strictly alphabetic\" (1943: v). Another feature of the new edition is indicating all cases of the unstressed neutral tone.\n\n\"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" has generally been well received but some authors have criticized lexicographical shortcomings. On one hand, Noel Stock, the University of Toledo scholar of Ezra Pound (who refers to Mathews in \"The Cantos\" ), says Mathews' dictionary \"is probably known by every westerner who undertakes Chinese, as well as by many Chinese themselves\" (1956: 424); but on the other, the American scholar of Chinese literature David R. Knechtges says it \"does not always give the correct or current pronunciation for many characters\" (1973: 420).\n\nThe Australian National University historian of China C. P. Fitzgerald says a user of Mathews' dictionary will be struck by \"the deep scholarship, the care and the accuracy of the man who produced this monument of learning\". Mathews has a \"peculiar kind of immortality\" among those who use his work, \"one does not say \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" but simply, 'I must look up that in Mathews'. Mathews, in fact, is a household word to the Sinologist, an indispensable adjunct to his work\" (Stock 1956: 425).\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley sinologist Edward H. Schafer made detailed criticisms of Mathew's dictionary. First, he used it to illustrate how an ideal dictionary of classical Chinese could \"improve on vague, conventional equivalents given in most dictionaries\"; while Mathew's gives \"ch'iung\" 瓊 \"A red stone. Excellent; beautiful.\" (no. 1245), Schafer (1966:202) translates \"rose-gem (cf. rhodonite; rose quartz); carbuncle (possibly an archaic word for \"garnet\" or \"spinel\"; overtones of classic, divine and fairy beauty.\" Second, Schafer (1978) wrote two supplements noting mistranslations and omissions in \"Mathews\", for example (1978: 5), \"fang\" 舫 \"A large boat. Two boats lashed together\" (1814) is more accurately translated \"rectangular, scowlike barge, usually with deckhouse\".\n\nThe American sinologist Jerry Norman (1988: 173-4) says that from a lexicographic point of view, \"Mathews' dictionary was no advance over Giles'\" and its only real advantage was that it was more compact and up-to-date with modern terminology. Otherwise, \"it scrambled together without differentiation words from the earliest texts of Chinese literature with contemporary neologisms\". However, the \"most serious problem\" was its treatment of pronunciation. As Yuen Ren Chao's introduction (1943: ix) points out, Mathews' dictionary uses three systems of pronunciation, giving the example (1943: 431) of \"HSÜAN\" for current Peking pronunciation in Wade-Giles, \"SÜAN\" and Gwoyeu Romatzyh ㄙㄩㄢ in the obsolete (1920) \"Guoyln zidian\" 國音字典 system, and \"Hsüen\" in the China Inland Mission system. The result of using three transcription systems, says Norman, is that although the entries are in alphabetic order, \"it is often frustratingly difficult to find a particular entry unless one is familiar with these various systems of transcription.\"\n\nThe lexicographer Robert Dunn (1997: 82) says that despite the fact that many of Mathews' dictionary entries are outdated or obsolete, some have changed meanings today, and numerous new and current Chinese terms are omitted, the reference work \"will doubtless continue to be one of the most widely used by students of Chinese history, literature, thought, and civilization.\" \n\nPaul W. Kroll, Professor of Chinese at the University of Colorado, says (2014) the most troubling inadequacy of Mathews' dictionary is that \"it indiscriminately mixes together vocabulary of all periods\", from the ancient \"Book of Documents\" to early 20th-century merchant and missionary vocabulary, with the \"unhappy result that students infer all terms and meanings to be equally applicable throughout three thousand years of Chinese history\". Another problem is the seemingly random arrangement of various meanings for any particular word, leading the user to a \"pick-and-choose approach\".\n\n"}

The project is headed by Maryann Martone, co-director of the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research (NCMIR), part of the multi-disciplinary Center for Research in Biological Systems (CRBS), headquartered at UC San Diego. Together with co-principal investigators Jeffrey S. Grethe and Amarnath Gupta, Martone leads a national collaboration that includes researchers at Yale University, the California Institute of Technology, George Mason University, Harvard, and Washington University.\n\nUnlike general search engines, NIF provides much deeper access to a focused set of resources that are relevant to neuroscience, search strategies tailored to neuroscience, and access to content that is traditionally “hidden” from web search engines. The NIF is a dynamic inventory of neuroscience databases, annotated and integrated with a unified system of biomedical terminology] (i.e. NeuroLex). NIF supports concept-based queries across multiple scales of biological structure and multiple levels of biological function, making it easier to search for and understand the results. NIF will also provide a registry through which resources providers can disclose availability of resources relevant to neuroscience research. NIF is not intended to be a warehouse or repository itself, but a means for disclosing and locating resources elsewhere available via the web.\n\nThe NIFSTD, or NIF Standard Ontology contains many of the terms, synonyms and abbreviations useful for neuroscience, as well as dynamic categories such as defined cell classes based on various properties like neuron by neurotransmitter or by circuit role or drugs of abuse according to the National Institutes on Drug Abuse.\nAny term (with associated synonyms) or dynamic category (all terms with their synonyms) can be used to simultaneously query all of the data that NIF currently indexes, please find several examples below:\n\nNIF content can be thought of as a Catalog (NIF Registry) and deep database search (NIF Data Federation)\n\nA listing of current resources can be found at www.neuinfo.org/registry\n\n\nThe idea of NIF is that while scientific databases do have a plethora of interfaces, some quite complex, there should be a uniform way of looking at them and searching though them. This uniform search idea has been extended to services so that developers can take advantage of the work done at NIF to enhance their own applications by gaining access to all of the data available through the NIF interface.\n\nWhen data is made public via NIF, it also becomes immediately available via web services.

It is the third and final installment in the \"Night at the Museum\" trilogy. The film stars Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Dan Stevens and Ben Kingsley. In \"Secret of the Tomb\", security guard Larry Daley must travel to London to return the tablet of Ahkmenrah, an Egyptian artifact which causes the exhibits to come to life, before the magic disappears.\n\nPrincipal photography of \"Secret of the Tomb\" took place from January to May 2014 in London, England and British Columbia, Canada. The film premiered on December 11, 2014, at New York City's Ziegfeld Theater and was released in the United States on December 19, 2014. \"Secret of the Tomb\" grossed over $363 million at the box office. This film was dedicated to the memory of Robin Williams, who died four months before the film's release, and fellow \"Night at the Museum\" actor Mickey Rooney, who died before principal photography was finished.\n\nIn 1938 Egypt, a team of archaeologists discover the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah, including a young Cecil Fredericks, finding the magical Tablet of Ahkmenrah. The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party.\n\nLarry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila, Jed, Octavius, Dexter, Rexy and Laaa have come as well, and Laaa is left to stand guard while the others search the museum, the tablet bringing its own exhibits to life.\n\nThey are joined by a wax Sir Lancelot, who helps them fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Xiangliu statue and a \"Triceratops\" skeleton. Jedediah and Octavius fall through a ventilation shaft but are rescued from an erupting Pompeii model by Dexter. The group find Ahkmenrah's parents, learning the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot mistakes the tablet for the Holy Grail and steals it, leaving to find Camelot. Larry and Laaa are locked in the employee break room by Tilly, but they escape, and Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly, during which they become attracted to each other.\n\nLancelot crashes a performance of the musical \"Camelot\", starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve as King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, but Larry and the others chase him to the theatre roof, where the New York exhibits begin to die. Lancelot then sees that the quest was about them and gives the tablet back. The moonlight restores the tablet's power, saving the exhibits. They decide that Ahkmenrah and the tablet should stay with his parents, even if it means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends before sunrise.\n\nThree years later, Larry, having taken the blame for the planetarium incident, thus giving McPhee his job back, now works as a teacher, and a traveling British Museum exhibit comes to New York. Tilly becomes the new night guard, and gives the tablet to Dr. McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again to celebrate Ahkmenrah's reunion. Outside, Larry watches them party inside.\n\n\n\nOn January 21, 2010, co-writer Thomas Lennon said to \"Access Hollywood\", \"I think it's a really outstanding idea to do \"Night at the Museum 3\", in fact. I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that. I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It might be in the works.\" In an October 2011 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that it was only in the \"ideas stage\". In February 2013 it was announced that the film, directed by Shawn Levy, would be released on December 25, 2014. On September 10, 2013, it was announced that shooting would start in February 2014.\n\nOn November 8, 2013, actor Dan Stevens was cast as Lancelot. On November 15, 2013, it was announced that Skyler Gisondo would be replacing Jake Cherry in the role of Nicky Daley. On December 18, 2013, it was announced that Stiller, Robin Williams, and Ricky Gervais would be returning for the sequel. On January 9, 2014, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would play a security guard in the British Museum. On January 14, 2014, the film's release date was moved up from December 25, 2014, to December 19, 2014. On January 23, 2014, it was announced Ben Kingsley would play an Egyptian Pharaoh at the British Museum. Principal photography and production began on January 27, 2014. On May 6, 2014, it was announced that the film would be titled \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\". In May 2014, principal photography ended. Shooting took place outside the British Museum in London, England, as well as on a sound stage at the Vancouver Film Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia for scenes taking place inside the museum.\n\nAlan Silvestri returned to score the final installment of the trilogy.\nVarèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album of the score on January 6, 2015.\nThe film premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 11, 2014. It was then released on December 19, 2014 in the United States.\n\n\"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" grossed $113.7 million in North America, and $249.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.2 million against a budget of $127 million.\n\nIn North America, early analysts were predicting a potential $25–$28 million opening. In North America, the film was released on December 19, 2014 across 3,785 theaters. It opened Friday, December 19, 2014 and earned $5.6 million on its opening day, placing at number three at the box office. The film underperformed expectations during its opening weekend, earning $17.1 million, which was relatively lower than the openings of the original film ($30.4 million) and its sequel ($54.1 million). The film debuted at number two at the box office behind \"\". According to 20th Century Fox, the movie's audience was 51% male, with 54% of the audience under the age of 25. In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\", on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film began its international rollout the same weekend as the North American premiere and earned $10.4 million from 27 markets in its opening weekend, debuting at #3 behind at the box office behind \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\" and \"Penguins of Madagascar\". The film expanded to an additional 40 markets in its second week and grossed $31.2 million. It topped the box office outside North America in its fourth weekend with a total gross of $46.2 million, primarily because of China, where it opened at #1 with $26 million.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"While not without its moments, \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" is a less-than-inspired sendoff for the trilogy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, praising the visual effects and calling the production values \"topnotch\", and admiring Guillermo Navarro's work. He added, \"A most enjoyable capper to director Shawn Levy and producer Chris Columbus' cheerfully silly and sneakily smart family-entertainment juggernaut... offers little in the way of secrets of surprises, but should add much holiday cheer to Fox's box-office coffers.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" gave the film three stars out of five and said, \"The third part in what absolutely no one is calling the \"Night at the Museum\" 'trilogy' turns out to be a good-natured and entertainingly surreal panto fantasy.\" Glenn Kenny awarded the film 2½ stars out of 4 praising the \"Indiana Jones\" themed-set while criticizing the performances of the cast and said, \"As talent-packed as any \"Night at the Museum\" picture may be—in this third installment... —one doesn't come to a movie of this sort expecting anybody's best work. Or at least one certainly shouldn't, because it won't materialize.\" Stephanie Zacharek of \"The Village Voice\" gave the film a positive review, saying \"The third installment, \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" may be the best, and even the generally wound-too-tight Ben Stiller – once again playing a bemused Museum of Natural History guard – is easy to tolerate.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Where the previous films felt frenetic and forced, this outing feels breezier, more enjoyable and less contrived.\" Joe Neumaier of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"There's a serenity to museum visits, especially if it's a place you know and love. \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\", amazingly, recaptures that feeling in big-studio franchise form.\"\n\nBill Goodykoontz of \"The Arizona Republic\" gave the film two out of five stars, saying \"\"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" is a rather lackluster affair, a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion.\" Joe McGovern of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a B, saying \"It's kind of fun, unembarrassingly, and not least of all because the people who made it look like they had a good time doing so.\" Tom Long of \"The Detroit News\" gave the film a B, saying \"There are some key elements that make this \"Night at the Museum\" sequel work better than its predecessor.\" Stephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"The exhibits in this \"Night at the Museum\" may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert.\" Tom Russo of \"The Boston Globe\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Seeing Ben Stiller, the late Robin Williams, and their magically roused gang together again, this time in London, is initially all about indulgent, nostalgic smiles rather than new wows. But then comes the movie's exceptionally clever and fresh final act, which delivers genuine surprise along with many laughs.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"The third \"Night at the Museum\" film starts strongly, with its heart in the past... It's an exciting opening, and perhaps too exciting for the film's own good. It's hard not to be disappointed when the plot moves back to the present and settles into the time-honoured formula of digitised creatures running riot and famous people in fancy dress doing shtick.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a negative review, saying \"Despite relocating across the pond to the esteemed British Museum, the creaky \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" fails to capitalize on the comic potential provided by that change of venue.\"\n\nIgnatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a C+, saying \"\"Secret of the Tomb\" plays it as a source of corny jokes, pop-culture references, and father-son bonding moments. In other words, it's exactly the kind of film that shouldn't be expected to engage with its assorted bizarre subtexts – but what a movie it could be if it did.\" Sara Stewart of the \"New York Post\" gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"For piquing kids' interest in history and nature, you could do worse than this goofy Ben Stiller franchise. But its third installment is more meh than manic, too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors. You get the feeling returning director Shawn Levy is ready to hang it up.\" Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying \"The dialogue is schmaltzy and often painfully unfunny. The special effects are often so 1980s-bad, one wonders if it was a deliberate choice, to make the creepy visuals of sculptures dancing and paintings moving less frightening to young viewers. Time and again, terrific actors sink in the equivalent of cinematic quicksand, helpless against the sucking sound of this movie.\" Drew Hunt of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"None of the entries in the \"Night at the Museum\" series could ever pass for high art, but a wealth of comedic talent gave the first two installments a madcap energy that somewhat forgave their childish premises. \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\", the third and supposedly final edition in the franchise, is nothing more than an uncomfortably transparent contractual obligation.\"\n\n\"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 10, 2015. The film debuted in second place on the home media charts behind \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "762860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762860", "title": "Operation Mincemeat", "text": "Operation Mincemeat\n\nOperation Mincemeat was a successful British deception operation of the Second World War to disguise the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily. Two members of British intelligence obtained the body of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison, dressed him as an officer of the Royal Marines and placed personal items on him identifying him as the fictitious Captain (Acting Major) William Martin. Correspondence between two British generals which suggested that the Allies planned to invade Greece and Sardinia, with Sicily as merely the target of a feint, was also placed on the body.\n\nPart of the wider Operation Barclay, Mincemeat was based on the 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division and his personal assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and the military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began by transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine and releasing it close to shore, where it was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read and Ultra decrypts of German messages showed that the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.\n\nThe effect of Operation Mincemeat is unknown, although Sicily was liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in \"Operation Heartbreak\", a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu's work formed the basis for the 1956 British film \"The Man Who Never Was\".\n\nOn 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the Second World War, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, circulated the Trout memo, a paper that compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The historian Ben Macintyre observes that although the paper was published under Godfrey's name, it \"bore all the hallmarks of ... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming\", Godfrey's personal assistant. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was titled: \"A Suggestion (not a very nice one)\"; it was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy.\n\nThe deliberate planting of fake documents to be found by the enemy was not new; known as the Haversack Ruse, it had been practised by the British and others in the First and Second World Wars. In August 1942, before the Battle of Alam el Halfa, a corpse was placed in a blown-up scout car, in a minefield facing the German 90th Light Division. On the corpse was a map purportedly showing the locations of British minefields; the Germans used the map, and their tanks were routed to areas of soft sand where they bogged down.\n\nIn September 1942 an aircraft flying from Britain to Gibraltar crashed off Cádiz. All aboard were killed, including Paymaster-Lieutenant James Hadden Turner – a courier carrying top secret documents – and a French agent. Turner's documents included a letter from General Mark Clark, the American Deputy Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, to General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, British Governor and Commander in Chief of Gibraltar, informing him that General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander, would arrive in Gibraltar on the eve of Operation Torch's \"target date\" of 4November. Turner's body washed up on the beach near Tarifa and was recovered by the Spanish authorities. When the body was returned to the British, the letter was still on it, and technicians determined that the letter had not been opened. Other Allied intelligence sources established that the notebook carried by the French agent had been copied by the Germans, but they dismissed it as being disinformation. To British planners it showed that some material that was obtained by the Spanish was being passed to the Germans.\n\nA month after the Turner crash, the British intelligence officer Charles Cholmondeley outlined his own variation of the Trout memo plan, codenamed Trojan Horse, after the Achaean deception from the Trojan War. His plan was\n\nCholmondeley was a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who had been seconded to MI5, Britain's domestic counter-intelligence and security service. He had been appointed as the secretary of the Twenty Committee, a small inter-service, inter-departmental intelligence team in charge of double agents. In November 1942 the Twenty Committee turned down Cholmondeley's plan as being unworkable, but thought there may have been some potential in the idea. As there was a naval connection to the plan, John Masterman, the chairman of the committee, assigned Ewen Montagu, the naval representative, to work with Cholmondeley to develop the plan further. Montagu – a peacetime lawyer and King's Counsel who had volunteered at the outbreak of the war – worked under Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Division, where he ran NID 17(M), the sub-branch which handled counter-espionage work. Godfrey had also appointed Montagu to oversee all naval deception involving double agents. As part of his duties, Montagu had been briefed on the need for deception operations to aid the Allied war aims in a forthcoming invasion operation in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn late 1942, with the Allied success in the North African Campaign, military planners turned to the next target. British planners considered that an invasion of France from Britain could not take place until 1944 and the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, wanted to use the Allied forces from North Africa to attack Europe's \"soft underbelly\". There were two possible targets for the Allies to attack. The first option was Sicily; control of the island would open the Mediterranean Sea to Allied shipping and allow the invasion of continental Europe through Italy. The second option was to go into Greece and the Balkans, to trap the German forces between the British and American invaders and the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, Allied planners agreed on the selection of Sicily – codenamed Operation Husky – and decided to undertake the invasion no later than July. There was concern among the Allied planners that Sicily was an obvious choice – Churchill is reputed to have said \"Everyone but a bloody fool would know that it's Sicily\" – and that the build-up of resources for the invasion would be detected.\n\nAdolf Hitler was concerned about a Balkan invasion, as the area had been the source of raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, diverting resources from Sicily. The deception reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. False communications about troop movements were generated from the Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.\n\nMontagu and Cholmondeley were assisted by an MI6 representative, Major Frank Foley, as they examined the practicalities of the plan. Montagu approached the pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury to determine what kind of body they needed and what factors they would need to take into account to fool a Spanish pathologist. Spilsbury informed him that those who died in an air crash often did so from shock and not drowning; the lungs would not necessarily be filled with water. He added that \"Spaniards, as Roman Catholics, were averse to post-mortems and did not hold them unless the cause of death was of great importance\". Spilsbury advised that a person could have suffered one of many different causes of death, which could be misconstrued in an autopsy. Montagu later wrote\n\nThis meant that not only would they have a better degree of success than they previously thought, but that there would be a larger number of corpses potentially available for selection when the time came. When Montagu discussed the possibility of obtaining a corpse with Bentley Purchase, the coroner for the Northern District of London, he was told there would be practical and legal difficulties: \"I should think bodies are the only commodities not in short supply at the moment [but] even with bodies all over the place, each one has to be accounted for\". Purchase promised to look out for a body that was suitable, with no relatives who would claim the corpse for burial.\n\nOn 28 January 1943 Purchase contacted Montagu with the news he had located a suitable body, probably that of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison that contained phosphorus. Purchase informed Montagu and Cholmondeley that the small amount of poison in the system would not be identified in a body that was supposed to have been floating in the sea for several days. When Montagu commented that the under-nourished corpse did not look like a fit field officer, Purchase informed him that \"he does not have to look like an officer – only a staff officer\", more used to office work. Purchase agreed to keep the body in the mortuary refrigerator at a temperature of – any colder and the flesh would freeze, which would be obvious after the body defrosted. He warned Montagu and Cholmondeley that the body had to be used within three months, after which it would have decomposed past the point of usefulness.\n\nMontagu refused to identify the individual and only identified him as \"a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did he did after his death\". In 1996 Roger Morgan, an amateur historian from London, uncovered evidence in the Public Record Office that the identity of the corpse was Glyndwr Michael. An alternative theory to the corpse's identity was suggested in the history \"The Secrets of HMS Dasher\" (2004) that in March 1943 there was an explosion on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion and observes that the official records of the operation state that Michael was the body.\n\nMontagu selected the code name Mincemeat from a list of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to co-operate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.\n\nMontagu and Cholmondeley began to create a \"legend\" – a fictitious background and character – for the body. The name and rank chosen was Captain (Acting Major) William Martin, of the Royal Marines assigned to Combined Operations Headquarters. The name \"Martin\" was selected because there were several men with that name of about that rank in the Royal Marines. As a Royal Marine, Major Martin came under Admiralty authority, and it would be easy to ensure that all official inquiries and messages about his death would be routed to the Naval Intelligence Division. Additionally, Royal Marines would wear battledress, which was easily obtainable and came in standard sizes. The rank of acting major made him senior enough to be entrusted with sensitive documents, but not so prominent that anyone would expect to know him.\nTo reinforce the impression of Martin being a real person, Montagu and Cholmondeley provided corroborative details to be carried on his person – known in espionage circles as wallet or pocket litter. These included a photograph from an invented fiancée named Pam; the image was of an MI5 clerk, Jean Leslie. Two love letters from Pam were included in the pocket litter, as was a receipt for a diamond engagement ring costing £53 10s 6d from a Bond Street jewellery shop. Additional personal correspondence was included, consisting of a letter from the fictitious Martin's father – described by Macintyre as \"pompous and pedantic as only an Edwardian father could be\" – which included a note from the family solicitor, and a message from Lloyds Bank, demanding payment of an overdraft of £79 19s 2d. To ensure that the letters would remain legible after immersion in seawater, Montagu asked MI5 scientists to conduct tests on different inks to see which would last longest in the water, and they provided him with a suitable list of popular and available ink brands.\n\nOther items of pocket litter placed on Martin included a book of stamps, a silver cross and a St. Christopher's medallion, cigarettes, matches, a pencil stub, keys and a receipt from Gieves for a new shirt. To provide a date that Martin had been in London, ticket stubs from a London theatre and a bill for four nights' lodging at the Naval and Military Club were added. Along with the other items placed on him, an itinerary of his activity in London could be constructed from 18 to 24 April.\nAttempts were made to photograph the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and it was obvious that the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.\n\nMontagu outlined three criteria for the document that contained the details of the falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually but clearly identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.\nThe main document was a personal letter from Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Nye, vice chief of the Imperial General Staff – who had a deep knowledge of ongoing military operations – to General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the Anglo-American 18th Army Group in Algeria and Tunisia under General Eisenhower. After several attempts at drafting the document did not generate something that was considered natural, it was suggested that Nye should draw up the letter himself to cover the required points. The letter covered several purportedly sensitive subjects, such as the (unwanted) award of Purple Heart medals by US forces to British servicemen serving with them and the appointment of a new commander of the Brigade of Guards. Montagu thought the result was \"quite brilliant\"; the key part of the letter stated that\n\nThere was also a letter of introduction for Martin from his putative commanding officer, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the chief of Combined Operations, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, the commander-in-chief Mediterranean Fleet and Allied naval commander in the Mediterranean. Martin was referred to in the letter as an amphibious warfare expert on loan until \"the assault is over\". The document included a clumsy joke about sardines, which Montagu inserted in the hope that the Germans would see it as a reference to a planned invasion of Sardinia. A single black eyelash was placed within the letter to check if the Germans or Spanish had opened it.\n\nMontagu considered that there would be a possible \"Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses\", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first thought of having the handle clutched in the corpse's hand, held in place by \"rigor mortis\", but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.\n\nMontagu and Cholmondeley gave consideration to the location of the corpse's delivery. It had long been assumed by the pair that the western coast of Spain would be the ideal location. Early in the planning they investigated the possibility of Portuguese and French coasts, but rejected those in favour of Huelva on the coast of southern Spain, after advice was taken from the Hydrographer of the Navy regarding the tides and currents best suited to ensure the body landed where it was wanted. Montagu later outlined that the choice of Huelva was also made because \"there was a very active German agent ... who had excellent contacts with certain Spaniards, both officials and others\". The agent – Adolf Clauss, a member of the – was the son of the German consul, and operated under the cover of an agriculture technician; he was an efficient and effective operative. Huelva was also chosen because the British vice-consul in the city, Francis Haselden, was \"a reliable and helpful man\" who could be relied upon, according to Montagu.\nThe body was supposed to be the victim of an aeroplane crash, and it was decided that to try and simulate the accident at sea using flares and other devices could be too risky and open to discovery. After seaplanes and surface ships were dismissed as being problematic, a submarine was chosen as the method of delivering the corpse to the region. To transport the body by submarine, it needed to be contained within the body of the boat, as any externally mounted container would have to be built with a skin so thick it would alter the level of the waterline. The canister needed to remain airtight and keep the corpse as fresh as possible through its journey. Spilsbury provided the medical requirements and Cholmondeley contacted Charles Fraser-Smith of the Ministry of Supply to produce the container, which was labelled \"Handle with care: optical instruments\".\n\nOn 13 April 1943 the committee of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – that he needed to obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that could go wrong, including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that \"in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim\". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.\n\nIn the early hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, although there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen. Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric fire was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly. The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached. The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with of dry ice and sealed up. When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration. The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver St. John \"Jock\" Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war. Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in the back of the van, which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine . \"Seraph\"s commander, Lt. Bill Jewell, and crew had previous special operations experience. Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret meteorological device to be deployed near Spain.\n\nOn 19 April \"Seraph\" set sail and arrived just off the coast of Huelva on 29 April after having been bombed twice en route. After spending the day reconnoitreing the coastline, at 4:15 am on 30 April, \"Seraph\" surfaced. Jewell had the canister brought up on deck, then sent all his crew below except the officers. They opened the container and lowered the body into the water. Jewell read Psalm 39 and ordered the engines to full astern; the wash from the screws pushed the corpse toward the shore. The canister was reloaded and the submarine travelled 12 miles out where it surfaced and the empty container was pushed into the water. As it floated, it was riddled with machine gun fire so that it would sink. Because of the air trapped in the insulation, this effort failed, and the canister was destroyed with plastic explosives. Jewell afterwards sent a message to the Admiralty to say \"Mincemeat completed\", and continued on to Gibraltar.\n\nThe body of \"Major Martin\" was found at around 9:30 am on 30 April 1943 by a local fisherman; it was taken to Huelva by Spanish soldiers, where it was handed over to a naval judge. Haselden, as vice-consul, was officially informed by the Spaniards; he reported back to the Admiralty that the body and briefcase had been found. A series of pre-scripted diplomatic cables were sent between Haselden and his superiors, which continued for several days. The British knew that these were being intercepted and, although they were encrypted, the Germans had broken the code; the messages played out the story that it was imperative that Haselden retrieve the briefcase because it was important.\n\nAt midday on 1May an autopsy was undertaken on Michael's body; Haselden was present and – in order to minimise the possibilities that the two Spanish doctors identified that the body was a three-month old corpse – Haselden asked if, in the heat of the day and smell of the corpse, the doctors should bring the post mortem to a close and have lunch. They agreed and signed a death certificate for Major William Martin for \"asphyxiation through immersion in the sea\"; the body was released by the Spanish and, as Major Martin, was buried in the San Marco section of Nuestra Señora cemetery in Huelva, with full military honours on 2May.\nThe Spanish navy retained the briefcase and, despite pressure from Adolf Clauss and some of his agents, neither it or its contents were handed over to the Germans. On 5May the briefcase was passed to the naval headquarters at San Fernando near Cadiz, for forwarding to Madrid. While at San Fernando the contents were photographed by German sympathisers, but the letters were not opened. Once the briefcase arrived in Madrid, its contents became the focus of attention of Karl-Erich Kühlenthal, one of the most senior agents in Spain. He asked admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the , to personally intervene and persuade the Spanish to surrender the documents. Acceding to the request, the Spanish removed the still-damp paper by tightly winding it around a probe into a cylindrical shape, and then pulling it out between the envelope flap – which was still closed by a wax seal – and the envelope body. The letters were dried and photographed, then soaked in salt water for 24 hours before being re-inserted into their envelopes, without the eyelash that had been planted there. The information was passed to the Germans on 8May. This was deemed so important by the agents in Spain that Kühlenthal personally took the documents to Germany.\n\nOn 11May the briefcase, complete with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet by the time they returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.\n\nFinal proof that the Germans had been passed the information from the letters came on 14May when a German communication was decrypted by the Ultra source of signals intelligence produced by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park. The message, which had been sent two days previously, warned that the invasion was to be in the Balkans, with a feint to the Dodecanese. A message was sent by Brigadier Leslie Hollis – the secretary to the Chiefs of Staff Committee – to Churchill, then in the United States. It read \"Mincemeat swallowed rod, line and sinker by the right people and from the best information they look like acting on it.\"\n\nMontagu continued the deception to reinforce the existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in \"The Times\" on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave credence to the Major Martin story.\n\nOn 14 May 1943 Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz met Hitler to discuss Dönitz's recent visit to Italy, his meeting with the Italian leader Benito Mussolini and the progress of the war. The Admiral, referring to the Mincemeat documents as the \"Anglo-Saxon order\", recorded\n\nHitler informed Mussolini that Greece, Sardinia and Corsica must be defended \"at all costs\", and that German troops would be best placed to do the job. He ordered that the experienced 1st Panzer Division be transferred from France to Salonika. The order was intercepted by GC&CS on 21 May. By the end of June, German troop strength on Sardinia had been doubled to 10,000, with fighter aircraft also based there as support. Two panzer divisions were moved to the Balkans from the Eastern Front; German torpedo boats were moved from Sicily to the Greek islands in preparation. Seven German divisions transferred to Greece, raising the number present to eight, and ten were posted to the Balkans, raising the number present to eighteen.\n\nOn 9 July the Allies invaded Sicily in Operation Husky. German signals intercepted by GC&CS showed that even four hours after the invasion of Sicily began, twenty-one aircraft left Sicily to reinforce Sardinia. For a considerable time after the initial invasion, Hitler was still convinced that an attack on the Balkans was imminent, and in late July he sent General Erwin Rommel to Salonika to prepare the defence of the region. By the time the German high command realised the mistake, it was too late to make a difference.\n\nOn 25 July 1943, as the battle for Sicily went against the Axis forces, the Italian Grand Council of Fascism voted to limit the power of Mussolini, and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King Victor Emmanuel III. The following day Mussolini met the King, who dismissed him as prime minister; the former dictator was then imprisoned. A new Italian government took power and began secret negotiations with the Allies. Sicily fell on 17August after a force of 65,000 Germans held off 400,000 American and British troops long enough to allow many of the Germans to evacuate to the Italian mainland.\n\nThe military historian Jon Latimer observes that the relative ease with which the allies captured Sicily was not entirely because of Mincemeat, or the wider deception of Operation Barclay. Latimer identifies other factors, including Hitler's distrust of the Italians, and his unwillingness to risk German troops alongside Italian troops who may have been on the point of a general surrender. The military historian Michael Howard, while describing Mincemeat as \"perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war\", considered Mincemeat and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler's \"congenital obsession with the Balkans\". Macintyre writes that the exact impact of Mincemeat is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded in the first week of fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12. The predicted 90-day campaign was over in 38.\n\nSmyth writes that as a result of Husky, Hitler suspended the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.\n\nMontagu was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948. Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel \"Operation Heartbreak\" (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse – with papers naming him as William Maryngton – being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote \"The Man Who Never Was\" (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure \"the idea of an organised programme of strategic deception ... with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper\". In 1977 Montagu published \"Beyond Top Secret U\", his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations.\n\nA 1956 episode of \"The Goon Show\", entitled \"The Man who Never Was\", was set during the Second World War, and referred to a microfilm washed up on a beach inside a German boot. The play \"Operation Mincemeat\", written by Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh, was first staged by the Cardboard Citizens theatre company in 2001. The work focused on Michael's homelessness. In his book \"The Double Agents\", the writer W. E. B. Griffin depicts Operation Mincemeat as an American operation run by the Office of Strategic Services. Fictional characters are blended with Ian Fleming and the actors David Niven and Peter Ustinov.\n\nIn 1977 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission took responsibility for Major Martin's grave in Huelva. In 1997 the Commission added the postscript \"Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin RM\".\n\n\n\n"}

For the non-zero case, what makes the change \"qualitative\" is that its direction but not its magnitude is specified.\n\nTypical exercises of qualitative economics include comparative-static changes studied in microeconomics or macroeconomics and comparative equilibrium-growth states in a macroeconomic growth model. A simple example illustrating qualitative change is from macroeconomics. Let:\nMonetary theory hypothesizes a positive relationship between \"GDP\" the dependent variable and \"M\" the independent variable. Equivalent ways to represent such a qualitative relationship between them are as a signed functional relationship and as a signed derivative: \n\nwhere the '+' indexes a positive relationship of \"GDP\" to \"M\", that is, as \"M\" increases, \"GDP\" increases as a result.\n\nAnother model of GDP hypothesizes that \"GDP\" has a negative relationship to \"T\". This can be represented similarly to the above, with a theoretically appropriate sign change as indicated:\n\nThat is, as \"T\" increases, \"GDP\" decreases as a result.\nA combined model uses both \"M\" and \"T\" as independent variables. The hypothesized relationships can be equivalently represented as signed functional relationships and signed partial derivatives (suitable for more than one independent variable): \n\nQualitative hypotheses occur in earliest history of formal economics but only as to formal economic models from the late 1930s with Hicks's model of general equilibrium in a competitive economy. A classic exposition of qualitative economics is Samuelson, 1947. There Samuelson identifies qualitative restrictions and the hypotheses of maximization and stability of equilibrium as the three fundamental sources of \"meaningful\" theorems — hypotheses about empirical data that could conceivably be refuted by empirical data.\n\n"}

The rarest of these books is probably \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" volume 1, issue 5, which was recalled due to the inclusion of a 19th-century advertisement for \"Marvel\"-brand douche; since \"League\" was published by an imprint of DC Comics, DC's publisher felt that this could be perceived as an attack on DC's main rival, Marvel Comics. Other notable recalls were the \"Elseworlds 80-Page Giant\" which included a portrayal of baby Superman in a microwave, and Marvel Knights' \"Elektra\" #3 which included tame nude images of the title character.\n\nAs well as comics with evidence of a genuine recall, there have been a number of rumored recalls and comics where the publisher (or distributor) has allowed the comic to be returned but has not issued a recall notice. Comic books have been categorized below as verified or unverified/returnable with supporting references.\n\nThis section lists comics verified by the CGC Collectors Society as being recalled and listed in the \"Recalled Editions\" competitive comic book set.\n\nNovember 2008, DC Comics' \"Action Comics\" #869, the penultimate issue of the \"Brainiac\" story arc, was recalled by DC Comics for cover content. The original cover depicted Superman, in civilian attire with his 'S' shield clearly visible, and his adoptive father outside the Kent farmhouse drinking what appears to be beer.\n\nDC issued a statement to retailers that the issue was recalled, and that any copies featuring the original cover be destroyed. The next week, DC reprinted the issue featuring a cover in which the label on the bottle was changed to read, \"soda pop\".\n\nAugust 2008, DC Comics\n\"All Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder\" was a mature-readers comic in which street thugs used profanity. However, DC did not want this language to actually appear in the book, so the text was placed in the speech bubbles and then blacked-out. However, in issue #10, slightly different shades of ink were used in the two elements leaving the vulgar words just readable. Frank Miller was quoted as saying \"This is the first I've heard of it,\" he said. \"I have no idea how this awful thing happened. It's just one of those terrible and glorious things that happen time to time in publishing\", \"...And my first reaction is simple: I want at least three copies.\"\n\nNovember 2001, Marvel Comics\nElektra appears nude in shadow.\n\nAugust 1999, DC Comics\nIn Kyle Baker and Liz Glass' story, \"Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter\", the super-toddler climbs into a microwave.

This ad caused DC Comics executive Paul Levitz to order the entire print run destroyed over concerns that this could lead to litigation with their main rival Marvel Comics. None of the recalled comics were ever distributed in the US; however, a small batch had been shipped to the UK and escaped the destruction. With only 100 thought to exist this makes it more than 10-20 times rarer than the \"Elseworlds 80-Page Giant\" that Paul Levitz also recalled, and is probably the rarest modern comic book in existence.\n\nIn \"Top 10\", Moore creates a \"Miracle Douche Recall\" headline on a newspaper.\n\nMarch 1999, Warner Bros.\nThis comic was specially printed for the cinema audience for the film of the same title. However, the content was deemed too mature for cinema audience and it was withdrawn and pulped. This comic, although recalled, retains a low value.\n\nFebruary 2000, DC Comics\nThis comic was a reprint of the original first issue of \"Mad\", however, inside DC Comics used their own masthead and copyright instead of EC's so it was withdrawn to be corrected. A very low number of these comic books have been encapsulated by CGC.\n\nOctober 2009, Image Comics\nRecalled and pulped due to a printing error that caused the bar-code from issue #4 to be used.\n\nMay 1983, Marvel Comics\nAs reported in \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" #497 (May 27, 1983), actor and comic book fan Mark Hamill discovered copies of Marvel Comics' comic book adaptation of the \"Return of the Jedi\" film, on sale a month prior to the release of the film, and alerted Lucasfilm. According to Marvel's Direct Sales Manager Carol Kalish, Marvel swiftly recalled the book off the stands upon learning this, though it did not prevent premature revelation of many of the film's secrets.\n\nJune 2001, Marvel Comics\nThe first issue of the comic was produced on the wrong paper stock giving it a matte finish. The comic was withdrawn and the cover reprinted on the correct stock.\n\nJanuary 2001, Marvel Comics\nThis alternate-universe Spider-Man book was recalled after it was discovered that artist Al Milgrom had hidden slanderous comments about former Marvel Comics editor Bob Harras within the issue. On page 28, panel 3, the spines of books on a bookshelf in the background read, \"Harras, ha ha, he's gone, good riddance to bad rubbish he was a, Nasty (blurred), s.o.b.\". when the comic is turned sideways. The comic was distributed to retailers as part of the First Look scheme, in which retailers get to see a copy of next week’s issue, but then recalled and pulped when the slander was spotted. Milgrom was fired and then quietly rehired several weeks later.\n\nNovember 1998, Marvel Comics\nThis issue featured a genuine error where, instead of the word \"killer\", the antisemitic word \"kike\" made it into Viper's description of Wolverine's archenemy Sabretooth.\n\nThis section lists comics that have been rumored as recalls or have been voluntarily returnable to the publisher (i.e. a recall notice was not issued).\n\nFebruary 1964, DC Comics\nIn one of the stories in this anthology issue, Superman visits the White House, and trusts President John F. Kennedy with his secret identity. The story was produced shortly before Kennedy was assassinated, which led to the cancellation of its publication. It was eventually published months later.\n\nNovember 2001, DC Comics\nThis issue was shipped to stores the day after the September 11 attacks in New York City. Due to an unfortunate coincidence the Superman comic features a scene in which Metropolis' twin LexCorp Towers have sustained damage due to events in the \"Our Worlds at War\" storyline. DC quickly announced that the issue was returnable although few, if any, were actually returned.\n\nDecember 2005, Dark Horse Comics\n\"Conan and the Demons of Khitai\" #3 featured a spoof nude advert for \"Conan\" #24. After complaints, a second printing was issued, replacing the spoof nude advert with actual (non-nude) advert for \"Conan\" #24, with retailers offered the option to swap copies (hence not technically a recall).\n\nMay 1993, DC/Vertigo\nPage 19 and 20 in the first print were not facing each other, which led to this being corrected and reprinted.\n\nMarch 1990, Marvel Comics\nJackson Guice's cover for \"Doctor Strange\" #15 (March 1990) used Christian music singer Amy Grant's likeness without her permission, leading to her management filing a complaint against Marvel Comics, saying the cover gave the appearance she was associating with witchcraft. A US District Court sealed an out-of-court settlement between Grant and Marvel in early 1991, with a consent decree that Marvel did not admit to any liability or wrongdoing.\n\nMarch 1982, Marvel Comics\nMost copies have a blank panel on the bottom left of page 10. About 1600 copies (of 80000 issues printed) show a red ink drawing of Dante in that panel. In the \"Bullpen Bulletins\" page in Marvel Comics cover-dated June 1982, Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter humorously explains this with \"The First Annual Shooter Awards\". Shooter wrote \"The Award for Worst Engraver's Error goes to Chemical Color for \"Ka-Zar\" #12 \"Belasco...!\" in which an entire panel, a color-hold, was dropped out!\"\n\nAugust 1990, DC/Vertigo\nThere are two versions of this issue where the first page has either three panels colored blue or the same three panels colored yellow. The blue panel variant is listed by CGC as an \"error version\" and very few are thought to exist.\n\nSeptember 1990, DC/Vertigo\nPages 18 and 19 printed in the wrong order (not recalled).\n\nDecember 2006, Marvel Comics\nOn December 6, 2006, the same day that \"\" #1 shipped to retailers, Marvel issued an apology and a \"CONTENT ADVISORY\" statement, announcing that the issue was now returnable as it \"contains an image that may be misinterpreted by some readers as inappropriate\". This was due to a panel showing a naked and elderly Peter Parker sitting on a bed, an image in which his genitalia are apparently visible. \"Spider-Man: Reign\" had shipped with a T+ (Teens & Up) rating. The second printing avoided this problem by modifying the panel, hiding Parker's body in shadow.\n\nFebruary 1993, Marvel Comics\nReturnable (not recalled) due to “Black Cover” printing error.\n"}
{"id": "227457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227457", "title": "Royal Armouries", "text": "Royal Armouries\n\nThe Royal Armouries is the United Kingdom's National Museum of Arms and Armour. It is the United Kingdom's oldest museum, and one of the oldest museums in the world. It is also one of the largest collections of arms and armour in the world, comprising the UK's National Collection of Arms and Armour, National Artillery Collection, and National Firearms Collection. Its historic base is in the Tower of London, but today the collection is split across three sites:\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015, a limited selection of items was also on display in Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States, in cooperation with the Frazier History Museum.\n\nThe Royal Armouries is one of the ancient institutions of the Tower of London and was originally engaged in the manufacture of armour for the Kings of England. The Office of the Armoury grew out of the department known as the King's Privy Wardrobe at the Tower of London in the mid-15th century. Overseen from 1423 by the Master of the King's Armour, and based in the White Tower, the Office was responsible for manufacturing armour and edged weapons for the monarch and his armies; it functioned alongside the Office of Ordnance, which had responsibility for firearms.\n\nThe Armoury oversaw storehouses and workshops at Woolwich and Portsmouth, and at various royal palaces (most notably the Greenwich Armoury, which specialized in richly decorated ceremonial armour). In 1545, it is recorded that a visiting foreign dignitary paid to view the Armoury collection at the Tower of London. By the time of Charles II, there was a permanent public display there; the \"Spanish Armoury\" which included instruments of torture and the \"Line of Kings\"—a row of wooden effigies representing the kings of England. This makes it the first museum in Britain. \nThe influence of the Armoury began to wane as traditional weapons gave way increasingly to firearms in the field of war. In the 1620s, swords, lances and items of armour were still used in battle, but for the most part were being issued by the Office of Ordnance (which was becoming a sizeable department of State) rather than by the Armoury. The latter, however, remained staffed and operational until 1671, when it was finally absorbed by the Ordnance Board; the board continued to maintain, and indeed expanded, the Armoury as a museum.\n\nThe Tower was engaged in the development, manufacture and storage of a wide variety of weaponry until the Board of Ordnance was abolished in 1855. Thereafter the historic armoury collection remained. Only a small part of this could be displayed, however, and in 1995, much of the artillery collection was moved to Fort Nelson in Hampshire and the following year a new Royal Armouries Museum was opened in Leeds. The remaining part of the collection relates directly to the Tower.\n\nThe National Heritage Act 1983 established the Armouries as a non-departmental public body, now sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe head of the Royal Armouries is known as the Master of the Armouries. This was an ancient office that was revived in 1935 when the Royal Armouries became a national museum. The current Director General and Master of the Armouries is Edward Impey.\nThe Master of the Armoury was responsible for maintaining a store of armour and weapons for use in the event of war and had an office in the Tower of London. The first use of the title was in 1462.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "69870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69870", "title": "Science museum", "text": "Science museum\n\nA science museum is a museum devoted primarily to science. Older science museums tended to concentrate on static displays of objects related to natural history, paleontology, geology, industry and industrial machinery, etc. Modern trends in museology have broadened the range of subject matter and introduced many interactive exhibits. Many if not most modern science museums which increasingly refer to themselves as science centers or \"discovery centers\" also emphasize technology, and are therefore also technology museums.\n\nThe mission statements of science centers and modern museums vary, but they are united in being places that make science accessible and encourage the excitement of discovery. They are an integral and dynamic part of the learning environment, promoting exploration from the first \"Eureka!\" moment to today's cutting-edge research.\n\nAs early as the Renaissance, many aristocrats collected curiosities for display to their family. Universities and particularly medical schools also maintained study collections of specimens for their students. Scientists and collectors displayed their finds in private cabinets of curiosities. Such collections were the predecessors of modern natural history museums.\n\nThe first purpose-built museum covering natural philosophy and open to the public from 1683 was the original Ashmolean museum (now called the Museum of the History of Science) in Oxford, although its scope was mixed. The first dedicated science museum was the Museo de Ciencias Naturales, in Madrid, Spain. Opened in 1752, it almost disappeared during the Franco regime, but it recovered afterwards and today works closely with the CSIC. The Utrecht University Museum, among others, still displays an extensive collection of 18th-century animal and human \"rarities\" in its original setting.\n\nAnother line in the genealogy of science museums came during the Industrial Revolution, with great national exhibits intended to showcase the triumphs of both science and industry. For example, the Great Exhibition in The Crystal Palace (1851) eventually gave rise to London's Science Museum.\n\nIn America, various Natural History Societies established collections in the early 19th century, which evolved into museums. Notable was the early New England Museum of Natural History, (now the Museum of Science) which opened in Boston in 1864. The Academy of Science of Saint Louis was founded in 1856 as the first scientific organization west of the Mississippi (although the organization managed scientific collections for several decades a formal museum was not created until the mid-20th century).\n\nThe modern interactive science museum appears to have been pioneered by Munich’s Deutsches Museum in the early 20th century. This museum had moving exhibits where visitors were encouraged to push buttons and work levers. The concept was taken to the US by Julius Rosenwald, chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Company, who visited the Deutsches Museum with his young son in 1911. He was so-captivated by the experience that he decided to build a similar museum in his home town. Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry opened in phases between 1933 and 1940.\n\nIn 1959 the Museum of Science and Natural History (now the Saint Louis Science Center) was formally created by the Academy of Science of Saint Louis, featuring many interactive science and history exhibits.\n\nIn August 1969, Frank Oppenheimer dedicated his new Exploratorium in San Francisco almost completely to interactive science exhibits. The Exploratorium published the details of their own exhibits in \"Cookbooks\" that served as an inspiration to many other museums around the world.\n\nOpened in September 1969, the Ontario Science Centre continued the trend of featuring interactive exhibits rather than static displays.\n\nIn 1973, the first Omnimax theater opened as the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego's Balboa Park. The tilted-dome Space Theater doubled as a planetarium. The Science Center was an Exploratorium-style museum included as a small part of the complex. This combination interactive science museum, planetarium and Omnimax theater pioneered a configuration that many major science museums follow today.\n\nAlso in 1973, the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) was founded as an international organization to provide a collective voice, professional support, and programming opportunities for science centers, museums, and related institutions.\n\nAs the flavor of interactivity spread worldwide, the massive Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie opened in Paris in 1986, and smaller but no less influential national centers soon followed in Spain, Finland, and Denmark. In the UK, the first interactive centers also opened in 1986 on a modest scale, but their real blossoming more than a decade later was fuelled by Lottery funding for projects to celebrate the millennium.\n\nSince the 1990s, science museums and centers, such as Thailand's National Science Museum, have been created or greatly expanded in East Asia, South Asia, and other parts of the developing word.\n\nHowever, in many more institutionalized organizations the improvised, experimental nature of the Oppenheimer era has been diluted in favor of a standardized view of science, often dominated by governmental, corporate, and commercial messages.\n\nMuseums that brand themselves as science centers emphasize a hands-on approach, featuring interactive exhibits that encourage visitors to experiment and explore.\n\nThe first science center was Urania founded in Berlin in 1888 . The Academy of Science of Saint Louis (founded in 1856) created the Saint Louis Museum of Science and Natural History in 1959 (Saint Louis Science Center), but generally science centers are a product of the 1960s and later. In the United Kingdom, many of them were founded as Millennium projects, with funding from the National Lotteries Fund.\n\nThe first \"science center\" in the United States was the Science Center of Pinellas County, founded in 1959. The Pacific Science Center (one of the first large organizations to call itself a \"science center\" rather than a museum) opened in a Seattle World's Fair building in 1962. The Smithsonian Institution invited visitors into a new Discovery Room in its National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, where they could touch and handle formerly off-limits specimens. In 1969, Oppenheimer's Exploratorium opened in San Francisco, California, and the Ontario Science Centre opened near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. By the early 1970s, COSI Columbus, then known as the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, had run its first \"camp-in.\"\n\nIt did not take long for these new-style museums to band together for mutual support. In 1971, 16 museum directors gathered to discuss the possibility of starting a new association one more specifically tailored to their needs than the existing American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums). The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) was formally established in 1973, headquartered in Washington DC, but with an international organizational membership. The corresponding European organization is ECSITE and in the UK the Association of Science and Discovery Centres (ASDC) represent the interests of science engagement organisations .\n\nIn India, the National Council of Science Museums runs science centers at several places including Delhi, Bhopal, Nagpur and Ranchi. There are few private Science Centers as well, noted among them are Birla Science Museum and The Science Garage in Hyderabad.\n\n\n\n"}

Such works also can include words and phrases arising from different dialects and argots, which may or may not have passed into more common usage. They can also track the changing meaning of the terms over time and space, as they migrate and mutate. This makes them of interest to a variety of people, from oral historians, to etymologists, to the casual browser.\n\nSlang dictionaries have been around hundreds of years. \"The Canting Academy, or Devil's Cabinet Opened\" was a 17th-century slang dictionary, written in 1673 by Richard Head, that looked to define thieves' cant. Other early slang dictionaries include \"A New Dictionary of the Terms Ancient and Modern of the Canting Crew\", first published circa 1698, and Francis Grose's \"A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\", first published in 1785. Grose's work was arguably the most significant English-language slang dictionary until John Camden Hotten's 1859 \"A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words\".\n\nIn recent years, dictionaries with a more academic focus have tried to bring together etymological studies in an attempt to provide definitive guides to slang while avoiding problems arising from folk etymology and false etymology. The study of slang is now taken seriously by academics, especially lexicographers like the late Eric Partridge, devoting their energies to the field and publishing on it, including producing slang dictionaries.\n\n\nThere have also been a subsequent amount of tongue-in-cheek efforts which tend to focus on the more vulgar slang terms:\n\nThe Urban Dictionary relies on user contributions, which can introduce both humour and inaccuracies.

{"id": "34457415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34457415", "title": "Teylers Oval Room", "text": "Teylers Oval Room\n\nThe Oval Room in the Teylers Museum was the first part of the museum (though it was not called a museum yet) that was opened in 1784. It could be entered through the garden of the fundatiehuis, the former home of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst. The building has an oval shape built around its centerpiece, a mineralogical cabinet. The Oval Room consists of two floors; the ground floor with its display cabinets and a gallery of books that connects to the Teylers Library. On top of the room, on the roof, the astronomical observatory used to be a landmark that could be seen for miles along the river Spaarne. The gallery and observatory are longer accessible to the public, though the gallery can be seen from the ground floor.\n\nIn 1779 the board of the Teylers Foundation (\"Teylers Stichting\") commissioned Leendert Viervant, the Amsterdam-based architect of amongst others the church of Ouderkerk aan den Amstel and the town hall of Weesp to build a \"book and hobby room\" or \"book and art room\" (\"boek- en liefhebberyzaal\" or \"Boek en Konstzael\") in the garden of the former house of Pieter Teyler. After his death, Teyler bequeathed a fortune for the pursuit of science, religion, and the arts. His house had been renamed the \"fundatiehuis\" to house this \"fundatie\" or foundation. The collections of Pieter Teyler himself, but also of the foundation, was growing and space was needed to show the collections in an appropriate way, while also affording space to hold lectures for teaching and to conduct lab experiments with the expensive instruments that had been purchased. Viervant designed both the mineralogical cabinet and the room around it in the neoclassicist style that was popular in the Netherlands at that time. For example, the Ionic order was chosen by Viervant for the columns in the room because it was regarded as the \"ideal order for the dignified control and moderation associated with the arts and sciences\".\n\nThe Oval Room walls have been timbered with pine wood on the floors and oak wood on the walls. In the walls there are alcoves both on the ground floor and on the gallery, which contain parts of the collections. Along the gallery, books have been stored in the alcoves, and on the ground floor mainly scientific instruments. The books could be accessed via the staircase. The cast iron gallery railing included fold-out supports which were the most expensive part of the room and comprised 15% of the total building costs. Every bookcase alcove is topped by the name and a stucco profile of a classical Greek writer or philosopher.\n\nIn the middle of the room an extensive mineralogical collection is housed in a special cabinet that is set up along the same principles as the Fersman Mineralogical Museum built in 1716. This is the second such cabinet designed by Viervant. The first had a display surface that could double as a library table. That table was on rails, so that it could be moved out of the room when necessary, such as for electricity or other lab experiments.\n\nThe Teylers Museum, and with that the Oval Room, was the first museum open to the public in the Netherlands. Though the Oval room included a library, observatory, and lab to show experiments to the public, the concept of a museum did not really exist yet when it was completed in 1781. At the time, the Teylers Oval room was seen more as a very large version of a curiosity cabinet with room to show large demonstrations of technological innovations, such as were done with the electrostatic generator. Some of the directors felt it should really contain a museum-like collection.\n\nIn the first years the central piece was not a cabinet, but a table on which experiments would be done. The central table would be moved out of the way when the electrostatic generator was going to be used. The drawings and minerals in the collection were stored in this central piece The instruments were stored in cabinets on the first floor.\n\nThe ground floor is still open for visitors, though they now enter and exit from a new door on the east side that was built in 1878. The old door to Teyler's fundatiehuis is closed off. The way the contents are displayed in the room has barely changed since 1800. In the central exhibition cabinets minerals have been showcased, as well as the Top of the Mont Blanc, separated from the mountain in 1787 by one of the first climbers of that mountain, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure. In the cabinets on the sides and outside cabinets, instruments are showcased. For example a world and celestial globe by George and Dudley Adams from London.\n"}
{"id": "38157643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38157643", "title": "Thomas Aquinas Dictionary", "text": "Thomas Aquinas Dictionary\n\nThe Thomas Aquinas Dictionary is a collection of quotations by medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas, indexed by keywords contained within the quotations. Most of the quotations are taken from the \"Summa Theologica\", with additional material from the \"Summa contra Gentiles\". The quotations are listed without additional commentary or explanatory notes, although the volume does contain an introduction to the work of Thomas Aquinas written by Theodore E. James. Scholarly reviews were critical of the work when it was published, particularly in terms of the selection and arrangement of material. The book does, however, still appear in bibliographies of reference material on Thomas Aquinas.\n\nThe \"Thomas Aquinas Dictionary\" was published by the Philosophical Library in 1965, with a British edition published the same year by Vision. It is one of a series of quotation dictionaries compiled by editor Morris Stockhammer, the others covering Immanuel Kant, Karl Marx and Plato.\n\nThe \"Dictionary\" contains quotations from the works of Thomas Aquinas, arranged under an alphabetical list of keywords, beginning with \"Abstinence\" and ending with \"Zeal\". Each entry lists quotations containing the word; the length of the quotations is generally one sentence. The dictionary does not contain any additional commentary or explanatory notes, with the exception of the introduction by Theodore E. James, which contains a summary of the life and works of Thomas Aquinas.\n\nMost of the quotations are taken from the \"Summa Theologica\", Aquinas's best-known work, with others from the \"Summa contra Gentiles\". The keywords were selected on the basis of being of interest to the twentieth-century student, omitting some medieval concepts.\n\nSince its publication, the \"Dictionary\" has been frequently cited in bibliographies of recommended reference works on the life of Thomas Aquinas, although it attracted criticism in scholarly reviews when it was first published, mainly due to the selection and arrangement of material. Vernon Bourke wrote a particularly dismissive review in the medieval history journal \"Speculum\", asserting that \"scholars need not concern themselves with this so-called dictionary\". He was especially concerned about the quotations being printed without context or commentary, thus limiting their usefulness or potentially altering their meaning.\n\nHans Bynagle, in his 21st-century guide to philosophical reference material, \"Philosophy: A Guide to the Reference Literature\", echoed these concerns, pointing to the entry for \"horse and donkey\", which states: \"Horse and Donkey are different beings, but both are animals\". Bynagle also commented that, due to the keyword method of indexing used, the work lacks headings for concepts which would normally appear in discussions of Aquinas, such as \"Ontology\", \"via negativa\" or \"The Five Ways\".\n\nA reviewer in \"The Review of Metaphysics\" (signed \"J. K.\") similarly pointed to the absence of Christian theological terms such as \"Redemption\", \"Incarnation\" and \"Trinity\". J.K. did highlight, however, the value of the dictionary in containing \"an impressive number of entries most of which get several important text references\". For him, the introduction was one of the strongest parts of the \"Dictionary\", a view shared by others; even Bourke, who was otherwise critical of the work, described it as \"competent\".\n\n"}

Moreover, a virtual museum can refer to the mobile or World Wide Web offerings of traditional museums (e.g., displaying digital representations of its collections or exhibits); or can be born digital content such as, 3D environments, net art, virtual reality and digital art. Often, discussed in conjunction with other cultural institutions, a museum by definition, is essentially separate from its sister institutions such as a library or an archive. Virtual museums are usually, but not exclusively delivered electronically when they are denoted as online museums, hypermuseum, digital museum, cybermuseums or web museums.\n\nThe following museums were created with digital technology before the web gained any form of popularity or mass usability. CD-ROM and postal mail distribution made these museums available world-wide, before web browsers, fast connections and ubiquitous web usage.\n\n\nThe following online museums were pioneers. At that time, web pages were simpler, bandwidth was slower, the concepts of the online museum were still developing, and there were limited multimedia technologies available within web browsers. Some online museums began in other (not web site) electronic forms, or were established by existing physical museums. Some online museums have become significant sources of scholarly information, including extensive citations within Wikipedia.\n\n\nMost physical museums now have an online presence, with varying degrees of online information. At one end of the spectrum, museums provide simple contact and background information, and a listing of exhibitions (brochure museums). On the other end of the spectrum are museums that exist only online, or those that have a physical building but offer extensive online exhibits, interactive online features, multimedia, and searchable or browsable collections (content museums, learning museums, virtual museums).\n\nThe following are a few other museums online:\n\nThe digitalization of museums is a task that has combined efforts, budgets and research from many museums, cultural associations and governments around the world. For the last few years, there have been projects related to Information Society Technologies dealing with: preservation of cultural heritage, restoration and learning resources. Some examples of contributions in the field of digital and virtual museography: Euromuse.net (EU), DigiCULT (EU), Musings, Digital Museums Projects. European Community has founded various projects to support this filed, like V-Must, the Virtual Museum Transnational Network that aims to provide the heritage sector with the tools and support to develop Virtual Museums that are educational, enjoyable, long-lasting and easy to maintain.\n\nIn 2017, Virtual Multimodal Museum (ViMM) continues to explore the core concept of the virtual museum where the Working group 1.1 is actively working towards re-defining the definition of the virtual museum in order to keep up with current research.\n\nThe leading international conference in the field of museums and their websites is the annual \"Museums and the Web\" conference.\n\nIn 2004, Roy Hawkey of King's College London reported that \"Virtual visitors to museum websites already out-number physical (on-site) visitors, and many of these are engaged in dedicated learning\".\n\nIn establishing virtuality and promoting cultural development, the goal is not merely to reproduce existing objects, but to actualize new ones. Information and communication technologies are not merely tools for processing data and making it available, but can be a force and stimulus for cultural development.\n\nThere are several types of interactive environments. One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides a sense of place using various spatial references. They usually use 3D modelling, VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) and now X3D(successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, X-ray imaging, 3D laser scanning, IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of EU-funded projects, the ViHAP3D, a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers. Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is QTVR. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited.\n\nIn 2013, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) trialled a virtual museum tour system that uses mobile telepresence technology and requires a high-speed broadband connection. The technology allows remote visitors, for example school students from regional and remote Australia, to interact with a museum facilitator through a robot equipped with an omni-directional camera. Each remote visitor is able to control their own view of the museum gallery.\n\nMuseums have a variety of top-level domain names. In the United States, many are .org. Some are .gov, or governmental domains for other countries. A few are .edu in the US, either as part of a larger educational institution, or grandfathered in when .edu regulations changed (e.g., as with the Exploratorium). The \".museum\" domain name is used by some museums, as organized by MuseDoma, but is not widely used.\n\nDepending on the scientific position of the researchers, industry or instrumental use, virtual museums are regarded and used in different ways. For example, as a kind of creative activity; an innovative educational tool; a fashion or advertising project; а room with multimedia capabilities; the representation of the traditional Museum on the Internet; a gadget; the publication; website; type of communication; the electronic catalogue, etc.\n\n"}

The report, which evaluates the core academic requirements at over 1,100 public and private universities, has been published annually since 2009.\n\n\"What Will They Learn?\" was first published in 2009. The report assigns a letter grade to over 1,100 universities based on how many of the following seven core subjects are required: composition, literature, foreign language, American history, economics, mathematics and science. ACTA concludes that most of the country's leading universities do not have rigorous general education requirements.\n\nThe first edition of the study looked at 100 schools across the nation. Only 5 institutions garnered an \"A\" rating, whereas 25 earned an \"F.\" Among the \"F\" institutions were several schools traditionally considered elite, including Yale University.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 edition, ACTA expanded \"What Will They Learn?\" to include 718 institutions. The grades broke down to 17 \"A's\" (2%), 252 \"B's\" (35%), 209 \"C's\" (29%), 136 \"D's\" (19%) and 104 \"F's\" (14%).\n\nThe 2011-2012 edition of \"What Will They Learn?\" was released on August 30, 2011. The study evaluated the general education requirements of 1,012 colleges and universities. The grade breakdown percentages remained similar to previous years, with 19 schools earning an \"A\" grade.\n\nThe 2012-2013 edition of \"What Will They Learn?\" was released in October 2012. The study evaluated 1,070 colleges and universities, with 21 schools earning an \"A\" grade. Regent University, which received an \"A\" grade from ACTA, was subsequently awarded $400,000 by the Beazley Foundation in recognition of the school's strong core curriculum.\n\nThe 2013-2014 edition of \"What Will They Learn?\" was released in October 2013. The study evaluated 1,091 colleges and universities, with 22 schools earning an \"A\" grade. The 2013-2014 edition included the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education's campus free speech \"Spotlight\" rating alongside the What Will They Learn? grades.\n\nThe 2014-2015 edition of the study, which analyzed 1,098 institutions of higher learning, issued 23 \"A\" grades.\n\nThe 2015-2016 edition of the study, which analyzed 1,108 institutions of higher learning, issued 24 \"A\" grades.\n\nThe 2016-2017 edition of the study, which analyzed over 1,100 institutions of higher learning, assigned 25 \"A\" grades.\n\nThe 25 schools on the \"What Will They Learn?\" \"A-List\" for 2016-2017 include Baylor University, Bluefield College, California Polytechnic State University–San Luis Obispo, Christopher Newport University, Clark Atlanta University, Colorado Christian University, Gardner-Webb University, Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, Morehouse College, Pepperdine University, Regent University, St. Katherine College, Southwest Baptist University, St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe), Thomas Aquinas College, Thomas More College of Liberal Arts, United States Air Force Academy, United States Coast Guard Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, United States Military Academy, University of Dallas, University of Georgia, and University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma.\n\nNationally syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker wrote that \"What Will They Learn?\" is a guide that can \"help parents and students determine where they might get the best bang for their buck.\" The study has been featured in the \"Washington Post\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", and newspapers across the United States. Upon the report's release in 2009, the founder of \"US News and World Report\", Mel Elfin, reassured ACTA that the anger of some of the higher education establishment \"is probably a sign that you are on the right track [to reform].\"\n\nIn response to the strong performance of historically black colleges and universities, Michael Lomax, president of the United Negro College Fund, said \"the ACTA review’s finding that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) ‘demonstrate overall stronger general education requirements than other public and private institutions’ confirms the important role these universities continue to play in American higher education.\n\nIn 2009, Debra Humphreys, vice president for communications and public affairs at the Association of American Colleges and Universities, said, \"as is often the case with ACTA, they have posed some very good questions,\" but Humphreys criticized the study for being narrow in scope and called its methodology \"inadequate.\"\n\nACTA countered that claim by commissioning a Roper study in 2011. The study found that 70 percent of Americans agreed with ACTA that all students should be required to take core curriculum classes. That number jumped to 80 percent among 25- to 34-year-olds who, according to the survey, are those \"just out of college who may find learnings from such classes are helpful in the job\nmarket.\"\n\nMurray Sperber of Indiana University said the report \"documents higher education's dirty little secret: Schools are charging more each year and requiring many fewer traditional education courses. This results in a legion of students with spotty educations and meaningless degrees.\"\n"}
