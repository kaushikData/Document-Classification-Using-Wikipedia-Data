These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps. The album was released to mixed reviews, but was a commercial success.\n\nShortly after independent release in June 1987, the JAMs were ordered by the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society to destroy all unsold copies of the album, following a complaint from ABBA. In response, the JAMs disposed of many copies of \"1987\" in unorthodox, publicised ways. They also released a version of the album titled \"1987 (The JAMs 45 Edits)\", stripped of all unauthorised samples to leave periods of protracted silence and so little audible content that it was formally classed as a 12-inch single.\n\nA limited edition release subjected to recall and a destruction order, \"1987\" became something of a rarity and by 2000, mint condition copies were trading for £60.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1987, Bill Drummond decided to make a hip hop record under the pseudonym \"the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\". Despite his small knowledge about modern music technology, he invited Jimmy Cauty, a former member of the band Brilliant, to join him. Cauty reportedly agreed, and the JAMs' debut single \"All You Need Is Love\" was independently released on 9 March 1987 as a limited-edition one-sided white label 12-inch. Cauty conceived the pseudonym \"Rockman Rock\", and Drummond used the nickname \"King Boy D\".\n\nThe reaction to \"All You Need Is Love\" was positive; the British music newspaper \"Sounds\" listed it as the single of the week, and lauded The JAMs as \"the hottest, most exhilarating band this year\". \"All You Need Is Love\"'s reliance on uncleared, often illegal samples made commercial release impossible. In response, the JAMs re-edited the single, removing or doctoring the most antagonistic samples, and re-released it as \"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\" in May 1987. According to Drummond, profits from this re-release funded the recording of their first album. The JAMs had completed and pressed copies of the album by early May 1987, but did not have a distributor.\nLike \"All You Need Is Love\", the album was made using an Apple II computer, a Greengate DS3 digital sampler peripheral card, and a Roland TR-808 drum machine. Using portions from existing works and pasting them into new contexts, with the duo stealing \"everything\" and \"taking... plagiarism to its absurd conclusion,\" several songs were liberally plagiarised. This mashup of samples was underpinned by rudimentary beatbox rhythms and overlaid with Drummond's raps of social commentary, esoteric metaphors and mockery. Drummond would later say in an interview that:\n\nWe'd just got ourselves a sampler, and we went sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it... When we put that record out, we knew what we were doing was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.\n\n\"1987\" is built around samples of other artists' work, \"to the point where the presence of original material becomes questionable\". The album is raw and unpolished, the sound contrasting sharply with the meticulous production and tight house rhythms of the duo's later work as the KLF. The beatbox rhythms are basic (\"weedy\", according to \"Q\" magazine), samples often cut abruptly, and distinctive plagiarised melodies are often played with a high-pitched rasping accompaniment. The plagiarised works are arranged so as to juxtapose with each other as a backdrop for the JAMs' rebellious messages and social comments. Lyrics include self-referential statements of the JAMs' agenda that clash with the fictional backstory adopted from \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\". Several songs (such as \"The Queen and I\" and \"All You Need Is Love\") have specific societal targets for Drummond's satirical raps.\n\nThe album's opening song, \"Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees\", begins with simulated human sexual intercourse noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's first sample is \"Here we come...\" from the Monkees' theme. It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: \"Here we come, crawling out of the mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves from one end of time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes\". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow – \"We're not The Monkees, I don't even \"like\" The Monkees!\" – before it gets interrupted by an original a cappella vocal line that later became The KLF's \"Justified and Ancient\" – \"We're justified/And we're ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any harm\".\n\nThe track is followed by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, \"Mind the gap...\". \"Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)\" follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's \"Take Five\" and Fred Wesley's \"Same Beat\", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: \"I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told me the truth about the basket of lies\". \"Sounds\" considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: \"This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history\".\n\nThe first side of the LP closes with \"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\", a homage to Jimmy Cauty that plagiarises from an array of sources, including the \"Bo Diddley Beat\" and \"Sunrise Sunset\" from the \"Fiddler on the Roof\" soundtrack. Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\", \"Since I've Been Loving You\" and \"Houses of the Holy\" can be also heard in this track. Side one would not close until \"Why Did You Throw Away Your Giro?\", a track consisting of a question in reference to a line from \"Rockman Rock\" from a female adult jokingly answered by a male person, ended in 20 seconds.\n\nThe second side begins with \"Mẹ Ru Con\", an emotive Vietnamese song originally titled \"Ca Dao Mẹ\", written by Trịnh Công Sơn performed \"a cappella\" by The JAMs' friend Duy Khiem. According to Drummond, it was a spontaneous recital by Khiem, who was in the studio contributing clarinet and tenor sax to the album. Khiem's vocal performance was later sampled by The KLF on the ambient house soundtrack to their movie, \"The Rites of Mu\".\n\n\"The Queen and I\" features extensive samples from ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\", often overlain with a rasping detuned accompaniment. These lead into Drummond's satirical and discontent rapping, a fictional account of his march into the British House of Commons and Buckingham Palace to demand answers. The song also protests the involvement of cigarette companies in sport (\"When cancer is the killer/John Player run the league\") and lambasts the \"tabloid mentality\" (\"They all keep talking about Princess Di's dress\"). The Sex Pistols' \"God Save the Queen\" is briefly sampled. After nearly three minutes of samples from the television show \"Top of the Pops\", as well as sound clips from programmes and advertisements on other TV channels, Drummond cries \"Fuck that, let's have The JAMs!\". The acerbic \"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\" follows. A \"stunning audio collage\" featuring an AIDS public information film, a rerecording of glamour model Samantha Fox's \"Touch Me (I Want Your Body)\", and the nursery rhyme \"Ring a Ring o' Roses\", \"All You Need Is Love\" comments on sex and the British media's reaction to the AIDS crisis.\n\nThe final track on the album is \"Next\", which Drummond describes as \"the only angst-er on the album\", with \"imagery of war and sordid sex\". The track samples Stevie Wonder's \"Superstition\", Scott Walker's \"Next\" from \"Scott 2\", the Fall's \"Totally Wired,\" and Julie Andrews' \"The Lonely Goatherd\" from \"The Sound of Music\", alongside Khiem's original melancholy clarinet and tenor saxophone contributions (\"a saxophone of stupefying tediosity\", according to Danny Kelly).\n\nBill Drummond summed up The JAMs' approach to composition in the first \"KLF Information Sheet\", sent out in October 1987: \"We made [the album] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff that came out of our mouths... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts.\" Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: \"It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing.\"\n\nIn 1991, Drummond admitted: \"We didn't listen to \"1987 What The Fuck's Going On\" for a long time, and when we did we were embarrassed by it because it was so badly recorded. But I still felt we were able to get a lot out of ourselves through it.\"\n\n\"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)\" was released in June 1987 on The JAMs' own record label, \"The Sound of Mu(sic)\".\n\n\"1987\" was met with mixed reviews in most of the major British music publications, including \"Melody Maker\", \"NME\", \"Sounds\", and \"Q\", and the album came to the attention of the management of Swedish pop group ABBA: The JAMs had sampled large portions of the ABBA single \"Dancing Queen\" on the track \"The Queen And I\". A legal showdown with ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society (MCPS) followed, \"1987\" was forcibly withdrawn from sale, and The JAMs were ordered to \"deliver up the master tape, mothers, stampers and any other parts commensurate with manufacture of the record\".\n\nKing Boy D and Rockman Rock travelled to ABBA's home country of Sweden, in the hope of meeting with ABBA personally, taking an \"NME\" journalist and photographer with them, along with most of the remaining copies of the LP and a gold disc of the album. Failing to find ABBA in residence at Polar Studios in Stockholm, they instead presented the gold disc to a blonde prostitute they pretended was Agnetha \"fallen on hard times.\" Of the original LP's stock, some copies were disposed overboard on the North Sea ferry trip across, and the remainder were burned in a field in Gothenburg before dawn (as shown on the cover of their next album, \"Who Killed The JAMs?\"). The JAMs also played a recording of \"The Queen and I\" loudly outside the offices of ABBA's record label, Polar Music. The trip was unexpectedly eventful, the JAMs accidentally hitting and killing a moose, and later being shot at by a farmer, a bullet cracking the engine of their Ford Galaxie police car. They were, by their own account, towed back to England by the AA.\n\nThe JAMs were not entirely sure what they would have said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told \"NME\": \"We were hoping to explain [our artistic justification] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them producing our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings.\" King Boy: \"Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit do you? Come and do the new JAMMS [sic] album.'\" In 1994, \"The Guardian\" looked back on the Swedish sojourn as \"a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [the duo's] collaborative career... \"We were being totally stupid about it\" Drummond later acknowledged.\"\n\nThe JAMs offered what they claimed were \"the last five\" copies of \"1987\" for sale at £1000 each in a full-page advertisement in the April 1988 edition of \"The Face\". Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: \"We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of \"1987\"... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back... [B]ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement and we can do what we like with them and not break any laws.\"\n\n\"Q\" magazine had mixed reactions to \"1987\", saying that there are \"too few ideas being spread too thin\". The magazine criticised some songs as \"overlong\" and questioned the overuse of sampling as \"the impression of a random hotchpotch\". \"Q\" also unfavourably commented that The JAMs' \"use of the beatbox is altogether weedy\". It liked some of its tracks: \"there are some wickedly amusing ideas and moments of pure poetry in the lyrics while some of the musical juxtapositions are both killingly funny and strong enough to stand repeated listenings\".\n\nA reviewer for \"Melody Maker\" found \"1987\" \"inspirational\", and \"the most exciting, most original record [he'd] heard in years\". He also argued that: \"Some snatches [of plagiarised music] rather outstay their welcome, tugging tell-tale glitz away from the clifftop and dangerously close to smug obviousness, but when the blows are kept short, sharp and very bloody, they make anything else you're very likely to hear on the radio dull and desperately humourless.\" \"It's easy to dismiss The JAMs frolics as little more than a brightly coloured sideshow to the shabbiest circus in town\", a later article said, but \"believe me, it's far more than a gimmick\".\n\nIn awarding \"1987\" the highest rating, a maximum five stars, \"Sounds\"—a publication that offered the duo's work consistent approval—mused, \"Taking the sound \"of\" the moment (hip hop) as a backbone, \"1987\" steals sound artefacts from anywhere ... and meshes them together with King Boy's hysterical 'Clydeside' rap method with bewildering effect. ... [Y]ou could call this sampling technology's answer to T. S. Eliot's arch cut up work, \"The Wasteland\". \" \"What's so good about The JAMs\", the magazine said, \"is the way they are capturing on disc the whole social and musical confusion and instability of 1987 Britain\".\n\n\"NME\"'s Danny Kelly was not so impressed. He also felt that the record was underdeveloped and The JAMs were not the most skilled of practitioners. \"Audacity, completely unfounded self-confidence, utter ruthlessness and a fast car will, of course, be useful attributes to the go-ahead noise-pirate of the 90s, but skill, feel, instinct, vision—y'know, boring old talent—will still be bottom line compulsories... it's in these latter commodities that the JAMs seem conspicuously undertooled.\" Compared to the output of DJ Code Money or Cut Creator (\"all humour, vibrancy and colour... – aerosoled version[s] of \"The Book of Kells\"\") Kelly felt Drummond's efforts to be a \"glitter-crusted charity Christmas card\". A later \"NME\" item called \"1987\" \"the best comment on sampling culture ever made\".\n\nA retrospective review by AllMusic commented that \"1987\" is \"a hilarious record\" filled with \"comments on music terrorism and [The JAMs'] own unique take on the Run-D.M.C. type of old-school rapping\"; and \"The Penguin Price Guide for Record & CD Collectors\" called \"1987\" an \"entirely brilliant example of the art of disc-jockey-as-producer\". Giving another retrospective review from across the Atlantic, \"Trouser Press\" described \"1987\" as \"energetic\" and \"a loopy dance album that isn't unlike a lot of sampled records, but proceeds from an entirely different cultural understanding.\"\n\nBill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were responsible for the concept and production of \"1987\", its lyrics and the TR-808 beatbox rhythms. Drummond provided rap, and an additional rapper introduced as 'Chike' appears on \"Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)\" and \"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\". Duy Khiem contributed lead vocals to \"Mẹ Ru Con\", as well as clarinet and tenor sax to \"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)\" and \"Next\". Uncredited female vocalists on \"Hey Hey We Are Not The Monkees\", \"Rockman Rock (Parts 2 & 3)\" and \"All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)\" are identified by one source as Cressida Cauty (Jimmy's wife) and June Montana, the lead vocalists of the KLF Communications side project Disco 2000.\n\n\nFollowing the enforced deletion of the \"1987\" album, the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu released an edited version as a 12\" single, with all of the unauthorised samples removed, leaving sparse instrumentation, Drummond's social commentary and, in several cases, long periods of silence; the \"Top of the Pops\" section of the original LP yielded three minutes of silence on \"45 Edits\", and the only sample remaining from the original was The Fall's \"Totally Wired.\"\n\nThe edited single was sold through normal retail channels and also offered as a \"reward\" to anyone who returned a copy of the LP to The JAMs' post office box. The single was released on 16 October 1987, and on 31 October 1987 The JAMs announced that the case with ABBA \"is now closed\". The sleevenotes to \"1987: The JAMs 45 Edits\" explain to the purchaser in a rather tongue-in-cheek fashion how to recreate the original \"1987\" album for themselves:\n\nThis record is a version of our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' with all of the copyright infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.\n\nBy 2000, a copy of the original version of \"1987\" in mint condition was worth £60, whereas a mint copy of \"1987: The JAMs 45 Edits\" was worth a mere £10.\n"}
{"id": "56155535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56155535", "title": "API Standard 682", "text": "API Standard 682\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) has approximately 500 technical standards for processes and components. “Pumps - Shaft Sealing Systems for Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps” (API Standard 682) is the standard about end face mechanical seals. The purpose of API 682 is to assist in the selection and operation of end face mechanical seals in centrifugal pumps. It is based on the combined knowledge and experience of seal manufacturers, engineering companies and end users. API 682 is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries but is often referenced for other types of equipment and industries.\n\nBy the late 1980’s, mechanical seals had been accepted as the preferred method for sealing rotating pumps for many years. However, mechanical seal standards were generally buried in other standards such as DIN 24960, ANSI B73 and API 610. All of these standards were primarily pump standards and any references to seals were directed at how mechanical seals would interact with pumps.\n\nAPI 610 is the API standard about centrifugal pumps and is primarily intended for use in the petroleum, natural gas and chemical industries. Although the 1st through 7th Editions of API 610 included specifications for mechanical seals, beginning with the 8th Edition, API 610 defers to API 682 for seal specifications.\n\nIn the late 1980’s a group of refinery equipment engineers and managers began to compare sealing solutions in refinery applications. This group, led by V. R. Dodd of Chevron, came up with a general plan and the American Petroleum Institute (API) agreed to establish a standard for mechanical seals: API 682. A Task Force was formed in 1990 and the first meeting was held in January 1991. This Task Force was composed of fourteen members from various refineries, seal and pump manufacturers. API 682, First Edition, was published in October 1994.\n\nOne interesting aspect of API 682 is that it includes a strong set of defaults. That is, unless the user indicates otherwise, API 682 makes default choices for specifics such as:\n\nSome statements within API 682 are normative, that is, required, whereas others are informative, that is, descriptive but not required. In particular, many of the illustrations are informative. This distinction has not always been apparent to the reader.\n\nSubsequent editions of API 682 have been published. The current edition is 4th Edition.\n\nThe first edition of API 682 was entirely new although parts of it were extracted from the pump standard API 610 and existing API standard paragraphs.\n\nThe mission statement for the 1st Edition was:\n\n\"This standard is designed to default to the equipment types most commonly supplied that have a high probability of meeting the objective of at least three years of uninterrupted service while complying with emissions regulations.\"\n\nAlthough this mission statement no longer appears in the standard, it remains the basic principle driving the work of the API 682 Task Force and its relevance remains the same for the 4th Edition as it did for the 1st. \n\nIn addition to providing requirements for mechanical seals, the 1st Edition of API 682 also provided a guide on how to select the correct seal for a number of common refinery applications. In order to provide this seal selection guide, it was necessary to categorize applications into a number of services: \n\nIt was also necessary to categorize the many different type seals that were used in these services. Three seal types were designated: \n\nPrior to API 682, 1st Edition, multiple seals were designated as being either “tandem” or “double” seals; however, advances in seal design had rendered these classic terms obsolete. As a result, there was some confusion on how multiple seals were designated. The task force decided to use a more descriptive designation and chose to define dual seal arrangements. A dual seal would be two sets of sealing faces used in the same seal chamber. The fluid between these two sets of sealing faces could be either pressurized or unpressurized. Three standard arrangements were defined: \n\nAPI 682 1st Edition did not include containment seals or dry gas barrier seals.\n\nAfter having defined the services, seal types, and seal arrangements, a series of flowcharts were created to help in selecting a seal type, special materials or design requirements, and supporting piping plans.\n\nAPI 682 seals were to have a high probability of three years of reliable service. In order to prove this, seal performance testing on process fluids under representative pressures and temperatures was required. These performance tests are called “Qualification Tests”. \n\nThe general idea of the qualification test was to prove that the design was sound. The goal of the qualification test was to simulate a long-term steady state run followed by a process upset. The simulated process upset consisted of pressure changes, temperature changes and included loss of flush. The results of these tests were made available to the purchaser for evaluation. There was no acceptance criteria presented in API 682 1st Edition. \n\nIn addition to the qualification test of the design, every API 682 seal, whether new or repaired, is to be pressure tested with air before being shipped to the end user. \n\nOne of the major criticisms of API 682 1st Edition was that all the seals were “heavy duty” and therefore expensive with no alternatives for easy services. To some degree, this was intentional and was done in order to reduce inventory, promote familiarity with a limited number of seal types and to increase reliability. Another criticism of API 682 1st Edition was that it considered only API 610 pumps and only refinery applications. The chemical and petrochemical industries routinely use ASME pumps in addition to API 610 pumps. Broadening the scope of pumps covered by API 682 would allow standardized seals to be applied in a greater number of industries. \n\nIn 2nd Edition, the organization of API 682 was changed to conform to ISO standards: This reorganization means that there is no simple cross reference guide between 1st edition and 2nd edition paragraph numbers.\n\nThe 2nd Edition introduced the concept of seal categories. A seal category describes the type of pump into which the seal will be installed, the operating window, the design features, and the testing and documentation requirements. There are three categories designated as Category 1, 2, or 3. \n\nCategory 1 seals are intended for non-API-610 pumps. This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 500°F (-40°C and 260°C) and pressures to 315 PSI (22 bar). \n\nCategory 2 seal are intended for API-610 This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). \n\nCategory 3 seals are essentially the original seals of 1st Edition and are also intended for API-610 pumps. Category 3 seals are intended for the most demanding applications. This category is applicable for temperatures between –40°F and 750°F (-40°C and 400°C) and pressures to 615 PSI (42 bar). Design features include a distributed flush and floating throttle bushing for single seals. Additional documentation must be also provided.\n\nThree new seal types were introduced in the 2nd Edition: dry running containment seals, non-contacting seals, and dual gas barrier seals. \n\nContainment seals are the outer seal of Arrangement 2. In the 2nd Edition, containment seals can be used with a liquid buffer fluid, a gas buffer fluid or without a buffer fluid. In the case of a dry running containment seal, the containment seal will be exposed primarily to buffer gas or vaporized process fluid. Such containment seals must therefore be designed for continuous dry running while meeting the reliability goals of the standard. Dry running containment seals may be either contacting or non-contacting.\n\nNon-contacting inner seals are also introduced for Arrangement 2. One of the primary targets for non-contacting inner seals is in flashing hydrocarbon services. In some of these services, it is impossible to obtain adequate vapor margins to prevent flashing of the fluid in the seal chamber. This seal will be used with a dry running containment seal and the leakage past the inner seal will be piped to a vapor recovery system.\n\nThe other new seal type introduced in 2nd Edition was the dry running gas seal used in Arrangement 3. This seal is designed to run on a gas barrier fluid such as nitrogen.\n\nSeveral new piping plans were introduced in the 2nd Edition. These included additional options for dual pressurized liquid seals as well as new piping plans to support containment seals and dual pressurized gas seals.\n\nOne of the strengths of the 1st Edition was to provide qualification tests in which seal vendors would be required to prove the suitability of their seals for a given service. The 2nd Edition expanded on these requirements by adding new tests for containment seals and dual gas seals as well as defining acceptance criteria for all tests.\n\nFor all practical purposes, API 682 3rd Edition is the same as 2nd Edition. The completed 2nd Edition was submitted to the ISO Organization for approval as their ISO 21049. At the time, API and ISO had an agreement to jointly issue standards. The ISO Organization made slight editorial changes to 2nd Edition, including correcting typographical errors and unit conversions. Therefore, API had to re-issue a corrected 2nd edition but choose to label it as 3rd edition. API 682 3rd Edition was published in September 2004.\n\nAPI and ISO no longer have the agreement to jointly issue standards. The 2004 issue of ISO 21049 is the only issue and plans to update it are unknown.\n\nA twenty-five member task force spent six years updating 3rd Edition to 4th Edition. The 4th Edition of API 682 is organized similarly to the 2nd and 3rd Editions:\nAnnexes \n\nSeal Configuration refers to the orientation of the seal components in an assembly. In previous editions, orientations were defined as face-to-back, back-to-back, and face-to-face and these terms are carried over into the 4th Edition. In 4th Edition, any orientation (face to back, back to back, face to face) can be used in a dual seal provided that the design features are appropriate to the functionality of that particular arrangement. \nFourth Edition added additional specifications for clearances, placed these requirements in the form of tables and noted that seal components are not to be considered as “shaft catchers” to restrict shaft movement. The minimum clearances specified apply only to equipment within the scope of the standard. Equipment outside that scope, such as non-cartridge seals, older pumps, non-API 610 pumps and certain severe services, might benefit from larger clearances. \n\nBefore API 682, API 610 (the pump standard) used a simple seal code to specify seals. API 682 attempted to use a more comprehensive seal code; however, that code changed with every edition of API 682. The 4th Edition code, described in Annex D, is probably the best to date and includes some concepts and codes from the historical API 610 seal code. The new code uses eight fields:\nAs an example, the 4th Edition code might be 31B-LIN-075-53A to indicate:\n\nAnnex G provides illustrations and a short tutorial about each piping plan. As has been the case for every edition, changes were made to the standard piping plans. In particular, the piping plans now default to using transmitters with local indicators as part of the instrumentation.\n\nAPI standards are reviewed every five years and re-issued every ten years. A new Taskforce for API 682 was formed in 2017 and preparations for 5th Edition are underway.\n"}
{"id": "34147955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34147955", "title": "A Hidden Ulster", "text": "A Hidden Ulster\n\nA Hidden Ulster: people, songs and traditions of Oriel is a non-fiction book that is a referencing of Irish traditional music in the Oriel area by Irish singer Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin. The book was published by Four Courts Press in both hardback and paperback formats. The book garnered significant acclaim.\n\nPádraigín Ní Uallacháin, an Irish singer, song collector and academic comes from the area which was historically the Kingdom of Oriel in Ireland. She began writing the book in the years following her sister's death in May 1999.\n\nThe book's title, \"A Hidden Ulster\" alludes to the lack of public knowledge among singers and song historians on the songs of Oriel. Many songs now sung in Ulster are claimed to be from County Donegal, though many of the songs originate from Oriel. The title is also ties with Ní Uallacháin's father, Pádraig's complaint in 1939 to the Department of Education in Dublin, with whom he was employed at the time. The Department released a list of 80 songs to appear in Ireland's national curriculum, none of which were from Ulster, the northern quarter of the island of Ireland. In his complaint, Pádraig wrote:\n\n\"A Hidden Ulster\" contains expansive notes, lyrics and translations for 54 songs found in the Oriel area, including notation, published for the first time. The book has biographies of local singers, song collectors and songwriters from various periods, catalogues of songs collected in the area and previously-unpublished glass-stained photographs from the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.

Currently owned by Real Times Inc., it publishes daily online.\n\nIt was \"one of the earliest and most influential black newspapers.\"\n\nIt was founded as the weekly \"Atlanta World\" on August 5, 1928, by William Alexander Scott II who was only 26 at the time. Scott was a Morehouse graduate who later worked as the only black clerk on the Jacksonville to Washington, D.C., rail line, then in 1927 published a Jacksonville business directory to help blacks find each other. A year later he published a similar directory for Atlanta.\n\nAt the time, there was very little coverage of black educational institutions, businesses, prominent persons, churches, or other news of significance; the exceptions being crime news and death listings. This was despite the fact that Atlanta contained at the time the most prominent black educational institutions and persons of influence in the country. Whites lived to a large extent sealed off from black Atlanta and only interacted with blacks in service positions, virtually unaware of the black institutions and achievements taking place only a mile or two from their homes.\n\nThe paper became a semi-weekly in May 1930, and a triweekly in April 1931. In 1931, Scott also began publishing the \"Chattanooga Tribune\" and \"Memphis World\", and by doing so, founded the first chain of black newspapers, a chain that would eventually grow, at its peak, to fifty publications.\n\nIn 1932 Scott's \"Atlanta World\" became a daily and added \"Daily\" to its title, becoming the first black daily in the U.S. in the 20th century and the first successful one in all U.S. history. At the time of its founding, the only other black paper in the area was the \"Atlanta Independent\", which ceased publication in 1933. This left the \"Daily World\" as the only black paper in town. Its offices were on Auburn Avenue (\"Sweet Auburn\") celebrated as the home of the black business, social, and religious community and famously called by John Wesley Dobbs the \"richest Negro street in the world\".\n\nOn February 4, 1934, Scott was shot and killed; no one was ever convicted of the crime. His brother, Cornelius Adolphus (C.A.) Scott, took over as head of the paper, which subsequently adopted a more conservative, Republican position, reflecting Cornelius' own political views and his resentment over the Democrats' historical support of segregation and bias against African-Americans.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, the \"Daily World\" was criticized for not supporting sit-ins staged at several white-owned restaurants in downtown Atlanta. Advertisers threatened to pull their business if the demonstrations didn’t stop. C.A. Scott thought the demonstrations were dangerous, would work against the participants when they later would be looking for jobs, and reasoned that blacks would more effectively improve their situation by working towards ending segregation in education, obtaining political and voting influence, and improving their economic situations.\n\nEditorial content during this period was mainly neutral in tone, as opposed to actively promoting Negro rights or attacking racism, and as such white businesses did not feel threatened by its content, allowing the \"Daily World\" to secure advertising support from companies such as Coca-Cola, Sears, Roebuck and Rich's, the largest department store in the city.\n\nThe paper did urge blacks to shop at black-owned businesses (the \"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\" campaign). In the 1940s it sponsored voter registration efforts. The paper also covered the Atlanta black community's social, church, and sports news.\n\n\"The Daily World\" covered, on a national basis, topics including:\n\nCornelius Scott retired in 1997 and his great niece, Alexis Scott Reeves, took over as publisher. Reeves has previously been a journalist at the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", Atlanta's leading daily, and later vice-president of community affairs there.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the newspaper's circulation declined from its peak over 20,000 in the 1960s to a steady 10,000. By 2000, although it retained the word \"Daily\" in its name, it had cut back its publication schedule to only two editions per week, on Sundays and Thursdays.\n\nIn 2012, the \"Atlanta Daily World\" joined Real Times Inc., a publisher of five other African-American weeklies, including the \"Chicago Defender\" and \"New Pittsburgh Courier\". Alexis Scott said the sale would give the \"World\" more multimedia resources, calling it \"truly a new beginning for the paper.\"\n\nIn 2008 the Downtown Atlanta tornado damaged the \"World\"'s offices at 145 Auburn Avenue. The paper's operations subsequently moved to another location. In 2012 Scott announced plans to sell the building where this important part of Atlanta's black history took place; the buyer had plans to demolish the building. This caused outcry in the local Old Fourth Ward neighborhood at the loss of yet another historic building on Auburn Avenue. The Historic District Development Corporation, whose mission is historic preservation in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District launched an online petition to save the building. Owner and publisher Alexis Scott responded in a joint statement with developer Integral Group claiming that demolition of the building but saving the façade was the only feasible option to preserve any portion of the historic structure and thus preserve the history in some physical form.\n\nOn January 8, 2014 the offices were sold to commercial real estate developer and Sidewalk Radio host Gene Kansas who stated that he planned to restore the building for retail and residential use, and that it would be designed by Gamble and Gamble architects, the same firm redesigning the Clermont Motor Inn on Ponce de Leon Avenue in Poncey-Highland into a boutique hotel.\n\n\n"}

The bull split off the Bishopric of Gniezno from the Archbishop of Magdeburg. From a historical perspective, the bull is especially important as it contains the earliest written record of the Polish language. Slavic language scholar Aleksander Brückner called the document a \"złota bulla języka polskiego\" (the golden bull of the Polish language).\n\nThe election of Pope Innocent II in 1130 prompted a schism in the Roman Catholic Church. The Polish church supported the appointment of the Antipope Anacletus II, while Saint Norbert of Xanten, Archbishop of Magdeburg, remained faithful to Innocent. In Norbert's last years, he was chancellor and adviser to Lothair II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and persuaded him to lead an army to Rome to restore Innocent to the papacy in 1133.\n\nFollowing Norbert's death, Lothair pressured Innocent to issue an order rejecting the independence and authority of the Archbishop of Gniezno, and affirming the Archbishop of Magdeburg's authority over the Archdiocese of Gniezno and, by default, the entirety of the Polish church. As a result, the Polish prelates swore fealty to the Antipope.\n\nIn August 1135, in exchange for the independence of the Polish episcopate, Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, declared himself a vassal of Emperor Lothair and agreed to pay tribute to the Holy Roman Empire. On July 7, 1136, Pope Innocent upheld the independence of the Polish church from the Archdiocese of Magdeburg in a papal bull entitled \"Ex commisso nobis.\"\n\nDuring World War II, the archdiocesan archives in Gniezno were plundered by the Nazis, and the bull, along with numerous other artefacts, were moved West towards Germany. The Nazis were intercepted by the Soviet army, however, and the bull was taken to Moscow. The document remained in the Russian capital for fifty years before being returned to Gniezno.\n\nUpon the document's return, the National Library of Poland performed a series of tests on the bull under the authority of Professor Andrzej Wyczański. The scientists discovered that when viewed under ultraviolet light, the document showed traces of different washed-out text. Due to the lack of adequate testing facilities, the Library abandoned further research efforts, which have not been resumed since.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32937647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32937647", "title": "Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)", "text": "Bust of Louis XIV (Bernini)\n\nThe Bust of Louis XIV is a marble portrait by the Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It was created in the year 1665 during Bernini's visit to Paris. This sculptural portrait of Louis XIV of France has been called the \"grandest piece of portraiture of the baroque age\". The bust is on display at the Versailles Palace, in the Salon de Diane in the King's Grand Apartment.\n\nBernini had been invited to Paris as part of a larger diplomatic exchange between the Papacy and France. The ostensible reason for the visit was to create new designs for the Louvre Palace, but the young king Louis XIV had declared he also desired a portrait bust. Bernini’s designs for the Louvre did not go down well and were not acted upon; indeed their failure to be accepted was a reflection of the general antagonism between the Italian Bernini and certain members within the French court. However, the portrait bust, which depended upon a more personal relationship between the king and the artist, was completed and largely considered a great success.\n\nThe creation of the bust is incredibly well documented, thanks to efforts of the French diarist Paul Fréart de Chantelou, a steward at the court of Louis XIV, who befriended Bernini during his time in Paris.\n\nThe bust took just over three months to carve. Once potential blocks of marble had been selected, Bernini began by taking drawings (none of which survive) and small clay models of the king., However, it seems that once he had done this initial work, Bernini chose to work only during sittings with the king. His pupil, Giulio Cartari, began work on carving down the chosen block of marble (and would later do much of the drapery work), and then Bernini took over, taking forty days to complete the work. He had hoped to have twenty sittings with the king during the final carving process, but in fact there were thirteen of around one hour each.\n\nBernini's son and biographer, Domenico Bernini, noted the artistic arguments of his father as to why the King agreed to sit for such a length of time, explaining that the artist preferred to work from Truth (i.e. real life) rather than rely on the unnecessary imaginative extras that would creep into working from sketches. Equally, Bernini wanted to see the king, as he did many of this other sitters, not remaining immobile, but sitting and talking in such as way that Bernini could capture all his characteristics. Such an approach, with Bernini wishing to capture the figure in physical and psychological motion, was a common element of Bernini’s work: “mere resemblance is inadequate. One must express what goes on in the heads of heroes,” Bernini is recorded as saying. Bernini also observed the king in other locations - playing tennis, resting after lunch, or simply walking around court.\n\nFilippo Baldinucci (biographer of artists/art historian) records numerous events that advertise Bernini’s supposed influence on French culture, including one incident where Bernini’s rearranged the King’s hair to give greater exposure to the King’s brow - the new stye was apparently followed by all at the French court, and became known as the Bernini modification. Contemporary art historians are sceptical of this however; Jeanne Zarucchi claims that the alteration was deliberate, altering the shape of the King's head in an unflattering manner.\n\nSculpted late in his career, the bust’s grand nature, with its dramatic drapery and regal nature can be seen as a continuation of the bust Bernini executed for Francesco I D’Este.\n\nDespite not being an actual military commander, Bernini conceived of Louis in armour, drawing on notions of heroic kings such as Alexander the Great. Though a small man, Louis is figured as a stately character, fusing grandeur with a rich elegance of spirit. The drapery suggests the movement of wind, but also demonstrates the ability of the king to overcome such earthly distractions - he stares in to the distance, perhaps as if giving a military commands, turning his face against the direction the wind is blowing. Bernini may also have explored concept of Louis as the Sun King in the portrait, relating the king’s hair to sunbeams and the drapery as passing clouds.\n\nYet the idealisation of the king as a great emperor was also grounded in reality. It was a feature of Bernini’s sculpture that he could combine abstract notions such as grandeur and nobility with precise individual characteristics of the sitter. Bernini paid careful attention to and played with the hair, eyes, nose forehead, and the clothing of Louis making subtle adjustments that allowed Bernini to give the appearance of the individual sitter, being without it being a slavish copy or a lifeless abstraction.\n\nTo strengthen the military grandeur of the bust, Bernini designed a large globe to act as a pedestal for the bust, thus giving the appearance that the entire world was a platform for Louis’s majesty. Bernini also intended such a pedestal to raise the overall height of the artwork, so that the artwork would sit above and be out of touch of the spectator. However, this was never completed and the bust was moved from its position in the Louvre palace to the Palace of Versailles in 1680s, where it still remains now.\n\nDespite the carping of French critics at the court of Louis XIV, the bust was immediately considered a success, as the number of reproductions testifies. A mould of the bust was made in 1666; by 1669 at least seven plaster casts had been created. An early bronze version was taken to Quebec, Canada but is now lost. The only other early copy in bronze is in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\n\n"}

Social media users started using the image as a meme at the start of 2017, and it went viral in August 2017 as a way to depict different forms of infidelity. The meme has inspired various spin-offs and received critical acclaim.\n\nThe stock image was taken in the city of Girona in Catalonia, Spain, in mid-2015 by the photographer Antonio Guillem from Barcelona. Guillem told \"Wired\" he and the stock image models planned on having a session which would represent the concept of infidelity \"in a playful and fun way.\" The boyfriend and girlfriend in the photograph are known by their stage names \"Mario\" and \"Laura\". \"Laura\" later described the experience shooting the stock images, saying, \"When people saw us simulate those scenes in the street, they stopped to look and laugh and, in my case that I had to have a more serious face, I had a hard time to keeping it\".\n\nThe image was uploaded to Shutterstock with the caption: \"Disloyal man walking with his girlfriend and looking amazed at another seductive girl.\" Regarding the copyright status of this image, Guillem has stated that his images \"are subject to copyright laws and the license agreements of the microstock agencies. It's not allowed to use any image without purchasing the proper license in any possible way, so each one of the people that use the images without the license are doing it illegally. This is not the thing that really worries us, as they are just a group of people doing it in good faith, and we are not going to take any action, except for the extreme cases in which this good faith doesn't exist.\"\n\nThe first known use of the stock image as an internet meme was posted to a Turkish progressive rock Facebook group in January 2017. The post labeled the man as Phil Collins, who is being distracted by pop music away from progressive rock. This meme was reposted on an English-language progressive rock Facebook page the next day, and then on Twitter on February 2, 2017. Later that month, the original stock photograph was shared on Instagram and got almost 30,000 likes.\n\nThe meme started going viral on August 19, 2017, after a Twitter user posted the photograph with the man labeled \"the youth\" being distracted from his girlfriend \"capitalism\" by \"socialism\". Another Twitter user copied this meme, getting retweeted more than 35,000 retweets and nearly 100,000 favorites. The meme and its permutations went viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook. According to Adam Downer, an editor for \"Know Your Meme\", the distracted boyfriend meme helped popularize a meme format called object labeling. The girlfriend in the meme generally came to represent something that one is supposed to do, and the woman wearing red came to represent something more desirable or riskier.\n\nThe models \"Mario\" and \"Laura\" say they first learned about the memes based on their photograph when people started posting them to their social media accounts. Guillem told \"The Guardian\", \"I didn't even know what a meme is until recently. The models discovered the meme on social media and they told me about it. None of us could imagine the media repercussion that it has reached right now.\"\n\nSome brands started using the meme when it started going viral. In early January 2018, a version of the meme referencing the biblical story of Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt went viral on Twitter. The meme was used in a sign for the \"Enough! National School Walkout\" gun violence protest in March 2018. On June 25, 2018, Twitter user Ernie Smith noted other stock images in which the girlfriend from the original meme is surprised looking at screens.\n\nEarly variations of the distracted meme used other photos from Guillem's photo shoot of the three stock characters to create a story. In late January 2018, some social media users noted similarities between the meme and promotional image from \"\" featuring Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett. On April 16, 2018, a Twitter user called the Joshua Reynolds painting \"David Garrick Between Tragedy and Comedy\" the \"18th century equivalent\" of the distracted boyfriend meme, and the painting became popular as a similar meme with historic references.\n\nIn early May 2018, a Twitter user posted the coin commemorating the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with one of the characters from the meme. In early June 2018, film writer Peter Goldberg posted on his Twitter account a scene from Charlie Chaplin's 1922 short film \"Pay Day\" with a format similar to the distracted boyfriend meme. In early July 2018, a photograph of a woman eating ice cream with a man and a woman holding hands in Venice went viral because of its similarities to the distracted boyfriend meme. A version of the meme featuring a distracted groom went viral on Twitter in early October 2018.\n\nNathan Heller of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that \"the delight of the Distracted Boyfriend meme was not unlike the perverse pleasure taken by Distracted Boyfriend himself: it allowed America to turn its attention away from much more important commitments.\" Tiffany Kelly of \"The Daily Dot\" wrote that \"the distracted boyfriend meme's range, unintentionally created by Guillem's portfolio, set it apart from other popular internet content [in 2017].\" Clair Valentine listed the meme as one that defined the year 2017, writing, \"They say that often, the most specific stories are in fact the most universal, and this meme's absurd popularity proves that point beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\n\nThe meme made various lists of the top memes of 2017, including NDTV \"The Next Web\", \"PC Magazine\", \"The Ringer\", and \"Narcity\". The meme was listed on \"The Washington Post\"s \"Meme Hall of Fame of 2017\", calling it \"the ultimate stock photo meme with endless permutations.\" The Reddit moderators of the /r/MemeEconomy subreddit called the distracted boyfriend meme one of the best memes of 2017. In April 2018, the distracted boyfriend meme won the Best Meme of 2017 category at the 10th Annual Shorty Awards.\n\nJoe McCarthy of \"Global Citizen\" wrote the original photograph depicts sexual harassment, and criticized most uses of the meme for failing \"to transcend the image's inherent, toxic sexism.\" In September 2018, Sweden's advertising ombudsman determined the internet service provider Bahnhof had broken rules against gender discrimination with its advertisement using the meme, which portrayed Bahnhof's employment opportunities as the attention-stealing woman and the ignored girlfriend as \"your current workplace\".\n\n"}

{"id": "48087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48087", "title": "Embarazada", "text": "Embarazada\n\nEmbarazada () is the Spanish word for pregnant. It is a false friend for native English-speaking students of Spanish who may attempt to say \"I'm embarrassed\" by saying \"estoy embarazada\". This phrase actually means \"I'm pregnant\" in Spanish. This may be confusing to Spanish speakers who are not familiar with the English word.\n\nThe correct way to say \"I'm embarrassed\" in Spanish is using the phrase \"tengo vergüenza\" (meaning \"I have shame\") or the more formal phrases \"me da vergüenza\" or \"estoy avergonzado/a\". Yet, in Spanish, there also exists the adjective \"embarazoso,\" meaning the same as \"embarrassing\" in its denotation of something that causes a sensation of unease, but not of shame. Complicating the issue further, \"embarazada\" can sometimes also mean \"hampered\", or \"hindered\". This more closely mirrors the original meaning of the English word \"embarrass\".\n\n\"Embarazada\" is a past participle, meaning that it indicates a state resulting from a previous action. In English, past participles usually end in \"-ed\" (e.g., \"destroyed), and \"embarazado\" therefore translates directly into English as \"impregnated\". It is a conjugated form of \"embarazar\" \"to impregnate\". As the word \"embarazado\" is masculine, it is rarely encountered in Spanish. It is more common for the word \"embarazada to be used to describe pregnancy. However, \"embarazado\" can be used as a past participle in perfect tenses, as in: \"El hombre ha embarazado a la mujer.\" (The man has impregnated the woman.)\n\nThe English word \"embarrassed\" is indirectly derived from the Spanish word. The first recorded usage of \"embarrass\" in English was in 1664 by Samuel Pepys in his diary. The word was derived from the French word \"embarrasser\", \"to block\" or \"to obstruct\", or figuratively, \"to put one in a difficult situation\". The first recorded usage was by Michel de Montaigne in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish \"embarazar\", whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in \"Cancionero de Stúñiga\" (Songbook of Stúñiga) by Álvaro de Luna.\n\nThe Spanish word likely comes from the Portuguese \"embaraçar\" (used in the same context of English \"embarrassment\"), which probably is a combination of the prefix \"em-\" (from Latin \"in-\" for \"in-\") with \"baraça\" \"a noose\", or \"rope\", which makes sense with the synonym \"encinta\" (\"on noose, on rope\" because of the old usage of women to wear a strap of cloth on their dresses when pregnant). \"Baraça\" originated before the Romans began their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BCE. Thus, \"baraça\" could be related to the Celtic word \"barr\", \"tuft\". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 700s BCE, the second group of Indo-European language speakers to do so.) However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of \"r\" for \"rr\" in Iberian Romance languages was not a known occurrence.\n\nSome say the Spanish word actually came from the Italian \"imbarazzare\", from \"imbarazzo\", \"obstacle\" or \"obstruction\". That word came from \"imbarrare\", \"to block\" or \"to bar\", which is a combination of \"in-\", \"in\", with \"barra\", \"bar\" (from the Vulgar Latin \"barra\", which is of unknown origin). The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by Bernardo Davanzati (1529-1606), long after the word had entered Spanish. Thus, modern scholars believe that the Italian word actually came from the Spanish one.\n\nWhen Parker Pen entered the Mexican market, its advertisements which claimed that Parker Pens \"won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you\" was mistranslated to \"No te embarazará chorreándose en tu bolsillo\", which means \"Won't leak in your pocket and impregnate you\".\n\n\n"}

This can be quantified simply as a measure of time, or it may entail a host of other criteria, involving other evidence of functionality or fitness for purpose.\n\nThe following depict the most commonly used international time/temperature curves:\nThere are many international variations for nearly countless types of products and systems, some with multiple test requirements.\n\nCanada's Institute for Research in Construction (a part of the National Research Council and publisher of Canada's model building code - NBC) requires a special test regime for firestops for plastic pipe penetrants. Fire endurance tests for this application must be run under 50Pa positive furnace pressure in order to adequately simulate the effect of potential temperature differences between indoor and outdoor temperatures in Canada's winters. Special hoods are applied here to provide suction on the top side of a test assembly in order to reach the 50Pa pressure differential. Afterwards, a 30PSI hose-stream test may be applied.\n\nOutdoor spray fireproofing methods that must be qualified to the hydrocarbon curve may be required to pass a host of environmental tests before any burn takes place, to minimize the likelihood that ordinary operational environments cannot render a vital system component useless before it ever encounters a fire.\n\nIf critical environmental conditions are not satisfied, an assembly may not be eligible for a fire-resistance rating.\n\nRegardless of the complexity of any given test regime that may lead to a rating, the premise is generally product certification and, most importantly listing and approval use and compliance. Testing without certification and installations that cannot be matched with an appropriate certification listing, are not usually recognised by any Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) unless it is in a realm where product certification is optional.\n\nThe following classifications may be attained when testing in accordance with UL 72.\n\nThis rating is the requirement in data safes and vault structures for protecting digital information on magnetic media or hard drives. Temperatures inside the protected chamber must be held below for the time period specified, such as Class 125-2 Hour, with temperatures up to outside the vault. The temperature reading is taken on the inside surfaces of the protective structure. Maintaining the temperature below 125 °F. is critical because data is lost above that temperature threshold, even if the media or hard drives appear to be intact.\n\nThis is the rating required to protect microfilm, microfiche, and other film-based information storage media. Above 150 °F (65.5 °C) film is distorted by the heat and information is lost. A Class 150-2 Hour vault must keep the temperature below 150 °F. for at least two hours, with temperatures up to 2,000 °F. (1,093.3 °C) outside the vault.\n\nThis rating is the requirement for protecting paper documents. Above 350 °F (176.7 °C) paper is distorted by the heat and information is lost. A Class 350-4 Hour vault must keep the temperature below 350 °F. for at least four hours, with temperatures up to 2,000 °F. (1,093.3 °C) outside the vault.\n\nTypically, most countries use the building elements curvefor residential and commercial spaces, which is nearly identical in most countries as that is what results by burning wood. The building elements curve is characterized jointly by, including, but not limited to, DIN4102, BS476, ASTM E119, ULC-S101, etc. For industrial facilities in the hydrocarbon & petrochemical industries, a hydrocarbon curve (such as UL 1709) is used, reflecting a more rapid temperature rise. The only commonly used exposure beyond this, apart from the more recent tunnel curves shown above, would be the jet fire exposure standards such as ISO 22899, which are used where equipment may be subject to the extreme heat and momentum effects of jet fire exposure.\n\nBig differences between different countries in terms of the use of the curves include the use of pipes, which shield the furnace thermocouples inside of NAFTA testing laboratories. This slows down the response time and results in a somewhat more conservative test regime in North America. On the other hand, the ISO based European curves run somewhat hotter for most of the test. North America also selectively uses a hose-stream test between 30 and 45PSI, to simulate real-world impacts and damages that may not be simulated in a laboratory. The US Navy even insists on a 90PSI hose-stream test for some of its assemblies, which may simulate the pressure available to firefighters in fighting a fire, but which has little to do with countermeasures against damaging effects of manual fire suppression. The hose-stream is simply intended to add a level of toughness to matters because without this, some fairly flimsy systems can pass a test, thus receive a rating and thus be permissible by a building code but be so weak that ordinary building use may damage a thus qualified system before it encounters a fire.\n\nGermany's DIN4102 also includes a significant impact test for a potential firewall, which is, however, applied from the wrong side: the cold side. Applying the impact from the cold side is more practical to do in a lab setting, however, potential impacts should come from the exposed side, not the unexposed side. Still, for the person designing, building and paying for the test, the fire resistance itself may be rather uneventful unless major problems appear. The burn itself is the long duration, up to 4 hours, but the hose stream test only lasts a few minutes, with large damage potential due to the sudden thermal and kinetic impacts, as the fire was upwards of 1,100 °C (see curves above), whereas the sudden hose-stream test is as cold as the domestic water fed to the fire hose used in the test, which might be 10-20 °C. This combined impact explains the debris that can be seen coming from test specimens during the hose stream test, as seen herein.\n\nBecause of the large differences in test regimes all over the world, even for \"identical products and systems\", organizations that intend to market their products internationally are often required to run many tests in many countries. Even where test regimes are identical, countries are often reluctant to accept the test results and particularly the certification methods of other countries.\n\nDuring a fire in a tunnel, as well as in the petrochemical industry, temperatures exceed those of ordinary building (cellulosic) fires. This is because the fuel for the fire is hydrocarbons, which burn hotter (compare hydrocarbon curve above to ASTM E119 curve), faster and typically run out of fuel faster as well, compared against timber. The added complication with tunnels is that the environment inside a \"tube\" is best described as a \"microclimate\". The heat cannot escape as well as it can in a burning refinery, which is in the open. Instead, the fire is confined to a narrow tube, where pressure and heat build up and spread rapidly, with little room for escape and little chance of compartmentalization. This scenario was tested and quantified, particularly during the \"Eureka Project\", run by Technische Universität Braunschweig's iBMB, Ekkehard Richter. The Netherlands, through Rijkswaterstaat in particular, mandated an extremely tough standard, the curve of which is shown in the gallery above.\n\nConstruction of a test sample consists of a mockup of a section of concrete floor, with typical mechanical and electrical utility components (pipes and cables) penetrating the floor assembly. A firestop mortar is applied around the penetrations.\n\nThe completed test sample is inserted into a furnace such that one side is exposed to a fire. The test is terminated when the fire stops successfully meet the test criteria in minimizing the amount of heat and smoke allowed to pass through the assembly, when the fire penetrates the fire stops. This determines the fire stop F-Rating. The length of time required for a penetrant or sample on average to exceed a specified average heat rise above ambient at any single location determines the duration for the FT Rating (Fire and Temperature). If a hose-stream test is passed afterwards, the rating can then be expressed as an FTH Rating (Fire, Temperature and Hose-stream). The lowest of the three determines the overall rating.\nPart B: The Burning Branding Test. This test consists of mock decks being subject the placement of a burning brand in the center of the mock deck to simulate the falling of burning embers during a wildfire. The deck must be absent of flame after the 40 minute test period and lack structural failure of any boards.\n\n"}

It was designed and built in 1841 by Michael Byrne. It is also known as Glenalvon and \"Glenalvon\" and Stables. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nGlenalvon House and farm was the family home of Michael Byrne, a publican. The homestead in the Victorian Georgian style was built in 1840. The homestead is managed by Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society Inc. as a museum that is open to the public for a modest fee. \n\nThe outline of the house is first shown on two town plans dated November 1840, although the stables are not shown at this time. It is thought that Michael Byrne, a publican, built the house around this time on the grant of 1 acre and 32 perches which was taken up in 1831. Although it is possible that the outbuildings were not shown, it is more likely that the stables were constructed later (which would be supported by the differing styles of the two buildings).\n\nMichael Byrne was born in County Wicklow, near Dublin in 1800, the son of Hugh and Sarah Byrne. Hugh Byrne was convicted without trial and transported to Australia, with his family, in 1802 for treasonous practices in the 1798 Irish Rebellion. Michael Byrne was made an apprentice to Lawrence Butler, Irish overseer of the NSW Government Lumber Yards, Sydney. Michael Byrne went on to own seven pubs in Campbelltown. He was trialled, though not found guilty, of kicking a man to death for non-payment of a debt. Byrne himself was made insolvent in 1844, after having built in 1841, \"Glenalvon\", the finest stone house in the town. He died in 1878 and is buried in the Irish corner of the Roman Catholic Cemetery in Campbelltown.\n\nBy the 1840s various members of the Byrne family were experiencing financial difficulties, including Michael who by 1844 owed his brother-in-law, John Keighran (publican) the sum of A₤880 17s 3d. As partial payment of the debt John accepted the property in Lithgow Street and a farm also owned by Byrne. Keighran is believed to have taken up residence in Glenalvon, along with his wife Catherine Byrne, sometime in 1853. They would eventually have thirteen children there. Upon the death of both parents little more than a year apart in 1858, the property passed to two of their sons John and Patrick.\n\nThe property was mortgaged to pay the debts of the estate and the house was let to J. Kidd, JP, who remained in tenancy until 1878 when the property was sold to the Fieldhouse brothers. The Fieldhouse brothers were prominent businessmen in Campbelltown who owned over 44 properties within the town by 1884. From 1878-1891 \"Glenalvin Hall\" was the residence of Edwin Fieldhouse and his family. From 1891-1904 the property remained in the joint ownership of the brothers at the end of which time they divided their assets with Edwin retaining Glenalvon. Edwin vacated the house shortly after and it was variously tenanted until 1920 when it was sold to the Bursill Family.\n\nGlenalvon remained in the ownership of the Bursill family until 1965 when it was acquired by the (then) State Planning Authority (SPA) for $35,000.\n\nIn 1969 architect John Fisher (member of the Institute of Architects, the Cumberland County Council Historic Buildings Committee and on the first Council of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) after its reformation in 1960) was commissioned by the State Planning Authority to restore the first five houses in Campbelltown, which had been resumed under the Cumberland County Planning Scheme. They included Glenalvon.\n\nIn 1970 the house and stables were restored by Clive Lucas at Fisher Jackson and Hudson and Lucas recalls this property as the conservation project where he first used the then innovative heritage principle of researching and understanding the fabric of a place before attempting conservation, including the use of paint scrapes to establish original paint schemes. The house was tenanted by the Oakham family from 1970 to 2010 and the stables are used as a resource centre by the Campbelltown and Airds District Historical Society.\n\nThe State Planning Authority sold Glenalvon to Campbelltown City Council and the Campbelltown & Airds District Historical Society now manage the building and garden, running displays, meetings, events.\n\nThe house is set in a mature garden, which contains some historic plantings including tall columnar Cook's pine (\"Araucaria columnaris\"), silky oak (\"Grevillea robusta\") and Californian desert fan palm (\"Washingtonia robusta\").\n\nA two-storey Georgian finely cut sandstone residence with symmetrical facade. The front verandah is stone flagged and is supported by turned stone Doric style columns. The hipped roof, originally shingled, is now clad in corrugated iron. The main entrance is located centrally on the southern elevation and double verandah posts on either side emphasise the point of entry. There are shuttered French doors either side of the main entry, opening onto the verandah. The five windows to the upper floor are double hung, timber sashed and of 9 panes to both the upper and lower sashes. The rear of the house has a verandah supported by flat timber columns. To the rear (north) of the house is located the former stables consisting of a symmetrical rectangular sandstone building with central gable on the eastern facade containing the entry doors and loft doors above. The hipped and gabled roof is clad in corrugated iron sheeting and has decorative timber barge boards. The roof framings were noted in 1973 as being jointed, dowelled, pegged and numbered without the use of nails (NT Listing). The verandah and eaves have timber soffits. Cellars are located below the house.\n\nOriginal cedar joinery, inc. six panelled doors, splayed panelled jambs to the windows and chimney pieces to the first floor; marble ground floor chimney pieces with sandstone mantlepieces; original geometric stair.\n\nAs at 1 February 1999, The building and grounds are in excellent condition, having undergone extensive conservation works in 1969. The property has been very well maintained since that time, although the garden is currently somewhat overgrown.\n\nGlenalvon has survived with much of its significant 1840s fabric intact and the original curtilage and setting of the property can still be interpreted. The property has high overall integrity.\n\n\nThe site is currently being evaluated through the preparation of a detailed conservation management plan (CMP). A CMP has been finalised and endorsed by the Heritage Council on 24 July 2000.\n\nAs at 27 November 1998, Glenalvon is historically, aesthetically and socially significant as one of the oldest urban townhouses in the township of Campbelltown. The house and stables of Glenalvon are a significant landmark element. Glenalvon has been used continuously as a residence for almost 160 years and although some changes have been made to the house, much of the original fabric, dating from 1840, has survived intact. The landscape setting of the house is also important as it represents part of the original curtilage of the property and makes a major contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown.\n\nGlenalvon House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nGlenalvon is of historical significance as one of the oldest uurban townhouses surviving in the township of Campbelltown. It is of further historical significance for it association with early and prominent families of the Campbelltown district and for its links to a way of life which has long since disappeared.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nGlenalvon is of high aesthetic significance as a particularly fine Colonial Georgian sandstone residence retaining much of its 1840s fabric intact. The stables buildings are also of high aesthetic significance as are the grounds which give an indication of the early curtilage of the property. The house combined with its grounds are important as reminders of the setting of early town houses with their generously landscaped grounds. Both the building and grounds make a considerable contribution to the historic townscape of Campbelltown.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nGlenalvon is of high social significance for its association with several prominent Campbelltown families and for its demonstration of the early pattern of life in the original township.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nGlenalvon is of high technical/research significance for its demonstration of colonial building techniques and for its use of local building materials and craftsmen, particularly the stonemasons, some of whom were convicts.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nGlenalvon is a rare surviving example of an 1840s townhouse to survive with much of its 1840s fabric and grounds intact, indicating the stature of such houses at the time of their construction.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nGlenalvon is an excellent example of an 1840s townhouse in the Colonial Georgian style.\n\n\n\n"}

However, in May 2012, Google announced that the service (which was also immediately renamed Google Shopping) would shift in late-2012 to a paid model where merchants would have to pay the company in order to list their products on the service.\n\nIn June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record €2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.\n\nCreated by Craig Nevill-Manning and launched in December 2002, Froogle was different from most other price comparison services in that it used Google's web crawler to index product data from the websites of vendors instead of using paid submissions. As with Google Search, Froogle was instead monetized using Google's AdWords keyword advertising platform.\n\nWith its re-branding as Google Product Search, the service was modified to emphasize integration with Google Search; listings from the service could now appear alongside web search results.\n\nGoogle prominently featured the service result in Google Search starting in January 2008 in Germany and the United Kingdom. It subsequently extended the practice to France in October 2010, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain in May 2011, the Czech Republic in February 2013 and Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden in November 2013.\n\nAlongside the announcement of an immediate re-brand to Google Shopping on May 31, 2012, Google also announced that in late 2012, it would change the service to use a \"pay-to-play\" model, where merchants would have to pay Google to list their products on the service, with results influenced by both relevance and the bid amounts they pay. Google justified the move by stating that it would allow the service to \"deliver the best answers for people searching for products and help connect merchants with the right customers.\"\n\nThe change proved controversial; some small businesses showed concern that they would not be able to compete with larger companies that can afford a larger advertising budget. Microsoft's Bing also attacked the move in an advertising campaign known as \"Scroogled,\" which called Google out for using \"deceptive advertising practices\" and suggesting that users use its competing Bing Shopping service instead.\n\nGoogle also revealed plans to integrate Google Catalogs with Google Shopping, to give users \"more ways to find ideas and inspiration as you shop and engage with your favorite brand.\"\n\nIn June 2017, Google Shopping was fined a record €2.4 billion by the EU Commission for giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results.\n\nGoogle Shopping was originally known as Froogle, a pun on the term \"frugal.\" On April 18, 2007, the product was renamed Google Product Search; the name was dropped due to concerns surrounding internationalization, people not understanding the pun or understanding what the service was actually about, and concerns related to the company's trademark infringement lawsuit against competing website Froogles. On May 31, 2012, the product was renamed to Google Shopping. The URL \"froogle.com\" remains as a redirect to Google Shopping's website.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, decided to fine Google €2.4 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. Google was found to have abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to another Google product, its own comparison shopping service.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, Google started giving its own Froogle significantly better treatment than rivals as early as 2008. It first began in Germany and the United Kingdom, followed by France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, then the Czech Republic and finally Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Poland and Sweden. A total 418 million citizens of the European Economic Area are claimed to have been deprived of the full benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation. Further damage payments may have to be required from Google should it not comply with European antitrust rules within 90 days.\n\nGoogle Shopping is currently available in:\n\n\n"}

The original manuscript had Kirk/Spock slash fiction elements, and these were requested to be removed by Paramount. However, they were not removed, and 250,000 copies were printed. These romantic undertones between Spock and James T. Kirk were brought to the attention of the office of the creator of \"Star Trek\", Gene Roddenberry, who made Pocket Books recall the first edition. This edition subsequently became a collector's item, with more than fifty changes made to a revised version.\n\nThe USS \"Enterprise\" is on patrol near the Romulan neutral zone and the crew is experiencing unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain of the ship and Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS \"ShiKahr\", which appears to otherwise be the \"Enterprise\". The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.\n\nThe Romulans had attempted to travel back in time and destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the \"ShiKahr\" realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.\n\nRomulan agents board the \"ShiKahr\" and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds that he is linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea to allow it to pass. They retrieve Kirk, and discover that taking Kirk and Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline.\n\nThe original manuscript of \"Killing Time\" included Kirk/Spock based slash fiction overtones. The foundation of this genre of writing dated back to the 1970s with fan created fiction about Kirk and Spock. This has since become a term typically used for same-sex unofficial fiction. Author Della van Hise had previously written these types of stories about those characters. When that manuscript was sent by Pocket Books for approval by Paramount Studios, the pages with the slash fiction were marked to be edited out of the eventual novel. It was returned, but at the time Pocket Books were between editors as Mimi Panich had just left, and her replacement Karen Haas had not yet arrived. At some point, someone went through the manuscript and marked the pages which Paramount had asked to be removed with the letters \"STET\", which is a Latin term used by proofreaders to tell the printer to disregard earlier changes.\n\nPocket Books published 250,000 copies of \"Killing Time\" in the first print run. After the publishing, Gene Roddenberry's assistant, Richard Arnold, received a letter from a reader stating that the book was suggesting a romantic link between Kirk and Spock. This was passed to Roddenberry, the creator of \"Star Trek\", who reportedly \"became livid\". Following his complaints to Pocket Books, the first print run of the novel was recalled and destroyed. Pocket Books had already shipped between 100,000 and 150,000 copies of the book to retailers. When the news broke, fans began purchasing the novels before they could be removed from the shelves as the first edition was expected to become a collector's item. Van Hise later said of that version of the novel, \"If someone went looking for 'questionable material', in \"Killing Time\", they could find it... Just as beauty is in supposedly in the mind of the beholder, so is questionable material.\" More than fifty changes were made to the novel before it was republished as a second edition.\n\nFollowing the issues with the publishing of \"Killing Time\", there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were stepping out of the bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.\n\nEllen Cheeseman-Meyer, writing for Tor.com in February 2013, said that \"Killing Time\" was \"incredibly romantic\". She stated that it reminded her of 18th century literary Romanticism, \"which suggested that morality lay in nature and civilization was a corrupting influence\". She said that whilst it could be considered \"a trivial piece of fluff tossed off by a fan writer and published when Pocket Books wasn’t paying much attention\", it could also be seen to be a \"call to action that requires readers to examine their relationships and their actions\". In Elizabeth Woledge's article for \"Extrapolation\", entitled \"From Slash to the Mainstream: Female Writers and Gender Blending Men\", she describes \"Killing Time\" as \"erotic but not sexual\" and said that Spock and Kirk both \"combine masculine and feminine imagery\". She suggested that it was not the romantic overtones that caused the reaction, but rather that it was this gender-blending that was the issue.\n"}

These letters were personal in nature, and were delivered folded and sealed, so that only the recipient could read their contents. This type of letter contrasts with the better-known letters patent.\n\nIt was necessary to break the seal to open and read the letter, and so its arrival with the seal intact showed that it had not been intercepted or tampered with. However, once the seal was broken, it could no longer confirm the authenticity of the document. \n\nIn this realm the letters could be issued by the monarch or government. The original charters of Edward the Confessor can be considered to be a form of letters close, as they were delivered wrapped, with the seal hanging down.\n\nThis type of letter later developed into the formal business letters that we are familiar with today.\n\nIt is thought that the earliest surviving English instance remaining unopened dates to the reign of Henry VIII. In England these letters are typical of those generated by the developing state bureaucracy. From 1204, copies of English letters close transcribed onto the Close Rolls are extant. However, examples of actual letters close, as opposed to the recorded copies in the Close Rolls, are extremely rare, and most of those exist because King Henry II required the return of some to the government. \n\nOver time, however, as new document series emerged, the scope of the Close Rolls narrowed; and after 1533 their contents consisted solely of copies of private deeds and awards of enclosure, and the like.\n\nAnother example of letters close is papal letters close. These often had the leaden papal bulla attached to the letter with a hemp cord, in contrast to the fine silk cords used for higher grades of document. The cords were often threaded through the letter to keep it folded, with the address written on the \"dorse\" (back) of the document (endorsed) for the entrusted deliverers to read.\n\n"}

Starting with the definition of a foot, he defined the mile and the diameter of the earth as a unit in terms of foot and then calculated the distance of the planets of the Solar System in terms of the diameter of the earth.\n\nThe first two volumes of the 234 letters originally written in French appeared in print in Saint Petersburg in 1768 and the third in Frankfurt in 1774. The letters were later reprinted in Paris with the first volume in 1787, the second in 1788 and the third in 1789.\n\nThe publication of the book was supported by the empress Catherine II with her personally writing to Count Vorontsov in January 1766:\nRussian translation of the letters followed in Saint Petersburg by Euler's student Stepan Rumovsky between 1768 and 1774 in 3 volumes.\n\nThe first English translation of the Letters were done by the Scottish minister Henry Hunter in 1795. Hunter targeted the translation at British women, believing that Euler intended to educate the females through his work.\n\nThe translation of Hunter was based on the 1787 Paris Edition, of Marquis de Condorcet and Sylvestre François Lacroix. The translation differed from the original letters of Euler in its omission of \"... the frequent, tiresome, courtly address of YOUR HIGHNESS\". \nThe Marquis de Condorcet's translation, made during the Age of Enlightenment, was notable for its omission of Euler’s theological references which Condorcet found as \"anathema\" to teaching science and rationalism.\n\nTranslations followed in other languages including Spanish (1798) which differed from the original book by a footnote describing the newly discovered planet Uranus. Subsequent German edition (1847), and French editions (1812 and 1829) were also noted for their reference to Uranus and four minor planets respectively.\n\n"}
{"id": "1190850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1190850", "title": "London Metropolitan Archives", "text": "London Metropolitan Archives\n\nThe London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) is the principal local government archive repository for the Greater London area, including the City of London: it is the largest county record office in the United Kingdom. It was established under its present name in 1997, having previously been known as the Greater London Record Office. It is administered and financed by the City of London Corporation.\n\nThe archive is based at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell, London. It attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and deals with a similar number of written enquiries. LMA's extensive holdings amount to over 72 miles of records of local, regional and national importance. With the earliest record dating from 1067, the archive charts the development of the capital into a modern-day major world city.\n\nLondon Metropolitan Archives in its current form is essentially an amalgamation of four separate bodies. The first three were the London County Record Office, the London County Council Members Library and the Middlesex County Record Office, which merged in 1965 to form the Greater London Record Office and History Library (GLRO). The GLRO became London Metropolitan Archives in 1997, and took over the former Corporation of London Record Office (CLRO) in 2005.\n\nUntil 1889, London was still the area within the walled city; to the south of the river was Surrey and Kent and to the north of the city's limits was Middlesex. These areas, however, had become densely populated and, given the sphere of influence of the city, traditional boundaries were no longer practical. The County of London was created and controlled by the newly formed London County Council, which took over many of the duties of its predecessor the Metropolitan Board of Works. It was the records of these bodies and similar groups such as the London School Board and Metropolitan Asylums Board that would form the nucleus of the London County Record offices holdings, which were based at County Hall on the south bank of the River Thames.\n\nAs well as the official records that the council generated, they also began to accept deposits of records fundamental to London's history, such as copies of memorials from the Middlesex deeds register, diocesan and parish records and records of charities such as the Foundling Hospital. Under the Public Records Act 1958, the record office became recognised as a place of deposit for public records.\n\nSince the creation of the London County Council there had been a record keeper in the Clerks Department who held custody of the documents. By the 1930s they had established individual departmental record rooms staffed by record assistants working under the general supervision of the Record Keeper. Finally in 1953 the position of Head Archivist and Librarian was created.\n\nThe library was originally that of the members of the London County Council and reflected their interests. Situated in the same building as the London County Record Office, the library was added to with books on the history and topography of London. The library also included a rich collection of maps, prints, drawings and photographs.\n\nNo single act or resolution marked the beginning of the Middlesex County Record Office. Like most other county record offices it developed naturally from the duty of the Clerk of the Peace to preserve certain records from the Quarter Sessions, together with other records such as enclosure awards and plans of public utilities. The first significant period in the formation of the county record office was in the early 1880s when a special committee was appointed by the justices of the peace to consider and report on the accommodation provided for the storage of the \"old records\" of the county. On behalf of the committee, John Cordy Jeaffreson, an inspector of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, sorted the records covering 1549–1820 into 87 classes comprising more than 10,000 volumes and nearly 5000 rolls. The more modern records from post-1820 were given a separate room.\n\nThe formation of the London County Council in 1889 had seen the County of Middlesex much reduced in size. In 1893 when the Middlesex sessions papers were to be moved from the sessions house in Clerkenwell (an area that was previously Middlesex but now London) an argument broke out between the two county councils as to who should have responsibility for the material. This protracted dispute lasted some five years, with a high court judge eventually deciding in favour of Middlesex.\n\nAround the same time, a Middlesex County Council act empowered the council to spend money preserving, arranging, indexing, classifying and publishing such records of the county that may be in the public interest. In 1913 the new Middlesex Guildhall at Westminster opened and was equipped with specially constructed muniment rooms, with an assistant to arrange and supervise their transfer from temporary storage. It was not until 1923 that a full-time graduate assistant was placed in charge of dealing with things such as document repair, storage issues, written enquiries, production of documents for public researchers and receipt of any gifts or deposits.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the work of the county record office expanded steadily, with the appointment of a County Archivist, first in a part-time capacity (Colonel William Le Hardy), then full-time from 1957. By then, the archive had also moved to new premises at 1 Queen Anne's Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street. In 1960 the record office was appointed an official place of deposit by the Lord Chancellor under section 4 (1) of the Public Records Act 1958. After this, the archive increased its holdings, with significant deposits of petty sessions, coroners, Boards of Guardians and other official material. By this time, the record office had acquired an extensive reference library on the topography of Middlesex, as well as a great number of maps, prints and photographs.\n\nUnder the Local London Government Act 1963, which came into effect on 1 April 1965, the administrative counties of London and Middlesex together with their respective county councils were abolished. They were replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC) which administered a much wider area known as Greater London. The formation of Greater London also meant that some areas that had been previously part of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire, were also now included. However, to minimise confusion, it was agreed that records from these areas should remain within their ancient county.\n\nThe Greater London Council took over responsibility for the established record offices of the counties of London and Middlesex, as well as the former member's library of the London County Council. Together, these became the Greater London Record Office (GLRO) and Library. Although administratively united, the new archive continued to exist at two separate sites, with Middlesex material still held at Dartmouth Street and London material at County Hall (the record office being approximately where the London Aquarium is now situated). The two archives finally came together in 1979, when the Dartmouth Street site was sold by the GLC, and both archives were housed at County Hall.\n\nIn 1982 the GLRO moved to adapted premises at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell. This site was a former print works, home to the Temple Press. The Press had moved from nearby Roseberry Avenue in August 1939, and continued to use the site until the end of the 1960s.\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and since that date the archives have been administered by the City of London Corporation. In the early 1990s work started on a new block adjacent to the site in Northampton Road. This extension conformed to archival storage standards, with mobile shelving and environmental controls.\n\nThe GLRO was renamed the London Metropolitan Archives in 1997.\n\nIn 2005 the archives of the Corporation of London Records Office were moved to the London Metropolitan Archives (LMA) while the Guildhall underwent a vast refurbishment programme. The City of London Corporation is the local government authority for the City of London, the area often referred to as the Square Mile. These archives include the earliest material currently held at LMA, dating from 1067. The archive contains the official records of how the City was governed and developed, through bodies such as the Court of Aldermen and Court of Common Council and many other official departments like the Chamberlains (which dealt with people being given the freedom of the city). It also contains a large number of records of organisations which the City of London Corporation are responsible for such as the City of London Police, a number of courts and many of the major London markets.\n\nIn 2006 LMA merged with the City of London Libraries and Guildhall Art Gallery to form the City of London Department of Libraries, Archives and Guildhall Art Gallery. Within this department, LMA sits in an administrative group with the Guildhall Library (a major historical reference library for London, holding printed books, manuscripts and map and print collections), the Guildhall Art Gallery and Keats House based at Hampstead, the London home of the poet John Keats. The department also includes three lending libraries and the City Business Library.\n\nThe records held at the London Metropolitan Archives have been arranged in 17 major classes, of which a number are detailed below. Not all collections are available for consultation. Uncatalogued collections can be made available only by prior appointment made at least 48 hours in advance of the intended visit. Some material is restricted or closed because it contains sensitive information relating to named individuals, other records may require written permission from the depositor before you can view them.\n\nLMA holds records of many associations all with very different purposes. A large number of records are associations with political purposes such as the London Labour Party, London Liberal Party as well as regional branches of the Labour Party and Conservative Party. The records of associations also include a number of trade unions including the National Union of Teachers London and Middlesex branches, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and the Union of Post office Workers. Within the field of education there are records of The National Education Association and the London Head Teachers Association.\n\nRecords of pressure groups and campaigning organisations such as the National United Temperance Council and the Royal Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising are also held. One of the larger series of records held are those belonging to the Public Morality Council. Formed in 1899 to combat vice and indecency in London, its members included representatives of all the major religions as well as leaders in education and medicine. The council continued until 1969 concentrating latterly on opposition to sexual immorality and pornography particularly with regards to theatre, cinema, radio and television.\n\nA number of the records relate to groups promoting the arts, sport and recreation. Of particular note are the records of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, though consultation of these archives, are subject to obtaining written permission. Other records include the Artists League of Great Britain, and The Royal Choral Society. On a more sporting theme, there are records of the London Schools Football Association, the National Amateur Rowing Association and the Ramblers Association.\nThe Associations series includes the archives of the Peabody Trust. The trust has its origins in a donation of £500,000 made by the American philanthropist, George Peabody, for the benefit of the people of London, the city where he had spent most of his adult life. The donation was put into the hands of trustees who were to ensure that it was used to \"ameliorate the condition of the poor\" of London. It was agreed that cheap, clean housing would best fulfil the intention of the gift, and that the Trust would provide an alternative to the Model Dwellings Companies who operated on a private, less philanthropic basis. The first housing estate was opened in Spitalfields in 1864 and consisted of 57 dwellings and 9 shops. Further block estates were built in Southwark, Lambeth, Westminster, Chelsea, Islington and Tower Hamlets. The collection includes registers of tenants, photographs, plans and administrative and financial records.\n\nLMA holds many archives from businesses that operated in the London and Middlesex areas. These are arranged alphabetically by the name of the company. One of the major collections in the series is that of the Predecessors of London Transport. These include a number of railway companies, particularly the Metropolitan Railway and many of the London Omnibus Companies, as well as the records of the London Passenger Transport Board, which unified services in the London area for the first time and ran from 1933 to 1948.\n\nAnother important collection is the archives of Thames Water Predecessors. The archive comprises the records of major institutions that supplied water to the metropolis between 1582 and 1974. Up to 1902 the work was largely carried out by private companies operating under increasing public control as time went on. The records of each company have been catalogued separately except in cases where takeover occurred. The companies include London Bridge Waterworks Company and the New River Company. In 1902 all the smaller private institutions were taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board, which assumed supply responsibilities for an area covering . The surviving records include corporate material such as board minutes and legal papers, accounts, staff records, engineering and technical files, plans, photos and property records.\n\nJ. Lyons and Co. was founded in 1886 as a catering business for exhibitions in Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow, Paris and London. By 1894 it had become a public company and it rapidly established a chain of teashops, corner houses and restaurants. This is one of the most intriguing business collections deposited, for as well as all the usual corporate records such as management, finance and administration, the collection is particularly strong in what may be termed ephemera. There are hundreds of photographs starting from as early 1887, a few films and videos, a large collection of press cuttings, advertisements, menus, lithographs and even a Nippy's uniform.\n\nBrewers have supplied the metropolis with beer for at least five centuries and by 1700 around 200 common brewers existed. As the industry evolved through acquisitions and competitive means, a hierarchy developed. By 1830 a few large companies dominated, supported by a base of smaller concerns. Several London brewers joined the ranks of England's greatest industrial enterprises and the LMA holds archives of six of those major companies. These include Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co Ltd, Courage, Barclay & Simonds Ltd, Watney, Combe, Reid, Ltd, latterly Watney Mann Ltd, and Whitbread & Co Ltd. The surviving records include administrative and financial records, staff records, property records photographs and ephemera.\n\nLMA's holdings of charities records date from the early 17th century and include notable foundations such as Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy and Sutton's Hospital (Charterhouse) which was founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 for the benefit of distressed gentlemen and the education of poor boys. Many of the charities are concerned with housing, education and medicine. One of the major collections is that of the Charity Organisation Society, now known as the Family Welfare Association which was formed to make sure that charitable organisations did not overlap with each other in terms of what they were trying to achieve.\n\nAmongst the many archives of housing associations held, are records of the Hampstead Garden Suburb. The Hampstead Garden Suburb was the vision and accomplishment of Henrietta Barnett who together with her husband Canon Samuel Augustus Barnett set about creating an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The land near Hampstead was purchased via the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust that she had formed. A total of were purchased for £140,000 by 1907. The idea was that the estate would be aesthetically pleasing consisting of low-density housing and thoroughly planned with a mix of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools, an institute of education and shops. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together in one area. Unfortunately though the houses may have been more modest, they were still too expensive for many working-class people. Increased building costs and the shortage of local employment meant that the suburb would become largely middle-class. By 1936 building was virtually complete and the suburb was home to some 16,000 people. The collection is particularly valuable to those interested in the history of planned settlements, architecture and the life and work of Henrietta Barnett. The archive consists of records of suburb organisations and recreational societies, education institutions and approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.\n\nAmong the records of charities are those of the Foundling Hospital, established by Royal charter in 1739 by Thomas Coram as a refuge for abandoned children. It was the sole institution responsible for taking in illegitimate children in the London area for a period of well over 120 years. Coram had been appalled by the number of dead and dying babies on the streets of London. Admission to the new hospital was at first limited because of lack of funds. Infants were to be less than two months old and in good health. Once a child had been admitted they were baptised and given a new name and boarded out to a dry or wet nurse in the country. On reaching the age of three, they were returned to the hospital to receive basic schooling before eventually being apprenticed out to trades or service or enlisted in the armed forces. From 1760 the mother was required to submit a written petition detailing her circumstances: these documents provide a valuable resource for social history. Other documents include records of the lives of the children, nursing methods, apothecaries' prescriptions, and inspectors' reports. Some parts of the collection have been returned to the Coram family, while more modern files concerned with the Berkhamsted site are at Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies.\n\nThe records that were formerly held by the Corporation of London Record Office and now held at the LMA have been re-catalogued and are now arranged in two distinct sections.\n\nRecords with the prefix COL are the administrative and corporate records of the City of London Corporation. Included in this section are the repertories, journals and letter books from the courts of Aldermen and Common Council, records of those receiving the freedom of the City of London from the Chamberlains department as well as numerous plans from the planning and surveyors departments.\n\nRecords with the prefix CLA are deposited collections from organisations and bodies that operate in close association with the City of London Corporation. This series includes records of many of the bridges across the Thames and particularly Tower Bridge, many markets including Smithfield, Billingsgate, Spitalfields and Leadenhall, and a number of courts such as Mansion House and Guildhall Justice Rooms and Southwark coroner's court. Records of particular interest in this series are the records of the City of London Sessions, these include criminal trials held before the London jury at the Old Bailey. Another series of particular interest are the records of the City of London Police. Archives include warrant books, over 95% of all personnel files as well as material relating to the Houndsditch murders and letters sent to the force concerning Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders.\n\nThe court records held at LMA are dominated by one of the finest collection of quarter session records known to exist in the country. The records of the Middlesex and Westminster Sessions cover both the judicial and administrative functions of the Justices of the Peace covering the period 1549–1971. These include sessions of gaol delivery for the Middlesex area, held at the Old Bailey until 1834. Until the 1870s and 1880s the Middlesex Justices were not only responsible for judicial matters in their area, they were also responsible for many of the functions now under the control of local governments. Such roles and responsibilities included county bridges, prisons, lunatic asylums and Feltham Industrial School. The deposited records also include Land and Hearth tax assessments, electoral registers, licensed victuallers, recognizance's, building surveyors returns, enclosure awards and maps and plans of numerous public undertakings such as canals, docks and railways.\n\nLMA also holds a number of records of the former Inner London police courts. While many of these courts date from the 18th and 19th centuries, the surviving records often only start in the early 20th century. Included in the same section are records of petty sessions, magistrates' courts and county courts for London and Middlesex. Some magistrates' courts in the London area are not covered and hold no records of the Crown Courts. Perhaps the most popular series of records in this section are the records of coroner's courts. These include the Middlesex area prior to 1889, the London and Middlesex areas from 1889 onwards and the Greater London area after 1965. Unfortunately the survival rate of coroner's records is only about 10%. They are also subject to a closure period of 75 years as opposed to the 30 years on other court records.\n\nThe records of the Diocese of London have been split between the LMA and the Guildhall Library. The LMA has records concerning the Consistory Court of London and the Archdeaconry Court of Middlesex. These records include probate material up to 1858, Tithe maps, Bishops Transcripts and Matrimonial and Testamentary Cause Papers.\n\nTo the south of the River Thames, LMA holds records of the Diocese of Winchester including probate and marriage bonds and allegations from the Archdeaconry Court of Surrey as well as probate from the Commissary Court of Surrey. The LMA also has records of the Diocese of Southwark, the Diocese of Guilford and the south-east London part of the Diocese of Rochester.\n\nEstate records held at the LMA include the Duke of Bedford's Covent Garden Estate with many of the records relating to the development of the market. Other major estate records in this series are those of the Marquess of Northampton at Clerkenwell and Canonnbury and the Maryon-Wilson estates in Hampstead and Charlton. Notable family collections include those of the Marquess of Anglesey, the Clitherow family of Brentford and the Earl of Jersey, whose papers include correspondence with prominent politicians and literary figures; however, these papers can only be viewed after obtaining written permission from the Head Archivist. The families and Estates series also includes records of over 80 manors, including those owned by Charterhouse School and St Thomas' Hospital, which covers land extending from Essex to Wiltshire and Yorkshire.\n\nLMA holds records for over 80 hospitals and local regional health authorities within the south-east area. The hospital records range from county asylums such as Hanwell Asylum and Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum to major teaching hospitals like Guy's Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital and specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital and Queen Charlotte's Hospital, right down to much smaller local hospitals. Anybody wishing to find out what hospital records are held at the LMA would do well to first consult the hospital records database on the national archives website. The collection of records is not arranged alphabetically as many different hospitals may be covered by one particular management trust, therefore it is worth asking at the reference room desk and they will direct you to the particular binder that you need. It is also worth consulting the 3 leaflets on hospital records that the archive had produced, namely No. 9 – Sources for the history of nursing, which details the Florence Nightingale collection among the records of St Thomas' Hospital – No. 13, a general guide to hospital records, and No. 15, which is concerned with patients' records. All patients' records among the hospitals collections are subject to data protection laws and may be closed access depending on their date.\n\nA great number of the Anglo-Jewish community's archives have been deposited at the London Metropolitan Archives, including records of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Office of the Chief Rabbi, the Beth Din, the federation of Synagogues and the United Synagogue. It should be noted that the collections contain only a small number of sources useful to those studying their Jewish Family History, particular sources are the records from the Jewish Temporary Shelter and those of the Jewish Free School which is said to have educated one third of all the Jewish community in London. The majority of records from the various Jewish Organisations are concerned with subject and policy decisions and most require written permission from the depositor before access can be granted.\n\nTwo very important series of records have been classified under the heading London Local Authorities. The first of these, are the records of the Boards of Guardians of the Poor Law Unions for London and Middlesex. Poor Law Unions were formed as a result of the new Poor Law amendment act of 1834, when neighbouring parishes joined together to pool their resources, each of these unions would be administered by a Board of Guardians. The records consist primarily of general minutes of the board, administrative records including details of staff, settlement examinations, orders of removal, workhouse and infirmary records and school records. The records are arranged by each individual board although the amount of surviving material varies from board to board. The majority of material is from the period 1850 to 1930.\n\nThe other major collection in this series, are the records of the Middlesex Deeds Register. By the Middlesex Registry Act 1708 a registry was established for the registration of all deeds, conveyances, wills, encumbrances etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.\n\nAs well as the archives of the London County Council, Middlesex County Council, Greater London Council, Inner London Education Authority and the London Residuary Body, the LMA also hold records of their 19th- and 20th-century predecessors such as the Metropolitan Board of Works, Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, London School Board and the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The records of these bodies are as broad as the functions of modern local government, with documentation on education, housing, health services, welfare, transport, building regulations, drainage, culture and leisure. Many of the different bodies include a series of indexed committee minutes, which often prove to be a valuable starting point when attempting to access the records.\n\nThe LMA has an extensive collection of maps numbering over 15,000. Many of the maps are split up amongst the various different collections for example tithes maps found amongst the diocesan records and enclosure maps found amongst court records. Fortunately there is a single card catalogue that combines all of the maps from the various collections and has listed them by the area they cover. Twenty of the most popular maps held by the LMA are accessible in the map cabinet in the reference room. These include the first edition of the Ordnance Survey for London 1867–70 and the Second World War Bomb damage maps.\n\nIncluded in this series are records of the British Waterways Board particularly concerning the River Lea, plans of National Schools in Middlesex and the London Region of English Heritage that took over many of the files and plans of the former Greater London Council Historic Buildings Division. Also featuring in the series of National Records are the archives of Wandsworth (HM Prison) and Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison). Of the two prisons the Wandsworth records are much more extensive, including administrative and staff records, photographs and prisoners records from 1879. For Wormwood Scrubs the majority of records concern prisoners and begin in 1917.\n\nThe majority of nonconformist records at LMA relate to the Congregationalist, Baptist, United Reformed and Methodist churches, circuits and missions dating predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some records of a few German churches are held, and some recent marriage registers from a Salvation Army citadel, a Seventh-Day Adventist church, the Kingdom Hall, Wandsworth and a Sikh Gurdwara. As well as baptism, marriage and burial records from individual nonconformist churches, records of several nonconformist organisations such as the London Congregational Union and the New Bunhill Fields Burial Ground are held. The LMA holds no Roman Catholic records, which are usually retained by the individual church.\n\nLMA holds records of more than 700 Anglican churches in the London and Middlesex areas. The types of records held vary from parish to parish, with some parishes only depositing registers of baptisms, marriage and burials. Other parishes, however, have deposited a great deal more and the types of records include vestry minutes, churchwarden accounts, parish poor rate and early workhouse material, parish magazines, plans, photographs and other ephemera.\n\nFor those interested in parish records, researchers should be aware that for certain areas of London, the LMA will not be the likely place records would be deposited. For those interested in the parish registers of the ancient City of London within the walls, these will be found at the Guildhall Library. Similarly churches within the ancient city of Westminster will deposit their records at the City of Westminster Archives. This will include parishes such as Saint Martin in the Fields, Saint James Piccadilly, Saint Clement Danes and Saint George Hanover Square. The final areas that would not deposit their records at the LMA are the modern London Boroughs that prior to the formation of the Greater London Council in 1964 would have been part of the former counties of Essex, Kent and Surrey. For each of these areas researchers should consult either their local borough archive or the respective ancient county record office.\n\nThe LMA photograph collection contains almost half a million photographs covering the history and topography of London, especially the inner London area. The majority of photos were taken for official purposes by and for the London County Council and Greater London Council. The collection is arranged in two sections. The first section is arranged by alphabetically by subject covering everything from Abbeys to Zoological Gardens. Particularly well covered are subjects such as schools, housing estates, parks, bridges, churches, cinemas, theatres, hospitals, pubs and areas of war damage. The second section is arranged alphabetically by modern London borough and then alphabetically by address.\n\nThe prints and drawings collection is similarly arranged to the photograph collection, with a greater focus on the inner London areas. It is also arranged both topographically and by subject. Most of the prints and drawings date from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe LMA holds many films produced by bodies including London Transport, the Greater London Council and the Corporation of London. Some of these films are accessible on YouTube.\n\nThe LMA library started as the library of the former members of the London County council. It contains over 100,000 volumes and specialises in all aspects of London life, the growth and development of the area, its history and organisation of Local Government. The library is purely a reference library. A search of the archive's stock of records can be done online by accessing the LMA website and navigating the londonGenerations search tool.\n\nAlthough many records (in particular the parish registers of Greater London) are stored on microfiche, there is a digitisation programme which is ongoing. The aim is to digitally store parish records, Poor Law documents, and school admission records up to 1911. An estimated 77 million people will be referenced by these documents.\n\nIt will be possible for visitors to view this data at no cost on terminals in the library. It will likewise be possible to view this data at home via the internet for a fee, via the website ancestry co uk, with the first stage going live in early 2009.\n\nAccording to a leaflet from the LMA (made available in September 2008):\n\nDigitised parish records went online on 16 September 2009, as an alternative to microfiche searches. Digitised electoral rolls, for the period 1835 to 1965, went online on 11 January 2012.\n"}

{"id": "3566823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3566823", "title": "Massachusetts Body of Liberties", "text": "Massachusetts Body of Liberties\n\nThe Massachusetts Body of Liberties was the first legal code established by European colonists in New England. Compiled by the Puritan minister Nathaniel Ward, the laws were established by the Massachusetts General Court in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the \"Countenance of Authority\".\n\nIn 1684 King Charles II revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. When King James II established the Massachusetts Colony the Body of Liberties took effect and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 Provincial Charter.\n\nThe Body of Liberties was one of the earliest protections of individual rights in America. Unlike many of the English sources of the time, the Body of Liberties were express in many of their grants and far more supportive of individual rights. Despite these grants, the rights were modifiable by the General Court.\n\nTo varying degrees, the document contained rights that would later be included in the Bill of Rights. Many of the other rights are now considered fundamental components of procedural due process, such as rights to notice and hearing before the court. The rights also contained in the Bill of Rights included freedom of speech, a right against uncompensated takings, a right to bail, a right to jury trial, a right against cruel and unusual punishment, and a right against double jeopardy.\n\nIn addition to those, the Body of Liberties also contained other individual rights, including: a prohibition of a compulsory draft except for territorial defense; a prohibition of monopolies, \"No monopolies shall be granted or allowed amongst us, but of such new Inventions that are profitable to the Countrie, and that for a short time.\"; prohibition of an estate tax; the freedom of all \"house holders\" to fishing and fowling on public land.\n\nSome of the liberties legislated are explicitly cited as originating from biblical sources. While many of the liberties established still exist in both and law and practice in the Commonwealth today, some do not. The justification for slavery of Africans in Passage 91 of the Body of Liberties was likely based on an interpretation of scriptural passages of the New Testament, such as Ephesians 6:5 and Titus 2:9. Liberties were only extended to Caucasian Northern Europeans, particularly protestant Christian men.\n\n"}

Board of Education of District of Columbia\n\nMills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia, 348 F.Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972), was a lawsuit filed against the District of Columbia in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The court ruled that students with disabilities must be given a public education even if the students are unable to pay for the cost of the education. The case established that \"all children are entitled to free public education and training appropriate to their learning capacities\". Peter D. Roos, a former staff attorney at Harvard University's Center for Law and Education, described \"Mills\" as a \"leading case\" in a series of lawsuits that attempted to provide access to education for children with disabilities.\n\nChildren were denied education because they were classified as having behavioral issues. The board of education did not provide schooling for these exceptional children, which violated their own board regulations. 18,000 similar cases were discovered in the Washington D.C. area. It had failed to provide prior hearings and periodic reviews of each exceptional student case. The Supreme Court of the United States stated that the board of education of the district of Columbia violated such rights as due process and certain statutes and regulations. The court claimed that the board of education had an obligation to provide education for all students, regardless of disability. By not providing equal protection and education for all students under law, the education system is stripping students of their natural rights, and therefore having a large impact on civil liberties in the United States. \n"}

{"id": "221798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221798", "title": "National Zoological Park (United States)", "text": "National Zoological Park (United States)\n\nThe National Zoological Park, commonly known as the National Zoo, is one of the oldest zoos in the United States. It is part of the Smithsonian Institution and does not charge for admission. Founded in 1889, its mission is to \"provide engaging experiences with animals and create and share knowledge to save wildlife and habitats\".\n\nThe National Zoo has two campuses. The first is a urban park located at Rock Creek Park in Northwest Washington, D.C., 20 minutes from the National Mall by MetroRail. The other campus is the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI; formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center) in Front Royal, Virginia. On this land, there are 180 species of trees, 850 species of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants, 40 species of grasses, and 36 different species of bamboo. The SCBI is a non-public facility devoted to training wildlife professionals in conservation biology and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction. The National Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\nThe two facilities host about 1,800 animals of 300 different species. About one-fifth of them are endangered or threatened. Most species are on exhibit at the Rock Creek Park campus. The best-known residents are the giant pandas, but the zoo is also home to birds, great apes, big cats, Asian elephants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, aquatic animals, small mammals and many more. The SCBI facility houses between 30 and 40 endangered species at any given time depending on research needs and recommendations from the zoo and the conservation community. The zoo was one of the first to establish a scientific research program. Because it is a part of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Zoo receives federal appropriations for operating expenses. A new master plan for the park was introduced in 2008 to upgrade the park's exhibits and layout.\n\nThe National Zoo is open every day of the year except for December 25 (Christmas Day).\n\nThe zoo first started as the National Museum's Department of Living Animals in 1886. By an act of Congress in 1889, for \"the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people\" the National Zoo was created. In 1890, it became a part of the Smithsonian Institution. Three well-known individuals drew up plans for the zoo: Samuel Langley, third Secretary of the Smithsonian; William T. Hornaday, noted conservationist and head of the Smithsonian's vertebrate division; and Frederick Law Olmsted, the premier landscape architect of his day. William Temple Hornaday was the curator of all 185 animals when the park was first opened. Together, they designed a new zoo to exhibit animals for the public and to serve as a refuge for wildlife, such as bison and beaver, which were rapidly vanishing from North America.\n\nFor the first 50 years, the National Zoo, like most zoos around the world, focused on exhibiting one or two representative exotic animal species. The number of many species in the wild began to decline drastically because of human activities. Sometimes animals became unexpectedly available. In 1899, the Kansas frontiersman Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones captured a bighorn sheep for the zoo. The fate of animals and plants became a pressing concern. Many of these species were favorite zoo animals, such as elephants and tigers; hence the staff began to concentrate on the long-term management and conservation of entire species.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the zoo hired its first full-time permanent veterinarian, reflecting a priority placed on professional health care for the animals. In 1958, Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) was founded. The citizen group's first accomplishment was to persuade Congress to fund the zoo's budget entirely through the Smithsonian; previously, the zoo's budget was divided between appropriations for the Smithsonian and the District of Columbia. Congressional funding placed the zoo on a firmer financial base, allowing for a period of growth and improvement. In 2006, Congress approved an additional 14.6 million dollars for renovations in both facilities. FONZ incorporated as a nonprofit organization and turned its attention to developing education and volunteer programs, supporting these efforts from its operation of concessions at the zoo, and expanding community support for the zoo through a growing membership which annually raises between $4 million and $8 million for the zoo.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the zoo turned its attention to breeding and studying threatened and endangered species. Although some zoo animals had been breeding and raising young, it was not understood why some species did so successfully while others did not. In 1965, the zoo created the zoological research division to study the reproduction, behavior, and ecology of zoo species, and to learn how best to meet the needs of the animals.\n\nIn 1975, the zoo established the Conservation and Research Center (CRC). In 2010, the complex was renamed the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), a title also used as an umbrella term for the scientific endeavors that take place on both campuses. On in the Virginia countryside, rare species, such as Mongolian wild horses, scimitar-horned oryx, maned wolves, cranes, and others live and breed in spacious surroundings. SCBI's modern efforts emphasize reproductive physiology, analysis of habitat and species relationships, genetics, husbandry and the training of conservation scientists.\n\nThe zoo's last hippopotamus, Happy, was transferred to Milwaukee County Zoo in 2009 to make space for Elephant Trails.\n\nExpanding knowledge about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well being has changed the look of the National Zoo. Today, animals live in natural groupings rather than individually. Rare and endangered species, such as golden lion tamarins, Sumatran tigers, and sarus cranes, breed and raise their young – showing the success of the zoo's conservation and research programs. The zoo's research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo. Its research encompasses reproductive biology, conservation biology, biodiversity monitoring, veterinary medicine, nutrition, behavior, ecology, and bird migration.\n\nThe National Zoo has developed public-education programs to help students, teachers and families explore the intricacies of the animal world. The zoo also designed specialized programs to train wildlife professionals from around the world and to form a network to provide crucial support for international conservation. The National Zoo is at the forefront of the use of web technology and programming to expand its programs to an international virtual audience.\n\nThe National Zoo has been the home to giant pandas since Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived at the zoo in 1972. Since 2000, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian also lived there. On July 9, 2005, Mei Xiang gave birth to Tai Shan, who went to China in February 2010. On August 23, 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to Bao Bao, who still resides at the zoo. On August 22, 2015, Mei Xiang gave birth to Bei Bei, who still resides at the zoo.\n\nPlans for the future include modernizing the zoo's aging facilities and expanding its education, research and conservation efforts in Washington, Virginia and in the wild. As part of a 10-year renewal program, Asia Trail – a series of habitats for seven Asian species including sloth bears, red pandas, and clouded leopards – was created. Elephant Trails, opened in 2013, provides a new home for the zoo's Asian elephants. Kids' Farm exhibit, opened in 2004, was slated for closure in 2011 but is to remain open for another 10 years following a donation to the exhibit.\n\nThe zoo, which is supported by tax revenues and open to everyone, attracts 2 million visitors per year, according to the \"Washington Post\" in 2005.\n\nThe National Zoo has a Federal Law Enforcement Agency deployed on its grounds: the National Zoological Park Police (NZPP), which consists of full-time Law Enforcement Officers. The NZPP is an agency that has been recognized by the United States Congress and is one of five original police agencies within the District of Columbia with full police powers. They work very closely with the Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Park Police, Department of State, Capital Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. The agency is considered the first line of defense in the event of any crisis.\n\nDennis W. Kelly was named director of the zoo on February 15, 2010, overseeing both campuses. Kelly succeeded John Berry, who was the National Zoo director for three years until February 2009, when he resigned to become the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under the Obama Administration. Steven Monfort, the zoo's associate director for conservation and science, served as the acting director between February 2009 and February 2010. Kelly retired as the zoo's director in November 2017, Steven Monfort was named acting director.\n\nThe zoo's Giant Panda Habitat features three outdoor areas with animal enrichment, as well as an indoor area with a rocky outcrop, a waterfall, and viewing areas. The zoo's pandas, named Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, are on loan from the China Wildlife Conservation Association, and will live at the zoo until 2020. They are the focus of a research, conservation, and breeding program that aims to preserve the species. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian successfully had a male cub, named Tai Shan, in 2005. Tai Shan currently lives at the Bifengxia Panda Base in Sichuan, China, taking part in Bifengxia's breeding program. On September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, but the cub died six days after its birth. On August 23, 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to two cubs; one, a female named Bao Bao, survived, while the other was stillborn. The pandas live at the Fujifilm Giant Panda Habitat, a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor exhibit. The exhibit is designed to replicate the rocky, lush terrain of the pandas' natural habitat. Mei delivered two cubs in August 2015; one died a few days later. Both cubs, fraternal twins, were sired by Tian Tian; the surviving male was given the name Bei Bei on September 25, 2015 and was on public exhibit in January 2016.\n\nA group of Asia-themed exhibits opened in 2006. Along with the giant pandas, the area also displays sloth bears, fishing cats, red pandas, a clouded leopard, Asian small-clawed otters, and Asian elephants. Next to the pandas is an exhibit for Japanese giant salamander. However, in mid-2016, the salamander died and the exhibit space is currently unoccupied; the zoo keeps members of the species off-exhibit in the reptile house.\n\nIn spring 2008, the National Zoo began construction on Elephant Trails, a new home for its 7 Asian elephants. The first part of the $52 million project opened in September 2010, expanding the zoo's former elephant area with a barn, two new yards (one with a pool), and a quarter-mile (400 m) walkway through woods, a total of of outdoor space, bringing the total size of Elephant Trails to 2 acres (0.81 ha). Elephant Trails: A Campaign to Save Asian Elephants is a comprehensive breeding, education, and scientific research program. It is designed to help scientists care for elephants in zoos and save them in the wild. The Elephant House was closed to the public from September 14, 2009 until late March 2013 for construction of the second phase of Elephant Trails. This includes the Elephant Community Center, an indoor exhibit with many interpretive signs and graphics.\n\nLemur Island is a moated island that is home to a group of ring-tailed lemurs, red-fronted lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs.\n\"Uncle Beazley\", a fiberglass \"Triceratops\" that Louis Paul Jonas created for the DinoLand pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, can now be seen near the island. The life-size statue, which had been located on the National Mall near the National Museum of Natural History until 1994, is named for a dinosaur in the 1956 children's book, \"The Enormous Egg\", by Oliver Butterworth and in the book's 1968 television movie adaptation, in which the statue appeared.\n\nThe majority of the zoo's smaller mammal species live in the Small Mammal House. The species on display include golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, pale-headed saki monkeys, Geoffroy's marmosets, red ruffed lemurs, black-footed ferrets, dwarf mongooses, meerkats, brush-tailed bettongs, striped skunks, La Plata three-banded armadillos, screaming hairy armadillos, sand cats, fennec foxs, naked mole-rats, southern tamanduas, rock hyraxs and several others.\n\nA sister pair of White-nosed coatis and a male, female pair of black howler monkeys can be found behind the building, while a pair of bennett's wallabies can be found along the side of the building.\n\nDespite not being mammals, two Von der Decken's hornbills and a male green aracari can be found in the building.\n\nThe American Trail exhibit houses a variety of North American species. These include five California sea lions, four grey seals, one harbor seal, three North American beavers, two North American River Otters, two bald eagles, two common ravens, three brown pelicans, and two grey wolves. After facing severe threats, the majority of American Trail species have rebounded thanks to conservation efforts. Many of the residents of American Trail have been listed as endangered. All of plants in the animal enclosures on American Trail exhibit are native to North America. \n\nThe exhibit also features a cafe called Seal Rock Cafe, which offers dishes crafted from local, seasonal, and sustainable ingredients. Menu items include Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) certified shrimp and Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fish. The American Trail was recently renovated and reopened in late summer 2012.\n\nThe Great Ape House is separated into two sets of enclosures. One houses seven bornean orangutans (two males named Kiko and Kyle; four females named Lucy, Batang, Iris and Bonnie; and a male infant named Redd, born in 2016). The other houses seven western lowland gorillas (four males named Baraka, Kojo, Kwame and Moke; As well as three females named Mandara, Kibibi and Calaya). The orangutans are allowed access to the Think Tank (see below) by travelling along the \"O-Line\", a series of high cables supported by metal towers that enable the orangutans to move between the two buildings. Kyle, Batang and Redd are Bornean orangutans and Kiko, Lucy, Iris and Bonnie are all hybrid orangutans.\n\nThe Think Tank is an area designed to educate visitors about how animals think and learn about their surroundings. The Think Tank features several interactive displays that teach visitors how zoologists conduct their studies. The zoo's orangutans (which are sometimes used in keeper demonstrations) are allowed to move from the Great Ape House to the Think Tank, and the building includes suitable enclosures for the apes should they choose to stay there. Other animals kept and studied in The Think Tank include brown rats, land hermit crabs, 4 Allen's swamp monkeys and 3 red-tailed monkeys. The zoo once had a population of Celebes crested macaques living in an outdoor cage.\n\nGibbon Ridge is an enclosure housing two different species of gibbon: two Northern white-cheeked gibbons (a male named Sydney and female named Tuyen), and two siamang (a male named Bradley and a female named Ronnie).\n\nGreat Cats is separated into three enclosures. The zoo rotates African lions, two Sumatran tigers (a female named Damai and a male named Sparky) and a male Amur Tiger named Pavel between the three exhibits.\n\nOne of the zoo's tigers, Soyono, was euthanized in November 2012. She was 19 years old, which is close to the limits of her life span. The tiger looked to be suffering from spondylosis, a degenerative spinal disorder, which afflicts big cats as they get older.\n\nOn January 24, 2014, the zoo's 10-year-old female lion, Nababiep, gave birth to three cubs in an eight-hour period. Two of the cubs survived, and were the first lion cub litter born at the zoo in four years, the third for Nababiep, and the fourth for the eight-year-old father, Luke. The birth followed the birth of two rare Sumatran tiger cubs to mother Damai on August 5, 2013. There are also two (currently indefinitely unoccupied) exhibits for bobcats and caracals.\n\nThis is an outdoor exhibit designed to mimic the African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and what is being done to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses four South African cheetahs (both males; Justin/Gat [named for Justin Gatlin], Bakari, Donnie and Copley), while the other houses one male Grevy's zebra named Moyo. Other animals on display in the area include two scimitar-horned oryxs, four dama gazelles, two Rüppell's vultures, one sitatunga, three red river hogs, two male maned wolves named Mateo and Quito (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian ground hornbill and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).\n\nThis exhibit housed the zoo's collection of invertebrates. It was permanently closed to the public on June 22, 2014 due to inadequate funding. The zoo has mentioned they eventually want to build a hall of biodiversity which will include invertebrates. The zoo's Bird House is currently under renovation and once complete some invertebrates (such as Horseshoe crabs) will be included.\n\nThis South America-themed walk-through exhibit contains animal and plant species native to the Amazon basin. Animals on display include multiple species of freshwater stingrays, oscars, silver arowanas, Yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles, arapaimas, black pacus, red-bellied piranhas, white-eared titi monkeys, a Southern two-toed sloth, sunbitterns, red-crested cardinals, yellow-rumped caciques and many more.\n\nThe Amazonia science gallery is located on the lower level. Here visitors can learn about the zoo's efforts to protect species around the globe. Some of the species on display include Panamanian golden frogs, African clawed frogs, aquatic caecilians, barred tiger salamanders, grey tree frogs and many species of poison frogs. Located within the science gallery is the Coral lab. Many corals are on display along with clownfish, anemones, peacock mantis shrimp, warty frogfish and other species.\n\nThe Electric Fishes Demonstration Lab features a five-foot long electric eel. Bluntnose knifefish, elephant-nose knifefish and black ghost knifefish are also featured.\n\nThe zoo's reptile and amphibian house exhibits seventy species of reptiles and amphibians. These include Aldabra tortoises, radiated tortoises, spider tortoises, Cuban crocodiles, a Gharial, a Philippine crocodile, Eastern indigo snakes, Gaboon vipers, gila monsters, green anacondas, Burmese rock pythons, green tree pythons, Timor pythons, king cobras, northern copperheads, Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, hellbenders, eastern red-backed salamanders, long-tailed salamanders, Alligator snapping turtles and many more.\n\nBehind the building are exhibits for a Komodo dragon, Chinese alligators and a false gavial. In the front of the building is an exhibit for an American alligator named Wally.\n\n The Bird House is closed for renovations for \"Experience Migration\", an exhibition dedicated to migratory birds.\nExperience Migration will open in 2021.\n\nThe Kids' Farm is aimed primarily at children and housing domesticated livestock. The exhibit also features a \"Pizza Garden\" which grows traditional pizza ingredients. Animals kept in the Kids' Farm include alpacas, Ossabaw Island hogs, miniature Mediterranean donkeys, Hereford and Holstein cows, and Nigerian dwarf, Anglo-Nubian and San Clemente Island goats. In 2011, the zoo announced plans to close The Kids' Farm due to budgetary constraints. However, a $1.4 million donation from State Farm Insurance allowed the exhibit to remain open.\n\nThe zoo opened a new American Bison Exhibit on August 30, 2014 as part of their 125th anniversary celebration. The exhibit features two female bison, named Zora and Wilma, that were transported to the zoo earlier that year from the American Prairie Reserve in northeastern Montana.\n\nOther animals in the zoo's collection include spectacled bears (near the Amazonia exhibit), Przewalski's horse, which is now gone] (in a yard adjacent to the Small Mammal house), North American porcupines (near the Great Cats exhibit), black-tailed prairie dogs (near the Great Cats exhibit) and Patagonian maras (near American Trail). \n\nOne of the most famous animals to have spent much of his life at the zoo was Smokey Bear, the \"living symbol\" of the cartoon icon created as part of a campaign to prevent forest fires. A black bear cub rescued from a fire, he lived at the zoo from 1950 until his death in 1976. During his time at the zoo, he had millions of visitors and an abundance of personal mail addressed to him – up to 13,000 letters a week – such that the U.S. Post Office designated a special zip code for correspondence addressed to him.\n\nDuring his time at the zoo, he was \"married\" to Goldie Bear, with the hope that one of his offspring would continue to hold the title of Smokey Bear. When the pair produced no offspring, an orphaned bear cub was added to their cage. It was named \"Little Smokey\", with the announcement that the bear couple had \"adopted\" the new cub. In 1975, an official ceremony was held to recognize the retirement of Smokey Bear and the new title of \"Smokey Bear II\" for Little Smokey. Upon the death of the original Smokey Bear, \"The Washington Post\" printed an obituary, recognizing him as a \"New Mexico native\" who had resided in Washington, D.C. for many years, working for the government.\n\nComing off the heels of President Richard Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China, the Chinese government donated two giant pandas, Ling-Ling (female) and Hsing-Hsing (male), to the official United States delegation. First Lady Pat Nixon donated the pandas to the zoo, where she welcomed them in an April 1972 ceremony. The first giant pandas in America, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were among the most popular animals at the zoo. Ling-Ling died in 1992 and Hsing-Hsing in 1999. Although Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing had five cubs between 1983 and 1989, all died as infants.\n\nA new pair of pandas, female Mei Xiang (\"Beautiful Fragrance\") and male Tian Tian (\"More and More\"), arrived on loan from the Chinese government in late 2000. The zoo paid an estimated 10 million dollars for the 10-year loan. On July 9, 2005, a male panda cub was born at the zoo. It was the first surviving panda birth at the zoo and the product of artificial insemination by the zoo's reproductive research team. The cub was named Tai Shan (\"Peaceful Mountain\") on October 17, 100 days after his birth; the panda went without a name for its first hundred days, in observance of a Chinese custom. Tai Shan is property of the Chinese government and was scheduled to be sent to China after his second birthday, although that deadline was extended in 2007 by two years. Tai Shan left Washington, D.C., on February 4, 2010, and was taken to the Ya'an Bifengxia Panda Base, part of the Wolong nature reserve's panda conservation center.\n\nOn September 16, 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub, believed by zoo officials to have been a female, which died after about a week. Initial results from a necropsy (animal autopsy) revealed the abnormal presence of fluid in the abdomen and also discoloration of the liver (hepatic) tissue of unknown etiology; the cub had managed to nurse before death because milk was found in its system. Zoo officials said that, while upsetting, they (and, by extension, the public) can hope to learn more about giant panda breeding, reproduction, and health as a result, and will work closely and cooperatively with their Chinese colleagues during the inquiry.\n\nIn January 2011, Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo, and Zang Chunlin, secretary general of the China Wildlife Conservation Association, signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement, extending the zoo's giant panda program for five more years, further cementing the two countries' commitment to the conservation of the species. The new agreement, effective through December 5, 2015, stipulates that the zoo will conduct research in the areas of breeding and cub behavior.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Mei Xiang gave birth to a live female panda cub (Tian Tian is the father; a second cub was stillborn), named Bao Bao (\"treasure\" or \"precious\"; decided through a naming contest) on the 100th day of her existence. Bao Bao is on public exhibit and drawing crowds, greatly increasing zoo attendance and on-line views via PandaCam.\n\nMei Xiang gave birth in August 2015 to two live cubs; the smaller one died a few days later (keepers had to care for it after Mei decided to focus on the larger cub). Sperm from both Tian Tian and another male giant panda based in a China preserve was used. It was determined on August 28, 2015 that both cubs were male and sired by Tian Tian. The larger, surviving cub was named Bei Bei (\"precious treasure\") on September 25, 2015. In celebration of a state visit, the name was selected by First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, and First Lady of the People's Republic of China, Peng Liyuan.\n\nBao Bao was healthy at that time, eating bamboo and special fruitsicle treats, having been separated from Mei at 18 months of age. She celebrated her second birthday in August 2015, shortly after the cubs were born. Her contract extended to August 2017. Bao Bao left the National zoo on February 22, 2017 for the Dujiangyan base of the China Panda Conservation and Research Center.\n\nIn partnership with Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ), a non-profit organization, the zoo holds annual fund raisers (ZooFari, Guppy Gala, and Boo at the Zoo) and free events (Sunset Serenades, Fiesta Musical). Proceeds support animal care, conservation science, education and sustainability at the National Zoo.\n\n\n\nFriends of the National Zoo (FONZ), the zoo's membership program, is the partner of the National Zoological Park that has been providing support to wildlife conservation programs at the zoo and around the world since 1958. FONZ members receive free parking, discounts at the zoo's stores and restaurants, and \"Smithsonian Zoogoer\", a magazine with the latest zoo news, research and photos.\n\nFONZ's 40,000 members include about 20,000 families, largely in the Washington metropolitan area, and more than 1,000 volunteers. FONZ provides guest services, development support, education and outreach programs, concessions management, and financial support for research and conservation. FONZ also offers a summer day-camp at the Rock Creek Park facility, and a residential nature camp at SCBI in Front Royal.\n\nThe Smithsonian established its Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in 2010 to serve as an umbrella for its global effort to conserve species and train future generations of conservationists. Headquartered in Front Royal, Virginia, the facility was previously known as the National Zoo's Conservation and Research Center.\n\nThe SCBI facilitates and promotes research programs based at Front Royal, at the National Zoo in Washington and at field research and training sites around the world.

In a broader sense it is a reference work for pharmaceutical drug specifications.\n\nThe term derives from Greek φαρμακοποιΐα \"pharmakopoiia\" \"making of (healing) medicine, drug-making\", a compound of φάρμακον \"pharmakon\" \"healing medicine, drug, poison\", the verb ποιεῖν \"poiein\" \"to make\" and the abstract noun suffix -ία \"-ia\".\n\nIn early modern editions of Latin texts, the Greek diphthong οι (\"oi\") is latinized to its Latin equivalent \"oe\" which is in turn written with the ligature \"œ\", giving the spelling \"pharmacopœia\"; in modern UK English, \"œ\" is written as \"oe\", giving the spelling \"pharmacopoeia\", while in American English \"oe\" becomes \"e\", giving us \"pharmacopeia\".\n\nAlthough older writings exist which deal with herbal medicine, the major initial works in the field are considered to be the Edwin Smith Papyrus in Egypt, Pliny’s pharmacopoeia and \"De Materia Medica\" (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς), a five-volume book originally written in Greek by Pedanius Dioscorides. The latter is considered to be precursor to all modern pharmacopoeias, and is one of the most influential herbal books in history. In fact it remained in use until about CE 1600.\n\nA number of early pharmacopoeia books were written by Persian and Arab physicians. These included \"The Canon of Medicine\" of Avicenna in 1025, and works by Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) in the 12th century (and printed in 1491), and Ibn Baytar in the 14th century. The Shen-nung pen ts'ao ching (Divine Husbandman's Materia Medica) is the earliest known Chinese pharmacopia. The text describes 365 medicines derived from plants animals and minerals; according to legend it was written by the Chinese god Shennong.\n\nThe first known work of this kind published under civic authority appears to have been that of Tang Dynasty in China. The treatise was written by several officials of Emperor Gaozong of Tang. The pharmacopoeia contained 850 sorts of crude medicine, revising the treatises written by ancient Chinese pharmacists.\n\nHowever, the first dated work appeared in Nuremberg in 1542; a passing student named Valerius Cordus showed a collection of medical prescriptions, which he had selected from the writings of the most eminent medical authorities, to the physicians of the town, who urged him to print it for the benefit of the apothecaries, and obtained for his work the sanction of the senatus. A work known as the \"Antidotarium Florentinum\", was published under the authority of the college of medicine of Florence in the 16th century. In 1511, the \"Concordie Apothecariorum Barchinone\" was published by the Society of Apothecaries of Barcelona and kept in the School of Pharmacy of the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe term \"Pharmacopoeia\" first appears as a distinct title in a work published at Basel, Switzerland, in 1561 by A. Foes, but does not appear to have come into general use until the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nBefore 1542 the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples by Avicenna and Serapion; the \"De synonymis\" and \"Quid pro quo\" of Simon Januensis; the \"Liber servitoris\" of Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim, which described the preparations made from plants, animals, and minerals, and was the type of the chemical portion of modern pharmacopoeias; and the \"Antidotarium\" of Nicolaus de Salerno, containing Galenic formulations arranged alphabetically. Of this last work, there were two editions in use — Nicolaus magnus and Nicolaus parvus: in the latter, several of the compounds described in the large edition were omitted and the formulae given on a smaller scale.\n\nAlso Vesalius claimed he had written some \"\"dispensariums\" and \"manuals\"\" on the works of Galenus. Apparently he burnt them. According to recent research communicated at the congresses of the International Society for the History of Medicine by the scholar Francisco Javier González Echeverría, Michel De Villeneuve(Michael Servetus) also published a pharmacopeia. Michel De Villeneuve, fellow student of Vesalius and the best galenist of Paris according to Johann Winter von Andernach, published the anonymous \" \"\"Dispensarium or Enquiridion\"\" in 1543, at Lyon, France, with Jean Frellon as editor. This work contains 224 original recipes by Michel De Villeneuve(Michael Servetus) and others by Lespleigney and Chappuis. As usual when it comes to pharmacopeias, this work was complementary to a previous Materia Medica that Michel De Villeneuve published that same year. This finding was communicated by the same scholar in the International Society for the History of Medicine, with agreement of John M. Riddle, one of the foremost experts on Materia Medica-Dioscorides works.\n\nNicolaes Tulp, mayor of Amsterdam and respected surgeon general, gathered all of his doctor and chemist friends together and they wrote the first pharmacopoeia of Amsterdam in 1636 \"Pharmacopoea Amstelredamensis\". This was a combined effort to improve public health after an outbreak of the plague, and also limit the number of quack apothecary shops in Amsterdam.\n\nUntil 1617 such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in England by the apothecaries and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate charter, and it was enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary’s shop. The preparation of physicians’ prescriptions was thus confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by the College of Physicians, and by the power which the wardens of the apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of examining the shops of apothecaries within 7 m. of London and destroying all the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, the first authorized London Pharmacopoeia, was selected chiefly from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, but it was found to be so full of errors that the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh edition was published in the following December.\n\nAt this period the compounds employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs’ eyes (i.e., gastroliths), pearls, oyster shells, and coral were supposed to have different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, calculi, human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, earthworms, etc.\n\nAlthough other editions of the London Pharmacopoeia were issued in 1621, 1632, 1639, and 1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir Hans Sloane, that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were still retained, such as dogs’ excrement, earthworms, and moss from the human skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits, cordials and ratafias were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee; to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the rejection of superfluous ingredients.\n\nIn the edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the principal remedies of physicians for 2,000 years were discarded, while a few powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the Pharmacopoeia of 1765 were restored to their previous position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published in 1824, 1836, and 1851.\n\nThe first Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia was published in 1699 and the last in 1841; the first Dublin Pharmacopoeia in 1807 and the last in 1850.\n\nThe preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. As a result, the Medical Act of 1858 ordained that the General Medical Council should publish a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, to be called the \"British Pharmacopoeia\", which would be a substitute throughout Great Britain and Ireland for the separate pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been published in Latin. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the fact that the majority of the compilers of the work were not engaged in the practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized manuals.\n\nThere are national and international pharmacopoeias, like the EU and the U.S. pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopeia in the EU is prepared by a governmental organization, and has a specified role in law in the EU. In the U.S., the USP-NF (United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary) has been issued by a private non-profit organization since 1820 under the authority of a Convention that meets periodically that is largely constituted by physicians, pharmacists, and other public health professionals, setting standards published in the compendia through various Expert Committees. In the U.S. when there is an applicable USP-NF quality monograph, drugs and drug ingredients must conform to the compendial requirements (such as for strength, quality or purity) or be deemed adulterated or misbranded under the Federal food and drug laws.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a nominally supranational pharmacopoeia, the State Pharmacopoeia of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSRP), although the de facto nature of the nationality of republics within that state differed from the de jure nature. The European Union has a supranational pharmacopoeia, the European Pharmacopoeia; it has not replaced the national pharmacopoeias of EU member states but rather helps to harmonize them. Attempts have been made by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis on which a globally international pharmacopoeia could be prepared, but regulatory complexity and locoregional variation in conditions of pharmacy are hurdles to fully harmonizing across all countries (that is, defining thousands of details that can all be known to work successfully in all places). Nonetheless, some progress has been made under the banner of the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), a tri-regional organisation that represents the drug regulatory authorities of the European Union, Japan, and the United States. Representatives from the Pharmacopoeias of these three regions have met twice yearly since 1990 in the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group to try to work towards \"compendial harmonisation\". Specific monographs are proposed, and if accepted, proceed through stages of review and consultation leading to adoption of a common monograph that provides a common set of tests and specifications for a specific material. Not surprisingly, this is a slow process. The World Health Organization has produced the International Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Int.), which does not replace a national pharmacopoeia but rather provides a model or template for one and also can be invoked by legislation within a country to serve as that country's regulation.\n\nThough formerly printed there has been a transition to a situation where pharmaceutical information is available as printed volumes and on the internet. The rapid increase in knowledge renders necessary frequent new editions, to furnish definite formulae for preparations that have already come into extensive use in medical practice, so as to ensure uniformity of strength, and to give the characters and tests by which their purity and potency may be determined. However each new edition requires several years to carry out numerous experiments for devising suitable formulae, so that current pharmacopoeia are never quite up to date.\n\nThis difficulty has hitherto been met by the publication of such non official formularies as \"Squire's Companion to the Pharmacopoeia\" and \"\" (formerly \"Martindale's: the extra pharmacopoeia\"), in which all new remedies and their preparations, uses and doses are recorded, and in the former the varying strengths of the same preparations in the different pharmacopoeias are also compared (Squire's was incorporated into Martindale in 1952). The need of such works to supplement the Pharmacopoeia is shown by the fact that they are even more largely used than the Pharmacopoeia itself, the first issued in 18 editions and the second in 13 editions at comparatively short intervals. In the UK, the task of elaborating a new Pharmacopoeia is entrusted to a body of a purely medical character, and legally the pharmacist does not, contrary to the practice in other countries, have a voice in the matter. This is notwithstanding the fact that, although the medical practitioner is naturally the best judge of the drug or preparations that will afford the best therapeutic result, they are not as competent as the pharmacist to say how that preparation can be produced in the most effective and satisfactory manner, nor how the purity of drugs can be tested.\n\nThe change occurred with the fourth edition of the British Pharmacopoeia in 1898. A committee of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was appointed at the request of the General Medical Council to advise on pharmaceutical matters. A census of prescriptions was taken to ascertain the relative frequency with which different preparations and drugs were used in prescriptions, and suggestions and criticisms were sought from various medical and pharmaceutical bodies across the British Empire. As regards the purely pharmaceutical part of the work a committee of reference in pharmacy, nominated by the pharmaceutical societies of Great Britain and Ireland (as they were then), was appointed to report to the Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Medical Council.\n\nSome difficulty has arisen since the passing of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only \"intended to afford to the members of the medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined\". It cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can be used only as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called \"Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs\" by C. G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.\n\nAn important step has also been taken in this direction by the publication under the authority of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain of the British Pharmaceutical Codex (BPC), in which the characters of and tests for the purity of many unofficial drugs and preparations are given as well as the character of many glandular preparations and antitoxins that have come into use in medicine, but have not yet been introduced into the Pharmacopoeia. This work may also possibly serve as a standard under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act for the purity and strength of drugs not included in the Pharmacopoeia and as a standard for the commercial grade of purity of those in the Pharmacopoeia which are used for non-medical purposes.\n\nAnother legal difficulty connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion in some of them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific chemical name is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were to use the same article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the chemical name (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and chemical name given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.\n\nIn most of the New Latin names, \"Pharmacopoea\" is the more common spelling, although for several of them, \"Pharmacopoeia\" is common.\n\n"}

Both had libraries named for members of the Phillips family.\" The Phillips Library reading room is in Plummer Hall on Essex Street, with offices in the connected John Tucker Daland House.\n\nPlummer Hall was originally built for the Salem Athenaeum in 1857. The Athenaeum provided for space for the Essex Institute and several other groups, and sold the building to the Essex Institute in 1907. The reading room underwent restoration in 1998. Both buildings closed in November 2011 for an extensive renovation. The Phillips Library Reading Room reopened in August 2013 at its temporary location at 1 Second Street, Peabody, MA.\n\nOn December 8, 2017, much to the dismay of Salem residents, Dan L.

{"id": "3460183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3460183", "title": "Posen speeches", "text": "Posen speeches\n\nThe Posen speeches were two secret speeches made by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, on 4 and 6 October 1943 in the town hall of Posen (), in German-occupied Poland. The recordings are the first known documents in which a high-ranking German member of the Nazi government spoke of the ongoing extermination of the Jews in extermination camps. They demonstrate that the German government wanted, planned and carried out the Holocaust.\n\nThe Posen speeches of October 1943 are two of 132 speeches obtained in various forms, which Himmler conducted before officials of the Nazi party. The first speech was given before 92 SS officers, the second before Reichsleiters and Gauleiters, as well as other government representatives. They constitute some of the most important of Himmler's speeches during the war, as they demonstrate Himmler's role as \"Architect of the Final Solution\" and a visionary of an elite race to be henceforth supported by the SS state.\n\nAlthough the genocide of the Jews was not the central topic in either of them, both carry historical significance in reference to it. Himmler did away with the usual camouflage terms and spoke explicitly of the extermination of the Jews via mass murder, which he depicted as a historical mission of the Nazis. This connection became clear in five further speeches made between December 1943 and June 1944 to commanders of the Wehrmacht.\n\nIn the literature, only the first speech was known as the \"Posen Speech\" until 1970. The second speech, uncovered at that time, is often mistaken as the first or equated with it.\n\nHimmler gave the speeches at a time when German military setbacks were mounting and the Nazi political and military leadership were privately expressing alarm. At the Casablanca Conference in January, 1943, the Allies had decided that the only acceptable outcome of the war was Germany's unconditional surrender. The Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad on 2 February 1943 was a turning point in the war. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the prosecution of those mainly responsible for war and genocide on 12 February, which the US Congress agreed to on 18 March. US and British troops landed on Sicily on 7 July 1943 and successfully invaded the Italian mainland on the 3 September, and after the Italian armistice on 8 September, gradually advanced northward. On 1 October, Naples was freed from German occupation.\n\nGerman hopes of regaining the military initiative on the Eastern front were dashed by the failure of the Battle of Kursk in early July, and the resultant massive Soviet counter offensive ushered in permanent German retreats for the remainder of the war. In the week 27 July – 3 August 1943, Allied air raids attacked Hamburg in Operation Gomorrah, and the armament centre of Peenemünde was heavily damaged by Operation Hydra on the night of 17-18 August, critically disrupting V-weapons development. At the same time resistance against German forces in the Western occupied territories grew, and a state of emergency was declared in Norway (17 August) and Denmark (29 August). Nazi dissidents planned Germany's reorganisation (the Kreisau Circle) and assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler (which led to \"Operation Walküre\", 20 July 1944). A scorched earth policy was brought in on 4 September for retreats on the Eastern Front, and martial law against those in the armed forces who refused to follow orders, initially introduced by the General Government on 2 October.\n\nIn the same period, the destruction of the Jews became the most important goal. In the spring of 1943, Sonderaktion 1005 was in full operation, the exhumation and incineration of those murdered by the Einsatzgruppen across the whole Eastern Front, whose death toll had so far reached 1.8 million Jews. Himmler ordered the liquidation of all Jewish ghettos in German occupied Poland on 11 June, and all Soviet ones on 21 June. As of 25 June, four new crematoria and gas chamber installations were completed in Auschwitz-II Birkenau at Auschwitz concentration camp. On 1 July all Jews in the Reich were placed under police law. On 24 August Himmler was appointed as minister of the interior, and thus all police forces in the Reich and occupied territories were subordinated to him. By 19 October, Operation Reinhard was to be terminated and the affiliated extermination camps dismantled.\n\nNonetheless, acts of resistance against the destruction of the Jews occurred. There were prisoner rebellions in Treblinka (2 August 1943,) and Sobibor (14 October 1943). Jews of the Białystok ghetto mounted an insurrection against their liquidation (16–23 August), and the Danes helped most of the Danish Jews planned for arrest to escape.\n\nHimmler did not prepare most of his speeches beforehand, but used terse handwritten notes instead. Since the end of 1942 his verbal lectures were no longer documented in shorthand, but recorded via phonograph onto wax master plates. These recordings were then typed up by SS-\"Untersturmführer\" Werner Alfred Wenn, who corrected obvious grammatical errors and supplemented missing words. Himmler then added his own handwritten corrections, and the thus authorised version was copied up via typewriter in large characters and then filed away.\n\nOf Himmler's three-hour speech of 4 October 1943, 115 pages of the final typewritten edition (one page was lost) were discovered among SS files and submitted to the Nuremberg Trials as document 1919-PS. On day 23 of the hearing, a passage (which however did not concern the Holocaust) was read out. A live recording of this speech survives, allowing for the differences between the spoken and the copyedited version to be examined. They are minor, and in no case distortionary.\n\nHimmler gave the first speech in the town hall, and not in the imperial palace as is often erroneously assumed. Of the SS's leadership cadre, 33 Obergruppenführers, 51 Gruppenführers and eight Brigadeführers from the whole of the Reich were present. Many of these came from areas of occupied eastern Europe. Large parts of the speech therefore concerned the increasingly precarious situation on the Eastern Front, while attempting to explain Soviet military successes as being due to a claimed combination of Communist ruthlessness and the weaknesses of Germany's allies.\n\nOnly about two minutes of the speech concerns the destruction of the Jews. Himmler postulates his audience's experiences with mass shootings, ghetto liquidations and extermination camps, and accordingly, their knowledge of them. The speech is to justify the crimes already perpetrated, and to commit its listeners to the \"higher purpose\" bestowed upon them. Around 50 officers not present were sent a copy of the speech and had to confirm their acknowledgment of it.\n\nAfter a tribute to the war dead, Himmler gave his view of the war so far. The tough Soviet resistance could be attributed to the political commissars, the German Invasion of the Soviet Union was a preemptive strike and due to failure by Germany's allies, a chance for victory in 1942 was wasted. Himmler speculated over the Soviet army's potential, spoke disparagingly of the \"Vlasov shivaree\" (\"der Wlassow-Rummel\"), expatiated on the inferiority of the Slavic race, and included thoughts as to how a German minority can prevail over it.\n\nIn later passages, Himmler claimed Italy's army had been contaminated with communism and was sympathetic to the Western allies. He also touches upon the situation in the Balkans and other occupied territories, whose acts of resistance he disregards as irritating pinpricks. The war in the air and sea is also mentioned, as well as the domestic front (\"die innere Front\") and factors from it such as enemy radio broadcasters and defeatism stemming from air raids.\n\nSubsequently, Himmler turns to the situation on the enemy's side, speculating over the relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States and their resilience and readiness for war. He goes into extensive detail about variances in the SS, individual divisions, police organisations, and outlines his duties regarding economic operations of the SS and being a minister of the Reich.\n\nIn his outline of the course of the war in the east, Himmler comments on the deaths of millions of Soviet prisoners of war and forced labourers. Like in pre-war speeches, and in accordance with Hitler's remarks in Mein Kampf, he speaks of how the eradication of the Slavic \"Untermensch\" is a historical and natural necessity. There is to be no place for sentiment:\n\nHimmler explicitly speaks of the genocide of the Jews, something which had not been previously done by a representative of the Nazi party up until this point:\n\nHimmler then praises the mindset of the SS man, devoting approximately 30 of the 116 pages to their virtues as well as their duty of becoming Europe's ruling class in 20 to 30 years.\n\nOf the second Posen speech, Himmler's terse notes are available, as well as a version recorded via shorthand then typed up and corrected in detail, and the final version as authorised by Himmler himself. The speech in each of these stages resided in the files of the Personal Staff of the Reichsführer (\"Persönlichen Stabes Reichsführer-SS\"), which were seized in their entirety by U.S. authorities in 1945. The text of the speech was recorded into microfilm by the U.S. and released to the Bundesarchiv. Analysis of these previously unavailable documents by historian Erich Goldhagen in 1970 in Koblenz revealed a speech hitherto unknown. It was printed in its entireity for the first time in 1974 in Bradley Smith's and Agnes Peterson's book of selected Himmler speeches.\n\nAt the end of September 1943, the party chancellery invited all Reichsleiters and Gauleiters, the head of the Hitler Youth Artur Axmann and Reich ministers Albert Speer and Alfred Rosenberg to a conference. This Posen Conference began on 6 October at 9 o'clock in the morning with Speer's reports, his speakers, and four big industries for armament production. Talks from Karl Dönitz and Erhard Milch followed. Himmler held his speech from 17:30 to 19:00. The second speech is shorter than the first, but contains a slightly longer and more explicit passage regarding the genocide of the Jews.\n\nHimmler begins by discussing partisans in Russia and support from Vlasov's auxiliary forces. The widespread idea that there would be a 300 kilometre wide belt dominated by partisans behind the German front is considered false. Frequently expressed is the view that Russia can only be conquered by Russians. This view is considered to be dangerous and wrong. Slavs are to be considered unreliable on a matter of principle, and for that reason, Russian Hiwis may only be employed as combatants in mixed units.\n\nThe danger of infiltrated parachutists, fugitive POWs and forced labourers is considered marginal, since the German population is in an impeccable way and grants the opponent no shelter, and the police have such dangers under control. A request by Gauleiters for a special force against the insurgency in the country is considered to be unnecessary and unacceptable.\n\nHimmler then reveals to \"this most secret circle\" his thoughts on the Jewish question, which he describes as \"the most difficult decision of my life\".\n\nHimmler then discusses the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (19 April – 16 May 1943) and the heavy battles during it:\n\nHimmler discusses the dismissal of Benito Mussolini, which is to have led to defeatism. A few death sentences imposed on the basis of making corrosive remarks are to serve as dissuasive warnings for thousands of others, and party members must display exemplary behaviour. Himmler then discusses his duties as Reich minister of the interior. By Hitler's volition, party organisation and administrative organisation are henceforth two separate pillars. Decentralized decisions are considered important, but centralised arrangements take precedence in the strained war situation. As a result, Himmler makes broad criticism of the personal politics of Gauleiters. In the last part of his speech, he goes into the benefits of the Waffen-SS. Himmler closes by discussing how the German national boundary will be pushed 500 km eastwards with 120 million people being relocated, and ends with the appeal:\n\nAlbert Speer, Reich minister for arms and munition since 1942, was, since 2 September 1943 as Reich minister for armament and wartime economy, responsible for all German armament production. This used Jewish forced labourers who were partly exempted from being deported to their extermination until 1943. After 1945, Speer always maintained that he left the conference before Himmler made his speech and knew nothing of the Holocaust. Historians cite Himmler's direct reference to Speer as proof of his presence.\n\nStatements from five further secret speeches by Himmler confirm the sentiment he expressed in Posen on the \"final solution to the Jewish question\". On 16 December 1943, he said to Kriegsmarine commanders:\n\nA handwritten memo from Himmler's speech on 26 January 1944 in Posen to Generals of fighting troops reads:\n\nOn 5 May 1944 Himmler explained to Generals in Sonthofen that perseverance in the bombing war has only been possible because the Jews in Germany have been discarded.\n\nApplause can be heard on a recording of another speech given to Generals in Sonthofen on 24 May 1944, when Himmler says:\n\nOn 21 June 1944 Himmler spoke to Generals educated in the Nazi world view in Sonthofen, mentioning the Jewish question again:\n\nThe destruction of the Jews was to be kept secret from those outside the Nazi regime, but could only be organised and carried out with the participation of all relevant state and party executives. The Posen speeches offer a retrospective look at the mass killings already carried out, and show how these and further killings were ideologically justified by the Party. The extermination of the \"internal enemy\" (\"innerer Feind\"), the Jewish race, had become an objective of the war, and success in this field was to compensate for other defeats accrued in the course of the war.\n\nSaul Friedländer highlights Himmler's self-image as an unconditionally obedient executor of Hitler's plans for the Germanic \"Lebensraum in the east\".\n\nKonrad Kwiet comments on Himmler's association of the \"heaviest task\" the SS ever had to perform with the \"Anständigkeit\" (decency) that had been preserved of it:\n\nHans Buchheim comments that the accused perpetrators very probably lacked a \"mens rea\". Himmler's revaluation of soldierly virtues was not a total negation of moral norms, but a suspension of them for the exceptional situation of the extermination of the Jews, which had been passed off as a historical necessity. Therefore, Himmler endorsed the murder of the Jews not by instruction, but via the \"correct\" ideological motives, while letting similar murders committed out of sadism or selfishness be prosecutable.\n\nHistorian Dieter Pohl states:\n\nThe unsparing portrayal of the genocide in Himmler's secret speech is thus interpreted as a means to formally render senior SS and Nazi functionaries as co-conspirators and accomplices in the perpetration of the Holocaust.\n\nJoseph Goebbels alludes to this view in his diary entry of 2 March 1943:\n\nIn an entry dated 9 October 1943, Goebbels commented on Himmler's second speech, at which he was present:\n\nHolocaust deniers have frequently attempted to negate Himmler's speeches as proof of the Holocaust. In particular, where Himmler – in his speech of 4 October 1943 – refers to the \"Ausrottung des jüdischen Volkes\" (extermination of the Jewish people), they will read the verb \"ausrotten\" (literally to \"root out\", aus = out; rott = root) and its related noun \"Ausrottung\" to offer a much more benign interpretation, i.e., Himmler was merely referring to the deportation of Jews and a desire to \"root them out\", as opposed to their mass destruction.\n\n\"Ausrotten\" can mean \"to stamp out/to root out\", but only figuratively, e.g., in contexts of concepts or ideals. In the context of living things (such as a people or race), \"ausrotten\" accordingly means destroying something so that it cannot return. David Irving considers the usage of the word \"Ausrotten\" vitally important and also agrees that the term was referring to eradication. He confirms this in an interview from 2007 when he compares its usage with Goebbels half-word \"Ausrott...\" during the Sportpalast speech from February 1943. In the subsequent paragraph, Himmler compares his disdain for individuals gaining personally (e.g. stealing) from Jewish victims, and the necessity to prevent this personal gain, to becoming sick and dying \"from the same bacillus that we have exterminated\" (\"weil wir den Bazillus ausrotten, an dem Bazillus krank werden und sterben\"). This use of \"ausrotten\" can be read as killing or extermination in the context of living things, because arguing for the deportation of bacteria would make no sense. The reference to a bacillus in this statement is figurative, however, in line with Nazi rhetoric that encouraged dehumanizing concepts of Jews as a pathogen or malignant presence, rather than people.\n\nIn the \"Ausrottung des jüdischen Volkes\" paragraph, Himmler says:\n\nHimmler thus confirms that the context is explicitly physical extermination, since \"umbringen\" simply has no meaning other than \"to kill\". Because of this, critics explain that Holocaust deniers will arbitrarily select words from the dictionary that have nothing to do with the given context, such as cherry-picking the definition for \"Unkraut\" (weeds) and erroneously applying it to \"Volk\" (people).\n\nIn the second speech in Posen, critics point to the fact that he defines the meaning of \"ausrotten\", where the operative word is \"umbringen\".\n\nHolocaust deniers will also offer erroneous translations of \"ausrotten\" by analysing the word's compounds, on the basis that \"\"aus\" and \"rotten\"\" are cognate with the English \"out\" and \"root\". To native German speakers, this is simply wrong. Critics compare this attempted etymological explanation to an attempt to cite the Latin origins of \"ex\" (out of) and \"terminus\" (borders) and on that basis, claim that \"exterminate\" means deportation, which would be equally nonsensical to native English speakers.\n\nCritics point out that German Holocaust deniers do not dare suggest a translation to a German audience where \"ausrotten\" does not mean physical extermination, citing instances of German deniers dismissing failed etymological analysis by English speakers by responding to confirm that \"ausrotten\" means complete destruction, and material written by German deniers where, in the context of people, \"ausrotten\" and \"vernichten\" are used synonymously.\n\nGermar Rudolf and Udo Walendy have claimed that the recording of the first speech is a forgery: Himmler's voice was actually that of a 1945 Allied voice imitator. However, the discovery of the second Posen speech in the Koblenz Bundesarchiv rendered allegations of falsification completely irrelevant. Himmler's explicit statements, such as making the decision to make the Jews \"disappear from the earth\", leave no room for alternative interpretation.\n\nIn Romuald Karmakar's 2000 film \"The Himmler Project\", the actor Manfred Zapatka reads the entire speech of 4 October 1943 word for word according to the recording, including all the nuances and incidents also recorded and the repetitions where Himmler loses his place while reading from a prepared manuscript. During the film, Zapatka wears no uniform and simply stands in front of a grey wall.\n\nHeinrich Breloers multipart television film \"Speer und Er\" contains a debate as to whether Albert Speer was present during Himmler's speech on 6 October 1943.\n\nIn Jonathan Littell's \"The Kindly Ones\", the first-person narrator, Maximilian Aue, cannot remember whether Speer was present or not, but does cite Speer's remark that he (Speer) remembered many officers being terribly drunk. As Speer only arrived in the morning for his speech, this would actually mean Speer was present during the evening's dinner, after Himmler's second Posen speech.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1966766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1966766", "title": "Proclamation of Indonesian Independence", "text": "Proclamation of Indonesian Independence\n\nThe Proclamation of Indonesian Independence (, or simply \"Proklamasi\") was read at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo, amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945.\n\nThe document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name \"Soekarno\" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day.\n\nThe draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at the house of Rear-Admiral Tadashi Maeda, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum, Jl. Imam Bonjol No. 1, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August.\n\nWhile the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers 'in the name of the nation of Indonesia'.\n\nSukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.\n\nThe proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the proclamation was broadcast overseas.\n\nProklamasi\n\nKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam tempoh jang sesingkat-singkatnja\n\nDjakarta, 17-8-'05\n\nWakil Bangsa Indonesia \n\nThree amendments were made to the draft, as follows:\n\nP R O K L A M A S I\n\nKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal-hal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam \"tempo\" jang sesingkat-singkatnja.\n\n\"Djakarta, hari 17 boelan 8 tahoen 05\"\n\n\"Atas nama bangsa Indonesia,\"\n\nSoekarno/Hatta.\n\nAn English translation published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as of October 1948 included the entire speech as read by Sukarno. It incorporated remarks made immediately prior to and after the actual proclamation. George McTurnan Kahin, a historian on Indonesia, believed that they were omitted from publication in Indonesia either due to Japanese control of media outlets or fear of provoking a harsh Japanese response.\n\nPROCLAMATION\n\nWE THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA HEREBY DECLARE THE INDEPENDENCE OF\nINDONESIA. MATTERS WHICH CONCERN THE TRANSFER OF POWER AND\nOTHER THINGS WILL BE EXECUTED BY CAREFUL MEANS AND IN THE\nSHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.\n\nDJAKARTA, 17 AUGUST 1945\n\nIN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA\n\nSOEKARNO/HATTA\n\nThis proclamation is printed in the front of the Rp.100,000 Indonesian banknote of the year 1999 and 2004 series.\n"}

{"id": "964717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=964717", "title": "Spamalot", "text": "Spamalot\n\nMonty Python's Spamalot is a musical comedy adapted from the 1975 film \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Like the motion picture, it is a highly irreverent parody of the Arthurian legend, but it differs from the film in many ways. The original 2005 Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, received 14 Tony Awards nominations, winning in three categories, including Best Musical. During its initial run of 1,575 performances, it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million.\n\nA recording encourages members of the audience to \"let your cellphones and pagers ring willy-nilly,\" and comments that they should \"be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you.\" This was recorded by Eric Idle. \n\nA historian narrates a brief overview of medieval England. In a miscommunication between the actors and the narrator, the actors sing an introductory song about Finland \"(\"Fisch Schlapping Song\")\". The Historian returns, irritated, and tells the frolicking Finns that he was talking about England, not Finland. The scene immediately changes to a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin and hitting themselves with books. King Arthur travels the land with his servant Patsy, who follows him around banging two coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse's hooves as Arthur \"rides\" before him, trying to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot. He encounters a pair of sentries who are more interested in debating whether two swallows could successfully carry a coconut than in listening to the king.\n\nSir Robin, a collector of plague victims, and Lancelot, a large, handsome and incredibly violent man, meet as Lancelot attempts to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred. Although a plague victim, the man insists that he is not dead yet and he can dance and sing. He completes a dance number, but is soon hit over the head with a shovel and killed by an impatient Lancelot. \"(\"He Is Not Dead Yet\")\". They agree to become Knights of the Round Table together, Lancelot for the fighting, and Robin for the singing and the dancing.\n\nArthur attempts to convince a peasant named Dennis Galahad that he, Arthur, is king of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur, the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs Galahad, are political radicals and deny that any king who has not been elected by the people has any legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur has the Lady Of The Lake and her Laker Girls appear to turn Dennis into a knight \"(\"Come With Me\")\". Cheered on by the girls \"(\"Laker Girls Cheer\")\", the Lady Of The Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song \"(\"The Song That Goes Like This\")\", complete with chandelier. They are joined by Sir Robin and Sir Lancelot, and together with Sir Bedevere and \"the aptly named\" Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show (a knight resembling Don Quixote, who promptly apologises and leaves), they make up the Knights of the Round Table \"(\"All For One\")\".\n\nThe five knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas's Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake headlining the Castle in full Cher get-up \"(\"Knights Of The Round Table\"/\"The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)\")\". In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (a recording voiced by John Cleese of the original Monty Python troupe and Eric Idle in the version currently touring the UK) who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. Urged on by the Lady Of The Lake \"(\"Find Your Grail\")\", the Knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers. They attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan Horse; however, they realise after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they should have hidden inside it. Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin taunting them again, sending cancan dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals including cows at them \"(\"Run Away!\")\". Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French catapult the Trojan Rabbit at them.\n\nSir Robin and his minstrels follow King Arthur and Patsy into a \"dark and very expensive forest\" (Arthur later says they're in a \"Dark and extremely expensive forest), where they are separated. King Arthur meets the terrifying but silly Knights who say Ni, who demand a shrubbery. King Arthur despairs of finding one, but Patsy cheers him up \"(\"Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life\")\" and they find a shrubbery shortly after.\n\nSir Robin, after wandering the forest for some time with his minstrels \"(\"Brave Sir Robin\")\", encounters The Black Knight, who scares him off, but King Arthur, who happens on the scene, more or less defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to give the Knights their shrubbery. The Knights accept it, but next demand that King Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway (in the United Kingdom, this became a West End musical; on the tour, they must put on a \"Broadway musical\"), implying that it need only be Broadway-style, \"but not an Andrew Lloyd Webber\". The mere mention of his name causes everyone to cover their ears and scream in pain. Sir Robin, who has found Arthur by this point, insists that it would be impossible for them to accomplish this next task, since you need Jews for a successful Broadway (or West End) musical \"(\"You Won't Succeed On Broadway\")\", and proves his point in a wild production number filled with \"Fiddler on the Roof\" parodies, including a bottle dance with Grails instead of bottles. King Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews.\n\nWhile the Lady Of The Lake laments her lack of stage time \"(\"Whatever Happened To My Part?\")\", Sir Lancelot receives a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is very surprised to find that the \"damsel\" is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert \"(\"Where Are You?\"/\"Here Are You\")\" whose overbearing, music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. As Herbert is asking Lancelot to help him escape, the King of Swamp Castle cuts the rope that he is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot's sidekick, Concorde. The King asks his son how he was saved, exactly, to which Herbert replies happily with a song. But the king charges at his son with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save him, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech about sensitivity to the king on Herbert's behalf, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process, an announcement celebrated in a wild disco number \"(\"His Name is Lancelot\")\".\n\nKing Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time \"(\"I'm All Alone\")\". The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along (in some productions she also points out Patsy's presence, to which Arthur claims that he sees Patsy as \"family\" and thus doesn't always consider him a separate person). Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't want to say anything to Arthur because \"that's not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed Christian.\" All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail \"(\"Twice in Every Show\")\".\n\nReunited with his Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns them of the danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the \"evil rabbit\" was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats. The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is house right of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D. In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're \"a bit stumped with the clue thing\" and asks God to \"give them a hand\". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is \"found\" (with some sleight of hand) under the seat and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo. \"(\"The Holy Grail\")\". Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the \"bloody singing\", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to \"He is Not Yet Dead\". \"(\"Act 2 Finale/Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)\")\".\n\nThe overall duration of the show is about two hours plus interval time.\n\nEric Idle wrote the musical's book and lyrics and collaborated with John Du Prez on the music, except for \"Finland\", which was written by Michael Palin for \"Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album\"; \"Knights of the Round Table\" and \"Brave Sir Robin\", which were composed by Neil Innes for \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"; and \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", which was originally written by Idle for the film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\".\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Does not appear on the Original cast album.\n\n‡The song 'You Won't Succeed On Broadway' was changed to 'You Won't Succeed in Showbiz' for the London production and later replaced with the 'Star Song' in the UK tour.\n\n\n\nIn tribute to the film, where six actors played the majority of the male parts (and a few female ones), several actors play multiple roles; the only major characters not doubling are Arthur and the Lady of the Lake. In the Broadway production, the following doubling is used:\n\n\nSara Ramirez was intended to double as a witch but this part was cut from the final script. Several pairs of characters originally played by the same Monty Python member were reduced to one: the Dead Collector and Sir Robin (Idle), the Large Man with a Dead Body and Sir Lancelot (Cleese), and Dennis the Active Peasant and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin).\n\nNotable Broadway cast replacements included:\nNotable West End cast replacements have included Peter Davison and Bill Ward in 2007 and Marin Mazzie, in early 2008. Sanjeev Bhaskar (King Arthur), Michael Xavier (Sir Galahad) and Nina Söderquist (Lady of the Lake) were part of the closing cast.\n\nPreviews of the show began in Chicago's Shubert Theatre (now the PrivateBank Theatre) on 21 December 2004; the show officially opened there on 9 January 2005.\n\nTwo musical numbers were dropped from Act One while the production was still in Chicago. During the scene set in the \"Witch Village\", the torch song \"Burn Her!\" was originally performed by Sir Bedevere, The Witch, Sir Robin, Lancelot and Villagers. At the French Castle, \"The Cow Song\", in a parody of a stereotypical film noir/cabaret style, was performed by The Cow and French Citizens. Before the two songs were cut in Chicago, the lead vocals in both songs were sung by Sara Ramirez. This gave her six songs in Act One, but no further appearances until scene five in Act Two, for \"The Diva's Lament\".\n\nThe musical previewed on Broadway, at New York's Shubert Theatre, beginning 14 February 2005, ahead of an official opening on 17 March. Mike Nichols directed, and Casey Nicholaw choreographed. The production won the Tony Award for Best Musical and was nominated for 14 Tony Awards. The show played its final performance on 11 January 2009 after 35 previews and 1,575 performances; it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million, recouping its initial production costs in under six months.\n\nThe original Broadway cast included Tim Curry as King Arthur, Michael McGrath as Patsy, David Hyde Pierce as Sir Robin, Hank Azaria as Sir Lancelot and other roles (e.g., the French Taunter, Knight of Ni, and Tim the Enchanter), Christopher Sieber as Sir Galahad and other roles (e.g., the Black Knight and Prince Herbert's Father), and Sara Ramirez as the Lady of the Lake. It also included Christian Borle as Prince Herbert and other roles (e.g., the Historian and Not Dead Fred), Steve Rosen as Sir Bedevere and other roles (e.g., Concorde and Dennis's Mother) and John Cleese as the (recorded) Voice of God.\n\n\nA North American tour commenced in spring 2006, and the cast included Michael Siberry as King Arthur, Jeff Dumas as Patsy, Richard Holmes as Lancelot, Bradley Dean as Galahad and Tom Deckman as The Historian. The tour won three 2007 Touring Broadway Awards, including Best New Musical. Richard Chamberlain later joined the tour as King Arthur. The Tour continued through the summer 2009, and played its final performances at the Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa where it closed on 18 October 2009.\nA Second North American tour launched on 24 September 2010 from Waterbury, Connecticut and ended 26 June 2011 in Dallas, Texas. The cast included Caroline Bowman as the Lady of the Lake. A third North American tour was undertaken in 2013.\n\nA three evening performance at the Hollywood Bowl was undertaken in 2015, with Eric Idle appearing in the role of The Historian, and other cast members including Christian Slater, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Craig Robinson, Merle Dandridge, Warwick Davis, Kevin Chamberlin and Rick Holmes. The script was updated and included many Los Angeles specific jokes.\n\nA London production opened at the Palace Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue in the West End, commencing 30 September 2006 (London premiere 17 October). Tim Curry and Christopher Sieber reprised their roles from the Broadway production. They were joined by Hannah Waddingham as the Lady of the Lake, Tom Goodman-Hill as Sir Lancelot, Robert Hands as Sir Robin, David Birell as Patsy, Tony Timberlake as Sir Bedevere and Darren Southworth as Prince Herbert. The London production closed on 3 January 2009.\n\nA UK tour scheduled for later in 2009 was initially postponed, the producers commenting \"Due to unforeseen circumstances the UK Tour of Spamalot will not be taking place as scheduled in 2009\", but eventually started at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 29 May – 5 June 2010. Phill Jupitus played King Arthur in the UK tour.\nTodd Carty played Patsy, assistant to King Arthur for the duration of the tour. Marcus Brigstocke made his musical theatre debut as King Arthur following Jupitus' departure. Jodie Prenger, Hayley Tamaddon, Amy Nuttall and Jessica Martin shared the role of The Lady of the Lake.\n\nThe UK tour also featured for the first time a re-working of the song \"You won't succeed on Broadway\" which has been renamed \"You won't succeed in showbiz\". The theme of the song has been changed from poking fun at the need for Jewish input into Broadway productions and instead mocks the cross over of celebrities in musicals and reality television competitions such as the X Factor. It notably pokes fun at reality TV celebrities including Simon Cowell, Cheryl Cole and Susan Boyle (who is shot by Sir Robin when she begins to sing).\n\nThe touring production played a limited seven week run in the West End during the summer of 2012 at the Harold Pinter Theatre Marcus Brigstocke shared the role of King Arthur with Jon Culshaw for those seven weeks, with Bonnie Langford playing Lady of the Lake. The production moved to the Playhouse Theatre on 14 November 2012, and ran until 12 April 2014. During 2013 a number of celebrities each played the part of God for a week in aid of charity, including Gary Lineker, Barbara Windsor, Brian May and Michael Palin.\n\nOther notable cast members during the run of the West End revival included Stephen Tompkinson, Joe Pasquale, Les Dennis and Richard McCourt as King Arthur, Anna-Jane Casey and Carley Stenson as Lady of the Lake, Warwick Davis and Dominic Wood as Patsy, Daniel Boys as Sir Lancelot and Jon Robyns as Sir Galahad.\n\nA production in April 2015 at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley starred Joe Pasquale, Todd Carty and Sarah Earnshaw.\n\nA production of the musical began Las Vegas, Nevada previewed on 8 March 2007 and opened on 31 March 2007 at the Wynn Las Vegas in the newly renamed Grail Theater. As with other Las Vegas transfers of Broadway musicals, including \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"Spamalot\" was condensed to run in ninety minutes without an intermission. Among the cuts were the song \"All For One\", most of the song \"Run Away\", the Knights of Ni receiving their shrubbery, and the \"Make sure he doesn't leave\" scene with Prince Herbert's guards.\n\nActor John O'Hurley starred as King Arthur, with J Anthony Crane playing Lancelot Due to the Las Vegas production, the North American touring company would not perform in California, Arizona, or Nevada. Although initially contracted to run for up to ten years its final performance was on 18 July 2008. \n\nA new Australian production started in Melbourne in November 2007 at Her Majesty's Theatre, with the official premiere on 1 December. The cast featured Bille Brown as King Arthur, Ben Lewis as Sir Galahad, Stephen Hall as Sir Lancelot and Mark Conaghan as Prince Herbert The Australian production closed on 5 April 2008, due to lack of ticket sales and no tour followed. In October 2014, Harvest Rain Theatre Company under the direction of producer Tim O'Connor staged a production of \"Spamalot\" with a cast list including Jon English as King Arthur, Simon Gallaher as Patsy, Julie Anthony as The Lady Of The Lake, and Frank Woodley as Sir Robin. The production was presented in The Concert Hall at QPAC in Brisbane.\n\nThe first translated production, in Spanish, ran at Teatre Victoria, Barcelona from 9 September 2008 to 10 May 2009. Directed by Catalan Comedy Group Tricicle and choreographed by Francesc Abós, the cast included Jordi Bosch as King Arthur and Marta Ribera as the Lady of the Lake. The production moved to Madrid in September 2009 A German production premiered in January 2009 at the Musical Dome in Cologne. The Hungarian production in Madach Theatre, Budapest premiered on 29 September 2009 with three casts, each actor taking up multiple roles. The Swedish production opened on the Malmö Nöjesteater in Malmö on 24 September 2010, with a cast including Johan Wester as King Arthur and Johan Glans as Sir Robin. The production moved to Oscarsteatern in Stockholm on 15 September 2011 where it played through 29 April 2012. Nina Söderquist, who starred as Lady of the Lake in the West End production was thought to reprise her role, but became pregnant. She joined the show when it moved to Stockholm, along with Henrik Hjelt as Sir Belvedere. In May 2011, the original UK touring production played at Politeama Rossetti in Trieste. Eric Idle attended the opening night on 24 May.\n\nThe Mexican premiere of the show was in July 2011 in Mexico City. The show ran for over 500 performances across the country. The Japanese productionran from 9 to 22 January 2012 at the Akasaka Blitz theater in Tokyo before playing Morinomiya Piloti Hall in Osaka from 2 February to February to 6 February. The production featured Yūsuke Santamaria as King Arthus, Aya Hirano as Lady of the Lake, Magy as Patsy, Yuya Matsushita as Sir Galahad and Tsuyoshi Muro as Prince Herbert. The South Korean production was presented by OD Musical Company, and CJ Entertainment's Performing Arts division (now a part of CJ E&M); incidentally, CJ CheilJedang, the sister company of CJ Group's multimedia business, manufactures Spam products under license since 1987. It played from 1 October to 28 December 2010, with Yesung of Super Junior and Park In-bae rotating as Sir Galahad. A Norwegian production ran from September to December 2012, with a cast featuring Atle Antonsen as King Arthur, Trond Espen Seim as Sir Lancelot, Anders Baasmo Christiansen as Sir Robin, Espen Beranek Holm as Sir Belvedere and Trond Fausa Aurvåg as Prince Herbert. A Serbian production at Sava Centar in Belgrade had a cast including Nikola Kojo as King Arthur, Nikola Đuričko as Sir Lancelot and Gordan Kičić as Sir Robin.\n\nBook-writer and lyricist Eric Idle explained the title in a February 2004 press release:\n\nThe show has had mixed reactions from Idle's former colleagues in Monty Python.\n\nTerry Gilliam, in an audio interview, describes it as \"Python-lite\". He later told the BBC News, \"It helps with the pension fund, and it helps keep Python alive. As much as we'd like to pull the plug on the whole thing it carries on – it's got a life of its own.\"\n\nTerry Jones – who co-directed the original film with Gilliam – expressed his opinions forthrightly in May 2005: \"\"Spamalot\" is utterly pointless. It's full of air…Regurgitating Python is not high on my list of priorities.\" However, when asked whether he liked \"Spamalot\" during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM \"The Bone\" shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, \"Well, I thought it was terrific good fun. It's great to see the audience loving it. I suppose I had reservations as far as…well…the idea of doing scenes from a film on stage. I just don’t get the point of it. They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric.\" Jones went on to say, \"...I think the best parts of the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious! That is one of the great moments where the show really comes alive for me.\"\n\nIn an October 2006 interview, Michael Palin said, \"We’re all hugely delighted that \"Spamalot\" is doing so well. Because we’re all beneficiaries! It's a great show. It's not ‘Python’ as we would have written it. But then, none of us would get together and write a ‘Python’ stage show. Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, ‘Well, I’ll do it myself then.’ He sent us bits and songs and all that and we said, ‘Yeah, that's all right, have a go.’ But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud to be associated with it, rather pathetically.\"\n\nWhen asked by a \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\" reporter in 2008 if he had to be persuaded to provide the recorded voice of God in the musical, John Cleese said, \"Yeah, that's right. And in the end I think \"Spamalot\" turned out splendidly. It's had a tremendous run. I defy anyone to go and not have a really fun evening. It's the silliest thing I’ve ever seen and I think Eric did a great job.\"\n\nThe last verse of the \"Finland\"/\"Fisch Slapping Dance\" was incorporated into Spam sketch for the 2014 reunion show \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\".\n\nThe original production has been both a financial and critical success. \"Variety\" reported advance ticket sales of $18 million, with ticket prices ranging from $36 to $179. The advance made Broadway box office history.\n\nThe show proved to be an early success when moving to London's West End. After high advance ticket sales the show's run was extended by four weeks, four months before the run commenced.\nThe play makes many references to the film and other material in the Python canon, including a line from \"The Lumberjack Song\", nods to \"Ministry of Silly Walks\", the \"Election Night Special\" and \"Dead Parrot sketch\" routines, a bar from \"Spam\" worked into \"Knights of the Round Table\", a rendition of the song \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" from the film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (1979), and the \"Fisch Schlapping Song\" which is a reference to both \"The Fish-Slapping Dance\" and the song \"Finland\". Another reference is actually part of the \"Playbill\" of the show; there are several gag pages about a musical entitled \"Dik Od Triaanenen Fol (Finns Ain't What They Used To Be)\". This gag programme was written by Palin, and echoes the \"faux\"-Swedish subtitles in the credits of the original \"Grail\" Python film.\n\nBroadway musical fans appreciate its references to other musicals and musical theatre in general, such as: \"The Song That Goes Like This\" (a spoof of Andrew Lloyd Webber productions and many other Broadway power ballads); the knights doing a dance reminiscent of \"Fiddler on the Roof\", and another reminiscent of \"West Side Story\" (including the music); Sir Lancelot's mimicking of Peter Allen in \"His Name Is Lancelot\"; the character of Sir Not Appearing in This Show being \"Man of La Mancha\"'s Don Quixote; a member of the French \"army\" dressed as Eponine from \"Les Misérables\"; and a line pulled from \"Another Hundred People\" from Stephen Sondheim's \"Company\" by the \"damsel\" Herbert. The song \"You Won't Succeed (On Broadway)\" also parodies \"The Producers\" and \"Yentl\".\n\nThe show has not escaped criticism. In \"Slate\", Sam Anderson wrote,\n\"Python was formed in reaction to exactly the kind of lazy comedy represented by \"Spamalot\" — what Michael Palin once described as the 'easy, catch-phrase reaction' the members had all been forced to pander in their previous writing jobs... \"Spamalot\" is the gaudy climax of a long, unfunny tradition of post-Python exploitation – books, actions figures, video games – that treats the old material as a series of slogans to be referenced without doing any of the work that made the lines so original in the first place.\"\n\nThe West End version opened to rave reviews. \"It's a wonderful night, and I fart in the general direction of anyone who says otherwise\", wrote Charles Spencer in the \"Daily Telegraph\" (echoing a joke from the show). According to Paul Taylor in the \"Independent\", \"it leaves you that high and weak with laughter, thanks not just to the Python provenance of the basic material but to the phenomenal speed, wit, cheek and showbiz knowingness of the direction, which is by the great veteran, Mike Nichols\". Michael Billington in the \"Guardian\" was less enthusiastic, though, stating \"while I'm happy to see musicals spoofed, the show's New York origins are clearly exposed in a would-be outre number which announces \"we won't succeed in show business if we don't have any Jews\": a Broadway in-joke that has little purchase this side of the Atlantic.\" Billington adds, \"With hand on heart, I'd much rather watch Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot\" than Eric Idle's smart-arsed \"Spamalot\".\"\n\nThe Las Vegas production was awarded the Number 1 show of 2007 by the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\n\nOn 22 March 2006, to mark the first anniversary of the official Broadway opening, the \"World's Largest Coconut Orchestra\", 1,789 people clapping together half coconut shells, performed in Shubert Alley, outside the theatre. The claim was officially recognised by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". This record was broken by 5,877 people in Trafalgar Square at 7 pm on 23 April 2007, led by the cast from the London production, along with Jones and Gilliam, with the coconuts used in place of the whistles in \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\". This formed part of London's St George's Day celebrations that year and was followed by a screening of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\".\n\nIn 2006, the London cast of \"Spamalot\" performed excerpts at the Royal Variety Performance.\n\nOn 10 March 2007, \"Spamalot\" partnered with HP Sauce (the classic British brown sauce, now made in the Netherlands following a contentious decision to close its factory in Britain) to produce 1,075 limited edition bottles featuring a unique \"Spamalot\" take on the classic HP design. The bottles were available exclusively via Selfridges, London and came in a presentation box with a numbered certificate. 1,075 was chosen to celebrate, absurdly, \"1,075 years of the show running in London\".\n\nIn July 2007 it was announced that the London production would solve the problem of replacing Hannah Waddingham as the Lady of the Lake through a TV talent show in Sweden. The programme, called West End Star, which began airing on TV3 on 8 December 2007, announced Nina Söderquist as the winner on 2 February 2008. Söderquist took up the rôle of The Lady of the Lake, with a standing ovation, on 11 February 2008.\n\nPortions of the \"Spamalot\" original cast recording were featured (with accompanying Flash animation) as a special feature in the 2006 \"Extraordinarily Deluxe Two-Disc Edition\" DVD re-release of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\".\n\nIn the original Broadway production, Sara Ramirez sang the line, \"I've no Grammy, no reward/I've no Tony Award.\" Ironically, the show's original cast album won the Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album in 2006 and Ramirez herself won the Tony for Best Featured Actress in 2005. The two awards led to a minor change to the song \"The Diva's Lament\". Initially, the line became \"My Tony Award/won't keep me out of Betty Ford's\". When Lauren Kennedy took over for Sara Ramirez, it became \"My predecessor won awards/and now she's in Betty Ford's\" but was later changed to, \"All our Tony Awards/won't keep me out of Betty Ford's.\" In the touring production, Pia Glenn sings \"All our \"goddamn\" awards/won't keep me out of Betty Ford's.\" For a change, Hannah Waddingham in the London production sings \"I'm as depressed as I can be/ I've got constant PMT\".\n\nThe touring production has garnered Boston's Elliot Norton Award for Outstanding Visiting Production.\n\nA special edition of \"The South Bank Show\" was a television documentary on the history of \"Spamalot\". It features numerous segments with Eric Idle and John Du Prez explaining the process of writing the songs, plus interviews with UK and US cast members. It included scenes from the rehearsal of the West End show, and was first broadcast on 15 October 2006.\n\nIn May 2018, 20th Century Fox announced a film adaptation is in works with Idle writing the script and Casey Nicholaw attached to direct. The film is reportedly being fast tracked with casting announced soon and shooting to begin in early 2019. The next month it was reported that the studio was looking to cast Benedict Cumberbatch as King Arthur, Peter Dinklage as his servant Patsy and Tiffany Haddish as the Lady of the Lake.\n\nIn 2013 the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the producer of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", over royalties for \"Spamalot\". He was paid 1/14 of the portion of the profits paid to the Pythons. The court ruled that he was a full Python partner and was to be paid 1/7 of the portion paid to the Pythons. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater, prompting them to produce \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\".\n\n"}

{"id": "33882593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33882593", "title": "Super Demetrios", "text": "Super Demetrios\n\nSuper Demetrios () is a 2011 Greek guerrilla ultra-low-budget superhero comedy film starring and written by the cinematic comedy group OtiNaNai Productions and directed by Georgios Papaioannou. Upon its release at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival the film got the highest number of audience votes in the history of the festival and became an instant cult classic, with all screenings being sold out in all venues thereafter.\n\nIn a surreal, parallel universe, Thessaloniki has its very own superhero: Super Demetrios. Posing as Dimitris Christoforidis, journalist for the Golden Jerusalem magazine, he fights for truth, justice and the Greco-Christian ideal. In the dark of the night, the city's worst nightmare returns. Captain F.ROM is back, determined to meet his long-awaited goal: claiming his true name. The two protagonists are drawn into a conflict that toys with the viewer's patience until the very climax of the film, in an archetypal battle between good and evil.\n\n\n\"Super Demetrios\" was created by a cinematic group called \"OtiNaNai Productions\" (literally: Whatever Productions). They are a group of friends from various Greek cities that met while in Thessaloniki as university students in the early 2000s. The group was formed initially by Georgios Papaioannou from Kavala and Mitsos Papavasileiou from Livadeia, both students of civil engineering, along with Dimitrios Vainas, Panos Kechagiopoulos, Charalambos Kydonakis, a student of architecture from Crete and Charalampos Papapostolou. They produced various short and feature DIY comedies and parodies in a philosophy similar to Monty Python's.\n\nThe idea of Super Demetrios came in 2007 while the team was working on a different script. One of the lesser characters of that script showed a lot of potential so they abandoned that script and started anew the story of Super Demetrios.\n\nIn June 2008 they begun shooting in Thessaloniki. In December Georgios Papaioannou had to move to Athens for professional reasons while Mitsos Papavasileiou had already had moved to Livadeia so they stopped shooting.\n\nIn October 2009 they decided to resume shooting and they started a series of scheduled trips to Thessaloniki, mostly on weekends and holidays. Since all cast and crew collaborated for free and everything was done in a DIY philosophy, the film's budget of €2000 was merely the cost of those trips. The shooting concluded in October 2010, more than two years after it begun. After that Georgios Papaioannou begun editing it for almost a year.\n\nIn Spring 2011, since the word of the very first Greek superhero movie had already been spread among fans, the movie was invited to the Den Yparxei Film Festival in Athens. During that time only one full scene was complete with visual effects and compositing (the space shuttle scene) and therefore only that scene could be screened in the festival. Nevertheless, the movie was awarded a special prize for the \"Best Picture Yet To See\".\n\nIn November 2011 a rough cut of \"Super Demetrios\" was first publicly screened at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival.\n\nAfter the festival Georgios Papaioannou resumed editing the movie for a while. They also replaced some of the songs used in the festival copy with original scores so as in the final cut all music was either original or royalty-free.\n\nFollowing the awards the film was distributed by the Thessaloniki International Film Festival to several Greek cities.\n\nAfter that, OtiNaNai Productions got its own distribution in two cinemas in Athens and Thessaloniki at the same time.\n\nThe film was also invited to many film clubs around Greece.\n\nOne year after its initial screening the film along with its soundtrack was freely released on the Internet under a Attribution, Non-commercial, No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0).\n\n\n\nDue to the long time taken for development, even before its release, \"Super Demetrios\" had already had a strong fan base, mostly among the Thessaloniki campus students.\n\nIn mid 2011, a major Athenian newspaper did a two-page tribute to \"Super Demetrios\", the so-called \"first Greek superhero film\", making it known to the general public of Athens.\n\nUpon its release at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival all screenings were crowded with a lot of people watching it standing up on the stairs. The film got the highest number of audience votes in the history of the festival. After that it was considered an instant cult classic, compared by many critics to an earlier Greek sci-fi cult film, \"The Attack of the Giant Moussaka\" (1999).\n\n\"Super Demetrios\" received broadly positive reviews in the mainstream press.\n\nGiannis Zoumboulakis from \"To Vima\" newspaper described it as \"the most pleasant Greek production in the last Thessaloniki Film Festival\".\n\nIlias Fragoulis from \"Free Cinema\" called it \"the most epic sci-fi b-movie of Greek cinema, after \"The Attack of the Giant Moussaka\"\".\n\nKostas Tsokos of \"FilmBoy\" gave it a 7/10 saying among others that \"First of all, everythings shows love and affection for the genre, and for cinema in general\" and that \"acting is a bit flat and dry but in most cases fits the movie's style. But after all it's a superhero parody and all this makes it more cult and less pretentious.\"\n\nGeorgia Myridaki from \"Fringe\" gave it 5/5 writing that \"it has tons of caustic humor, mocks and plays very cleverly with stereotypes that are inextricably linked with this city, like nationalism, strong Christian faith, surrealism\" while \"leaving aside clichés.\"\n\nStratos Kersanidis from \"AlterThess\" calls it \"cult cinema in all its glory\" and a \"thoroughly poorly done film\" that satirizes shamelessly and in a \"blasphemous\" and funny way the conservatism and other aspects of Thessaloniki.\n\nGiorgos Kalapotharakos of \"Cine Tweets\" gave it 2/5. He wrote that directing was good, especially if you consider the budget, but he found acting unacceptable.\n\n As a result of the film's success, Georgios Papaioannou, a successful PhD in civil engineering, decided to pursue a career in visual effects. After his visit to Los Angeles invited by the Los Angeles Greek Film Festival he studied in Gnomon School of Visual Effects in Hollywood, and now he is working as a VFX expert in the industry. His most notable work is for the film \"The Expendables 3\" (2014).\n\nIn May 2015, \"Super Demetrios\" became an academic subject. Invited by the Public Vocational Institute of Agios Dimitrios, Georgios Papaioannou gave a big master class on the VFX of Super Demetrios to students of 8 departments of computer graphics from several Public Vocational Institutes of Athens.\n\n\n"}

Their list includes 69 distinct franchises from across the United States and in Canada and Mexico. There are representatives from every decade of the century.\n\nWeiss and Wright developed a statistical formula to evaluate teams. First, a rating was given to each league. They assigned 100 points for Triple-A leagues down to 20 points for Class D leagues. The equivalent classifications of each league were used to adjust for changes in the minor league structure since 1900. Next, individual teams were graded based on winning percentage and total wins in order to assess each team's strength against its league and its season-long performance. The combination of these three metrics resulted in a statistical list of the century's top teams. Weiss and Wright further took into account intangibles such as winning a pennant, significant achievements, or reputation in creating their final list. \n\nOf the 69 franchises to make the list, 14 appeared more than once. The Baltimore Orioles took 6 places on the list, the most of any team, followed by the Ft. Worth Panthers and Toronto Maple Leafs (5), Newark Bears and San Francisco Seals (4); Kansas City Blues, Los Angeles Angels, and St. Paul Saints (3); and Charlotte Hornets, Columbus Senators/Red Birds, Houston Buffaloes, Indianapolis Indians, Memphis Chicks, and Milwaukee Brewers (2). Thirty leagues are represented on the list. The league with the most entrants is the International League with 17. The other top leagues are the American Association (13); Pacific Coast League (10); Eastern League and Texas League (8); California League, Western Association, and Western League (4). Thirty-one teams competed at the Double-A classification level, the most of any class, followed by Class A (24); Class C (12); Class B (11); Triple-A (10); Class D (7); Class A1 and independent (2); and Class A-Advanced (1). Twenty-seven teams competed in the 1920s, the most of any decade, followed by the 1940s (16); 1930s (13); 1900s and 1950s (10); 1910s and 1980s (6); 1970s (5); 1990s (4); and 1960s (3).\n\n"}
{"id": "38461589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38461589", "title": "The Racecourse Colliery", "text": "The Racecourse Colliery\n\nThe Racecourse Colliery is an exhibit located at the Black Country Living Museum\n\nThe Black Country Living Museum has more than 40 old mine shafts on its site, which have largely been lost, in-filled, collapsed, stabilised or capped. One of the original surviving shafts has been used to create the Racecourse Colliery exhibit. It was originally the shaft of one of the Earl of Dudley's small pits, Coneygree Colliery Pit No 126, which operated between 1860 and 1902. After the pit was abandoned, all the surface landmarks were removed and the shaft itself was eventually filled in.\n\nWork started on the creation of the Racecourse Colliery exhibit in 1979 and, with the exception of the head frame, all work was carried out on Sundays by volunteers from the Birmingham Enterprise Club and the Friends of the Black Country Museum Mining Group. The colliery was re-created following exactly the same sequence as the creation of an actual working Black Country pit. The shaft was re-opened to a depth of 64 feet (its original depth was between 100–120 feet). The lining brickwork was also repaired. The coal obtainable from this pit is Bottom Coal- about 100 ft down. Close to this exhibit another original shaft was used to create Racecourse Colliery Number Two Pit, also referred to as Brook Shaft. Here coal was worked at 30 ft and has 8 ft of Bottom Coal showing. Moulds from this shaft were used to create the 'coal' for the Museum's underground drift mine experience, 'Into the Thick'.\n\nOther principle coal seams in the South Staffordshire Coalfield include Brooch, Flying Reed, Upper Heathen, Stinking (sulphur), New Mine, Fireclay and the famous Thick Coal.\n\nThe buildings and other features of the Racecourse Colliery are either replicas of known mining landmarks, or have been devised on the basis of photographs and existing knowledge of old Black Country pits. The exception to this is the Weighbridge House which is a historic building, relocated from Rolfe Street in Smethwick, where it stood in the Birmingham Canal Navigation's wharf yard. It was probably built in the early years of the 20th century. The reconstruction at Black Country Living Museum has been called Racecourse Colliery because the land on which it stands was originally the Earl of Dudley's private racecourse, which was closed when the railway line from Dudley to Wolverhampton was built in 1852.\n\nThis pit features a Manager's Office and a Weighbridge Office that sit side by side. Many of the small pits did not have a resident manager instead, one manager would look after a number of pits. One of the manager's jobs was to make sure that all the mine plans were kept up-to-date, these plans would have been kept in the office. There are no safety lamps in the office; many Black Country pits did not use them as working lights because the shallow workings enabled some of the volatile gases to escape to the surface. Mines like this were known as 'naked lamp' mines, i.e. the miners would have to make do with tallow candles set in a lump of clay.\n\nMines were run on a day-to-day basis by the butty, this position can be compared to the modern-day contactor who would agree to sell coal to the mine owner at a fixed price. The butty would also hire and fire the men as required and at a pit like this, between six and 30 men could be employed. Every morning before the start of the shift the butty would go down with his safety lamp and check the workings for gases and to see if any more pit props were required.\n\nAt 6.30 in the morning the miners started work. They were lowered down the shaft in a cage (by the head frame). These cages were also used to bring up coal as it was mined. A Winding engine housed in a brick building would operate the cage.\n\nThe winding house at the Museum is a replica based on the one that used to stand at Amblecote Colliery No.2 Pit. At the back of the building is the large drum which holds the wire rope that runs over the wheel at the top of the head frame and lifts the cage. This drum is rotated by a Steam engine inside the engine house. The steam to power the engine would have come from the Egg-ended boiler in front of the engine house. Heating all the water in the boiler to convert it to steam took a long time so the fire beneath the boiler was kept lit all the time. The engine operator kept the fire stoked during the day, but at about 3pm when the shift ended the fire would be banked up and left overnight. The Museum does not use this boiler to raise steam when it operates the colliery winder, instead a smaller Vertical boiler is used which is housed at the rear of the engine house.\n\nApart from using the winding engine to raise and lower the miners and the coal tubs, the winding engine would also have been used to remove water from the pit. This was done by a process called tanking. After 1864 all coal miners had to have two head frames and two shafts to provide an extra way out of the workings in an emergency. The second shaft would be situated over the lowest point of the pit so that all the water would gather there in a sump. The winding engine would lower a tank into the sump, a special valve enabled the tank to fill with water, the tank was then raised and someone on the surface pulled a lever one the tank to discharge the water from the pit. There is one of these tanks lying at the side of the miner’s hovel.\n\nTo the side of the brick engine shed is a small corrugated building which houses the engine and fan. This was installed to provide adequate ventilation in a mine. The engine is from Amblecote Fireclay Pit c1860 and was made by J. C. Stark of Torquay. It was found dismantled in the Orangery at Shugborough. The fan sucks the air from the pit. The upright part is called the evaze and is designed to dissipate the air.\n\nThe Headframe is a replica of the one that used to stand at the Amblecote Colliery Pit No.12. At the bottom of the shaft was the on-setter, the man whose job it was to load the coal tubs into the cages. When the cage was loaded he would shout or signal (via the bell fixed to the head frame) to the man at the top the shaft, the banks man. He in turn would signal to the engine operator to raise the cage. At the top the banks man would take the truck from the cage, push it along the rails to the land sale wharf. The rails are laid on a slope above the wharf and loaded up with coal.\n\nThe miners' Hovel is the workmen’s mess room and the place where miners could dry their wet pit clothes at the end of the day. A fire was kept lit in the hovel and wet clothes left hanging in there overnight were usually dry again by morning. The men could also brew a hot drink in the hovel, eat their 'snap'(lunch usually in a tin or cloth covered bowl) or fry bacon and egg on a shovel over the fire. In some pits with a good boss, a barrel of beer may be provided to take underground.\n\nThe Blacksmith's Shop was for keeping the miners' picks sharp, they had to be kept sharp to cut the coal. Tools were sharpened by heating and hammering rather than sharpening with a file. The tools had to be kept sharp in order to get fast results. If a pit did not have a blacksmith the picks would be regularly taken along to the nearest local blacksmith for sharpening. The forge would also be used for making or repairing wrought iron equipment or tub bodies. Rattle chain (Black Country term for flat winding chain ) would have been repaired by the blacksmith. The chain was wound on a narrow reel similar to camera film, not on a drum, and rattled as it wound. Metal tyres for wooden wheels were heated on the forge and the shrunk onto the wooden wheels.\n"}

Type-in traffic is a form of direct navigation.\n\nExample: If you are interested in widgets, then instead of performing a search-engine search for the term 'widgets' you might type 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' in your mobile browser address bar to see if such a web site exists, and, if so, what content is there. From another perspective, if you are in the business of selling widgets, then owning the domain name 'widgets.com' or 'widgets.mobi' and having an active website at that address would be a desirable thing, as you could take advantage of the type-in traffic this name receives. This simple example holds true for virtually all products and services.\n\nPrior to 2002 most web browsers resolved type-in search strings via DNS to the \".com\" top-level domain; thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the web browser's address bar would typically lead the user to <nowiki>http://mysearchterm.com/</nowiki>. This behavior changed as browsers evolved based on the 'default search engine' setting in the web browser's properties. Thus entering 'mysearchterm' in the address bar would now lead to an error page, as the computer is looking <nowiki>http://mysearchterm/</nowiki> or to results from a search engine if a default is set. Much of Microsoft's Bing (formerly as MSN then Windows Live Search) high usage rank results from the error page traffic delivered via their dominant Internet Explorer browser. A significant percentage of Google's traffic originates from redirects via the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers and from the Google toolbar, all of which take over type-in traffic search strings to the browser address bar.\n\nIn the last few years advertisers, publishers and ad networks such as MSN, AOL, Google and Yahoo have awoken to the power of displaying relevant advertising to highly targeted type-in traffic from domain names, browser address bar searches and error traffic.\n\n"}
{"id": "11509839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11509839", "title": "Vasari Corridor", "text": "Vasari Corridor\n\nThe Vasari Corridor () is an elevated enclosed passageway in Florence, central Italy, which connects the Palazzo Vecchio with the Palazzo Pitti. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the Uffizi Gallery and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the River Arno until it crosses the river at Ponte Vecchio. At the time of construction, the corridor had to be built around the Torre dei Mannelli, using brackets, because the owners of the tower refused to alter it. The corridor covers up part of the façade of the Church of Santa Felicita. The corridor then snakes its way over rows of houses in the Oltrarno district, becoming narrower, to finally join the Palazzo Pitti. Most of it is closed to visitors.\n\nThe Vasari Corridor was built in five months by order of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565, to the design of Giorgio Vasari. It was commissioned in connection with the marriage of Cosimo's son, Francesco, with Johanna of Austria. \nThe idea of an enclosed passageway was motivated by the Grand Duke's desire to move freely between his residence and the government palace, when, like most monarchs of the period, he felt insecure in public, in his case especially because he had replaced the Republic of Florence. The meat market of Ponte Vecchio was moved to avoid its smell reaching into the passage, its place being taken by the goldsmith shops that still occupy the bridge. At the latter extremity, the corridor was forced to pass around the Mannelli's Tower, after the staunch opposition of that family to its destruction.\n\nIn the middle of Ponte Vecchio, the corridor is characterized by a series of panoramic windows facing the Arno, in the direction of the Ponte Santa Trinita. These replaced the smaller windows of the original construction in 1939, by order of Benito Mussolini. The larger windows were installed for an official visit to Florence by Adolf Hitler to give him a panoramic view of the river.\n\nAfter the Ponte Vecchio the Corridor passes over the loggiato of the church of Santa Felicita; at that point it had a balcony, protected by a thick railing, looking into the interior of the church, in order to allow the Grand Duke's family to follow services without mixing with the populace.\n\nIn its Uffizi section, the Vasari Corridor is used to exhibit the museum's famous collection of self-portraits.\n\nThe area closest to the Uffizi entrance was heavily damaged by a bombing commissioned by the Italian mafia on the night of May 27th, 1993. When a car bomb was detonated next to the Torre dei Pulci, located between via Lambertesca and via de' Georgofili, this section of the Uffizi Gallery was among the buildings damaged, and several artworks in the Corridor were destroyed. These paintings, some hopelessly damaged, have been pieced back together and placed back on their original spot to serve as a reminder of the event.\n"}
{"id": "3659532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3659532", "title": "Vestibular exam", "text": "Vestibular exam\n\nThe Vestibular (from , \"entrance hall\") is a competitive examination and is the primary and widespread entrance system used by Brazilian universities to select the students admitted. \n\nThe Vestibular usually takes place from November to January, right before the start of school year in February or March, although certain universities hold it every semester.\nThe exams often span several days, usually two, with different disciplines being tested each day.\n\nSeveral Brazilian universities follow the FUVEST (University of São Paulo's entry exam) pattern, which is divided into two stages or \"phases\". The first stage consists of 90 multiple choice questions, including subjects such as Portuguese Language, Portuguese Literature and Brazilian Literature; Math, History, Geography, Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Foreign Language. The answers are marked on an answer card, and they are graded afterwards by an automated optical reader. Some institutions establish a cutoff score for the first stage. Students who score below that are automatically eliminated and do not proceed to the second stage, even if the maximum number of candidates has not been reached, although some schools make exceptions in the rare case of most candidates scoring below the cutoff.\n\nIn some universities, the Vestibular may include only a single-stage exam where the scores for each subject tested are adjusted by weights depending on the student's course choice. For example, on the brazilians unities of PUC (known as one of the most prestigious private universities in Brazil) has a Vestibular consisting of 45 multiple choice questions, one written question about Chemistry and Biology, one about Maths and Physics, and another about History and Geography, in addition to a student-written essay on a provided theme. All of that is done in one single day. Another example is Mackenzie, considered one of the best private universities in the country: its Vestibular consists of 60 multiple choice questions and a student-written essay. \n\nIn some military engineering colleges such as ITA and IME, the Vestibular includes exams in Math, Physics, Chemistry, Portuguese and English only. Those exams are mostly write-in and demand more from the students when compared to ordinary vestibular exams of the same subjects by other universities, being heavily influenced by mathematics competitions questions. In the other hand, colleges with a humanities focused curriculum, such as ESPM, only include Portuguese, English, History, Geography, Math and culture. This is done in order to let the student focus on the subjects of the college's interest while preparing for the exams.\n\nUniversity candidates must choose their majors by the time they sign in for the vestibular, and they cannot change their choice except through a very bureaucratic process of internal transfers within the university. Some exceptions exist, such as Engineering in some universities, where the engineering major is chosen only after a three or four semester period. Language studies is another exception: you sign up for Languages, and choose your focus later on, which could be Portuguese and English, Portuguese and French, Portuguese and Italian, amongst many others.\n\nThroughout the last decades, there has always been a gap between the few vacancies offered and the overwhelmingly high and growing demand for high quality and tuition-free public universities. The competition goes as far as having more than 150 candidates per vacancy for the most sought-after careers, such as medicine.\n\nThe Vestibular was implanted primarily as a way to prevent nepotism or some other form of unfair or beneficial selection of candidates. It was considered by law the only authorized selection method until 1996, when the new Education Law was passed.\n\nWhile the Vestibular is generally considered to be a fair and unbiased system to select students due to the standardized nature of the tests, there are a few controversies surrounding it.\n\nThere is some criticism to the alleged standardization of the high school curriculum for the whole country to match the Vestibular agenda. As most types of academic evaluation, the vestibulars suffers from the same limitations as a regular test; that is, factors such as stress come into play. It also seems to favor candidates that come from a wealthier background, who had access to better and deeper education in private schools, as opposed to the comparatively poor public high school educational system, although many university boards claim that it doesn't matter which background the candidates have, since their Vestibular aims to select the best students based solely on their knowledge. \n\nTo ease this problem, some universities such as the Federal University of Minas Gerais, provide a 10–15% bonus for students who received their middle and high education in public schools. There is also the alternative of taking classes at cram schools called \"cursinhos\" (a brazilian word that usually means \"Vestibular course\"). Those are revisions of Vestibular subjects, given through periods of 9 months (the regular year-long one), 6 months (the semi-intensive one), and 3 months (known as intensive). These courses are given usually for the most prestigious schools and can be done after concluding high school or as a complement of the last year of it.\n\nRacial and social quotas are a very controversial subject in Brazil. They were implemented by the government as an attempt to minimize the gap between students. That way, students who had their high school education entirely at public schools get quotas. Also, African and Indigenous Brazilian descendants gain a small percentage of bonuses on their Vestibular. That is considered an affirmative action policy.\n\nIn August 2005, at Universidade Federal do Paraná, a student was granted by a federal court the right to be admitted at the university because she had a better score on the Vestibular than several other freshmen that took advantage of their quotas. \nIn 2012 a law was approved that gave quotas to students who came from public schools. The federal universities (such as UFRJ, UNIFESP, UFPR, UFRGS...) will have to save half of the vacancies for those students. State-owned establishments, such as the University of São Paulo, are not currently forced to abide by this law.\n\nThe Ministry of Education and Culture of Brazil (MEC) proposed in 2009 that the universities should use the ENEM (National High School Exam), a non-mandatory national exam, as a standard university entrance qualification test. The \"new ENEM\", as it is known, is composed of 180 multiple choice questions in five main areas (natural sciences, human sciences, math, Portuguese and either English or Spanish as a foreign language) and an essay.\n\nThe proposal's main objective is to democratize access to higher education, opportunities for federal jobs, academic mobility and induce the restructuring of the curricula of high school.\n\nThe universities have the autonomy to choose whether or not they want to use the exam, and if they want to, they can also choose the way it is used:\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}
{"id": "6391011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6391011", "title": "WebCite", "text": "WebCite\n\nWebCite is an on-demand archiving service, designed to digitally preserve scientific and educationally important material on the web by making snapshots of Internet contents as they existed at the time when a blogger, or a scholar or a Wikipedia editor cited or quoted from it. The preservation service enables verifiability of claims supported by the cited sources even when the original web pages are being revised, removed, or disappear for other reasons, an effect known as link rot.\n\nThe service differs from the short time Google Cache copies by having indefinite archiving and by offering on-the-fly archiving. The Internet Archive, since 2013, also offers immediate archiving, however WebCite has some advantages:\n\n\nWebCite is a non-profit consortium supported by publishers and editors, and it can be used by individuals without charge. Rather than relying on a web crawler which archives pages in a \"random\" fashion, authors who want to cite web pages in a scholarly article can initiate the archiving process. They then cite – instead of or in addition to the original URL – the snapshot address archived by WebCite, with an identifier that specifies the cited source. (However, note that the Internet Archive does \"both\" a crawler-based archiving and on-demand archiving.)\n\nWebCite can be used to preserve cited Internet content, such as the archived web pages, in addition to citing the original URL of the Internet content. All types of web content, including HTML web pages, PDF files, style sheets, JavaScript and digital images can be preserved. It also archives metadata about the collected resources such as access time, MIME type, and content length.\n\nConceived in 1997 by Gunther Eysenbach, WebCite was publicly described the following year when an article on Internet quality control declared that such a service could also measure the citation impact of web pages. In the next year, a pilot service was set up at the address webcite.net. Although it seemed that the need for WebCite decreased when Google's \"short term\" copies of web pages began to be offered by Google Cache and the Internet Archive expanded their crawling (which started in 1996), WebCite was the only one allowing \"on-demand\" archiving by users. WebCite also offered interfaces to scholarly journals and publishers to automate the archiving of cited links. By 2008, over 200 journals had begun routinely using WebCite.\n\nWebCite used to be, but is no longer, a member of the International Internet Preservation Consortium. In a 2012 message on Twitter, Eysenbach commented that \"WebCite has no funding, and IIPC charges €4000 per year in annual membership fees.\"\n\nWebCite \"feeds its content\" to other digital preservation projects, including the Internet Archive. Lawrence Lessig, an American academic who writes extensively on copyright and technology, used WebCite in his amicus brief in the Supreme Court of the United States case of \"MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.\"\n\nWebCite ran a fund-raising campaign using FundRazr from January 2013 with a target of $22,500, a sum which its operators stated was needed to maintain and modernize the service beyond the end of 2013. This includes relocating the service to Amazon EC2 cloud hosting and legal support. it remained undecided whether WebCite would continue as a non-profit or as a for-profit entity.\n\nWebCite allows on-demand prospective archiving. It is not crawler-based; pages are only archived if the citing author or publisher requests it. No cached copy will appear in a WebCite search unless the author or another person has specifically cached it beforehand.\n\nTo initiate the caching and archiving of a page, an author may use WebCite's \"archive\" menu option or create a WebCite bookmarklet that will allow web surfers to cache pages just by clicking a button in their bookmarks folder.\n\nOne can retrieve or cite archived pages through a transparent format such as\n\nwhere codice_2 is the URL that was archived, and codice_3 indicates the caching date. For example,\n\nor the alternate short form codice_5\nretrieves an archived copy of the URL codice_6 that is closest to the date of March 4, 2008. The ID (5W56XTY5h) is the UNIX time in base 62.\n\nIt is important to note that WebCite does not work for pages which contain a no-cache tag. WebCite respects the author's request to not have their web page cached.\n\nOne can archive a page by simply navigating in their browser to a link formatted like this:\n\nCompared to Wayback Machine\n\nreplacing \"codice_9\" with the full URL of the page to be archived, and \"codice_10\" with their e-mail address. This is how the WebCite bookmarklet works.\n\nOnce archived on WebCite, users can try to create an independent second-level backup copy of the starting URL, saving a second time the new WebCite's domain URL on web.archive.org, and on archive.is.\n\nThe term \"WebCite\" is a registered trademark. WebCite does not charge individual users, journal editors and publishers any fee to use their service. WebCite earns revenue from publishers who want to \"have their publications analyzed and cited webreferences archived\", and accepts donations. Early support was from the University of Toronto.\n\nWebCite maintains the legal position that its archiving activities are allowed by the copyright doctrines of fair use and implied license. To support the fair use argument, WebCite notes that its archived copies are transformative, socially valuable for academic research, and not harmful to the market value of any copyrighted work. WebCite argues that caching and archiving web pages is not considered a copyright infringement when the archiver offers the copyright owner an opportunity to \"opt-out\" of the archive system, thus creating an implied license. To that end, WebCite will not archive in violation of Web site \"do-not-cache\" and \"no-archive\" metadata, as well as robot exclusion standards, the absence of which creates an \"implied license\" for web archive services to preserve the content.\n\nIn a similar case involving Google's web caching activities, on January 19, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada agreed with that argument in the case of \"Field v. Google\" (CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL), holding that fair use and an \"implied license\" meant that Google's caching of Web pages did not constitute copyright violation. The \"implied license\" referred to general Internet standards.\n\nAccording to their policy, after receiving legitimate DMCA requests from the copyright holders, WebCite removes saved pages from public access, as the archived pages are still under the safe harbor of being citations. The pages are removed to a \"dark archive\" and in cases of legal controversies or evidence requests there is pay-per-view access of \"$200 (up to 5 snapshots) plus $100 for each further 10 snapshots\" to the copyrighted content.\n\n"}

Mail is an email service launched in 1997 through the American parent company Yahoo. Yahoo Mail provides four different email plans: three for personal use (Basic, Plus, and Ad Free) and another for businesses. By December 2011, Yahoo! Mail had 281 million users, making it the third largest web-based email service in the world. Since 2015 its webmail client also supports managing non-Yahoo e-mail accounts.\n\nAs many as three web interfaces were available at any given time. The traditional \"Yahoo! Mail Classic\" preserved the availability of their original 1997 interface until July 2013 in North America. A 2005 version included a new Ajax interface, drag-and-drop, improved search, keyboard shortcuts, address auto-completion, and tabs. However, other features were removed, such as column widths and one click delete-move-to-next. In October 2010, Yahoo! released a beta version of Yahoo! Mail, which included improvements to performance, search, and Facebook integration. In May 2011, this became the default interface. Their current Webmail interface was introduced in 2017.\n\nYahoo! made a deal with the online communications company Four11 for co-branded white pages. Marvin Gavin, who worked at Four11 as the Director of International Business Development, said \"We always had a bias about being acquired by Yahoo. They were more entrepreneurial than Microsoft. We had a great cultural fit – it made a lot of sense.\" In the end, Yahoo! acquired Four11 for $96 million. The purpose behind acquiring Four11 was the company's RocketMail webmail service, which launched in 1997. Yahoo! announced the acquisition on October 8, 1997, close to the time that Yahoo! Mail was launched. Yahoo! chose acquisition rather than internal platform development, because, as Healy said, \"Hotmail was growing at thousands and thousands users per week. We did an analysis. For us to build, it would have taken four to six months, and by then, so many users would have taken an email account. The speed of the market was critical.\"\n\nThe transition to Yahoo! Mail was not easy for many Rocketmail users. On March 21, 2002, Yahoo! eliminated free software client access and introduced the $29.99 per year Mail Forwarding Service. Mary Osako, a Yahoo! Spokeswoman, told CNET, \"For-pay services on Yahoo!, originally launched in February 1999, have experienced great acceptance from our base of active registered users, and we expect this adoption to continue to grow.\"\n\nDuring 2002, the Yahoo! network was gradually redesigned. On July 2, the company website was changed, and it was announced that Yahoo! Mail and other services would also be redesigned. Along with this new design, new features were to be implemented, including drop-down menus in DHTML, different category tabs, and a new user-customizable color scheme. Yahoo! Network Services senior vice president Geoff Ralston stated that\n"}
