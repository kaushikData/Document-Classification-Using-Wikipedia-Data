{"id": "45963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45963", "title": "Analytic language", "text": "Analytic language\n\nIn linguistic typology, an analytic language is a language that primarily conveys relationships between words in sentences by way of \"helper\" words (particles, prepositions, etc.) and word order, as opposed to utilizing inflections (changing the form of a word to convey its role in the sentence). For example, the English-language phrase \"The cat chases the ball\" conveys the fact that the cat is acting on the ball \"analytically\" via word order. This can be contrasted to synthetic languages, which rely heavily on inflections to convey word relationships (e.g., the phrases \"The cat chase\"s\" the ball\" and \"The cat chase\"d\" the ball\" convey different time frames via changing the form of the word \"chase\"). Most languages are not purely analytic, but many rely primarily on analytic syntax.\n\nTypically, analytic languages have a low morpheme-per-word ratio, especially with respect to inflectional morphemes. A grammatical construction can similarly be \"analytic\" if it uses unbound morphemes, which are separate words, and/or word order. Analytic languages rely more heavily on the use of definite and indefinite articles, which tend to be less prominently used or absent in strongly synthetic languages; stricter word order; various prepositions, postpositions, particles, and modifiers; and context.\n\nThe term \"analytic\" is commonly used in a relative rather than an absolute sense. The currently most prominent and widely used analytic language is modern English, which has lost much of the inflectional morphology inherited from Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Germanic, and Old English over the centuries and has not gained any new inflectional morphemes in the meantime, making it more analytic than most Indo-European languages. \n\nFor example, while Proto-Indo-European had much more complex grammatical conjugation, grammatical genders, dual number and inflections for eight or nine cases in its nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, participles, postpositions and determiners, standard English has lost nearly all of them (except for three modified cases for pronouns) along with genders and dual number and simplified its conjugation.\n\nLatin, German, Greek, and Russian are synthetic languages. Nouns in Russian inflect for at least six cases, most of them descended from Proto-Indo-European cases, whose functions English translates using other strategies like prepositions, verbal voice, word order, and possessive \"\" instead.\n\nIsraeli Hebrew is much more analytic than Classical Hebrew \"both with nouns and with verbs\".\n\nA related concept is the isolating language, which is about a low number of any type of morphemes per word, taking into account derivational morphemes as well. A purely isolating language would be analytic by necessity, lacking inflectional morphemes by definition. However, the reverse is not necessarily true: a language can have derivational morphemes while lacking inflectional morphemes. For example, Mandarin Chinese has many compound words, giving it a moderately high ratio of morphemes per word, yet since it has almost no inflectional affixes at all to convey grammatical relationships, it is a very analytic language.\n\nEnglish is not totally analytic in its nouns since it does use inflections for number (e.g., \"one day, three days; one boy, four boys\") and possession (\"The boy's ball\" vs. \"The boy has a ball\"). Mandarin Chinese has, in contrast, no inflections on its nouns: compare \"yī tiān\" \"one day\", \"sān tiān\" \"three days\" (literally \"three day\"); \"yī ge nánhái\" \"one boy\" (lit. \"one [entity of] male child\"), \"sì ge nánhái\" \"four boys\" (lit. \"four [entity of] male child\"). Instead, English is considered to be weakly inflected.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21684015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21684015", "title": "Animaniacs", "text": "Animaniacs\n\nAnimaniacs is an American animated comedy television series created by Tom Ruegger. It is the second animated series produced by Amblin Entertainment in association with Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the late 1980s and early 1990s. \"Animaniacs\" first aired on Fox Kids from 1993 to 1995 and new episodes later appeared on The WB from 1995 to 1998 as part of its Kids' WB afternoon programming block. The series had a total of 99 episodes and one film, \"Wakko's Wish\".\n\n\"Animaniacs\" is a variety show, with short skits featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, character catchphrases, and humor directed at an adult audience.\n\nA reboot of the series was announced by Hulu in January 2018, with two seasons to be produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, expected to air starting in 2020.\n\nThe Warner siblings and the other characters live in Burbank, California. However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The \"Animaniacs\" characters interacted with famous people and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from contemporary pop culture and television. Andrea Romano, the casting and recording director of \"Animaniacs\", said that the Warner siblings functioned to \"tie the show together,\" by appearing in and introducing other characters' segments. Each \"Animaniacs\" episode usually consisted of two or three cartoon shorts. \"Animaniacs\" segments ranged in time, from bridging segments less than a minute long to episodes spanning the entire show length; writer Peter Hastings said that the varying episode lengths gave the show a \"sketch comedy\" atmosphere.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" had a large cast of characters, separated into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warner kids, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. Water Tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph the Security Guard; Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant Hello Nurse. Pinky and the Brain are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt to take over the world. Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, Skippy Squirrel, about cartoon techniques. Additional principal characters included Rita and Runt, Buttons and Mindy, Chicken Boo, Flavio and Marita (The Hip Hippos), Katie Ka-Boom, and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.\n\nThe \"Animaniacs\" cast of characters had a variety of inspiration, from celebrities to writers' family members to other writers. Executive producer Steven Spielberg said that the irreverence in \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons inspired the \"Animaniacs\" cast. Tom Ruegger created \"Pinky and the Brain\", a series Sherri Stoner had also written for, after being inspired by the personalities of two of his \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise for \"Pinky and the Brain\" when wondering what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world. Deanna Oliver contributed \"The Goodfeathers\" scripts and the character \"Chicken Boo\", while Nicholas Hollander based \"Katie Kaboom\" on his teenage daughter.\n\nRuegger modeled the Warners' personalities heavily after his three sons. Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early 1930s, Ruegger and other artists for \"Animaniacs\" made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s. Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Buddy, Felix the Cat, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the early versions of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.\n\nSherri Stoner created \"Slappy the Squirrel\" when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager. Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and \"have the dirt on [them]\".\n\nSteven Spielberg served as executive producer, under his Amblin Television label. Showrunner and senior producer Tom Ruegger lead the overall production and writer's room. Producers Peter Hastings, Sherri Stoner, Rusty Mills, and Rich Arons contributed scripts for many of the episodes and had an active role during group discussions in the writer's room as well.\n\nThe writers and animators of \"Animaniacs\" used the experience gained from the previous series to create new animated characters that were cast in the mold of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery's creations. Additional writers for the series included Liz Holzman, Paul Rugg, Deanna Oliver, John McCann, Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, Tom Minton, and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds.\n\nMade-up stories did not exclusively comprise \"Animaniacs\" writing, as Hastings remarked: \"We weren't really there to tell compelling stories ... [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial ... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up.\" Writers for the series wrote into \"Animaniacs\" stories that happened to them; the episodes \"Ups and Downs,\" \"Survey Ladies,\" and \"I Got Yer Can\" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, \"Bumbie's Mom,\" both parodied the film \"Bambi\" and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.\n\nIn an interview, the writers explained how \"Animaniacs\" allowed for non-restrictive and open writing. Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because \"Animaniacs\" segments could widely vary in both time and subject, while Stoner described how the \"Animaniacs\" writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode \"The Three Muska-Warners\". Rugg, Hastings and Stoner also mentioned how the \"Animaniacs\" writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" featured Rob Paulsen as Yakko, Pinky and Dr. Otto von Scratchansniff, Tress MacNeille as Dot, Jess Harnell as Wakko, Sherri Stoner as Slappy the Squirrel, Maurice LaMarche as the Brain, Squit and the belching segments \"The Great Wakkorotti\" (Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role), and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Ralph the Security Guard, Thaddeus Plotz and Runt. Andrea Romano said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: \"We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko.\" Romano said that the casters had \"no trouble\" choosing the role of Dot, referring to MacNeille as \"just hilarious ... And yet [she had] that edge.\" Before Animaniacs, Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for Disney which he \"fell into\". Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show, he did a John Lennon impression and the audition \"went great\". Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should play Slappy. According to Romano, she personally chose Bernadette Peters to play Rita. Other voices were provided by Jim Cummings, Paul Rugg, Vernee Watson-Johnson, Jeff Bennett and Gail Matthius (from Tiny Toon Adventures). Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles on the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, nephew to Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced \"The Flame\" in historical segments on \"Animaniacs\"; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from \"Wild Blue Yonder\".\n\nAnimation work on \"Animaniacs\" was farmed out to several different studios, both American and international, over the course of the show's production. The animation companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as TMS Entertainment), StarToons, Wang Film Productions, Freelance Animators New Zealand, and AKOM, and most \"Animaniacs\" episodes frequently had animation from different companies in each episode's respective segments.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" was made with a higher production value than standard television animation; the show had a higher cel count than most TV cartoons. The \"Animaniacs\" characters often move fluidly, and do not regularly stand still and speak, as in other television cartoons.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" utilized a heavy musical score for an animated program, with every episode featuring at least one original score. The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg. \"Animaniacs\" used a 35-piece orchestra, and seven composers were contracted to write original underscore for the series run: Richard Stone, Steve Bernstein, Julie Bernstein, Carl Johnson, J. Eric Schmidt, Gordon Goodwin, and Tim Kelly. The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with \"Animaniacs\" predecessor, \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in \"Animaniacs\". Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, \"the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation,\" said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series. According to Steve and Julie Bernstein, not only was the \"Animaniacs\" music written in the same style as that of \"Looney Tunes\" composer Carl Stalling, but that the music was recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage, which was used by Stalling as well as its piano. Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote \"a lot of music\" for the series.\n\nThe humor of \"Animaniacs\" varied in type, ranging from parody to cartoon violence. The series made parodies of television shows and films. In an interview, Spielberg defended the \"irreverence\" of \"Animaniacs\", saying that the \"Animaniacs\" crew has \"a point of view\" and does not \"sit back passively and play both sides equally\". Spielberg also said that \"Animaniacs\"' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the Marx Brothers and Looney Tunes cartoons. \"Animaniacs\", among other Spielberg-produced shows, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in \"Animaniacs\" by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never become either too violent or \"benign\". \"Animaniacs\" also made use of catchphrases, recurring jokes and segments, and \"adult\" humor.\n\nCharacters on \"Animaniacs\" had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's \"Goodnight, everybody!\" often said following adult humor, Wakko's \"Faboo!\" and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all three Warners was \"Hello-o-o, nurse!\" Tom Ruegger said that the \"Hello-o-o, Nurse!\" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, \"What's up, doc?\" Before the theme song for each \"Pinky and the Brain\" segment, Pinky asks, \"Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\" Brain replies, \"The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!\" During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, \"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur that changes every episode. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode \"Win Big,\" and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.\n\nRunning gags and recurring segments were very common in the show. The closing credits for each episode always included one joke credit and ended with a water tower gag similar to \"The Simpsons\" couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled \"The Wheel of Morality\" (which, in Yakko's words, \"adds boring educational value to what would otherwise be an almost entirely entertaining program\", and ends with a \"moral\" that makes no sense) eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, in the case of the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode).\n\nA great deal of \"Animaniacs's\" humor and content was aimed at an adult audience. \"Animaniacs\" parodied the film \"A Hard Day's Night\" and the Three Tenors, references that \"The New York Times\" wrote were \"appealing to older audiences\". The comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan \"Pirates of Penzance\" and \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" were parodied in episode 3, \"HMS Yakko\". The Warners' personalities were made similar to those of the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis, in that they, according to writer Peter Hastings, \"wreak havoc,\" in \"serious situations\". In addition, the show's recurring Goodfeathers segment was populated with characters based on characters from \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas\", R-rated crime dramas neither marketed nor intended for children. Some content of \"Animaniacs\" was not only aimed at an adult audience but was suggestive in nature; one character, Minerva Mink, had episodes that network censors considered too sexually suggestive for the show's intended audience, for which she was soon de-emphasized as a featured character. Jokes involving such innuendo would often end with Yakko telling \"Goodnight, everybody!\" as a punchline.\n\"Animaniacs\" parodied popular TV shows and movies and caricatured celebrities. \"Animaniacs\" made fun of celebrities, major motion pictures, television shows for adults (\"Seinfeld\" and \"Friends\", among others), television shows for children, and trends in the US. One episode even made fun of competing show \"Power Rangers\", and another episode caricatured \"Animaniacs<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" own Internet fans. \"Animaniacs\" also made potshots of Disney films, creating parodies of such films as \"The Lion King\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Pocahontas\", \"Bambi\", and others. \"Animaniacs\" director Russell Calabrese said that not only did it become a compliment to be parodied on \"Animaniacs\" but also that being parodied on the series would be taken as a \"badge of honor\".\n\n\"Animaniacs\" had a variety of music types. Many \"Animaniacs\" songs were parodies of classical or folk music with educational lyrics. Notable ones include \"Yakko's World\", in which Yakko sings the names of all 200-some nations of the world to the tune of the \"Mexican Hat Dance\". \"Wakko's America\" listed all the United States and their capitals to the tune of \"Turkey in the Straw\". Another song, titled \"The Presidents\", named every US president (up to Bill Clinton, due to production date) to the tune of the \"William Tell Overture\" (with brief snippets of the tunes \"Mademoiselle from Armentieres\" and \"Dixie\"). Non-educational songs included parodies such as the segment \"Slippin' on the Ice\" and a parody of \"Singin' in the Rain\". Most of the groups of characters even had their own theme songs for their segment on the show.\n\nThe \"Animaniacs\" series theme song, performed by the Warners, was a very important part of the show. In the series' first season, the theme won an Emmy Award for best song. Stone composed the music for the title sequence and Ruegger wrote the lyrics. Several \"Animaniacs\" albums and sing-along VHS tapes were released, including the CDs \"Animaniacs\", \"Yakko's World\", and \"Variety Pack\", and the tapes \"Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World\" and \"Animaniacs Sing-Along: Mostly in Toon\".\n\nShorts featuring Rita and Runt would also incorporate songs for Bernadette Peters to sing.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" was a successful show, gathering both child and adult fans. The series received ratings higher than its competitors and won eight Daytime Emmy Awards and one Peabody Award.\n\nDuring its run, \"Animaniacs\" became the second-most popular children's show in both demographics of children ages 2–11 and children ages 6–11 (behind \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\"). \"Animaniacs\", along with other animated series, helped to bring \"Fox Kids\" ratings much larger than those of the channel's competitors. In November 1993, \"Animaniacs\" and \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" almost doubled the ratings of their rival shows, \"Darkwing Duck\" and \"Goof Troop\", in both the 2–11 and 6–11 demographics that are very important to children's networks. On Kids' WB, \"Animaniacs\" gathered about one-million children viewers every week.\n\nWhile \"Animaniacs\" was popular among younger viewers (the target demographic for Warner Bros.' TV cartoons), adults also responded positively to the show; in 1995, more than one-fifth of the weekday (4 p.m., Monday through Friday) and Saturday morning (8 a.m.) audience viewers were 25 years or older. The large adult fanbase even led to one of the first Internet-based fandom cultures. During the show's prime, the Internet newsgroup alt.tv.animaniacs was an active gathering place for fans of the show (most of whom were adults) to post reference guides, fan fiction, and fan-made artwork about \"Animaniacs\". The online popularity of the show did not go unnoticed by the show's producers, and twenty of the most active participants on the newsgroup were invited to the Warner Bros. Animation studios for a gathering in August 1995 dubbed by those fans Animania IV.\n\n\"Animaniacs\"' first major award came in 1993, when the series won a Peabody Award in its debuting season. In 1994, \"Animaniacs\" was nominated for two Annie Awards, one for \"Best Animated Television Program\", and the other for \"Best Achievement for Voice Acting\" (Frank Welker). \"Animaniacs\" also won two Daytime Emmy Awards for \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\" and \"Outstanding Original Song\" (\"Animaniacs\" Main Title Theme). In 1995, \"Animaniacs\" was nominated four times for the Annie Awards, once for \"Best Animated Television Program\", twice for \"Voice Acting in the Field of Animation\" (Tress MacNeille and Rob Paulsen), and once for \"Best Individual Achievement for Music in the Field of Animation\" (Richard Stone). In 1996, \"Animaniacs\" won two Daytime Emmy Awards, one for \"Outstanding Animated Children's Program\" and the other for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\". In 1997, \"Animaniacs\" was nominated for an Annie Award for \"Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a TV Production\" (Charles Visser for the episode \"Noel\"). \"Animaniacs\" also won two more Daytime Emmy Awards, one for \"Outstanding Animated Children's Program\" and the other for \"Outstanding Music Direction and Composition\". In 1998, the last year in which new episodes of \"Animaniacs\" were produced, \"Animaniacs\" was nominated for an Annie Award in \"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Daytime Television Program\". \"Animaniacs\" also won a Daytime Emmy Award in \"Outstanding Music Direction and Composition\" (for the episode \"The Brain's Apprentice\"). In 1999, \"Animaniacs\" won a Daytime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\". When \"Animaniacs\" won this award, it set a record for most Daytime Emmy Awards in the field of \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\" for any individual animation studio. In 2009, IGN named \"Animaniacs\" the 17th-best animated television series. On September 24, 2013, \"Animaniacs\" was listed among TV Guide's \"60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time\".\n\nBefore \"Animaniacs\" was put into production in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into \"Animaniacs\" (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" premiered on September 13, 1993, on the Fox Kids programming block of the Fox network, and ran there until September 8, 1995; new episodes aired from the 1993 through 1994 seasons. \"Animaniacs\" aired with a 65-episode first season because these episodes were ordered by Fox all at once. While on Fox Kids, \"Animaniacs\" gained fame for its name and became the second-most popular show among children ages 2–11 and children ages 6–11, second to \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" (which began that same year). On March 30, 1994, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot first theatrically appeared in the animated short, \"I'm Mad\", which opened nationwide alongside the full-length animated feature, \"Thumbelina\". The musical short featured Yakko, Wakko, and Dot bickering during a car trip. Producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger, and Jean MacCurdy wanted \"I'm Mad\" to be the first of a series of shorts to bring \"Animaniacs\" to a wider audience. However, \"I'm Mad\" was the only \"Animaniacs\" theatrical short produced. The short was later incorporated into \"Animaniacs\" episode 69. Following the 65th episode of the series, \"Animaniacs\" continued to air in reruns on Fox Kids. The only new episodes during this time included a short, four-episode long second season that was quickly put together from unused scripts. After Fox Kids aired \"Animaniacs\" reruns for a year, the series switched to the new Warner Bros. children's programming block, Kids' WB.\n\nThe series was popular enough for Warner Bros. Animation to invest in additional episodes of \"Animaniacs\" past the traditional 65-episode marker for syndication. \"Animaniacs\" premiered on the new Kids' WB line-up on September 9, 1995, with a new season of 13 episodes. At this time, the show's popular cartoon characters, \"Pinky and the Brain\", were spun off from \"Animaniacs\" into their own TV series. Warner Bros. stated in a press release that \"Animaniacs\" gathered over one million children viewers every week.\n\nDespite the series' success on Fox Kids, \"Animaniacs\" on Kids' WB was only successful in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers and not enough young viewers put pressure on the WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards \"Animaniacs\". Slowly, orders from the WB for more \"Animaniacs\" episodes dwindled and \"Animaniacs\" had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with \"Animaniacs\". The 99th and final \"Animaniacs\" episode aired on November 14, 1998.\n\n\"The Chicago Tribune\" reported in 1999 that the production of new \"Animaniacs\" episodes ceased and the direct-to-video film \"Wakko's Wish\" was a closer to the series. \"Animation World Network\" reported that Warner Bros. laid off over 100 artists, contributing to the reduced production of the original series. Producer Tom Ruegger explained that rather than produce new episodes, Warner Bros. instead decided to use the back-catalog of \"Animaniacs\" episodes until \"someone clamors for more.\" \"Animaniacs\" segments were shown along with segments from other cartoons as part of \"The Cat&Birdy Warneroonie PinkyBrainy Big Cartoonie Show\".\nRuegger said at the time the hiatus was \"temporary\". Following the end of the series, the \"Animaniacs\" team developed \"Wakko's Wish\". On December 21, 1999, Warner Bros. released \"Wakko's Wish\". In 2016, Ruegger said on his Reddit AMA that the decline of \"Animaniacs\" and other series was the result of Warner Bros.' investment in the much cheaper anime series \"Pokémon\". Following Warner Bros. right to distribute the cheaper and successful anime, the network chose to invest less in original programming like \"Animaniacs\". \n\nAfter \"Animaniacs\", Spielberg collaborated with Warner Bros. Animation again to produce the short-lived series \"Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid\", along with the \"Animaniacs\" spin-off series \"Pinky and the Brain\", from which \"Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain\" was later spun off. Warner Bros. also produced two other comedy animated series in the later half of the decade titled \"Histeria!\" and \"Detention\", which were short-lived and unsuccessful compared to the earlier series. Later, Warner Bros. cut back the size of its animation studio because the show \"Histeria!\" went over its budget, and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased.\n\n\"Animaniacs\", along with \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", continued to rerun in syndication through the 1990s into the early 2000s after production of new episodes ceased. In the US, \"Animaniacs\" aired on Cartoon Network, originally as a one-off airing on January 31, 1997, and then on the regular schedule from August 31, 1998 until the spring of 2001, when Nickelodeon bought the rights to air the series beginning on September 1, 2001. Nickelodeon transferred the series to its newly launched sister channel Nicktoons on May 1, 2002, and aired there until July 7, 2005. \"Animaniacs\" aired on Hub Network from January 7, 2013 until October 10, 2014.\n\nPaulsen, Harnell, and MacNeille have announced plans to tour in 2016 to perform songs from \"Animaniacs!\" along with a full orchestra. Among the songs will be an updated version of \"Yakko's World\" by Randy Rogel that includes a new verse to include nations that have been formed since the song's original airing, such as those from the break-up of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Warners starred in the feature-length, direct-to-video movie \"Wakko's Wish\". The movie takes place in the fictional town of Acme Falls, in which the Warners and the rest of the \"Animaniacs\" cast are under the rule of a greedy king who conquered their home country from a neighboring country. When the Warners find out about a star that will grant a wish to the first person that touches it, the Warners, the villagers (the \"Animaniacs\" cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated \"Wakko's Wish\" highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.\n\nEpisodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS during and after the series run.\n\nVHS tapes of \"Animaniacs\" were released in the United States and in the United Kingdom. All of these tapes are out of production, but are still available at online sellers. The episodes featured are jumbled at random and are in no particular order with the series. Each video featured four to five episodes each and accompanied by a handful of shorter skits, with a running time of about 45 minutes.\n\nBeginning on July 25, 2006, Warner Home Video began releasing DVD volume sets of \"Animaniacs\" episodes in order of the episodes' original airdates. Volume one of \"Animaniacs\" sold very well; over half of the product being sold in the first week made it one of the fastest selling animation DVD sets that Warner Home Video ever put out.\n\nAn \"Animaniacs\" comic book, published by DC Comics, ran from 1995 to 2000 (59 regular monthly issues, plus two specials). Initially, these featured all the characters except for Pinky and the Brain, who were published in their own comic series, though cameos were possible. The \"Animaniacs\" comic series was later renamed \"Animaniacs! Featuring Pinky and the Brain\". The \"Animaniacs\" comic series, like the show, parodied TV and comics standards, such as \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"The X-Files\", among others.\n\n\"Animaniacs\" was soon brought into the video game industry to produce games based on the series. The list includes titles such as:\n\nBecause \"Animaniacs\" had many songs, record labels Rhino Entertainment and Time Warner Kids produced albums featuring songs from the show. These albums include \"Animaniacs\" (1993), \"Yakko's World\" (1994), \"A Christmas Plotz\" (1995), \"Animaniacs Variety Pack\" (1995), \"A Hip-Opera Christmas\" (1997), \"The Animaniacs Go Hollywood\" (1999), \"The Animaniacs Wacky Universe\" (1999), and the compilation album, \"The Animaniacs Faboo! Collection\" (1995).\n\nAccording to \"IndieWire\" in May 2017, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation were in the early stages of developing a reboot of \"Animaniacs\". The interest in the reboot was driven by a surge of popularity for the show when it was made available on Netflix in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as \"Fuller House\".\n\nThe reboot was officially announced by the streaming service Hulu in January 2018 in partnership with Spielberg and Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. The reboot will consist of at least two seasons, to start airing in 2020. Yakko, Wakko, and Dot will return, along with appearances by Pinky and the Brain each episode; however, no voice actors were announced at this point. The deal includes rights for Hulu to stream all episodes of \"Animaniacs\", \"Pinky & the Brain\", \"Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain\", and \"Tiny Toon Adventures\". Spielberg will return to serve as executive producer, alongside Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series, and Amblin Television co-presidents Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank. The show will be produced by Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation. Hulu considers the show its first original series targeted for families.\n\nWellesley Wild will serve as the showrunner for the series, while Carl Faruolo will serve as supervising director. Initial storyboarding work started around July 2018.\n\n\na. Sources vary on the size of the \"Animaniacs\" orchestra. On the \"\"Animaniacs\" Live!\" featurette, host Maurice LaMarche refers to the orchestra as \"35-piece\". A 1995 Warner Bros. Press release refers to the orchestra as \"30-piece\", while an article of \"The New York Times\" reads that the orchestra was a much smaller \"20-piece\". In an interview for \"The Cartoon Music Book\", \"Animaniacs\" composer Richard Stone said that the number of people in the orchestra varied, depending on the episode and the type of music needed, but said that \"I don't think we ever had more than thirty-two [pieces]\".\n"}

{"id": "41515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41515", "title": "Cod", "text": "Cod\n\nCod is the common name for the demersal fish genus \"Gadus\", belonging to the family Gadidae. Cod is also used as part of the common name for a number of other fish species, and some species suggested to belong to genus \"Gadus\" are not called cod (the Alaska pollock).\n\nThe two most common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (\"Gadus morhua\"), which lives in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (\"Gadus macrocephalus\"), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific. \"Gadus morhua\" was named by Linnaeus in 1758. (However, \"G. morhua callarias\", a low-salinity, nonmigratory race restricted to parts of the Baltic, was originally described as \"Gadus callarias\" by Linnaeus.)\n\nCod is popular as a food with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky, white flesh. Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil, an important source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Young Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice.\n\nAt various times in the past, taxonomists included many species in the genus \"Gadus\". Most of these are now either classified in other genera, or have been recognized as simply forms of one of three species. All these species have a number of common names, most of them ending with the word \"cod\", whereas other species, as closely related, have other common names (such as pollock and haddock). However, many other, unrelated species also have common names ending with cod. The usage often changes with different localities and at different times.\n\nThree species in the genus \"Gadus\" are currently called cod:\n\n\"Cod\" forms part of the common name of many other fish no longer classified in the genus \"Gadus\". Many are members of the family Gadidae; others are members of three related families within the order Gadiformes whose names include the word \"cod\": the morid cods, Moridae (100 or so species); the eel cods, Muraenolepididae (four species); and the Eucla cod, Euclichthyidae (one species). The tadpole cod family (Ranicipitidae) has now been placed in Gadidae.\n\nGadiformes include:\n\nSome fish have common names derived from \"cod\", such as codling, codlet or tomcod. (\"Codling\" is also used as a name for a young cod.)\n\nSome fish commonly known as cod are unrelated to \"Gadus\". Part of this name confusion is market-driven. Severely shrunken Atlantic cod stocks have led to the marketing of cod replacements using culinary names of the form \"\"x\" cod\", according to culinary rather than phyletic similarity. The common names for the following species have become well established; note that all inhabit the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFish of the order Perciformes that are commonly called \"cod\" include:\n\nAlmost all coral cod, reef cod or rock cod are also in order Perciformes. Most are better known as groupers, and belong to the family Serranidae. Others belong to the Nototheniidiae. Two exceptions are the Australasian red rock cod, which belongs to a different order (see below), and the fish known simply as the rock cod and as soft cod in New Zealand, \"Lotella rhacina\", which as noted above actually is related to the true cod (it is a morid cod).\n\nFrom the order Scorpaeniformes:\n\nThe tadpole cod family, Ranicipitidae, and the Eucla cod family, Euclichthyidae, were formerly classified in the order Ophidiiformes, but are now grouped with the Gadiformes.\n\nSome fish that do not have \"cod\" in their names are sometimes sold as cod. Haddock and whiting belong to the same family, the Gadidae, as cod.\n\nCods of the genus \"Gadus\" have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the gill cover (i.e. the throat region), in front of the pectoral fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin barbel. The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, to the base of the caudal or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.\n\nThe Atlantic cod can change colour at certain water depths. It has two distinct colour phases: gray-green and reddish brown. Its average weight is , but specimens weighing up to have been recorded. Pacific cod are smaller than Atlantic cod and are darker in colour.\n\nAtlantic cod (\"Gadus morhua\") live in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic. Pacific cod (\"Gadus macrocephalus\") is found in both eastern and western regions of the Pacific.\n\nAtlantic cod divide into several stocks, including the Arcto-Norwegian, North Sea, Faroe, Iceland, East Greenland, West Greenland, Newfoundland, and Labrador stocks. There seems to be little interchange between the stocks, although migrations to their individual breeding grounds may involve distances of or more.\n\nAtlantic cod occupy varied habitat, favouring rough ground, especially inshore, and are demersal in depths between , on average, although not uncommonly to depths of . Off the Norwegian and New England coasts and on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, cod congregate at certain seasons in water of depth. Cod are gregarious and form schools, although shoaling tends to be a feature of the spawning season.\n\nSpawning of northeastern Atlantic cod occurs between January and April (March and April are the peak months), at a depth of in specific spawning grounds at water temperatures between . Around the UK, the major spawning grounds are in the middle to southern North Sea, the start of the Bristol Channel (north of Newquay), the Irish Channel (both east and west of the Isle of Man), around Stornoway, and east of Helmsdale.\n\nPrespawning courtship involves fin displays and male grunting, which leads to pairing. The male inverts himself beneath the female, and the pair swim in circles while spawning. The eggs are planktonic and hatch between eight and 23 days, with larva reaching in length. This planktonic phase lasts some ten weeks, enabling the young cod to increase its body weight by 40-fold, and growing to about . The young cod then move to the seabed and change their diet to small benthic crustaceans, such as isopods and small crabs. They increase in size to in the first six months, by the end of their first year, and to by the end of the second. Growth tends to be less at higher latitudes. Cod reach maturity at about at about 3 to 4 years of age.\n\nAdult cod are active hunters, feeding on sand eels, whiting, haddock, small cod, squid, crabs, lobsters, mussels, worms, mackerel, and molluscs.\n\nIn the Baltic Sea the most important species are Atlantic cod, herring, and sprat. Many studies that analyze the stomach contents of these fish indicate that cod is the top predator, preying on the herring and sprat. Sprat form particularly high concentrations in the Bornholm Basin in the southern Baltic Sea. Although cod feed primarily on adult sprat, sprat tend to prey on the cod eggs and larvae.\n\nCod and related species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, \"Lernaeocera branchialis\", starts life as a copepod, a small free-swimming crustacean larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker, which they capture with grasping hooks at the front of their body. They penetrate the lumpsucker with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the lumpsucker. The female worm, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worms body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host's heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod's blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod's gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.\n\nThe 2006 northwest Atlantic cod quota is 23,000 tons, representing half the available stocks, while the northeast Atlantic quota is 473,000 tons. Pacific cod is currently enjoying strong global demand. The 2006 total allowable catch (TAC) for the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands was 260,000 tons.\n\nFarming of Atlantic cod has received a significant amount of interest due to the overall trend of increasing cod prices alongside reduced wild catches. However, progress in creating large scale farming of cod has been slow, mainly due to bottlenecks in the larval production stage, where survival and growth are often unpredictable. It has been suggested that this bottleneck may be overcome by ensuring cod larvae are fed diets with similar nutritional content as the copepods they feed on in the wild Recent examples have shown that increasing dietary levels of minerals such as selenium, iodine and zinc may improve survival and/or biomarkers for health in aquaculture reared cod larvae.\n\nCod is popular as a food with a mild flavor and a dense, flaky white flesh. Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil, an important source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA).\n\nYoung Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice. Cod's soft liver can be tinned (canned) and eaten. Cod is mainly consumed in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Brazil.\n\nUSDA data: Pacific cod; Atlantic cod\n\nFollowing the early 1990s collapse of Canadian stocks, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) banned fishing for northern (that is, cod to the north and east of the island of Newfoundland, in Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization areas JKL) cod in 1992, which caused great economic hardship in Newfoundland and Labrador. The collapse was blamed on cold water, or seals, and it had even been suggested the cod were really still there; only rarely was overfishing acknowledged, or management's role in that.\n\nThe DFO partly lifted its ban in 1997, although the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea noted the poor recovery of Canadian cod stocks. In general, depleted populations of cod and other gadids appear to recover poorly when fishing pressure is reduced or stopped.\n\nIn 1998, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the Atlantic cod as \"vulnerable\", a category subsequently rebranded as \"special concern\", though not as an endangered species. This decision process is formally supposed to be informed by Reports that are commissioned from authors. Dr. Kim N.I. Bell authored the 1998 Status Report for COSEWIC. This was the first such report on a commercial fish species in Canada. The potential designation (from Not At Risk to Endangered) was highly contentious because many considered the collapse of Atlantic Cod had resulted ultimately from mismanagement by DFO. The Report (section: \"Author's Recommendation of Status\") therefore discussed at great length the process of developing a recommendation for the designation. The Report contained discussion addressing points that had been offered by DFO, because although COSEWIC had a mechanism for the 'jurisdiction', i.e. the department responsible for the 'species' (which is defined for this purpose as, effectively, a population), to provide objections to an author, it had no mechanism for those objections to be objectively arbitrated as a matter of science. Rebuttal by authors was, simply, untraditional and unexpected. That is undoubtedly why, prior to the meeting at which the designation was to be decided, COSEWIC had conducted a massive unannounced edit of the Report, the effect of which was to introduce many errors and change meanings, including removing the word few from \"there are few indications of improvement\", and expunging a substantial section which engaged various objections raised by DFO. When the unauthorised \"edits\" were discovered by the author COSEWIC was obliged to circulate a letter explaining that it had sent out a version that lacked the author's approval, and had to provide the author's version to members. The Report contained, under a subsection \"Designation by geographic management units (as preferred by DFO in 1996)\", recommendations (or options) for 10 geographic management units, ranging from Not At Risk or Vulnerable (1 mgmt. area) to Threatened or Endangered (5 mgmt. areas) to simply (i.e. offering no choice) Endangered (4 mgmt. areas). In its designation, COSEWIC firstly disregarded population structure and provided a recommendation based on the presumption of a single homogeneous population (which even DFO's own internal documents concluded was unlikely compared to heterogeneity), and secondly disregarded the arithmetic that clearly put declines in high \"at risk\" categories and applied a decision of \"vulnerable\", a lower-risk category, to the entire species within Canadian waters. COSEWIC not only provided no accounting for the variance of its designation from the Report recommendation, it did not admit that variance. COSEWIC also refused to release the Report, despite that its rules required it to. Bell, the Report author, subsequently stated that political pressure by the DFO within COSEWIC was what accounted for the difference.\n\nIn 2000, WWF placed cod on the endangered species list. The WWF issued a report stating the global cod catch had suffered a 70% drop over the last 30 years, and if this trend continued, the world’s cod stocks would disappear in 15 years. Åsmund Bjordal, director of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research disputed the WWF's claim, noting the healthy Barents Sea cod population. Cod (known in Norway as skrei) is among Norway's most important fishery exports and the Barents Sea is Norway's most important cod fishery. In 2015, the Norwegian Seafood Council invited Crown Prince Haakon to take part in opening the year’s cod fishing season on the island of Senja.\n\nIn 2003, under the new legislative framework of the Species At Risk Act [SARA], COSEWIC placed the Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries cod on the endangered species list and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite closure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Newfoundland's northeast coast. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to be healthy, but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas. In 2005, the WWF—Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the Grand Banks, in the form of bycatch. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern Atlantic.\n\nIn 2006, the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research considered coastal cod (but not the North East Arctic cod) endangered, but has since reversed this assessment. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Atlantic cod to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\" According to Seafood Watch, cod is currently on the list of fish consumers should avoid. In the book , it is claimed cod is an example of how unsustainable fishing is destroying ocean ecosystems.\n\nIn a letter to \"Nature\" in 2011, a group of Canadian scientists reported that cod in the Scotian Shelf ecosystem off Canada are showing signs of recovery.\n\nCod has been an important economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians travelled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques played an important role in the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.\n\nApart from the long history, cod differ from most fish because the fishing grounds are far from population centers. The large cod fisheries along the coast of North Norway (and in particular close to the Lofoten islands) have been developed almost uniquely for export, depending on sea transport of stockfish over large distances. Since the introduction of salt, dried and salted cod (clipfish or 'klippfisk' in Norwegian) has also been exported. By the end of the 14th century, the Hanseatic League dominated trade operations and sea transport, with Bergen as the most important port.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Elder, criticizing the Treaty of Paris in Parliament, claimed cod was \"British gold\"; and that it was folly to restore Newfoundland fishing rights to the French.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries in the New World, especially in Massachusetts and Newfoundland, cod became a major commodity, creating trade networks and cross-cultural exchanges. In 1733, Britain tried to gain control over trade between New England and the British Caribbean by imposing the Molasses Act, which they believed would eliminate the trade by making it unprofitable. The cod trade grew instead, because the \"French were eager to work with the New Englanders in a lucrative contraband arrangement\". In addition to increasing trade, the New England settlers organized into a \"codfish aristocracy\". The colonists rose up against Britain's \"tariff on an import\".\n\nIn the 20th century, Iceland re-emerged as a fishing power and entered the Cod Wars. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fishing off the European and American coasts severely depleted stocks and become a major political issue. The necessity of restricting catches to allow stocks to recover upset the fishing industry and politicians are reluctant to hurt employment.\n\n\n\n"}

Bush to stop implementation of his orders directing the United States military to fight in Iraq without first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress, the only branch Constitutionally mandated to declare war.\n\nFifty four members of Congress, including U.S. Representative Ron Dellums, sued George H.W. Bush in 1990 attempting to halt a preemptive military buildup in the Middle East in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without a declaration of war would be unlawful under U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 11 of the United States Constitution. The District Court held that, although the plaintiff's claims were plausible, because the President had not yet initiated war-like actions and only 54 members of Congress (53 members of the House and one member of the Senate) were involved in the suit, and not a majority, the dispute was not ripe for adjudication at that time.

It was founded by publisher Gerhard Frey as an informal association in 1971 and established as a party in 1987. Financially, it was largely dependent on Frey. In 2011, it merged with the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).\n\nThe party never reached the five-percent minimum in federal elections that is generally necessary to enter the Bundestag. The DVU won seats in several state parliaments.\n\nThe party, throughout its history, was financially completely dependent on Frey, something that caused it to be dubbed the \"Frey Party\". \n\nThe DVU was formed as an association, not a party, by Gerhard Frey and twelve others, former members of other right-wing organisations or conservative parties as well as from various groups in the Federation of Expellees. In the early years, before the organisation became a party in 1987, it was predominantly active in propagating revisionist views about the Holocaust and Germany's role in World War II, predominately through Frey's media empire and his \"National Zeitung.\n\nWith the decline of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany, the NPD, from 1969 onward, the German People's Union became a new home for many former supporters of this party. The DVU however stayed away from party politics and instead organised protest marches against the German governments \"Ostpolitik\", the rapprochement with Poland and Eastern Europe. It formed a number of action committees:\n\nMembership in the DVU fluctuated in the following years but stood at 12,000 by 1986, making it the largest registered far-right organisation in Germany at the time. On 5 March 1987 the association became a party with the help of a large number of former NPD officials, something Frey had started planning the year before. Initially the party was called \"Deutsche Volksliste\", which soon changed to \"Deutsche Volksunion-Liste D\" and, in 1991, just \"Deutsche Volksunion\". \n\nFrey's official reason for forming a party at the time was his disappointment with the German conservative-liberal Federal Government in regards to foreigners, security and policy towards East Germany. The new party formed an alliances with the NPD, generally agreeing not to compete with each other in elections. The DVU was financially well off, courtesy to Frey's personnel wealth, but lacked election expertise, while the NPD had the latter but was financially weak.\n\nIn September 1987 the DVU became the first far-right party in Germany in 20 years to win a seat in a state parliament when it entered the Parliament of Bremen, courtesy to winning 5.4 percent of the votes in Bremerhaven. Despite missing the five percent cut off in Bremen overall, gaining only 3.41 percent of the vote in the city state, the special provisions in Bremen allowed for a party to enter parliament if it passed the five percent mark in one of the two parts of the state. Frey had spend more money on the Bremen campaign than the major party in the state combined and benefited from targeting protest voters.\n\nKarl Heinz Sendbühler, a high-ranking member of the NPD, stated in 1989 that, with Frey's money, the charisma of Franz Schönhuber, leader of The Republicans at the time, and the NPD organisation, no German parliament would be save from such an alliance. However, the personnel dislike of Schönhuber and Frey made such an alliance impossible, with Frey accusing Schönhuber of being in league with the German conservatives while the latter called Frey a trader of Devotional articles.\n\nFrey continued to spend heavily on elections, investing DM 17 million on the 1989 European Parliament election, but winning only 1.6 percent of the votes in Germany, compare to 7.1 percent for their right-wing competitors, The Republicans, REP. Despite this financial and political defeat, the DVU expanded its membership to 25,000 by 1989, and won six seats in the Parliament of Bremen in 1991, becoming the third-largest party there. In the following year it won 6.3 percent in the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein but failed to win seats in the Hamburg state election in September 1993, where competition between the DVU and REP kept both out of parliament.\n\nBy 1994 the DVU was in a financially difficult situation while also experiencing a break down of relations with the NPD. A short-term alliance with the REP did not last and it was unable to compete in elections for a time. The DVU membership declined and it lost its seats in the Bremen election of 1995, despite spending DM 2 million on the campaign. After losing its seats in Schleswig-Holstein the following year it achieved a better result in Hamburg in 1997, gaining 4,97 percent of the votes, just 190 votes short of earning seats in the state parliament.\n\nFrey attempted to form alliances with the other two major far-right and right-wing parties in Germany but was rebuffed by the REP as being to extremist and by the NPD as being to moderate and business-orientated. In 1998 the DVU achieved its greatest election success, wining 12.8 percent, 16 seats, in Saxony-Anhalt, and a quarter of all votes of the young voters aged 18 to 25. However, by the following year the DVU fraction was split by infighting and a number of the party's members of parliament left the DVU.\n\nThe final years of the party saw it lose a substantial number of members and the ageing of the remainder. By the time of its merger with the NPD in 2010 the party had just 3,000 members, half the number the NPD had.\n\nIn 2004, the DVU entered a non-competition agreement with the far-right NPD for the state elections in Brandenburg and Saxony. Both parties passed the five-percent threshold in their respective states. The DVU reached 6.1 percent in the Brandenburg state elections, and the NPD won 9.2 percent in the Saxony state elections. After this relatively successful election, the parties formed an electoral alliance for the 2005 federal elections. The joint NPD-DVU slate, which ran under the NPD's ballot line, won 1.6 percent of the total votes nationally.\n\nIn 2009, party founder Frey did not run for reelection as chairman and was replaced by Matthias Faust. In 2010, a referendum of party members approved a merger of the DVU and the NPD. Several state sections of the DVU objected to the merger and achieved a preliminary injunction from the Landgericht Munich based on irregularities during the referendum. On May 26, 2012, these objections were withdrawn and the DVU was declared defunct. Several branches and individuals objected to the perceived links between the NPD and Nazism, and instead joined with the smaller party the Republicans, who were considered more moderate. This was especially true in North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria, where the Republicans were traditionally strongest. Some other individuals formed a new party called Die Rechte (meaning \"the Right\").\n\nThe party was, from the start, under observation by the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, who declared the party's policies to be in violation of the German constitution. The DVU was classified as xenophobic, nationalistic, historical revisionist and as a protest party against the alleged failure of the mainstream political parties.\n\nDVU candidates in state elections rarely made appearances, remaining in the back ground. Instead of election rallies, the party invested in posters and flyers, targeting protest voters. Candidates for state elections were hand-picked by Frey after private interviews, and not elected by the party.\n\nBecause of Frey's authoritarian leadership, the DVU was often dubbed the \"Frey Party\" and its financial dependence on Frey ensured that independent party activities were impossible. DVU fractions in state parliaments soon fractured because of Frey's overreaching control and the party soon folded after Frey stepped down in 2009. The Irish Times, after the party's success in the 1998 Saxony-Anhalt state elections, described the DVU as \"less a political party than the dangerous plaything of a millionaire\", without any real party structure. At the time, Frey's personnel fortune was estimated to be in excess of DM 500 million.\n"}

{"id": "336979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336979", "title": "Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures", "text": "Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures\n\nThe representation of \"jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures\" has a long history, with iconographic examples dating back to at least the mid-Formative period of Mesoamerican chronology. The jaguar (\"Panthera onca\") is an animal with a prominent association and appearance in the cultures and belief systems of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies in the New World, similar to the lion (\"Panthera leo\") and tiger (\"Panthera tigris\") in the Old World. Quick, agile, and powerful enough to take down the largest prey in the jungle, the jaguar is one of the biggest felids in Central or North America, and one of the most efficient and aggressive predators. Endowed with a spotted coat and well adapted for the jungle, hunting either in the trees or water, making it one of the few felines tolerant of water, the jaguar was, and remains, revered among the indigenous Americans who live closely with the jaguar. \n\nAll major Mesoamerican civilizations prominently featured a jaguar god, and for many, such as the Olmec, the jaguar was an important part of shamanism. For those who resided in or near the tropical jungle, the jaguar was well known and became incorporated into the lives of the inhabitants. The jaguar's formidable size, reputation as a predator, and its evolved capacities to survive in the jungle made it an animal to be revered. The Olmec and the Maya witnessed this animal's habits, adopting the jaguar as an authoritative and martial symbol, and incorporated the animal into their mythology. The jaguar stands today, as it did in the past, as an important symbol in the lives of those who coexist with this feline.\n\nThe Olmec civilization was first defined as a distinctive art style at the turn of the nineteenth century. The various sculpture, figurines, and celts from what now is recognized as the Olmec heartland on the southern Gulf Coast, reveal that these people knew their jungle companions well and incorporated them into their mythology.\n\nIn the surviving Olmec archaeological record, jaguars are rarely portrayed naturalistically, but rather with a combination of feline and human characteristics. These feline anthropomorphic figures may range from a human figure with slight jaguar characteristics to depictions of shamanistic transformations in the so-called transformative pose, kneeling with hands on knees, to figures that are nearly completely feline. \n\nOne of the most prominent, distinctive, and enigmatic Olmec designs to appear in the archaeological record has been the \"were-jaguar\". Seen not only in figurines, the motif also may be found carved into jade \"votive axes\" and celts, engraved onto various portable figurines of jade, and depicted on several \"altars\", such as those at La Venta. Were-jaguar babies are often held by a stoic, seated adult male.\n\nThe were-jaguar figure is characterized by a distinctive down-turned mouth with fleshy lips, almond-shaped eyes, and a cleft head similar – it is said – to that of the male jaguar which has a cleft running vertically the length of its head.\n\nIt is not known what the were-jaguar represented to the Olmec, and it may well have represented different things at different times.\n\nThe jaguar also is important for shamans who often associate the jaguar as a spirit companion or \"nagual\", which will protect the shamans from evil spirits and while they move between the earth and the spirit realm. In order for the shamans to combat whatever evil forces may be threatening, or for those who rely on the shamans for protection, it is necessary for the shamans to transform and cross over to the spirit realm. The jaguar is often as a \"nagual\" because of its strength, for it is necessary that the shamans \"dominate the spirits, in the same way as a predator dominates its prey\" (Saunders 1998:30). The jaguar is said to possess the transient ability of moving between worlds because of its comfort both in the trees and the water, the ability to hunt as well in the nighttime as in the daytime, and the habit of sleeping in caves, places often associated with the deceased ancestors. The concept of the transformation of the shaman is well documented in Mesoamerica and South America and is in particular demonstrated in the various Olmec jaguar transformation figures (Diehl, p. 106).\n\nIntegration of the jaguar into the sacred and secular realms of the Maya is proven in the archaeological record. The Maya, whose territory spanned the Yucatán Peninsula all the way to the Pacific coast of Guatemala, was a literate society who left documentation of their lives (mostly the lives of the aristocracy) and belief system in the form of bas-relief sculpture on temples, stelae, and pottery. Often depicted on these artifacts are the gods the Maya revered and it is no coincidence that these gods often have jaguar attributes. As stated earlier, the jaguar is said to have the ability to cross between worlds, and for the Maya daytime and nighttime represented two different worlds. The living and the earth are associated with the day, and the spirit world and the ancestors are associated with the night. As the jaguar is quite at home in the nighttime, the jaguar is believed to part of the underworld; thus, \"Maya gods with jaguar attributes or garments are underworld gods\" (Benson 1998:64). One such god is Xbalanque, one of the Maya Hero Twins who descended to the underworld, and whose entire body is covered with patches of jaguar skin. Another is God L, who is \"the primary lord of the underworld\" and often is shown with a jaguar ear or jaguar attire, and atop a jaguar throne (Benson 1998: 64-65). Not only is the underworld associated with the ancestors, but it also is understood as, where plants originate. In addition, the Maya's source of fresh water comes from underground pools in the porous limestone that makes up the Yucatán, called \"cenotes\". These associations with water and plants further reinforce the notion of the jaguar as a god of fertility.\n\nThe jaguar is further associated with vegetation and fertility by the Maya with what is known as the Waterlily jaguar, which is depicted as having water lilies sprouting from its head (Benson 1998:64-67).\n\nNo doubt, the jaguar's brilliant coat made it quite desirable, however, not all were allowed to don the jaguar pelt as it became the identification of the ruling class for the Maya. Not only did Maya kings wear jaguar pelts, but they also adopted the jaguar as part of their ruling name, as a symbol of their might and authority. One such ruling family to incorporate the jaguar into their name is known as, Jaguar Paw, who ruled the Maya city of Tikal in the fourth century. Jaguar Paw I was ousted by central Mexicans from Teotihuacán, and it was not until late in the fifth century that the Jaguar Paw family returned to power (Coe 1999: 90). Other Maya rulers to incorporate the jaguar name include, Scroll Jaguar, Bird Jaguar, and Moon Jaguar, just to name a few (Coe 1999: 247-48). In addition to the ruling class, the jaguar also was associated with warriors and hunters. Those who excelled in hunting and warfare often adorned themselves with jaguar pelts, teeth, or claws and were \"regarded as possessing feline souls\" (Saunders 1998: 26).\nArcheologists have found a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600-900 AD), which depicts a musical instrument that has been reproduced and played. This instrument is astonishing in at least two respects. First, it is the only stringed instrument known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European musical instruments. Second, when played, it produces a sound virtually identical to a jaguar's growl. A sample of this sound is available at the Princeton Art Museum website.\n\n\"Tēcuani\" (variously rendered) means \"jaguar\" in Nahuatl while \"tepēc\" means \"at the hill\". The name refers to a particular hill in southern Mexico which is believed to have been an important shrine in the jaguar cult throughout several eras of Mesoamerican history. Subsequently, the name also was applied to the isthmus in southern Mexico upon which the hill lies, as well as to the gulf on the Pacific shore of the isthmus.\n\n\"Tēcuani\" (and its variants tekuani, tekuane, tecuane) means \"jaguar\" in Nahuatl. In the south-center of Mexico the \"danza de los tecuanes\" is performed in at least 96 communities. In this region jaguar dances are very popular. There are many variants of jaguar dances. Some of the most popular are the \"tecuanes dances\", \"tlacololeros dances\" and \"tlaminques dances\". \n\n\n"}

It was common for a new sultan to have his brothers killed, including infants, sometimes dozens of them at once. This practice reduced the number of claimants to the throne, leading to several occasions where the Ottoman line seemed destined to end. The confinement of heirs provided security for an incumbent sultan and continuity of the dynasty.\n\nWhen Ahmet I died in 1617, his eldest son was only 13 years old, and for the first time in 14 generations, the Imperial Council altered succession so that the late sultan's brother acceded to the throne as Mustafa I, aged 25 years. He was deposed (for the first time) the following year and became the first inmate of the Kafes although he and other princes throughout the preceding generations had been sequestered in various other places of comfortable confinement.\n\nThe next time there was a succession choice between a son or younger brother was in 1687 and the brother was again preferred. Thereafter, the \"rule of elderness\" was adopted as the rule of succession in the House of Osmanli so that all males within an older generation were exhausted before the succession of the eldest male in the next generation. This rule has also been largely adopted by other Islamic kingdoms.\n\nIt became common to confine brothers, cousins and nephews to the Cage, generally not later than when they left the harem (women's quarters) at puberty. This also marked the end of their education and many sultans came to the throne ill-prepared to be rulers, without any experience of government or affairs outside the Cage. There they had only the company of servants and the women of their harems, occasionally with deposed sultans.\n\nThe degree of confinement varied from reign to reign. Abdülaziz (1861–76) confined his nephews to the Cage when he succeeded his half-brother Abdülmecid I (their father) on the throne, but allowed them some freedom. He took his two eldest nephews with him when he traveled to Europe in 1867. At different times, it was the policy to ensure that inmates of the Cage only took barren concubines. Consequently, some sultans did not produce sons until they acceded to the throne. These sons, by virtue of their youth at the time of their fathers' deaths, ensured that the rule of elderness became entrenched so that it sometimes happened that the son of a sultan was confined during the reigns of cousins and older brothers before acceding to his father's throne.\n\nSome inmates of the Cage grew old and died there before having the opportunity to succeed to the throne. Confinement in the Cage had a great impact on the personalities of the captives in the Kafes and many of them developed psychological disorders. At least one deposed sultan and one heir committed suicide in the Cage.\n\nThe last Ottoman sultan, Mehmet VI Vahidettin (1918–22) was aged 56 when he came to the throne and had been either in the harem or the Cage his whole life. He was confined to the Cage by his uncle (Abdülaziz) and had stayed there during the reigns of his three older brothers. It was the longest and last confinement of a sultan by his predecessors. \n\nBy the later years of the Ottoman dynasty, the Cage had become a metaphor for the confinement of princes rather than the actual place where they were confined. The heir of the last sultan had apartments in the Dolmabahce Palace, on the Bosphorus, where the sultan also lived. The last sultan's deposed older brother (Abdulhamit II) was confined in rooms of his own choosing at Beylerbeyi Palace in his final years and died there in 1918. The Topkapı Palace, the original location of the Cage, had long fallen into disuse by the imperial family.\n\n"}

Its purpose is to list every cultural event in Paris and Île-de-France.\n\nThe first edition appeared on September 25, 1946, under the title \"Cette semaine\" (\"This Week\"). Its purpose was to inform its readers, in the most precise and consise way possible, of every event taking place that week that was \"not of a political, religious, or controversial nature.\" Rather, its intention was to provide information \"about everything that is leisure, everything that is Paris\".\n\nThe first publication contained 32 pages and cost 10 francs. At the time, the format of the magazine comprised eight sections: theatre, cinema, music, dance, cabarets, expositions, museums and churches of Paris. The hallmark of the publication was the information that would lead to its success: \n\nBetween September 1946 and July 2013, 3,471 editions were published with one sole interruption (of one week, during the events of May 1968).\n\nIn its early years, several famous French writers wrote columns in the pages of the magazine, including Maurice Rostand, from February 1948 to February 1949; Sacha Guitry, from October 1952 to May 1954; and André Roussin beginning in June 1954.\n\nIn 1973 the format was established that is still utilised today. The contents of the sections have progressively evolved to adapt to the changing language and mores of Parisians and inhabitants of Île de France.\n\nIn 2013, the guide was divided into nine major sections: \n\nSince June 1, 2013, \"L'Officiel des spectacles\" has been published by Offi Médias, the offspring of the association between Christophe Richemond, the son of Jean-Philippe Richemond, and Xavier Pauporté, the director of TheatreOnline.\n\nIn 2013, the weekly publication figures were reported to be 72,404 copies, and the total distribution was 48,079 copies.\n"}

{"id": "34655805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34655805", "title": "Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War", "text": "Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War\n\nDuring the 1971 Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat e Islami raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. During the war, a fatwa in Pakistan declared that the Bengali freedom fighters were \"Hindus\" and that their women could be taken as the \"booty of war\". Imams and Muslim religious leaders publicly declared that the Bengali women were \"gonimoter maal\" (war booty) and thus they openly supported the rape of Bengali women by the Pakistani Army.\n\nThe activists and leaders of Islamic parties were also involved in the rapes and abduction of women. Scholars have suggested that rape was used to terrorise both the Bengali-speaking Muslim majority and the Hindu minority of Bangladesh. The rapes caused thousands of pregnancies, births of war babies, abortions, infanticide, suicide, and ostracisation of the victims. Recognised as one of the major occurrences of war crimes anywhere, the atrocities ended after surrender of the Pakistani military and supporting Razaker militias. Initially India claimed its support for the Mukti Bahini and later intervention was on humanitarian grounds, but after the UN rejected this argument, India claimed intervention was needed to protect its own security, and it is now widely seen as a humanitarian move. Despite the Pakistani government's attempts to censor news during the conflict, reports of atrocities filtered out, attracting international media and public attention, and drawing widespread outrage and criticism.\n\nDuring the war Bengali nationalists also committed mass rape of ethnic Bihari Muslim women, since the Bihari Muslim community supported Pakistan. Indian soldiers as well as Bengali millitiamen were also identified as perpetrators of rape by scholar Yasmin Saikia.\n\nIn 2009, almost 40 years after the events of 1971, a report published by the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee of Bangladesh accused 1,597 people of war crimes, including rape. Since 2010 the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has indicted, tried and sentenced several people to life imprisonment or death for their actions during the conflict. The stories of the rape victims have been told in movies and literature, and depicted in art.\n\nFollowing the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan the East and West wings were not only separated geographically, but also culturally. The authorities of the West viewed the Bengali Muslims in the East as \"too Bengali\" and their application of Islam as \"inferior and impure\", and this made them unreliable. To this extent the West began a strategy to forcibly assimilate the Bengalis culturally. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan were chiefly Muslim, but their numbers were interspersed with a significant Hindu minority. Very few spoke Urdu, which in 1948 had been declared the national language of Pakistan. To express their opposition, activists in East Pakistan founded the Bengali language movement in February 1952. Earlier, in 1949, other activists had founded the Awami League as an alternative to the ruling Muslim League in West Pakistan. In the next decade and half, Bengalis became gradually disenchanted with the balance of power in Pakistan, which was under military rule during much of this time; eventually some began to call for secession. By the late 1960s, a perception had emerged that the people of East Pakistan were second-class citizens. It did not help that General A. A. K. Niazi, head of Pakistani Forces in East Pakistan, called East Pakistan a \"low-lying land of low, lying people\".\n\nThere had been opposition to military rule in West Pakistan as well. Eventually the military relented, and in December 1970 the first ever elections were held. To the surprise of many, East Pakistan's Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a clear majority. The West Pakistani establishment was displeased with the results. In Dacca following the election a general said \"Don't worry, we will not allow these black bastards to rule over us\". Soon President Yahya Khan banned the Awami League and declared martial law in East Pakistan.\n\nWith the goal of putting down Bengali nationalism, the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight on 25 March 1971. According to Eric Heinze the Pakistani forces targeted both Hindus and Bengali-speaking Muslims. In the ensuing 1971 Bangladesh genocide, the army caused the deaths of up to 3 million people, created up to 10 million refugees who fled to India, and displaced a further 30 million within East Pakistan.\n\nRounaq Jahan alleges elements of racism in the Pakistan army, who he says considered the Bengalis \"racially inferior—a non-martial and physically weak race\", and has accused the army of using organised rape as a weapon of war. According to the political scientist R. J. Rummel, the Pakistani army looked upon the Bengalis as \"subhuman\" and that the Hindus were \"as Jews to the Nazis, scum and vermin that best be exterminated\". This racism was then expressed in that the Bengalis, being inferior, must have their gene pool \"fixed\" through forcible impregnation. Belén Martín Lucas has described the rapes as \"ethnically motivated\".\n\nThe attacks were led by General Tikka Khan, who was the architect of Operation Searchlight and was given the name the \"butcher of Bengal\" by the Bengalis for his actions. Khan said—when reminded on 27 March 1971 that he was in charge of a majority province—\"I will reduce this majority to a minority\". Bina D'Costa believes an anecdote used by Khan is significant, in that it provides proof of the mass rapes being a deliberate strategy. In Jessore, while speaking with a group of journalists Khan was reported to have said, \"Pehle inko Mussalman karo\" (First, make them Muslim). D'Costa argues that this shows that in the highest echelons of the armed forces the Bengalis were perceived as being disloyal Muslims and unpatriotic Pakistanis.\n\nThe perpetrators conducted nighttime raids, assaulting women in their villages, often in front of their families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. \"Time\" magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.\n\nIn what has been described by Jenneke Arens as a deliberate attempt to destroy an ethnic group, many of those assaulted were raped, murdered and then bayoneted in the genitalia. Adam Jones, a political scientist, has said that one of the reasons for the mass rapes was to undermine Bengali society through the \"dishonoring\" of Bengali women and that some women were raped until they died or were killed following repeated attacks. The Pakistani army also raped Bengali males. The men, when passing through a checkpoint, would be ordered to prove they were circumcised, and this is where the rapes usually happened. The International Commission of Jurists concluded that the atrocities carried out by the Pakistan armed forces \"were part of a deliberate policy by a disciplined force\". The writer Mulk Raj Anand said of the Pakistani army actions, \"The rapes were so systematic and pervasive that they had to be conscious Army policy, \"planned by the West Pakistanis in a deliberate effort to create a new race\" or to dilute Bengali nationalism\". Amita Malik, reporting from Bangladesh following the Pakistan armed forces surrender, wrote that one West Pakistani soldier said: \"We are going. But we are leaving our Seed behind\".\n\nNot all Pakistani military personnel supported the violence: General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, who advised the president against military action, and Major Ikram Sehgal both resigned in protest, as did Air Marshal Asghar Khan. Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, a Balochi politician, and Khan Abdul Wali Khan, leader of the National Awami Party, protested over the actions of the armed forces. Those imprisoned for their dissenting views on the violence included Sabihuddin Ghausi and I. A. Rahman, who were both journalists, the Sindhi leader G. M. Syed, the poet Ahmad Salim, Anwar Pirzado, who was a member of the air force, Professor M. R. Hassan, Tahera Mazhar and Imtiaz Ahmed. Malik Ghulam Jilani, who was also arrested, had openly opposed the armed action in the East; a letter he had written to Yahya Khan was widely publicised. Altaf Hussain Gauhar, the editor of the \"Dawn\" newspaper, was also imprisoned. In 2013 Jilani and Faiz Ahmad Faiz, a poet, were honoured by the Bangladeshi government for their actions.\n\nAccording to Peter Tomsen, a political scientist, Pakistan's secret service the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, in conjunction with the political party Jamaat-e-Islami, formed militias such as Al-Badr (\"the moon\") and the Al-Shams (\"the sun\") to conduct operations against the nationalist movement. These militias targeted non-combatants and committed rapes as well as other crimes. Local collaborators known as Razakars also took part in the atrocities. The term has since become a pejorative akin to the western term \"Judas\".\n\nMembers of the Muslim League, such as Nizam-e-Islam, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamiat Ulema Pakistan, who had lost the election, collaborated with the military and acted as an intelligence organisation for them. Members of Jamaat-e-Islami and some of its leaders collaborated with the Pakistani forces in rapes and targeted killings. The atrocities by Al-Badr and the Al-Shams garnered worldwide attention from news agencies; accounts of massacres and rapes were widely reported.\n\nThere is an academic consensus that the events of the nine-month conflict were a genocide. The atrocities in East Pakistan were the first instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J. Scholz has written that this was the first genocide to capture the interest of the mass media. The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani army.\n\nOwing to the scale of the atrocities, US embassy staff had sent telegrams indicating that a genocide was occurring. One, which became known as the Blood telegram, was sent by Archer Blood, the US Consul General in Dhaka, and was signed by him as well as US officials from USAID and USIS who at the time were serving in Dhaka. In it, the signatories denounced American \"complicity in Genocide\". In an interview in 1972, Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, justified the use of military intervention, saying, \"Shall we sit and watch their women get raped?\" The events were discussed extensively in the British House of Commons. John Stonehouse proposed a motion supported by a further 200 members of parliament condemning the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani armed forces. Although this motion was presented twice before parliament, the government did not find time to debate it.\n\nBefore the end of the war the international community had begun to provide aid in large quantities to the refugees living in India. Although humanitarian aid was given, there was little support for the war crimes trials which Bangladesh proposed at the end of the war. Critics of the United Nations have used the atrocities of 1971 to argue that military intervention was the only thing to stop the mass murder. Writing to \"The New York Times\", a group of women said in response to women being shunned by family and husbands, \"It is unthinkable that innocent wives whose lives were virtually destroyed by war are now being totally destroyed by their own husbands\". International aid was also forthcoming owing to the issue of war rape.\n\nAccording to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape during wartime is not a new phenomenon. She argues that what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the international community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape could be used as a weapon to terrorise the people.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.\n\nThe feminist writer Cynthia Enloe has written that some pregnancies were intended by the soldiers and perhaps their officers as well. A report from the International Commission of Jurists said, \"Whatever the precise numbers, the teams of American and British surgeons carrying out abortions and the widespread government efforts to persuade people to accept these girls into the community, testify to the scale on which raping occurred\". The commission also said that Pakistani officers not only allowed their men to rape, but enslaved women themselves.\n\nFollowing the conflict the rape victims were seen as a symbol of \"social pollution\" and shame. Few were able to return to families or old homes because of this. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called the victims \"birangona\" (\"heroine\"), but this served as a reminder that these women were now deemed socially unacceptable as they were \"dishonored\", and the term became associated with \"barangona\" (\"prostitute\"). The official strategy of marrying the women off and encouraging them to be seen as war heroines failed as few men came forward, and those who did expected the state to provide a large dowry. Those women who did marry were usually mistreated, and the majority of men, once having received a dowry, abandoned their wives.\n\nOn 18 February 1972 the state formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping the victims of rape and to help with the adoption programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, \"I do not want those polluted blood in this country\". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as they did not have to bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to \"mainstream life\", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said \"I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born.\"\n\nForty years after the war, two sisters who had been raped were interviewed by Deutsche Welle. Aleya stated she had been taken by the Pakistani army when she was thirteen, and was gang raped repeatedly for seven months. She states she was tortured and was five months pregnant when she returned to her home. Her sister, Laily, says she was pregnant when she was taken by the armed forces, and lost the child. Later she fought alongside the Mukti Bahini. Both say that the state has failed the \"birangona\", and that all they received was \"humiliation, insults, hatred, and ostracism.\"\n\nAfter the conflict, the Pakistani government decided on a policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare an account of the circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.\n\nIn 1974 the commission was reopened and issued a supplementary report, which remained classified for 25 years until published by the magazine \"India Today\". The report said that 26,000 people were killed, rapes numbered in the hundreds, and that the Mukti Bahini rebels engaged in widespread rape and other human rights abuses. Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist, believes that the Pakistani establishment has yet to come to terms with the atrocities carried out, saying that, in a visit to Bangladesh in 2002, Pervez Musharraf expressed regret for the atrocities rather than accepting responsibility.\n\nIn 2008, after a 17-year investigation, the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee released documentation identifying 1,597 people who had taken part in the atrocities. The list included members of the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, a political group founded in 1978. In 2010 the government of Bangladesh set up the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) to investigate the atrocities of that era. While Human Rights Watch has been supportive of the tribunal, it has also been critical of reported harassment of lawyers representing the accused. Brad Adams, director of the Asia branch of Human Rights Watch, has said that those accused must be given the full protection of the law to avoid the risk of the trials not being taken seriously, and Irene Khan, a human rights activist, has expressed doubt about whether the mass rapes and killings of women will be addressed. Khan has said of her government's reaction:\n\nThe deputy leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the first person to face charges related to the conflict, was indicted by the ICT on twenty counts of war crimes, which included murder, rape and arson. He denied all charges. On 28 February 2013, Sayeedi was found guilty of genocide, rape and religious persecution, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Four other members of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, including Motiur Rahman Nizami, have also been indicted for war crimes. Abul Kalam Azad, a member of the Razakars, was the first person to be sentenced for crimes during the war. He was found guilty of murder and rape in absentia, and was sentenced to death. Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, senior assistant secretary general of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, faced seven charges of war crimes, including planning and advising on the rape of women in the village of Shohaghpur on 25 July 1971. The ICT sentenced him to death by hanging on 9 May 2013. In July 2013 Ghulam Azam was given a ninety-year sentence for rape and mass murder during the conflict. Abdul Quader Molla, a member of the Rajakar militia during the war was charged with abetting the Pakistani army and actively participating in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities: rape (including the rape of minors) and mass murder of Bangladeshis in the Mirpur area of Dhaka during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After the government had amended the war crimes law to allow a sentence to be appealed based on leniency of punishment, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and asked for it to upgrade Molla's sentence from life in prison to death. On 17 September 2013, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal and sentenced Molla to death. Finally he was hanged in Dhaka Central Jail on 12 December 2013 at 22:01.\n\nA photograph taken during the conflict of a woman who had been assaulted featured in an exhibition in London. Titled \"Shamed Woman\", but also called \"Brave Woman\", the image was taken by a Bangladeshi photographer, Naib Uddin Ahmed. The image is considered by John Tulloch to be as \"classical a pose as any Madonna and Child\". One of the more emotive photographs at the exhibition, the woman has her hands clenched, her face completely covered by her hair. Tulloch describes the image as having the \"Capability to reveal or suggest what is unsayable\".\n\n\"Orunodoyer Ognishakhi\" (\"Pledge to a New Dawn\"), the first film about the war, was screened in 1972 on the first Bangladeshi Independence Day celebration. It draws on the experiences of an actor called Altaf. While trying to reach safe haven in Calcutta, he encounters women who have been raped. The images of these \"birangona\", stripped and vacant-eyed from the trauma, are used as testimony to the assault. Other victims Altaf meets are shown committing suicide or having lost their minds.\n\nIn 1995 Gita Sahgal produced the documentary \"War Crimes File\", which was screened on Channel 4. In 2011 the film \"Meherjaan\" was shown at the Guwahati International Film Festival. It explores the war from two perspectives: that of a woman who loved a Pakistani soldier and that of a person born from rape.\n\nIn 1996 the book \"Ami Birangana Bolchi\" (\"The Voices of War Heroines\") written by Nilima Ibrahim was released. It is a collection of eyewitness testimony from seven rape victims, which she documented while working in rehabilitation centres. The narratives of the survivors in this work, is heavily critical of pre war Bangladeshi society`s failure to support the victims of rape.\n\nPublished in 2012, the book \"Rising from the Ashes: Women's Narratives of 1971\" includes oral testimonies of women affected by the Liberation War. As well as an account from Taramon Bibi, who fought and was awarded the Bir Protik (Symbol of Valour) for her actions, there are nine interviews with women who were raped. The book's publication in English at the time of the fortieth anniversary of the war was noted in the \"New York Times\" as an \"important oral history\".\n\nThe 2014 film \"Children of War\" tries to capture this horror. The film by Mrityunjay Devvrat starring Farooq Sheikh, Victor Banerjee, Raima Sen, among others is meant to \"send shivers down the viewers' spine. We want to make it so repulsive that no one even entertains the thought of pardoning rapists, let alone commit the crime. The shoot took its toll on all of us.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58488188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58488188", "title": "Sha-Amun-en-su", "text": "Sha-Amun-en-su\n\nSha-Amun-en-su () was an Egyptian priestess and singer who lived in Thebes during the first half of the 8th century B.C., responsible for ceremonial duties at the Temple of Karnak, dedicated to the god Amun. Sha-Amun-en-su was a \"Heset\", i.e., a member of the foremost group of singers with ritualistic functions active in the temple of Amun. After her death, which is estimated to have occurred around the age of 50, the singer was mummified and placed in a sarcophagus made of stucco and polychrome wood. Since its sealing, more than 2700 years ago, Sha-Amun-en-su's sarcophagus had never been opened, throughout its history, conserving inside the singer's mummy, a feature that gave it extreme rarity.\n\nThe sarcophagus and its mummy were given as presents to the Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro II during his second travel to Egypt, in 1876, by the Khedive Ismail Pasha. They became featured items displayed in the Palace of São Cristóvão, integrating Pedro II's private collection until the Proclamation of the Republic, in 1889, when they became part of the  Egyptian collection of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. However, a large-scale fire in the museum on 2 September 2018, destroyed the sarcophagus and the mummy, as well as almost all archaeological artifacts in permanent display.\n\nSha-Amun-en-su was born circa the year 800 B.C., during the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt. Her name and almost all known information about her life come from the hieroglyphic inscriptions in her sarcophagus It is known that she was a \"singer of Amun's sanctuary\", that means, a singer with priestly assignments in the service of the Temple of Karnak  in the ancient city of Thebes (currently Luxor), devoted to the god Amun. Thebes was one of the most important religious centers in Ancient Egypt, congregating a complex of temples and hundreds of workers, among them priests, scribes, singers, musicians, managers and employees, with Karnak as its main temple.\n\nThere were several categories of priestly singers at Amun's shrine. Sha-Amun-en-su belonged to the main group, called \"Heset\", women who exercised ritualistic functions and sang hymns in honor of the god Amun at sacred ceremonies and festivals, either as soloists or accompanied by female choirs. The  \"Heset\" tradition lasted in Thebes between the 9th to 6th centuries  B.C. Besides  singing the religious hymnns, they were responsible in hepling the \"God's Wife of Amun\" during the temple rites.\n\nThe \"Heset\" were not obliged to live permanently in the temple and many of them attended only for the execution of the ceremonies. Nevertheless, they obeyed to strict codes of conduct. Preferently, they had to stay chaste, but, even though not being virgins, they were considered extremely pure, to such extent as performing their gifts in such an important and symbolic edification as the temple of  Amun. Although they were not members of the Egyptian nobility, the singers were chosen among members of local elites and prepared for the function from an early age, being \"adopted\" by an older singer who served as their tutor and, in fact, as an \"adoptive mother\".\n\nThere are no information about Sha-Amun-en-su's biilogical family or foster mother. It is likely that, like most Heset, she came from a wealthy family traditionally linked to priestly activities. It is known, however, that sge had an \"adopted daughter,\" based on the inscriptions of another sarcophagus currently preserved in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo — the casket of a singer called Merset-Amun, whose hieroglyphs report that she was \"\"daughter of Sha-Amun-en-su, singer of the shrine of Amun\".\" Sha-Amun-en-su lived until around 50 years old, according to researches led by the National Museum's Laboratory of Egyptology. The death causes could not be determined.\n\nAfter the singer's death, her body was mummified by Egyptian priests and placed into a sarcophagus. Sha-Amun-en-su's coffin cover has never been removed, preventing the mummy from being studied by the naked eye. Thus, all analyzes of the coffin's inner structure and mummy status depended on X-ray examinations, computerized tomography, and three-dimensional scans. The set consisting of the sarcophagus and its mummy possessed great historical and scientific value, especially in relation to the knowledge of the funerary practices and rituals of the Temple of Ámon, since mummies of Egyptian singers are rare and even rarer are mummies of singers deposited in sealed coffins.\n\nSome features of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummification process were also quite specific and accentuated its rarity. Although most of the mummification process has followed traditional procedures, such as evisceration of the body and its wrapping with linen bandages, research coordinated by archaeologist , curator of the Egyptian collection of the National Museum, revealed that the mummy's throat was covered with resin-coated bandages. This particularity indicates a concern of the mummifying priests to protect a zone seen as \"vital\" for a singer with ritualistic functions that, according to the Egyptian beliefs, would continue using her gift in the afterlife.\n\nThe Institute of Oriental Studies at the University of Chicago preserves in its collection another mummy, also in a sealed sarcophagus, called Meresamun (\"Amun's beloved\", in Egyptian language). Like Sha-Amun-en-su, she was also a singer of the Amun temple during the 22nd Dynasty and her mummy also boasts a kind of protection in her throat. Meresamun was about 30 years old at her death. Her mouth and throat are lined with a padded protection, apparently made with pressed earth and bandages. Based on these common characteristics between the two mummies, Brancaglion hypothesized that there were specific standards of mummification for the women in charge of chanting hymns and songs in the Temple of Karnak.\n\nAnatomical analysis of the Sha-Amun-en-su mummy failed to determine the cause of her death. It is known, anyway, that the singer was around 50 years old when she died. The mummy's body appeared to be in good condition, with no traumas or injuries. The examinations also allowed to observe a very rare dental curiosity: the mummy still kept almost all her teeth, missing only one. The Sha-Amun-en-su mummy also underwent a three-dimensional laser scan coordinated by Jorge Lopes, from the Tri-dimensional Experimentation Nucleus of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. That procedure allowed the generation of three-dimensional data files (called \"orthogonal coordinates\") that served as the basis for making a small-scale replica of the singer's skeleton.\n\nComputed tomography analysis, coordinated by radiologist Iugiro Kuroki, under the supervision of paleopathologist Sheila Mendonça of Fiocruz, identified several amulets with votive functions stored inside the coffin, including a heart-scarab, an artifact related to Egyptian belief in the resurrection of the dead. Sha-Amun-en-su's heart-scarab consisted of a green stone of oval shape, set in a gold plaque and attached to a golden cord, with the name of the singer written in hieroglyphs. These artifacts were often placed on the heart of the mummy and had the function of \"replacing\" it in cases in which the organ was extracted during the evisceration process. In this way the priests sought to preserve the \"integrity\" of the deceased in the afterlife, as well as the functions, states, characteristics, and other attributes that ancient Egyptians attached to the heart, such as intelligence and feelings.\n\nThe Sha-Amun-en-su sarcophagus was composed of box and lid, both carved in polychrome stuccoed wood.It was 1,58 meters high and was made around 750 BC. Throughout its nearly three millennia of history, since it had been sealed with the mummified body of the singer and her votive amulets, the sarcophagus had never been opened.It was a highly representative example of Egyptian funerary art from the 8th and 9th centuries BC, characterized by the profusion of references to Heliopolitan theology.\n\nThe top of the sarcophagus cover was decorated with a female face, which sought to represent the natural color of the skin, topped with a blue headdress, decorated with yellow vulture wings and yellow and red ribbons. Shades of dark green, red and yellow stood out against a white background. At the breast height, there was the figure of the goddess Nut and a representation of a ram-headed bird with wings outstretched over the lid, symbolizing protection. The bird's claws and tail were flanked by two uraeus serpents, one with the crown of Upper Egypt and one with the crown of Lower Egypt The four Sons of Horus were represented in two pairs, one pair in front of each snake.On the right side were Imset with a human head and Hapy with a baboon's head, and on the left side Duamutef with a jackal's head and Qebehsenuf with a hawk's head. In the region of the legs were represented the amulets of the god Osiris, flanked by divinities. The two halves of the sarcophagus were separated by the sign Ankh, the symbol of life, which was repeated in two other ribbons. Finally, there was a representation of the singer's Ba - Ba was understood at the same time as a spiritual component of human beings, gods and animals, as a metaphysical principle related to the individuality of being and as a dynamic element that separates from the body after death, approaching, in this sense, the Western concept of soul.\n\nAt the back and outside of the sarcophagus was a representation of the great Djed pillar, a sign of stability associated with Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, who ruled the underworld and the dead. In different parts of the coffin, there were bands with hieroglyphic inscriptions, analyzed and studied by different Egyptologists, such as Kenneth Kitchen and Alberto Childe. Kitchen was the first to identify the mummy, deciphering two bands of distinct hieroglyphs that associated her name to her occupation. The first band bore the inscription\" \"An offering that the king makes [to] Osiris, Chief of the West, great God, Lord of Abydos - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine [of Ammon], Sha-Amun-en-su \". In the second line of hieroglyphs was read: \"An offering that the king makes [to] Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, Lord of the [shrine] Shetayet - made for [?] The Singer of the Shrine of Ammon, Sha-Amun-en-su\"\".\n\nThere is scarce information on the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su in the pre-nineteenth century period. There is no record of the date or exact archaeological site where the coffin was found (although it is known to come from the vast western Thebes complex), nor is there any information on the process of integrating the coffin into the Egyptian Khedivate collections.\n\nIn 1876, during the second visit of Emperor Dom Pedro II to Egypt, the sarcophagus was offered as a gift to the Brazilian monarch by Ismail Pasha. In return, Pedro II offered a book to the Khedive. An amateur Egyptologist and enthusiast of Egyptian culture, Pedro II had a special affection for the sarcophagus, which soon became one of the most relevant pieces of his private collection. The emperor kept him standing in his study in the Palace of São Cristóvão.\n\nDuring its passage through the collection of Pedro II, the sarcophagus was damaged in the event of a storm. Knocked down by the wind, the sarcophagus fell, crashing into one of the emperor's office windows and having its left side fragmented. It was later restored, but the intervention would remain visible ever since. Other restorations would be carried out in the following decades aiming at eliminating, above all, the threats of termites and wasps, attracted by the oldness of the wood.\n\nThe sarcophagus remained in the Palace of São Cristóvão after the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, and was later integrated into the collection of Egyptian archeology of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. Since its integration into the museum collection, the sarcophagus has always been one of the most outstanding pieces of the collection, having served as the basis for a large number of scientific researches, theses and monographs, developed by researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and others Brazilian scientific institutions and academics from different parts of the world. In 2015, commenting on the importance and uniqueness of the sarcophagus and the mummy of Sha-Amun-en-su, the curator of the Egyptian National Museum's collection, Antonio Brancaglion Junior, stated:\n\nOn September 2, 2018, a major fire destroyed the building of the National Museum and much of the collection on display, including the sarcophagus of Sha-Amun-en-su, with its mummy and all the votive artifacts conserved within it. In the fire, the other mummies and sarcophagi of the collection, along with most of the archaeological collection, were also lost. The fire caused great commotion in the academic, scientific and cultural circles of Brazil and the world.\n\n\n"}

It was published by Wiley in 2007. Villas is a former food editor for \"Town & Country\" magazine, and \"The Bacon Cookbook\" is his 15th book on food. He notes on the book's jacket that he was \"beguiled by bacon since he was a boy.\" He describes the appeal of bacon in the book's preface, and in the introduction recounts the history of the product, as well as its variations from different locations internationally. Chapters are structured by type of recipe and food course, and in total the book includes 168 recipes.\n\nThe book received generally positive reception in book reviews and media sources, receiving praise in \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"Library Journal\". In 2009 the National Pork Board highlighted recipes from the book for International Bacon Day. Chef Bobby Flay highlighted one recipe from \"The Bacon Cookbook\", for \"Bacon-Wrapped Figs Stuffed With Almonds In Port\", as one of his favorites. \"AM New York\", \"The Baltimore Sun\", and the \"Star Tribune\", recommended the book in articles on suggested gift-giving ideas. \"The Independent\" highlighted the book as number 11 on a list of \"The 50 Best Cookbooks\".\n\nIn the preface to the book, Villas states that vegetarians and those that do not eat pork for religious reasons are \"haunted instinctively by the sensuous, irresistible enticement\". He asserts, \"There's no one who doesn't love bacon. It's the greatest food God has ever created.\" Villas asks, \"Who, under any circumstances, is not rendered almost helpless by the tantalizing sound of bacon sizzling slowly in a skillet, by the taunting backwoods aroma that permeates the air ...?\" He notes that \"the greatest and most beloved food on earth\" is one of the worlds oldest forms of cooked meat. The author comments on the surge in interest in bacon products in the years prior to the book's publication, \"Just the 40 percent increase in bacon consumption in the United States over the past five years might have justified my writing this book.\" The book includes photographs by Andrea Grablewski.\n\nThe introduction contains a guide to \"the international world of bacon\", and Villas compares dishes Salt Pork and Pancetta; and Paprikaspeck and Bauchspeck. The introduction also includes a list of places to receive mail-order products. The book goes over the history of curing bacon, discussing the various international traditions. Smokehouses listed as resources in the book include Benton's in Tennessee, Newsom's in Kentucky, Edwards & Sons in Virginia, Nueske in Wisconsin, and Lazy H Smokehouse in Kirbyville, Texas. Villas instructs the reader in techniques of smoking bacon, how to buy and store it, and how to utilize bacon fat for cooking purposes.\n\nVillas explains the derivation of the phrase \"bring home the bacon\", writing, \"An Old English tradition whereby a flitch, or side, of bacon was offered as a prize to any man who could swear before the church that for a year and a day he had neither quarreled with his wife nor wished himself single.\" He recounts how the Chinese discovered methods of preserving pork bellies around 1500 B.C. By the first century A.D., Romans had established a practice of breeding hogs for the production of bacon. During the Middle Ages, bacon and beans was considered a staple food for the poor. According to Villas, bacon was eaten aboard the \"Mayflower\", and was a staple food product in the early American colonies. Villas describes how Oscar F. Mayer began to package sliced bacon for his customers during the 1920s. The author describes contemporary practices of utilizing old-fashioned style curing and smoking methods by food manufacturers in the United States.\n\nChapters are structured according to each type of recipe, including main course, soup, and breads. 168 recipes from the United States and globally are included in the book. The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately \"73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 grams of fat and 11 milligrams of cholesterol\", while the hot dog has \"182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 grams of fat and 29 milligrams of cholesterol\". \"If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence,\" writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew. For dessert, Villas includes six recipes such as bacon-wrapped figs, and Bacon and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles, and Portuguese Egg and Bacon Pudding.\n\nJames Villas is a former food editor for \"Town & Country\" magazine. The back flap of the book's jacket notes that Villas was \"beguiled by bacon since he was a boy.\" Prior to \"The Bacon Cookbook\", Villas had written other cookbooks including \"The Glory of Southern Cooking\", \"My Mother's Southern Kitchen\", and \"Biscuit Bliss\". \"The Bacon Cookbook\" is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to \"Pork Magazine\", \"People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon goes a long way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension.\" Villas explained to \"Salon\", \"Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture.\" Villas commented to \"CBS News\" that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, \"We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store. I mean quality bacon. And America really should be out there searching for this stuff. And it'll change your life. It will really change your life.\"\n\nA review in \"Publishers Weekly\" called the book an \"exuberant parade of pork fat\", and commented, \"there's plenty good to be had in these pages\". Writing for \"Library Journal\", Judith Sutton concluded, \"There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, including Sara Perry's \"Everything Tastes Better with Bacon\", but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections.\" Amy Culbertson of the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\" also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, \"His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's \"Seduced by Bacon\" by Joanna Pruess\". The book was highlighted in the \"Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide\" column of \"The Austin Chronicle\", where writer Mick Vann concluded, \"This is one of the few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading.\" In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from \"The Bacon Cookbook\". Bonnie Stern of \"Financial Post\" recommended the book, and commented, \"Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas\".\n\nChef Bobby Flay highlighted the recipe from \"The Bacon Cookbook\" for \"Bacon-Wrapped Figs Stuffed With Almonds In Port\" as one of his favorites. Jonathan Cheung, co-owner of the cookbook store Bon Appétit in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, recommended the book to his customers when they asked for books on cooking with pork products. \"AM New York\" highlighted the book among its recommendations of \"Best cookbooks to give as gifts\", noting that the author, \"presents a mouthwatering array of recipes to nudge the pork lover.\" Writing for \"The Advocate\", Cheramie Sonnier commented, \"James Villas comes through once again with a cookbook that is sure to please cooks who love both classic comfort foods and exotic new dishes.\" The \"San Jose Mercury News\" noted that Villas \"turns his meticulous eye to the cured pork product\" in the book, which includes \"recipes featuring bacon in every imaginable way\". The \"Winston-Salem Journal\" observed, \"His history of bacon, short and to the point, should be required reading for bacon lovers.\" \"The Baltimore Sun\" highlighted the book in an article \"Gifts to savor\", commenting that \"James Villas covers everything about this trendy ingredient\". Marialisa Calta of \"The Douglas Daily Dispatch\" wrote, \"in the unusual-but-oddly-compelling-single-subject-cookbook category, props go to “The Bacon Cookbook” by James Villas\". Writing for the \"Star Tribune\", Lee Svitak Dean recommended the book as a holiday gift for cooks, commenting, \"It's all here, from guacamole and bacon canapés to New England apple and bacon griddlecakes and German fennel and bacon soup.\" \"No publishing season is complete without a bacon book,\" wrote Kristen Browning-Blas of \"The Denver Post\", who noted that Joanna Pruess's \"Seduced by Bacon\" was released the previous year. The \"New York Daily News\" noted that the book \"includes an introductory primer on the many wondrous bacon varieties along with easy-to-follow instruction for more than 150 international dishes, from guacamole with bacon to bacon-duck stew.\" \"The Independent\" highlighted the book as number 11 on a list of \"The 50 Best Cookbooks\", commenting, \"Bacon is a standard choice for many a simple supper, but there is nothing standard about Villas's book. The irresistible smell of bacon oozes from the pages, as Villas shows the versatility of bacon, even bacon desserts – for example, bacon and peanut butter chocolate truffles. Vegetarians beware; these dishes could prove too tempting.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "276527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276527", "title": "The Battle of the Somme (film)", "text": "The Battle of the Somme (film)\n\nThe Battle of the Somme (US title, \"Kitchener's Great Army in the Battle of the Somme\"), is a 1916 British documentary and propaganda war film, shot by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell. The film depicts the British Army in the preliminaries and early days of the Battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November 1916). The film premièred in London on 10 August 1916 and was released generally on 21 August. The film depicts trench warfare, marching infantry, artillery firing on German positions, British troops waiting to attack on 1 July, treatment of wounded British and German soldiers, British and German dead and captured German equipment and positions. A scene during which British troops crouch in a ditch then \"go over the top\" was staged for the camera behind the lines.\n\nThe film was a great success, watched by about 20 million people in Britain in the first six weeks of exhibition and distributed in eighteen other countries. A second film, covering a later phase of the battle, was released in 1917 as \"The Battle of the Ancre and the Advance of the Tanks\". In 1920 the film was preserved in the film archive of the Imperial War Museum. In 2005 it was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register and digitally restored, and in 2008, was released on DVD. \"The Battle of the Somme\" is significant as an early example of film propaganda, an historical record of the battle and as a popular source of footage illustrating the First World War.\n\n\"The Battle of the Somme\" is a black-and-white silent film in five parts, with sequences divided by intertitles summarising the contents. The first part shows preparations for battle behind the British front line; there are sequences of troops marching towards the front, French peasants continuing their farm work in rear areas, the stockpiling of munitions, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle addresses the 29th Division and some of the preparatory bombardment by 18-pounder, 60-pounder and 4.7-inch guns, 6-inch, 9.2-inch howitzers and 2-inch mortars is shown. The second part depicts more preparations, troops moving into front line trenches, the intensification of the artillery barrage by 12-inch and 15-inch howitzers, a 9.45-inch Heavy Mortar and the detonation of the mine under the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Part three begins with the attack on First day on the Somme (1 July 1916), with some re-enactments and shows the recovery of British wounded and German prisoners. The fourth part shows more scenes of British and German wounded, the clearing of the battlefield and some of the aftermath. The final part shows scenes of devastation, including the ruins of the village of Mametz, British troops at rest and preparations for the next stage of the advance.\n\nOn 2 November 1915, the British Topical Committee for War Films, representing British newsreel producers and supported by the War Office, despatched two cameramen to France. Geoffrey Malins of Gaumont British and Edward Tong of Jury's Imperial Pictures, were to shoot footage for short newsreels. By early June Tong had fallen ill and been sent home but he and Malins had made five series of newsreels, which although well-received, had failed to impress the British cinema trade. John McDowell, of the British & Colonial film company, volunteered to replace Tong and left for France on 23 June 1916. On 24 June, the British Army began the preparatory artillery bombardment of German positions for the Battle of the Somme.\n\nMalins and McDowell shot the film between 26 June and . Malins filmed in the vicinity of Beaumont Hamel, on attachment with the 29th Division (VIII Corps); McDowell worked further south near Fricourt and Mametz with the 7th Division (XV Corps).\n\nBefore the battle, Malins worked at the north end of the British Somme sector, photographing troops on the march and heavy artillery west of Gommecourt. De Lisle suggested to Malins that he view the bombardment of Beaumont Hamel from Jacob's Ladder near White City, an abrupt drop down the side of a valley, with about cut into the ground, showing up white because of the chalk. Sappers had dug the large mine under Hawthorn Ridge in front of White City near Beaumont Hamel. German shells were falling as Malins made his way to Lanwick Street Trench. Malins had to rise above the parapet to remove sandbags and then set up his camera, which was camouflaged with sackcloth. Malins returned to film the speech by de Lisle to the 2nd Royal Fusiliers, after which Malins heard of the postponement of the battle for . Malins returned to White City to film the bombardment of the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt by trench mortars, during which there were three misfires, which destroyed a trench-mortar position nearby.\n\nOn 1 July Malins filmed troops of the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers waiting to advance at Beaumont Hamel from a sunken lane in no man's land, which had been occupied by digging a tunnel overnight. Malins then went back to Jacob's ladder to film the explosion of the Hawthorn Ridge mine. At Malins began filming and the mine detonation shook the ground as troops of Royal Engineers advanced on either side to occupy the crater. Later in the day a shell explosion damaged the camera tripod; Malins repaired the tripod and in the evening filmed roll-calls. Next day Malins shot film at La Boisselle before leaving for London around 9 July. Malins returned to France, and from filmed sequences of shellfire and of troops advancing from trenches, which were staged for the camera at a Third Army mortar school near St Pol.\n\nMcDowell reached the Somme front after Malins and began filming British preparations on 28 or 29 June, to the east of Albert. He covered the opening day of the battle from the vicinity of Carnoy and from the dressing-station at Minden Post. The success of the 7th Division enabled McDowell to film captured German trenches near Fricourt and Mametz.\n\nOn 10 July, Brigadier-General John Charteris reported to the War Office that some of footage had been shot and recommended that sections of film should be released as soon as possible. Footage was first viewed as a negative on 12 July and Charles Urban is thought to have begun work on the film as editor, with the assistance of Malins. Urban later claimed to have proposed that the film be issued as a feature film rather than in short sections. The change in format was agreed with the British Topical Committee for War Films and a cut of the film was ready by 19 July. Much footage was censored from the public version, as the War Office wanted the film to contain images that would support the war effort and raise morale. A version was ready by 31 July and a rough cut was screened at the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) General Headquarters (GHQ) at Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais and at the Fourth Army headquarters. The commander Lieutenant-General Henry Rawlinson said \"some of it is very good but it cut out many of the horrors in dead and wounded\". The film was shown to the Secretary of State for War, David Lloyd George on 2 August and members of the cinema trade late on 7 August, the day that the film received final approval for release.\n\nThe film comprises five reels and is long. The first screening took place on 10 August 1916 at the Scala Theatre, to an audience of journalists, Foreign Office officials, cinema trade figures and officers of the Imperial General Staff. The screening was preceded by the reading of a letter from Lloyd George, exhorting the audience to \"see that this picture, which is in itself an epic of self-sacrifice and gallantry, reaches everyone. Herald the deeds of our brave men to the ends of the earth. This is your duty.\"\n\nA musical medley with excerpts from classical, folk, contemporary and popular pieces, to be played live in cinemas by accompanying musicians, was devised by J. Morton Hutcheson and published in The Bioscope on 17 August 1916. On 21 August, the film began showing simultaneously in thirty-four London cinemas and opened in provincial cities the following week, when the film was shown simultaneously at twenty cinemas in Birmingham, at least twelve cinemas in Glasgow and Edinburgh, six cinemas in Cardiff and three in Leeds. The Royal Family received a private screening at Windsor Castle on 2 September; the film was eventually shown in more than eighteen countries.\n\nThe popularity of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand. The film is thought to have achieved attendance figures of twenty million in its first six weeks of release. The film also attracted more middle-class audiences, some of whom had never been to a cinema before. William Jury, as the film's booking director, initially charged exhibitors £40, with the fee decreasing by £5 a week; after two months, a reduced fee of £6 for three nights put the film within the price range of village halls wishing to show the film. By October 1916, the film had been booked by more than two thousand cinemas in Britain, earning over £30,000.\nBritish authorities showed the film to the public as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on 22 August that\n\nSome members of the audience considered it immoral to portray scenes of violence; the Dean of Durham protested \"against an entertainment which wounds the heart and violates the very sanctity of bereavement\". Others complained that such a serious film shared the cinema programme with comedy films. On 28 August, the Yorkshire Evening Post printed the comment, attributed to Lloyd George, \"If the exhibition of this Picture all over the world does not end War, God help civilisation\". The film was shown to British troops in France from 5 September; Lieutenant-Colonel Rowland Feilding, an officer who saw the film in a muddy field near Morlancourt, described it as \"a wonderful and most realistic production\" but criticised the film for failing to record the sound of rifles and machine-guns, although there was an artillery accompaniment from guns firing nearby. Feilding suggested that the film could reassure new recruits, by giving them some idea of what to expect in battle; the intertitles were forthright, describing images of injury and death.\n\nThe film was shown in New Zealand in October 1916. On 12 October, the Wellington \"Evening Post\" ran an advertisement for the film, describing it as \"the extraordinary films of 'the big push' and \"an awe-inspiring, glorious presentation of what our heroes are accomplishing today\". In a review published on 16 October, it was written that \"these pictures of the Battle of the Somme are a real and valuable contribution to the nation's knowledge and a powerful spur to national effort\". The film premièred in Australia on 13 October at Hoyt's Picture Theatre in Melbourne. The Melbourne \"Argus\" considered that after the attack sequence, \"... you are not in a Melbourne picture theatre, but in the very forefront of the Somme battle\" and called the film \"this moving reality of battle\".\n\nThe film and its reception was of great interest to Germans, who were able to read a report from a neutral reporter in London, filed in the . British cinema was said to be taking a serious view of the war, helped by the government, which had arranged for the production of \"real war films\", \"The Battle of the Somme\" was \"absorbing\" and had attracted huge audiences. German troops recovered a letter from a British civilian, who had seen the film on 26 August and written to a soldier in France, describing the issue of a leaflet to each filmgoer that stated that the film was not entertainment but an official film. Having viewed the film, the writer was sure that it would enlighten the audience in a way never before achieved.\n\nDuring the second week of August, the King, Prime Minister and Lloyd George toured the Western Front and were filmed by Malins. The War Office released the film in October as \"The King Visits His Armies in the Great Advance\". Malins made a third film \"The Battle of the Ancre and the Advance of the Tanks\" which opened in January 1917. In the same month a German film \"With our Heroes on the Somme\" was shown but \"lacked the immediacy\" of the British film, being re-enactments at training establishments behind the lines, which received a lukewarm reception. A booklet to accompany the film proclaimed that it depicted \"the German will in war\" and implied that the enemies of Germany were using colonial troops to undermine \"German honour\". Malins' final feature film \"The German Retreat and the Battle of Arras\" was released in June 1917, showing the destruction of Péronne and the first British troops across the Somme, following-up the German withdrawal; the film failed to attract the audiences of 1916.\n\nIn 1920 the original nitrate negative was passed to the Imperial War Museum for preservation. A nitrate protection archive master was made in 1921 and an acetate safety master in 1931. The nitrate masters were destroyed in the 1970s after the onset of irreversible nitrate decomposition. Excerpts have been taken for television documentaries, including \"The Great War\" (1964. BBC), \"The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century\" (1996, PBS) and \"The First World War\" (2003, Channel 4). The film was offered on VHS in 1987, as the first title from the Imperial War Museum film archive to be released on video. In 2005, \"The Battle of the Somme\" was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register for the preservation of global documentary heritage. The film was described by UNESCO as a \"compelling documentary record of one of the key battles of the First World War [and] the first feature-length documentary film record of combat produced anywhere in the world\" and had \"played a major part in establishing the methodology of documentary and propaganda film.\"\n\nOn 22 October 2006, after a restoration project, a refined version of the film was screened at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, accompanied by the Philharmonia Orchestra performing an original orchestral score by Laura Rossi. The restoration was later nominated for an Archive Restoration or Preservation Project award by the Federation of Commercial Audiovisual Libraries. In November 2008, the restored film was released on DVD, to mark the 90th anniversary of the Armistice with Germany in 1918. The DVD included the score by Laura Rossi, an accompanying 1916 musical medley, a commentary by Roger Smither, a film archivist at the Imperial War Museum and interviews with Smither, Rossi, Toby Haggith (film archivist) and Stephen Horne (silent film musician) on the reconstruction of the contemporary medley; film fragments and missing scenes were also included in the DVD.\n\nIn 2012, with the support of the Imperial War Museum, there were public screenings of the restored film accompanied by a live orchestra playing the soundtrack of Rossi's music. Somme100 FILM has a target of a hundred performances of the film by amateur and professional orchestras in the centenary year, between July 2016 and July 2017.\n\n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n\nNewspapers\n\nWebsites\n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n\nwebsites\n\n"}
{"id": "3565369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3565369", "title": "The Children's Museum of Indianapolis", "text": "The Children's Museum of Indianapolis\n\nThe Children's Museum of Indianapolis is the world's largest children's museum. It is located at 3000 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, in the United Northwest Area neighborhood of the city. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. It is with five floors of exhibit halls and receives more than one million visitors annually. Its collection of over 120,000 artifacts and exhibit items is divided into three domains: the American Collection, the Cultural World Collection, and the Natural World Collection. Among the exhibits are a simulated Cretaceous dinosaur habitat, a carousel, and a steam locomotive. The museum's focus is family learning; most exhibits are designed to be interactive, allowing children and families to actively participate.\n\nFounded in 1925 by Mary Stewart Carey with the help of Indianapolis civic leaders and organizations, it is the fourth-oldest such institution in the world. The current site became home for the museum in 1946; the current building was constructed in 1976 and has had four major expansions since then. The museum hosts thousands of activities annually, including plays at the Lilly Theater, classes and workshops for school children, traveling exhibits, and fund-raising events. With a 2008 budget of $28.7 million, it has 400 employees and 1,500 volunteers. Its financial stability is ensured by a large endowment that was first established in the 1960s and is governed by a board of trustees.\nThe Children's Museum of Indianapolis was founded in 1925 by Mary Stewart Carey, a wealthy civic patron who owned the Stewart-Carey Glass Company. She was inspired to create the museum after a 1924 visit to the Brooklyn Children's Museum. Carey began a campaign to start a Children's Museum in Indianapolis and enlisted the aid of other local civic leaders and the Progressive Teacher's Association. With their support, the museum opened in a garage complex that belonged to Propylaeums, a local civic club. A board of trustees was established to manage the museum and Carey was elected its first president. The early exhibits were created and donated by school children. Carey sought a larger facility and after two moves, she finally located the museum in her own mansion on Meridian Street in 1926. The same year the first curator, Arthur Carr was hired. Carr arranged Carey's specimens into exhibits and managed the museum. The first permanent exhibits were marine, Japanese, pioneer, archeology, and nature. By the 1940s, a larger staff was hired and Carr became director after Carey's 1938 death. The museum began offering guided tours to school children, organized traveling exhibits that were moved around to area schools, and began hosting events for fund raising. Early members were given a Seahorse pin to identify them as Youth members.\n\nIn 1942, Carr retired from the museum and Grace Golden became the new director. Golden sought to further expand the museum and successfully solicited grants from the Indianapolis Foundation, the Lilly Endowment, and members of the Lilly family. She also secured several important corporate sponsorships. The new revenue allowed the museum to purchase its own building, a former mansion on North Meridian Street. Golden also began a diversification of the museum's exhibits, rather than relying on local donations. She successfully created partnerships with other museums who loaned exhibits of Native American artifacts in 1947, a gallery of dinosaur skeletons in 1949, the mummy Wenuhotep was given on permanent loan from the University of Chicago in 1959, a nineteenth-century log cabin was donated in 1961, and the Hall of Man was added in 1962. Several new permanent exhibits were created during her tenure, focusing on pioneer life, natural science, and ethnography. Golden also established a Junior Docent program, created two weekly television shows for local broadcast, and began a program of interpretive activities.\n\nIn 1964, Golden resigned and was succeeded as director by Mildred Compton. Compton remained director until 1982. She created the first long-term financial plans for the museum by establishing an endowment and began advertising campaigns for donations and to increase attendance. The museum was enhanced to help it earn accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums by standardizing and cataloging its exhibits and archives and implementing conservation techniques. New permanent exhibits were obtained during Compton's tenure including the Physical Science Gallery in 1967, the Reuben Wells Steam Engine in 1968, and the Model Train Gallery in 1970.\n\nA fund raising drive held in 1973 raised $8.7 million and allowed for the construction of the current museum building. The old museum was demolished and the new one built on its site. Finished in 1976, the new museum had modern conservation and storage facilities, classrooms, the 350 seat Ruth Allison Lilly Theater, and a much larger five-floor exhibit area. New exhibits and attractions were added for the grand opening including a carousel, a simulated cavern, and a mastodon skeleton.\n\nPeter Sterling became director in 1982 and continued to pursue a growth policy for the museum. A restaurant and outdoor garden gallery was added in 1983, and in 1984, the Caplan folk art collection of 50,000 items was donated by Frank and Theresa Caplan, nearly doubling the number of items owned by the museum. The museum also undertook a $14 million, multi-phase expansion that included construction of a welcome center and atrium entrance (completed in 1983), a planetarium, and an additional exhibit hall, completed in 1988. Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III designed the four-story atrium addition. A grant from Lilly Endowment funded the construction of the Eli Lilly Center for Exploration in 1990.\n\nBy 1992, the museum was hosting 4,000 programs and activities annually and had an annual attendance of 835,000 patrons. It employed 165 full-time employees, 227 part-time employees, and 850 volunteers. Revenue in 1992 was $12.4 million.\n\nIn 1996, a 310-seat large-format theater called the CineDome was constructed adjacent to the museum. In 2004, the museum added a 950-space parking garage and the CineDome was converted to Dinosphere, which is built within and around the former CineDome. The Welcome Center was expanded again in 2009 increasing the total size of the museum to .\n\nThe museum's current CEO Jeffrey H. Patchen was hired in 1999, after serving as a Senior Program Officer at the J. Paul Getty Museum.\n\nIn 2008, the institution had revenue of $26.37 million and expenses of $26.369 million, with over half its income being supplied by the museum's endowment. The facility had more than one million visitors in 2008. Field trips from 775 schools brought more than 83,000 students to the museum during 2008. In 2010, the museum had 400 part and full-time employees. Additionally, 1,500 individuals contribute over 65,000 hours of volunteer work annually.\n\nThe museum has five floors of exhibit halls in the main building. There are several smaller structures around the main building including a planetarium, Dinosphere, a theater, and an outdoors garden gallery. In total, the museum has of floor space. The museum has a collection of over 120,000 artifacts, divided into three groups: Natural World, Cultural World, and American Collections.\n\nTo maintain a regular change in its exhibits, significant emphasis is placed on research and development. Field experts are consulted regularly to assess the exhibits and offer proposals for new ones. The museum employs many experts who are leaders in their field of study. Because of its leadership and innovations, the museum is a world leader in its field. \"Child\" and \"Parents\" magazine have both ranked the museum as the best children's museum in the United States. The \"institution is considered the gold standard of museums for children.\"\nThe museum employs a Wikipedian in Residence, appointed in August 2011, and has some QRpedia codes posted for visitors to read Wikipedia articles about objects in the collection, translated into their preferred language. QRpedia codes are located in the All Aboard! exhibit which directs users to the Reuben Wells steam engine Wikipedia article, and in the Carousel Wishes and Dreams exhibit, which links to the Broad Ripple Park Carousel article.\n\nThe main stairwell of the museum is a giant spiral ramp which allows visitors to access all five levels of the museum by strollers, wheelchairs, and walkers. In 2006, glass artist Dale Chihuly installed a four-story glass sculpture inside the central atrium of the giant spiral ramp. The sculpture is called \"Fireworks of Glass\" and is accompanied by an exhibit of Chihuly's glass blowing methods.\n\nThe National Geographic: Treasures of the Earth exhibit, which includes three areas, is located on the Lower Level of the museum and was first opened on June 11, 2011. One area contains ancient Egyptian artifacts presented in a replica of the tomb of Seti I. Another area has a simulated archeological dig where artifacts about Ying Zheng, the first Emperor of China, were discovered. The third area features artifacts retrieved from a pirate shipwreck.\n\nThe lower level also hosts a planetarium, the Lilly Theater , and an steam engine designed by Reuben Wells in 1868 to conquer Indiana’s Madison Hill. The engine is attached to a Pennsylvania Railroad caboose that visitors can find in the museum's \"All Aboard!\" Gallery.\n\nOn the main floor/ground level, the Museum has the Welcome Center with adult and juvenile Brachiosaur sculptures climbing into the front. These sculptures are physiologically accurate to current paleontological knowledge and were created by Gary Staab and painted by Brian Cooley who created the sauropod sculptures which are crashing out of the Dinosphere. Outside the museum on this level is the Seven Wonders of the World garden, a green rain garden, parking garage, and the oversize parking lot to accommodate large parties of visitors such as schools on field trips.\n\nA focal point of the ground level of the museum is North America's largest water clock, created by French physicist and artist Bernard Gitton. The main floor contains The Children's Museum toy store and food court. The volunteer center, concierge desk, and birthday party rooms are also on this level.\n\nThe museum also contains a branch of the Indianapolis Public Library called the InfoZone. During the latest expansion in 2009, this space was moved to the second floor outside of the skywalk which links the parking garage to the main building.\n\nThe second level hosts many of the museum's temporary exhibits. The only semi-permanent exhibit on the level is the \"Take Me There\" gallery. The \"Take Me There\" exhibit has its content changed periodically with a different culture represented in the space every two to three years. In 2009, the exhibit featured the culture of modern-day Egypt and is called \"Take Me There: Egypt.\" Starting from May 2014, the exhibit was changed to \"Take Me There: China.\" It features Chinese culture, such as calligraphy, medicine, and traditional instruments. Also on this floor are miniature insets depicting various rooms and their decorations. The three changeable spaces are known as Special Exhibit Galleries and they have short run exhibits that rotate.\n\nOpened in July 2012, \"Stories from our Community\" is a display that includes artifacts that illustrate stories from community members which are featured in the exhibit space. Visitors can sit at touch-screen displays and choose the stories that they would like to listen to or read. A related website is available that shares the stories on display, in addition to others.\n\nThe third level features \"\", a permanent exhibit featuring the stories of Anne Frank, Ruby Bridges, and Ryan White and the impact these children made on the world. The purpose of the Power of Children is to create a supportive environment where people can examine and discuss issues related to prejudice and discrimination and seek solutions to these problems. Historically accurate, immersive environments are recreated to reflect the place where each of the children spent their lives. First-person interpreters, live theater, and artifacts are designed to facilitate the public understanding of the lives of Frank, Bridges and White. The gallery has sounds, dramatic lighting, quotations, interactives and moving images to draw visitors into the exhibit.\n\nThe second exhibit on the third floor is \"Playscape,\" a learning and play area designed for children 5 years and younger. Originally opened in 1981, the museum carried out an extensive renovation of \"Playscape\" in 2013. The renovated gallery includes and improves upon many of the elements from the previous exhibit, such as a large sandbox area, a water play experience, and an area designated for small children 2 and younger.\n\nOne of the museum's most popular attractions is the Broad Ripple Park Carousel in the Carousel Wishes and Dreams gallery on the fourth floor. The carousel was originally built by Dentzel for an amusement park (now Broad Ripple Park) in 1917 and was restored and reinstalled in this museum in 1973. It is the largest of the museum's artifacts. The carousel is a National Historic Landmark. The music is provided by a rare Wurlitzer style #147 Military Band Organ.\n\nThe fourth level houses Science Works (formerly known as Science Spectrum), an exhibit devoted to exploring natural science and physical science through building activities. Children may build toy boats to float along the waterway, play in a construction zone, erect an arch, climb a rock wall, crawl through tunnels, observe a live pond, and participate in other activities. Within Science Works is the Biotech Lab, which hosts daily events focusing on the future of DNA and chemistry and SciencePort which focuses on plant biology.\n\nAlso located on the fourth floor, positioned at the top of the ramp, is the Ball Dollhouse.\n\nDinosphere is connected to the main museum on the Lower Level (through All Aboard), Level One (near the food court and main entrance gates), and Level Two (through The Mann Properties Gallery of Dinosaur Imagery). Dinosphere was formerly the CineDome Theater. Dinosphere features a sound and light experience that simulates a day in the late Cretaceous period 65 million years ago. The center of the exhibit space includes three themed fossil scenes. Visitors can perform fossil excavations in the Dig Site, touch a real \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" femur fossil in the Paleo Prep Lab, talk to real paleontologists, enjoy family-friendly games and touch-screen learning activities, and view numerous real dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous period on display. Dinosphere is one of the largest displays of juvenile and family dinosaur fossils in the U.S. The exhibit features several species of dinosaurs including \"Hypacrosaurus\", \"Prenoceratops\", \"Tyrannosaurus rex\", \"Triceratops\", \"Gorgosaurus\", \"Maiasaura\", \"Bambiraptor\", \"Oviraptor\", and \"Dracorex hogwartsia\". Several ancient non-dinosaur creatures are also featured, including \"Didelphodon\", \"Sarcosuchus\" (super croc), and \"Pteranodon\".\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

R. R. Tolkien, compiled and edited by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of Middle-earth as a fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions of a \"mythology for England\" through to the development of the stories that make up \"The Silmarillion\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". It is not a \"history of Middle-earth\" in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.\n\nSome of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist in the Bodleian and Marquette University libraries, and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.\n\nThe first five books track the early history of \"The Silmarillion\" and related texts. Books six to nine discuss the development of \"The Lord of the Rings\"; book nine also discusses the Númenor story in the form of The Notion Club Papers. Books ten and eleven focus on material from the \"Silmarillion\" that Tolkien worked on after \"The Lord of the Rings\" was published, including the \"Annals of Beleriand\" and the \"Annals of Aman\". Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to \"The Lord of the Rings\" and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.\n\nChristopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to \"The Hobbit\" in \"The History of Middle-earth\" because it was not originally intended to form part of the mythology, but was a children's story and originally not set in Middle-earth, but was revised during the writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\". \"The History of The Hobbit\" was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was edited by John D. Rateliff\n\n\nA combined index was published six years after the series was completed as \"The History of Middle-earth: Index\" (2002).\n\nA shorter version of volume 9, omitting material not related to \"The Lord of the Rings\", was published as \"The End of the Third Age\"; this is usually sold as a boxed set along with volumes 6, 7 and 8 as \"The History of the Lord of the Rings\".\n\n"}

In the text on its dust jacket, it bills itself as a \"comprehensive guide\" to \"pitchers, the pitches they throw, and how they throw them\".\n\n\"The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers\" is divided into three main sections. \n\nThe first section contains a series of 11 chapters dealing with eight different pitches, such as the fastball, spitball, curveball, change, slider, knuckleball, forkball, and screwball. These chapters detail such matters as the origin of these pitches, the history of their nomenclature, a description of any sub-types, and citations of different pitchers who were noted for their skill in throwing particular pitches. All but two of these chapters are credited to Neyer.\n\nThe second section is concerned with pitchers. It includes brief essays on a series of individual players: Tommy Bond, Tony Mullane, Wilbur Cooper, Eddie Rommel, Mel Harder, Lon Warneke, Tommy Bridges, Bucky Walters, Billy Pierce, and Bob Friend. These essays are followed by a \"Pitcher Census\", which occupies approximately two-thirds of the book's length. This census is a list and brief description of most of the noteworthy pitchers in both Major League Baseball and the Negro Leagues. Each pitcher's entry includes a header stating both the pitcher's physical data (height, weight, and handedness) and a listing of a few of his career statistics (won-lost record, earned run average, and saves). Below this header, Neyer and James have compiled a list of pitches known to have been thrown by that pitcher, along with one or more citations from scouting guides or media sources of the period. Some pitchers' entries also include quotes from contemporary observers and/or descriptions of the pitcher's throwing motion or career. The second section concludes with two lists: one containing all pitchers known to have thrown a knuckleball, and another for all pitchers who used a sidearm or underhand delivery.\n\nAmusingly, the book also contains entries for such \"fictional\" pitchers as Sidd Finch, Damon Rutherford (from the novel \"The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.\") and even Charlie Brown of \"Peanuts\" fame (who, the book dryly notes, \"gave up an unusual number of line drives up the middle\").\n\nThe third section contains five sabermetric essays on pitching written by James. One of these essays deals with the \"Pitcher Abuse Points\" statistic developed by Baseball Prospectus, and this essay is followed by a response by Prospectus writers Rany Jazayerli and Keith Woolner.\n\n\n"}

It is published by Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century, Prime Minister Robert Peel suggested to Alexander Macmillan (of the family publishing house) the publication of “a handbook presenting in a compact shape a picture of the actual conditions, political and social of the various states in the civilised world.”\n\nThe first volume was published for 1864. Frederick Martin was its foundational editor, and presided over the book for twenty years, during which time it became established as a leading reference work.\n\nAccording to Steinberg in 1866, the words Martin used in the preface of the first issue of the Statesman's Year-Book still applied to every volume a century later: \"The great aim has been to insure an absolute correctness of the multiplicity of facts and figures given in the Statesman's Year-Book. For this purpose, none but official documents have been consulted in the first instance, and only when these failed or were manifestly imperfect, recourse has been had to authoritative books and influential newspapers, magazines and other reliable information.\"\n\nHis successor, well-known Scottish journalist John Scott Keltie, took over in 1883. A talented author, editor and scholar and a passionate geographer, he introduced the insertion of thumbnail maps of each country and large political world maps. The cartographic illustration of networks of communication began in 1899 when two maps displayed the railways, navigable waters and telegraphic lines of Africa.\n\nAfter Scott-Keltie’s death in 1927, his sometime co-editor Mortimer Epstein took over and edited the work for over twenty years including, remarkably, during World War II when the book continued to be published yearly, despite the rationing of paper.\n\nEpstein died in 1946, and his successor Henry Steinberg was faced with the challenge of producing a new \"Statesman’s Yearbook\" for an ever-changing world, as new countries came into being and others ceased to exist. His passion for the task, sharp mind and amiable nature meant that \"The Statesman’s Yearbook\" swiftly adapted to the new world order.\n\nSteinberg continued as Editor until 1969 when his assistant, John Paxton, took over. Brian Hunter edited between 1990 and 1997 and Barry Turner took over in 1997.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30038", "title": "Thomas Henry Huxley", "text": "Thomas Henry Huxley\n\nThomas Henry Huxley (4 May 1825 – 29 June 1895) was an English biologist specialising in comparative anatomy. He is known as \"Darwin's Bulldog\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.\n\nThe stories regarding Huxley's famous debate in 1860 with Samuel Wilberforce were a key moment in the wider acceptance of evolution and in his own career, although historians think that the surviving story of the debate is a later fabrication. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of \"Vestiges\", he changed his mind and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated about whether humans were closely related to apes.\n\nHuxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as gradualism, and was undecided about natural selection, but despite this he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin. Instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain, he fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition.\n\nOriginally coining the term in 1869, Huxley elaborated on \"agnosticism\" in 1889 to frame the nature of claims in terms of what is knowable and what is not. Huxley statesAgnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle... the fundamental axiom of modern science... In matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as it will take you, without regard to any other consideration... In matters of the intellect, do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. Use of that term has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and agnosticism). Much of Huxley's agnosticism is influenced by Kantian views on human perception and the ability to rely on rational evidence rather than belief systems.\n\nHuxley had little formal schooling and was virtually self-taught. He became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the later 19th century. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between groups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially on the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing \"Archaeopteryx\" with \"Compsognathus\", he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, a theory widely accepted today.\n\nThe tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his energetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his extensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant effects on society in Britain and elsewhere.\n\nThomas Henry Huxley was born in Ealing, which was then a village in Middlesex. He was the second youngest of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers. Like some other British scientists of the nineteenth century such as Alfred Russel Wallace, Huxley was brought up in a literate middle-class family which had fallen on hard times. His father was a mathematics teacher at Ealing School until it closed, putting the family into financial difficulties. As a result, Thomas left school at age 10, after only two years of formal schooling. Huxley’s parents were Anglicans, although it was against organized religion Huxley sympathized with the town’s Nonconformist.\n\nDespite this unenviable start, Huxley was determined to educate himself. He became one of the great autodidacts of the nineteenth century. At first he read Thomas Carlyle, James Hutton's \"Geology\", and Hamilton's \"Logic\". In his teens he taught himself German, eventually becoming fluent and used by Charles Darwin as a translator of scientific material in German. He learned Latin, and enough Greek to read Aristotle in the original.\n\nLater on, as a young adult, he made himself an expert, first on invertebrates, and later on vertebrates, all self-taught. He was skilled in drawing and did many of the illustrations for his publications on marine invertebrates. In his later debates and writing on science and religion his grasp of theology was better than most of his clerical opponents. Huxley, a boy who left school at ten, became one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain.\n\nHe was apprenticed for short periods to several medical practitioners: at 13 to his brother-in-law John Cooke in Coventry, who passed him on to Thomas Chandler, notable for his experiments using mesmerism for medical purposes. Chandler's practice was in London's Rotherhithe amidst the squalor endured by the Dickensian poor. Here Thomas would have seen poverty, crime and rampant disease at its worst. Next, another brother-in-law took him on: John Salt, his eldest sister's husband. Now 16, Huxley entered Sydenham College (behind University College Hospital), a cut-price anatomy school whose founder, Marshall Hall, discovered the reflex arc. All this time Huxley continued his programme of reading, which more than made up for his lack of formal schooling.\n\nA year later, buoyed by excellent results and a silver medal prize in the Apothecaries' yearly competition, Huxley was admitted to study at Charing Cross Hospital, where he obtained a small scholarship. At Charing Cross, he was taught by Thomas Wharton Jones, Professor of Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery at University College London. Jones had been Robert Knox's assistant when Knox bought cadavers from Burke and Hare. The young Wharton Jones, who acted as go-between, was exonerated of crime, but thought it best to leave Scotland. He was a fine teacher, up-to-date in physiology and also an ophthalmic surgeon. In 1845, under Wharton Jones' guidance, Huxley published his first scientific paper demonstrating the existence of a hitherto unrecognised layer in the inner sheath of hairs, a layer that has been known since as Huxley's layer. No doubt remembering this, and of course knowing his merit, later in life Huxley organised a pension for his old tutor.\n\nAt twenty he passed his First M.B. examination at the University of London, winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology. However, he did not present himself for the final (Second M.B.) exams and consequently did not qualify with a university degree. His apprenticeships and exam results formed a sufficient basis for his application to the Royal Navy.\n\nAged 20, Huxley was too young to apply to the Royal College of Surgeons for a licence to practise, yet he was 'deep in debt'. So, at a friend's suggestion, he applied for an appointment in the Royal Navy. He had references on character and certificates showing the time spent on his apprenticeship and on requirements such as dissection and pharmacy. Sir William Burnett, the Physician General of the Navy, interviewed him and arranged for the College of Surgeons to test his competence (by means of a \"viva voce\").\n\nFinally Huxley was made Assistant Surgeon ('surgeon's mate', but in practice marine naturalist) to HMS \"Rattlesnake\", about to set sail on a voyage of discovery and surveying to New Guinea and Australia. The \"Rattlesnake\" left England on 3 December 1846 and, once they had arrived in the southern hemisphere, Huxley devoted his time to the study of marine invertebrates. He began to send details of his discoveries back to England, where publication was arranged by Edward Forbes FRS (who had also been a pupil of Knox). Both before and after the voyage Forbes was something of a mentor to Huxley.\n\nHuxley's paper \"On the anatomy and the affinities of the family of Medusae\" was published in 1849 by the Royal Society in its \"Philosophical Transactions\". Huxley united the Hydroid and Sertularian polyps with the Medusae to form a class to which he subsequently gave the name of \"Hydrozoa\". The connection he made was that all the members of the class consisted of two cell layers, enclosing a central cavity or stomach. This is characteristic of the phylum now called the \"Cnidaria\". He compared this feature to the serous and mucous structures of embryos of higher animals. When at last he got a grant from the Royal Society for the printing of plates, Huxley was able to summarise this work in \"The Oceanic Hydrozoa\", published by the Ray Society in 1859.\n\nThe value of Huxley's work was recognised and, on returning to England in 1850, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the following year, at the age of twenty-six, he not only received the Royal Society Medal but was also elected to the Council. He met Joseph Dalton Hooker and John Tyndall, who remained his lifelong friends. The Admiralty retained him as a nominal assistant-surgeon, so he might work on the specimens he collected and the observations he made during the voyage of the \"Rattlesnake\". He solved the problem of \"Appendicularia\", whose place in the animal kingdom Johannes Peter Müller had found himself wholly unable to assign. It and the Ascidians are both, as Huxley showed, tunicates, today regarded as a sister group to the vertebrates in the phylum \"Chordata\". Other papers on the morphology of the cephalopods and on brachiopods and rotifers are also noteworthy. The \"Rattlesnake\"'s official naturalist, John MacGillivray, did some work on botany, and proved surprisingly good at notating Australian aboriginal languages. He wrote up the voyage in the standard Victorian two volume format.\n\nHuxley effectively resigned from the navy (by refusing to return to active service) and, in July 1854, he became Professor of Natural History at the Royal School of Mines and naturalist to the British Geological Survey in the following year. In addition, he was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution 1855–58 and 1865–67; Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons 1863–69; President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1869–1870; President of the Quekett Microscopical Club 1878; President of the Royal Society 1883–85; Inspector of Fisheries 1881–85; and President of the Marine Biological Association 1884–1890.\n\nThe thirty-one years during which Huxley occupied the chair of natural history at the Royal School of Mines included work on vertebrate palaeontology and on many projects to advance the place of science in British life. Huxley retired in 1885, after a bout of depressive illness which started in 1884. He resigned the presidency of the Royal Society in mid-term, the Inspectorship of Fisheries, and his chair (as soon as he decently could) and took six months' leave. His pension was a fairly handsome £1200 a year.\n\nIn 1890, he moved from London to Eastbourne where he edited the nine volumes of his \"Collected Essays\". In 1894 he heard of Eugene Dubois' discovery in Java of the remains of \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" (now known as \"Homo erectus\"). Finally, in 1895, he died of a heart attack (after contracting influenza and pneumonia), and was buried in North London at St Marylebone. This small family plot had been purchased upon the death of his beloved youngest son Noel, who died of scarlet fever in 1860; Huxley's wife Henrietta Anne née Heathorn and son Noel are also buried there. No invitations were sent out, but two hundred people turned up for the ceremony; they included Joseph Dalton Hooker, William Henry Flower, Mulford B. Foster, Edwin Lankester, Joseph Lister and, apparently, Henry James.\n\nHuxley and his wife had five daughters and three sons:\n\nNoel Huxley (1856–1860), died aged 4.\nJessie Oriana Huxley (1856–1927), married architect Fred Waller in 1877.\nMarian Huxley (1859–1887), married artist John Collier in 1879.\nLeonard Huxley (1860–1933), married Julia Arnold.\nRachel Huxley (1862–1934), married civil engineer Alfred Eckersley in 1884.\nHenrietta (Nettie) Huxley (1863–1940), married Harold Roller, travelled Europe as a singer.\nHenry Huxley (1865–1946), became a fashionable general practitioner in London.\nEthel Huxley (1866–1941) married artist John Collier (widower of sister) in 1889.\n\nFrom 1870 onwards, Huxley was to some extent drawn away from scientific research by the claims of public duty. He served on eight Royal Commissions, from 1862 to 1884. From 1871 to 1880 he was a Secretary of the Royal Society and from 1883 to 1885 he was president. He was president of the Geological Society from 1868 to 1870. In 1870, he was president of the British Association at Liverpool and, in the same year was elected a member of the newly constituted London School Board. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1877 to 1879. He was the leading person amongst those who reformed the Royal Society, persuaded government about science, and established scientific education in British schools and universities. Before him, science was mostly a gentleman's occupation; after him, science was a profession.\n\nHe was awarded the highest honours then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin got the same award. He was the youngest biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards are listed in the \"Life and Letters\". He turned down many other appointments, notably the Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford and the Mastership of University College, Oxford.\n\nIn 1873 the King of Sweden made Huxley, Hooker and Tyndall Knights of the Order of the Polar Star: they could wear the insignia but not use the title in Britain. Huxley collected many honorary memberships of foreign societies, academic awards and honorary doctorates from Britain and Germany. He also became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1892.\n\nAs recognition of his many public services he was given a pension by the state, and was appointed Privy Councillor in 1892.\n\nDespite his many achievements he was given no award by the British state until late in life. In this he did better than Darwin, who got no award of any kind from the state. (Darwin's proposed knighthood was vetoed by ecclesiastical advisers, including Wilberforce) Perhaps Huxley had commented too often on his dislike of honours, or perhaps his many assaults on the traditional beliefs of organised religion made enemies in the establishment—he had vigorous debates in print with Benjamin Disraeli, William Ewart Gladstone and Arthur Balfour, and his relationship with Lord Salisbury was less than tranquil.\n\nHuxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective advocate, and for some Huxley was \"\"the\" premier advocate of science in the nineteenth century [for] the whole English-speaking world\".\n\nThough he had many admirers and disciples, his retirement and later death left British zoology somewhat bereft of leadership. He had, directly or indirectly, guided the careers and appointments of the next generation, but none were of his stature. The loss of Francis Balfour in 1882, climbing the Alps just after he was appointed to a chair at Cambridge, was a tragedy. Huxley thought he was \"the only man who can carry out my work\": the deaths of Balfour and W. K. Clifford were \"the greatest losses to science in our time\".\n\nThe first half of Huxley's career as a palaeontologist is marked by a rather strange predilection for 'persistent types', in which he seemed to argue that evolutionary advancement (in the sense of major new groups of animals and plants) was rare or absent in the Phanerozoic. In the same vein, he tended to push the origin of major groups such as birds and mammals back into the Palaeozoic era, and to claim that no order of plants had ever gone extinct.\n\nMuch paper has been consumed by historians of science ruminating on this strange and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley was wrong to pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, and he did not estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.\n\nHuxley's detailed anatomical work was, as always, first-rate and productive. His work on fossil fish shows his distinctive approach: whereas pre-Darwinian naturalists collected, identified and classified, Huxley worked mainly to reveal the evolutionary relationships between groups.\n\nThe lobed-finned fish (such as coelacanths and lung fish) have paired appendages whose internal skeleton is attached to the shoulder or pelvis by a single bone, the humerus or femur. His interest in these fish brought him close to the origin of tetrapods, one of the most important areas of vertebrate palaeontology.\n\nThe study of fossil reptiles led to his demonstrating the fundamental affinity of birds and reptiles, which he united under the title of \"Sauropsida\". His papers on \"Archaeopteryx\" and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are.\n\nApart from his interest in persuading the world that man was a primate, and had descended from the same stock as the apes, Huxley did little work on mammals, with one exception. On his tour of America Huxley was shown the remarkable series of fossil horses, discovered by O. C. Marsh, in Yale's Peabody Museum. Marsh was part palaeontologist, part robber baron, a man who had hunted buffalo and met Red Cloud (in 1874). Funded by his uncle George Peabody, Marsh had made some remarkable discoveries:\nthe huge Cretaceous aquatic bird \"Hesperornis\", and the dinosaur footprints along the Connecticut River were worth the trip by themselves, but the horse fossils were really special.\n\nThe collection at that time went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling \"Orohippus\" from the Eocene through three-toed species such as \"Miohippus\" to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes could be explained by a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.\n\nThe horse series also strongly suggested that the process was gradual, and that the origin of the modern horse lay in North America, not in Eurasia. If so, then something must have happened to horses in North America, since none were there when Europeans arrived. The experience was enough for Huxley to give credence to Darwin's gradualism, and to introduce the story of the horse into his lecture series.\n\nHuxley was originally not persuaded of \"development theory\", as evolution was once called. This can be seen in his savage review of Robert Chambers' \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\", a book which contained some quite pertinent arguments in favour of evolution. Huxley had also rejected Lamarck's theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. It was the kind of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.\n\nHuxley was therefore one of the small group who knew about Darwin's ideas before they were published (the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray. Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\" However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.\n\nLogically speaking, the prior question was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution and it was this and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that formed the basis of his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.\n\nHuxley's support started with his anonymous favourable review of the \"Origin\" in the \"Times\" for 26 December 1859, and continued with articles in several periodicals, and in a lecture at the Royal Institution in February 1860. At the same time, Richard Owen, whilst writing an extremely hostile anonymous review of the \"Origin\" in the \"Edinburgh Review\", also primed Samuel Wilberforce who wrote one in the \"Quarterly Review\", running to 17,000 words. The authorship of this latter review was not known for sure until Wilberforce's son wrote his biography. So it can be said that, just as Darwin groomed Huxley, so Owen groomed Wilberforce; and both the proxies fought public battles on behalf of their principals as much as themselves. Though we do not know the exact words of the Oxford debate, we do know what Huxley thought of the review in the \"Quarterly\":\n\nSince Lord Brougham assailed Dr Young, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most candid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as a \"flighty\" person, who endeavours \"to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation,\" and whose \"mode of dealing with nature\" is reprobated as \"utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.\"\n\nIf I confine my retrospect of the reception of the \"Origin of Species\" to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the \"Quarterly Review\" article...\n\nHuxley said \"I am Darwin's bulldog\". While the second half of Darwin's life was lived mainly within his family, the younger combative Huxley operated mainly out in the world at large. A letter from Huxley to Ernst Haeckel (2 November 1871) states: \"The dogs have been snapping at [Darwin's] heels too much of late.\" At Oxford and Cambridge Universities, \"Bulldog\" was and still is student slang for a university policeman, whose job was to corral errant students and maintain their moral rectitude.\n\nFamously, Huxley responded to Wilberforce in the debate at the British Association meeting, on Saturday 30 June 1860 at the Oxford University Museum. Huxley's presence there had been encouraged on the previous evening when he met Robert Chambers, the Scottish publisher and author of \"Vestiges\", who was walking the streets of Oxford in a dispirited state, and begged for assistance. The debate followed the presentation of a paper by John William Draper, and was chaired by Darwins's former botany tutor John Stevens Henslow. Darwin's theory was opposed by the Lord Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, and those supporting Darwin included Huxley and their mutual friends Hooker and Lubbock. The platform featured Brodie and Professor Beale, and Robert FitzRoy, who had been captain of HMS \"Beagle\" during Darwin's voyage, spoke against Darwin.\n\nWilberforce had a track record against evolution as far back as the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' \"Vestiges\". For the more challenging task of opposing the \"Origin\", and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen – Owen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his \"Quarterly Review\" article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the exact wording is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.\n\nThe letters of Alfred Newton include one to his brother giving an eye-witness account of the debate, and written less than a month afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought \"he\" had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley got much the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.\n\nOne effect of the debate was to increase hugely Huxley's visibility amongst educated people, through the accounts in newspapers and periodicals. Another consequence was to alert him to the importance of public debate: a lesson he never forgot. A third effect was to serve notice that Darwinian ideas could not be easily dismissed: on the contrary, they would be vigorously defended against orthodox authority. A fourth effect was to promote professionalism in science, with its implied need for scientific education. A fifth consequence was indirect: as Wilberforce had feared, a defence of evolution did undermine literal belief in the Old Testament, especially the Book of Genesis. Many of the liberal clergy at the meeting were quite pleased with the outcome of the debate; they were supporters, perhaps, of the controversial \"Essays and Reviews\". Thus both on the side of science, and on the side of religion, the debate was important, and its outcome significant. (see also below)\n\nThat Huxley and Wilberforce remained on courteous terms after the debate (and able to work together on projects such as the Metropolitan Board of Education) says something about both men, whereas Huxley and Owen were never reconciled.\n\nFor nearly a decade his work was directed mainly to the relationship of man to the apes. This led him directly into a clash with Richard Owen, a man widely disliked for his behaviour whilst also being admired for his capability. The struggle was to culminate in some severe defeats for Owen. Huxley's Croonian Lecture, delivered before the Royal Society in 1858 on \"The Theory of the Vertebrate Skull\" was the start. In this, he rejected Owen's theory that the bones of the skull and the spine were homologous, an opinion previously held by Goethe and Lorenz Oken.\n\nFrom 1860–63 Huxley developed his ideas, presenting them in lectures to working men, students and the general public, followed by publication. Also in 1862 a series of talks to working men was printed lecture by lecture as pamphlets, later bound up as a little green book; the first copies went on sale in December. Other lectures grew into Huxley's most famous work \"Evidence as to Man's place in Nature\" (1863) where he addressed the key issues long before Charles Darwin published his \"Descent of Man\" in 1871.\n\nAlthough Darwin did not publish his \"Descent of Man\" until 1871, the general debate on this topic had started years before (there was even a precursor debate in the 18th century between Monboddo and Buffon). Darwin had dropped a hint when, in the conclusion to the \"Origin\", he wrote: \"In the distant future... light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history\". Not so distant, as it turned out. A key event had already occurred in 1857 when Richard Owen presented (to the Linnean Society) his theory that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus \"Homo\". Having reached this opinion, Owen separated man from all other mammals in a subclass of its own. No other biologist held such an extreme view. Darwin reacted \"Man...as distinct from a chimpanzee [as] an ape from a platypus... I cannot swallow that!\" Neither could Huxley, who was able to demonstrate that Owen's idea was completely wrong.\nThe subject was raised at the 1860 BA Oxford meeting, when Huxley flatly contradicted Owen, and promised a later demonstration of the facts. In fact, a number of demonstrations were held in London and the provinces. In 1862 at the Cambridge meeting of the B.A. Huxley's friend William Flower gave a public dissection to show that the same structures (the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor) were indeed present in apes. The debate was widely publicised, and parodied as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\". It was seen as one of Owen's greatest blunders, revealing Huxley as not only dangerous in debate, but also a better anatomist.\n\nOwen conceded that there was something that could be called a hippocampus minor in the apes, but stated that it was much less developed and that such a presence did not detract from the overall distinction of simple brain size.\n\nHuxley's ideas on this topic were summed up in January 1861 in the first issue (new series) of his own journal, the \"Natural History Review\": \"the most violent scientific paper he had ever composed\". This paper was reprinted in 1863 as chapter 2 of \"Man's Place in Nature\", with an addendum giving his account of the Owen/Huxley controversy about the ape brain. In his \"Collected Essays\" this addendum was removed.\n\nThe extended argument on the ape brain, partly in debate and partly in print, backed by dissections and demonstrations, was a landmark in Huxley's career. It was highly important in asserting his dominance of comparative anatomy, and in the long run more influential in establishing evolution amongst biologists than was the debate with Wilberforce. It also marked the start of Owen's decline in the esteem of his fellow biologists.\n\nThe following was written by Huxley to Rolleston before the BA meeting in 1861:\n\nDuring those years there was also work on human fossil anatomy and anthropology. In 1862 he examined the Neanderthal skull-cap, which had been discovered in 1857. It was the first pre-\"sapiens\" discovery of a fossil man, and it was immediately clear to him that the brain case was surprisingly large.\n\nPerhaps less productive was his work on physical anthropology, a topic which fascinated the Victorians. Huxley classified the human races into nine categories, and discussed them under four headings as: Australoid, Negroid, Xanthocroic and Mongoloid types. Such classifications depended mainly on appearance and anatomical characteristics.\n\nHuxley was certainly not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, so there was a difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best way to explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.\n\nHuxley's reservations on natural selection were of the type \"until selection and breeding can be seen to give rise to varieties which are infertile with each other, natural selection cannot be proved\". Huxley's position on selection was agnostic; yet he gave no credence to any other theory. Despite this concern about evidence, Huxley saw that if evolution came about through variation, reproduction and selection then other things would also be subject to the same pressures. This included ideas because they are invented, imitated and selected by humans: ‘The struggle for existence holds as much in the intellectual as in the physical world. A theory is a species of thinking, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting extinction by its rivals.’ This is the same idea as meme theory put forward by Richard Dawkins in 1976.\n\nDarwin's part in the discussion came mostly in letters, as was his wont, along the lines: \"The empirical evidence you call for is both impossible in practical terms, and in any event unnecessary. It's the same as asking to see every step in the transformation (or the splitting) of one species into another. My way so many issues are clarified and problems solved; no other theory does nearly so well\".\n\nHuxley's reservation, as Helena Cronin has so aptly remarked, was contagious: \"it spread itself for years among all kinds of doubters of Darwinism\". One reason for this doubt was that comparative anatomy could address the question of descent, \"but not the question of mechanism\".\n\nHuxley was a pallbearer at the funeral of Charles Darwin on 26 April 1882.\n\nIn November 1864, Huxley succeeded in launching a dining club, the X Club, composed of like-minded people working to advance the cause of science; not surprisingly, the club consisted of most of his closest friends. There were nine members, who decided at their first meeting that there should be no more. The members were: Huxley, John Tyndall, J. D. Hooker, John Lubbock (banker, biologist and neighbour of Darwin), Herbert Spencer (social philosopher and sub-editor of the Economist), William Spottiswoode (mathematician and the Queen's Printer), Thomas Hirst (Professor of Physics at University College London), Edward Frankland (the new Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution) and George Busk, zoologist and palaeontologist (formerly surgeon for HMS \"Dreadnought\"). All except Spencer were Fellows of the Royal Society. Tyndall was a particularly close friend; for many years they met regularly and discussed issues of the day. On more than one occasion Huxley joined Tyndall in the latter's trips into the Alps and helped with his investigations in glaciology.\n\nThere were also some quite significant X-Club satellites such as William Flower and George Rolleston, (Huxley protegés), and liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster. Guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time.\n\nThey would dine early on first Thursdays at a hotel, planning what to do; high on the agenda was to change the way the Royal Society Council did business. It was no coincidence that the Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.\n\nThe next step was to acquire a journal to spread their ideas. This was the weekly \"Reader\", which they bought, revamped and redirected. Huxley had already become part-owner of the \"Natural History Review\" bolstered by the support of Lubbock, Rolleston, Busk and Carpenter (X-clubbers and satellites). The journal was switched to pro-Darwinian lines and relaunched in January 1861. After a stream of good articles the \"NHR\" failed after four years; but it had helped at a critical time for the establishment of evolution. The \"Reader\" also failed, despite its broader appeal which included art and literature as well as science. The periodical market was quite crowded at the time, but most probably the critical factor was Huxley's time; he was simply over-committed, and could not afford to hire full-time editors. This occurred often in his life: Huxley took on too many ventures, and was not so astute as Darwin at getting others to do work for him.\n\nHowever, the experience gained with the \"Reader\" was put to good use when the X Club put their weight behind the founding of \"Nature\" in 1869. This time no mistakes were made: above all there was a permanent editor (though not full-time), Norman Lockyer, who served until 1919, a year before his death. In 1925, to celebrate his centenary, \"Nature\" issued a supplement devoted to Huxley.\n\nThe peak of the X Club's influence was from 1873 to 1885 as Hooker, Spottiswoode and Huxley were Presidents of the Royal Society in succession. Spencer resigned in 1889 after a dispute with Huxley over state support for science. After 1892 it was just an excuse for the surviving members to meet. Hooker died in 1911, and Lubbock (now Lord Avebury) was the last surviving member.\n\nHuxley was also an active member of the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and expanded to include all kinds of opinions. Tyndall and Huxley later joined The Club (founded by Dr. Johnson) when they could be sure that Owen would not turn up.\n\nWhen Huxley himself was young there were virtually no degrees in British universities in the biological sciences and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. When he retired there were established chairs in biological disciplines in most universities, and a broad consensus on the curricula to be followed. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation.\n\nIn the early 1870s the Royal School of Mines moved to new quarters in South Kensington; ultimately it would become one of the constituent parts of Imperial College London. The move gave Huxley the chance to give more prominence to laboratory work in biology teaching, an idea suggested by practice in German universities. In the main, the method was based on the use of carefully chosen types, and depended on the dissection of anatomy, supplemented by microscopy, museum specimens and some elementary physiology at the hands of Foster.\n\nThe typical day would start with Huxley lecturing at 9am, followed by a program of laboratory work supervised by his demonstrators. Huxley's demonstrators were picked men—all became leaders of biology in Britain in later life, spreading Huxley's ideas as well as their own. Michael Foster became Professor of Physiology at Cambridge; E. Ray Lankester became Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College London (1875–91), Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Oxford (1891–98) and Director of the Natural History Museum (1898–1907); S.H. Vines became Professor of Botany at Cambridge; W.T. Thiselton-Dyer became Hooker's successor at Kew (he was already Hooker's son-in-law!); T. Jeffery Parker became Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at University College, Cardiff; and William Rutherford became the Professor of Physiology at Edinburgh. William Flower, Conservator to the Hunterian Museum, and THH's assistant in many dissections, became Sir William Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and, later, Director of the Natural History Museum. It's a remarkable list of disciples, especially when contrasted with Owen who, in a longer professional life than Huxley, left no disciples at all. \"No one fact tells so strongly against Owen... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower\".\n\nHuxley's courses for students were so much narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: \"The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism\"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said \"Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices\". E.W MacBride said \"Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes.\n\nThis largely morphological program of comparative anatomy remained at the core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. It is an interesting fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution (Darwin, Wallace, Fritz Müller, Henry Bates) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.\n\nSince Darwin, Wallace and Bates did not hold teaching posts at any stage of their adult careers (and Műller never returned from Brazil) the imbalance in Huxley's program went uncorrected. It is surely strange that Huxley's courses did not contain an account of the evidence collected by those naturalists of life in the tropics; evidence which they had found so convincing, and which caused their views on evolution by natural selection to be so similar. Desmond suggests that \"[biology] had to be simple, synthetic and assimilable [because] it was to train teachers and had no other heuristic function\". That must be part of the reason; indeed it does help to explain the stultifying nature of much school biology. But zoology as taught at all levels became far too much the product of one man.\n\nHuxley was comfortable with comparative anatomy, at which he was the greatest master of the day. He was not an all-round naturalist like Darwin, who had shown clearly enough how to weave together detailed factual information and subtle arguments across the vast web of life. Huxley chose, in his teaching (and to some extent in his research) to take a more straightforward course, concentrating on his personal strengths.\n\nHuxley was also a major influence in the direction taken by British schools: in November 1870 he was voted onto the London School Board. In primary schooling, he advocated a wide range of disciplines, similar to what is taught today: reading, writing, arithmetic, art, science, music, etc. In secondary education he recommended two years of basic liberal studies followed by two years of some upper-division work, focusing on a more specific area of study. A practical example of the latter is his famous 1868 lecture \"On a Piece of Chalk\" which was first published as an essay in \"Macmillan's Magazine\" in London later that year. The piece reconstructs the geological history of Britain from a simple piece of chalk and demonstrates science as \"organized common sense\".\n\nHuxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. This may seem out of step with his agnostic convictions, but he believed that the Bible's significant moral teachings and superb use of language were relevant to English life. \"I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches\".\nHowever, what Huxley proposed was to create an \"edited version\" of the Bible, shorn of \"shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe\". The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said \"I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools\". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.\n\nIt may be right to see Huxley's life and work as contributing to the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said \"It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems\"  — and Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain. Some modern Christian apologists consider Huxley the father of antitheism, though he himself maintained that he was an agnostic, not an atheist. He was, however, a lifelong and determined opponent of almost all organised religion throughout his life, especially the \"Roman Church... carefully calculated for the destruction of all that is highest in the moral nature, in the intellectual freedom, and in the political freedom of mankind\". In the same line of thought, in an article in \"Popular Science\", Huxley used the expression \"the so-called Christianity of Catholicism,\" explaining: \"I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.\"\n\nIn 1893, during preparation for the second Romanes Lecture, Huxley expressed his disappointment at the shortcomings of 'liberal' theology, describing its doctrines as 'popular illusions', and the teachings they replaced 'faulty as they are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth'.\n\nVladimir Lenin remarked (in \"Materialism and empirio-criticism\") \"In Huxley's case... agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism\" (see also the Debate with Wilberforce above).\n\nHuxley's interest in education went still further than school and university classrooms; he made a great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, many of which were published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly to reach out to the literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the \"Westminster Review\", the \"Saturday Review\", the \"Reader\", the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", \"Macmillan's Magazine\", the \"Contemporary Review\". Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.\n\nIn 1868 Huxley became Principal of the South London Working Men's College in Blackfriars Road. The moving spirit was a portmanteau worker, Wm. Rossiter, who did most of the work; the funds were put up mainly by F.D. Maurice's Christian Socialists. At sixpence for a course and a penny for a lecture by Huxley, this was some bargain; and so was the free library organised by the college, an idea which was widely copied. Huxley thought, and said, that the men who attended were as good as any country squire.\n\nThe technique of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which were sold to the general public was extremely effective. A good example was \"The physical basis of life\", a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme — that vital action is nothing more than \"the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it\" — shocked the audience, though that was nothing compared to the uproar when it was published in the \"Fortnightly Review\" for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said \"No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation\". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; \"Punch\" added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.\n\nThe topic had been stimulated by Huxley seeing the cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells, which is indeed a sensational sight. For these audiences Huxley's claim that this activity should not be explained by words such as vitality, but by the working of its constituent chemicals, was surprising and shocking. Today we would perhaps emphasise the extraordinary structural arrangement of those chemicals as the key to understanding what cells do, but little of that was known in the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen the Archbishop of York thought this 'new philosophy' was based on Auguste Comte's positivism, Huxley corrected him: \"Comte's philosophy [is just] Catholicism minus Christianity\" (Huxley 1893 vol 1 of Collected Essays \"Methods & Results\" 156). A later version was \"[positivism is] sheer Popery with M. Comte in the chair of St Peter, and with the names of the saints changed\". (lecture on \"The scientific aspects of positivism\" Huxley 1870 \"Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews\" p. 149). Huxley's dismissal of positivism damaged it so severely that Comte's ideas withered in Britain.\n\nDuring his life, and especially in the last ten years after retirement, Huxley wrote on many issues relating to the humanities.\n\nPerhaps the best known of these topics is \"Evolution and Ethics\", which deals with the question of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy. Both Huxley and his grandson Julian Huxley gave Romanes Lectures on this theme. For a start, Huxley dismisses religion as a source of moral authority. Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore inherited.\n\nDespite this, the \"details\" of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly determined by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the \"struggle for existence\": \"Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture.\" It is therefore our responsibility to make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend Herbert Spencer.\n\nHuxley's dissection of Rousseau's views on man and society is another example of his later work. The essay undermines Rousseau's ideas on man as a preliminary to undermining his ideas on the ownership of property. Characteristic is: \"The doctrine that all men are, in any sense, or have been, at any time, free and equal, is an utterly baseless fiction.\"\n\nHuxley's method of argumentation (his strategy and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much studied. His career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions and other public bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies.\n\nHuxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions (titles somewhat shortened here). The Royal Commission is the senior investigative forum in the British constitution. A rough analysis shows that five commissions involved science and scientific education; three involved medicine and three involved fisheries. Several involve difficult ethical and legal issues. All deal with possible changes to law and/or administrative practice.\n\n\n\nIn 1855, he married Henrietta Anne Heathorn (1825–1915), an English émigrée whom he had met in Sydney. They kept correspondence until he was able to send for her. They had five daughters and three sons:\n\n\nHuxley's relationships with his relatives and children were genial by the standards of the day—so long as they lived their lives in an honourable manner, which some did not. After his mother, his eldest sister Lizzie was the most important person in his life until his own marriage. He remained on good terms with his children, more than can be said of many Victorian fathers. This excerpt from a letter to Jessie, his eldest daughter is full of affection:\n\nHuxley's descendants include children of Leonard Huxley:\n\n\nOther significant descendants of Huxley, such as Sir Crispin Tickell, are treated in the Huxley family.\n\nBiographers have sometimes noted the occurrence of mental illness in the Huxley family. His father became \"sunk in worse than childish imbecility of mind\", and later died in Barming Asylum; brother George suffered from \"extreme mental anxiety\" and died in 1863 leaving serious debts. Brother James, a well known psychiatrist and Superintendent of Kent County Asylum, was at 55 \"as near mad as any sane man can be\"; and there is more. His favourite daughter, the artistically talented Mady (Marian), who became the first wife of artist John Collier, was troubled by mental illness for years. She died of pneumonia in her mid-twenties.\n\nAbout Huxley himself we have a more complete record. As a young apprentice to a medical practitioner, aged thirteen or fourteen, Huxley was taken to watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though Huxley ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Bibby and others may be right to suspect that emotional shock precipitated the depression. Huxley recuperated on a farm, looking thin and ill.\n\nThe next episode we know of in Huxley's life when he suffered a debilitating depression was on the third voyage of HMS \"Rattlesnake\" in 1848. Huxley had further periods of depression at the end of 1871, and again in 1873. Finally, in 1884 he sank into another depression, and this time it precipitated his decision to retire in 1885, at the age of only 60. This is enough to indicate the way depression (or perhaps a moderate bi-polar disorder) interfered with his life, yet unlike some of the other family members, he was able to function extremely well at other times.\n\nThe problems continued sporadically into the third generation. Two of Leonard's sons suffered serious depression: Trevennen committed suicide in 1914 and Julian suffered a breakdown in 1913, and five more later in life.\n\nDarwin's ideas and Huxley's controversies gave rise to many cartoons and satires. It was the debate about man's place in nature that roused such widespread comment: cartoons are so numerous as to be almost impossible to count; Darwin's head on a monkey's body is one of the visual clichés of the age. The \"Great Hippocampus Question\" attracted particular attention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "20119302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20119302", "title": "Threefold death", "text": "Threefold death\n\nThe threefold death, which is suffered by kings, heroes, and gods, is a putatively Proto-Indo-European theme, reconstructed from medieval accounts of Celtic and Germanic mythology and archaeologically attested from ancient bodies such as Lindow Man.\n\nSome proponents of the trifunctional hypothesis distinguish two types of threefold deaths in Indo-European myth and ritual. In the first type of threefold death, one person dies simultaneously in three ways. He dies by hanging (or strangulation or falling from a tree), by drowning (or poison), and by wounding. These three deaths are foretold, and are often punishment for an offense against the three functions of Indo-European society. The second form of the threefold death is split into three distinct parts; these distinct deaths are sacrifices to three distinct gods of the three functions.\n\nIn Welsh legend, Myrddin Wyllt (one of the sources for Merlin of Arthurian legend) is associated with threefold death. As a test of his skill, Merlin is asked to prophesy how a boy will die. He says the boy will fall from a rock. The same boy, with a change of clothes, is presented again, and Merlin prophesies that he will hang. Then, dressed in a girl's clothes, the boy is presented, and Merlin replies, \"Woman or no, he will drown.\" As a young man, the victim, in a hunt, falls from a rock, is caught in a tree, and hanging head down in a lake, drowns.\n\nMyrddin Wyllt also reportedly prophesied his own death, which would happen by falling, stabbing, and drowning. This was fulfilled when a gang of jeering shepherds drove him off a cliff, where he was impaled on a stake left by fishermen, and died with his head below water.\n\nThe Norse god Odin is also associated with the threefold death. Human sacrifices to Odin were hanged from trees. Odin is said to have hanged himself in order to learn the secrets of magic.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of this threefold death in three separate sacrifices comes to us from Lucan In his epic poem, \"Pharsalia\", which relates Caesar's conquest of Gaul, he describes a set of three Celtic gods who receive human sacrifices:\n\"et quibus inmitis placatur sanguine diro/ Teutates horrensque feris altaribus Esus/ et Taranis Scythicae non mitior ara Dianae.\" (\"To whom they appease with cruel blood, harsh Teutates, and wild, bristling Esus, and Taranis whose altar is as insatiable as that of Scythian Diana.\") \n\nOne of the marginal notes in a 10th-century manuscript of the \"Pharsalia\", known as the \"Commenta Bernensia\" is highly important for an understanding of how these lines relate to Proto-Indo-European culture. “The later... scholiasts... elaborate on Lucan: they elicit the information that Taranis was propitiated by burning, Teutates by drowning, and Esus by means of suspending his victims from trees and ritually wounding them” \nThis scholium is of huge significance to understanding whether this text contains evidence of the threefold death in Celtic worship. It is a distinctive detail, and it matches closely with numerous other details that relate to ritual practice in Indo-European society.\n\nIn recent years an Indo-European pattern of threefold death has\n\nEvans goes on to cite numerous stories from various Indo-European societies. All of these stories he tells contain this theme of a tripartite death. He argues, following Dumezil, that three distinct methods of sacrifice, corresponding to the three functional deities, was an important Proto-Indo-European ritual.\n\nThere are a number of stories in Celtic mythology that clearly are formed by the Tripartite functions of Proto-Indo-European. The theme of triple-death occurs in several places in medieval Celtic sources. The first story comes from the \"Life of St. Columba\" (\"Vita Columbae\"):\n\nAedh, surnamed the Black, descended of a royal family, and a Cruthinian by race. Aedh wore the clerical habit, and came with the purpose of residing with him in the monastery for some years. Now this Aedh the Black had been a very bloodthirsty man, and cruelly murdered many persons, amongst others Diarmuid, son of Cerbul, by divine appointment king of all. This same Aedh, then, after spending some time in his retirement, was irregularly ordained priest by a bishop invited for the purpose... The bishop, however, would not venture to lay a hand upon his head unless Findchan, who was greatly attached to Aedh in a carnal way, should first place his right hand on his head as a mark of approval. When such an ordination afterwards became known to the saint, he was deeply grieved, and in consequence forthwith pronounced this fearful sentence on the ill-fated Findchan and Aedh... And Aedh, thus irregularly ordained, shall return as a dog to his vomit, and be again a bloody murderer, until at length, pierced in the neck with a spear, he shall fall from a tree into the water and be drowned... But Aedh the Black, a priest only in name, betaking himself again to his former evil doings, and being treacherously wounded with a spear, fell from the prow of a boat into a lake and was drowned.\n\nThis story of triple-death corresponds to the elements which Evans finds in a whole host of similar stories. In all of these stories, the tripartite death is foretold. Here St. Columba foretells the triple death of Aedh. At the same time Columba's prophecy is a curse or a punishment which he dispenses to Aedh because of his sins. This leads to the next element common in many 'Triple-death' stories, the sins of the warrior. According to Dumezil, the warrior often commits a sin against each one of the functions. He is punished for each sin, with a punishment fitting for his crime. In this passage from the \"Life of St. Columba\", three specific sins are mentioned. Aedh blasphemes by being ordained a priest outside of the Church. This is a sin against the priestly function of Indo-European society. Aedh's second sin is murder; he has killed numerous people, most notably King Diarmuid. This is a sin against the warrior function. Aedh's last sin is against the productive/fertile function in Indo-European society, he has slept with another man—an act which is by its very nature unfertile.\n\nThe Tripartite death of Aedh is linked with another story of triple-death. Diarmuid, who is killed by Aedh, also dies a triple death:\n\nWhen the king sent men to arrest Aedh, St. Ronan hid him and so Diarmuid had Ronan arrested and tried in his stead. He was condemned by the ecclasiastics for this act and Ronan himself uttered the famous curse, 'Desolate be Tara forever!' Soon after, Tara was abandoned, never to achieve its former splendor... [Diarmuid's wife] had an affair with Flann, so Diarmuid had Flann's fortress burnt over his head. Sorely wounded, Flann tried to escape the flames by crawling into a vat of water where he drowned... Bec Mac De [Diarmuid's druid councilor] prophesied that Diarmuid would be killed by Flann's kinsman, Aedh Dubh in the house of Banban... The manner of his death would be by slaughter, by burning, by drowning and by the ridge pole of a roof falling on his head... The Prophecy seemed so unlikely that Diarmuid scorned it, even when Banban invited him to a feast... Aedh Dubh was there and stabbed the High King with his spear. Wounded, Diarmuid fled back into the house. Aedh Dubh's men set fire to it. Seeking to escape the flame, Diarmuid scrambled into a vat of ale. A burning ridge pole fell on to his head. The prophecy was fulfilled (Ellis, 84).\n\nBoth of the elements which Evans discusses are present in this story of Diarmuid's death. In this story, there is a prophecy of the threefold death before it occurs. In fact, Diarmuid's death is foretold by three different men in the original story. Diarmuid has also clearly violated two of the three functions. He sins against the sanctity of the priestly function, by trying St. Ronan. For this crime Ronan curses the throne at Tara. Diarmuid also murders Flann, a violation of the warrior function. Diarmuid is punished for his transgressions by the triple nature of his death.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture\" cites several more examples of Indo-European myths that evidence a \"conjunction of trifunctional signs and death-modes\":\n\nThe tarot card known as The Hanged Man is sometimes identified with Odin and with the threefold death.\n\nAlfred Dieck claimed a high number of up to 1,860 known bog bodies in Europe. Archaeologist Don Brothwell considers that many of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. \nThe study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, have contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques such as computer tomography (CT) scans has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27 bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4th centuries. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.\n\nThe physical evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it does not explain why he was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st century AD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In the later half of the 20th century, it was a common assumption that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were ritualistic in nature. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.\n\nAccording to Brothwell, it is one of the most complex examples of \"overkill\" in a bog body, and possibly has ritual meaning as it was \"extravagant\" for a straightforward murder or perfunctory execution. Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice, although there is division in the academic community over this issue and in the case of Lindow Man, whether the killing was murder or ritualistic is still debated. Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the \"triple death\" (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to several different gods. The wide date range for Lindow Man's death (2 BC to 119 AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s AD. As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice, this opens up other possibilities; this was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death. Connolly suggests that as Lindow Man was found naked, he could have been the victim of a violent robbery. Joy said, \"The jury really is still out on these bodies, whether they were aristocrats, priests, criminals, outsiders, whether they went willingly to their deaths or whether they were executed – but Lindow was a very remote place in those days, an unlikely place for an ambush or a murder\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3221635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3221635", "title": "True name", "text": "True name\n\nA true name is a name of a thing or being that expresses, or is somehow identical to, its true nature. The notion that language, or some specific sacred language, refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophical study as well as various traditions of magic, religious invocation and mysticism (mantras) since antiquity.\n\nThe true name of the Egyptian sun god Ra was revealed to Isis through an elaborate trick. This gave Isis complete power over Ra and allowed her to put her son Horus on the throne.\n\nSocrates in Plato's \"Cratylus\" considers, without taking a position, the possibility whether names are \"conventional\" or \"natural\" (\"true name\" [τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ὄνομα]), that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify (this anti-conventionalist position is called Cratylism).\n\nHellenistic Judaism emphasized the divine nature of \"logos\", later adopted by the Gospel of John. The true name of God plays a central role in Kabbalism (see Gematria, Temurah, YHWH [the tetragrammaton]) and to some extent in Sufism (see 100th name of God).\nThe ancient Jews considered God's true name so potent that its invocation conferred upon the speaker tremendous power over His creations. To prevent abuse of this power, as well as to avoid blasphemy, the name of God was always taboo, and increasingly disused so that by the time of Jesus their High Priest was supposedly the only individual who spoke it aloud — and then only in the Holy of Holies upon the Day of Atonement.\n\nAlso in a Biblical context, in the tale of Jacob's nocturnal wrestling with an anonymous angel, the angel refuses to reveal his own name to Jacob even after the angel's submission at dawn. Thereafter Jacob obtains a new name which signifies his successful struggle to God and man, and names the place to commemorate his surviving an encounter with the Divine.\n\nContemporary pre-industrial peoples guard secret names which are only used in solemn rituals. These names are never mentioned and kept from general knowledge.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as \"Alter\" (, literally \"old\"), or \"Alterke\", the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. \n\nWhen captured by Polyphemus, Homer's Odysseus is careful not to reveal his name; when asked for it, Odysseus tells the giant that he is \"Οὖτις\", which means \"nobody\". But later, having escaped after blinding Polyphemus and thinking himself beyond Polyphemus' power, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of hubris that was to cause enormous problems later. Knowing his name, Polyphemus was able to call upon Odysseus the revenge of his father, the god Poseidon. Many later episodes of the Odyssey depict Odysseus facing the relentless hostility of Poseidon - which he could have avoided had he persisted in keeping his real name secret. \nAccording to practises in folklore, referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being magically. It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales, such as in the German fairytale of \"Rumpelstiltskin\": within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.\n\nA legend of Saint Olaf recounts how a troll built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods. Similarly, the belief that children who were not baptised at birth were in particular danger of having the fairies kidnap them and leave changelings in their place may stem from their unnamed state. In the Scandinavian variants of the ballad \"Earl Brand\", the hero can defeat all his enemies until the heroine, running away with him, pleads with him by name to spare her youngest brother.\n\nIn Scandinavian beliefs, more magical beasts, such as the Nix, could be defeated by calling their name. For the same reason significant objects in Germanic mythology, which were considered to have some kind of intrinsic personality, had their own names too, for example the legendary Sword Balmung.\n\nMedieval beliefs about witchcraft indicated that the Devil baptized witches with a new, secret name.\n\nIn the folklore of Northern England, there was the belief that a boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n\nGiacomo Puccini used a similar theme in the opera Turandot. The plot turns on whether or not Princess Turandot could learn the name of her unwanted suitor. If she does, she could execute him; if she doesn't, she would have to marry him.\n\nThe term \"true name\" is sometimes used in cryptography and computer security to refer to a name that is assumed to uniquely identify a principal in a global namespace (for example, an X.500 or X.509 Distinguished name). This usage is often critical, with the implication that use of true names is difficult to enforce and unwise to rely on. \n\nIn fantasy where magic works by evoking true names, characters often go to great lengths to conceal their true names. In some settings, such as Ursula K. Le Guin's \"Earthsea\", this is true for all beings. In others, as in Larry Niven's \"The Magic Goes Away\", it applies only to those of magical inclination, as where a wizard is revived from the dead only by another who found his name, and even then only with great difficulty. Finding a true name may require arcane procedures. In \"Earthsea\", a wizard must listen for and give the hero his true name; this is performed in both Le Guin's \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" and \"The Tombs of Atuan\".\n\n\nA character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life. In Hayao Miyazaki's movie \"Spirited Away\", the witch who runs the bathhouse, Yubaba, ensures loyalty by stealing the names of her subjects. For example, one of the witch's most loyal subjects, the spirit of the Kohaku River, has his name taken and is given a slave name: Haku. He forgets his name, and it is in this way 'taken' from him; he warns Chihiro Ogino against the dangers of forgetting her own name. She frees him when she recognises him and he then remembers and 'takes back' his name and is freed from the clutches of the witch.\n\nIn the cyberpunk genre following Vernor Vinge's 1981 \"True Names\" and the work of William Gibson, much of the plot involved interactions between people's virtual selves in cyberspace. Learning a fellow hacker's real-world name (i.e., their \"true name\") could allow you to turn them in to the government or otherwise blackmail them, conveying a kind of power that could be considered analogous to the equivalent concept of myth and legend.\n\n"}

{"id": "39256445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39256445", "title": "Uncle Grandpa", "text": "Uncle Grandpa\n\nUncle Grandpa is an American animated television series created by Peter Browngardt. The series ran on Cartoon Network from September 2, 2013 to June 30, 2017. It is based on Browngardt's animated short of the same name from \"The Cartoonstitute\". \"Uncle Grandpa\" is also a spin-off of \"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\", which was in turn a spin-off of the Cartoonstitute short. It is produced by Cartoon Network Studios.\n\nThe show is a surreal action-adventure comedy that relies extensively on visual gags and catchphrases. Creator Pete Browngardt has cited the work of cartoonists Don Martin, Gary Larson and Robert Crumb, as well as Golden Age-era animators such as Tex Avery and Max Fleischer when it came to developing the style of the show. Each 11-minute episode is presented in a unique format, consisting of a main seven- to nine-minute story, some short bumpers typically composed of a quick visual joke, and an original short that focuses on the show's side-characters.\n\nCartoon Network renewed the series for the fourth and fifth seasons: first splitting the second season (of 52 episodes) into two halves, which respectively became the second and third season, then also dividing in half the already announced third season into the fourth and fifth season (of 26 and 23 episodes, respectively), which served as the final seasons.\nThe \"Uncle Grandpa\" pilot was created by former \"Chowder\" storyboard artist Peter Browngardt, who first pitched the idea to Cartoon Network in 2006. Browngardt, who grew up the youngest in a large family of eight children (his eldest brother Tom would go on to work as the show's film editor), based the character upon the various and often eccentric relatives who would often drop by and visit them, as well as aspects of his own personality. The style of the show was inspired by his love of comics and Warner Bros. cartoons. The pilot was produced in 2008, but aired online in 2009 on Cartoon Network Video as part of \"The Cartoonstitute\". Akin to the \"Regular Show\" pilot, the \"Uncle Grandpa\" pilot was successful, but it had yet to have been green-lit into its own series. \n\nIn 2011, the TV series \"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" (based on the creatures that appear in the original short) aired on Cartoon Network, but was not as well-received as the other \"Cartoon Network\" series at the time, and was eventually put on hiatus in February 2012. Despite the failure, \"Secret Mountain Fort Awesome\" went on to win several awards, including the coveted Crystal Award for \"Best Television Production\" at Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the first US-based production to do so. This helped boost Browngardt's profile in getting \"Uncle Grandpa\" greenlit as a series. Finally, another factor that has contributed to the launch of the show was the redesign of the character by John Kricfalusi, \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\"s creator.\n\nOn July 27 and 28, 2013, Cartoon Network aired a sneak peek of the series as part of Big Fan Weekend, along with \"Clarence\" and \"Steven Universe\".\n\nUncle Grandpa, the magical uncle and grandpa who is the uncle-grandpa and brother-dad of every child and adult in the world, stops by children's houses every day to see how they are doing. The children he visits have a problem of their own and Uncle Grandpa tries to help them through a series of chaotic and surreal misadventures. He is a clowny sort of person who sometimes eats inedible objects (paper, and mostly books). He drives/lives in a recreational vehicle (RV) and is accompanied by a red talking fanny pack named Belly Bag, an anthropomorphic dinosaur named Mr. Gus, a photo cutout of a tiger named Giant Realistic Flying Tiger, and a talking pizza slice named Pizza Steve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first-season episode \"Christmas Special\" was aired on December 2014. A double-length Christmas special, it centers on Uncle Grandpa who reluctantly agrees to disguise himself as his brother Santa Claus, after the latter character injures a leg. The episode received mostly praise in international publications, and in the United States it was viewed by 1.5 million. Cartoon Network developed a browser game adaptation named \"Sneakin' Santa\" to promote the episode. The episode was well received by the critics during its respective Christmas season.\n\nA crossover special between \"Uncle Grandpa\" and \"Steven Universe\" was aired as an episode of the latter series' second season in April 2015. Conceived of by the creator of the latter series, Rebecca Sugar, the episode has Uncle Grandpa teach Steven how to bear a shield from his gemstone. Nearly two million viewed the episode, which received acclaim from critics.\n\nThe second-season episode \"Guest Directed Shorts\" was aired in June 2015 and consists of three animated shorts. The first short, directed by M. Wartella, has Uncle Grandpa using time travel in order to find the best hamburger; the second, by Pendleton Ward, has Pizza Steve beatboxing with Uncle Grandpa in the park; and the third, by Max Winston, has the RV gang getting trapped in Uncle Grandpa's claymation mind after their television set breaks down. Wartella is known for his work on the animated series \"Superjail!\" and \"Mad\", while Ward is the creator of \"Adventure Time\"; Winston is a professional stop-motion artist. The episode was viewed by 1.3 million. The episode was very well received by the critics, while Winston's short was nominated for best television production at the 2015 edition of the Annecy Film Festival.\n\nUncle Grandpa Babies first appeared as a short in the 2014 episode \"Grounded\" as a faux Cartoon Network ad that presents a series called \"Uncle Grandpa Babies\" and claims to be made by the same creators of \"Adventure Time\" (Pendleton Ward) and \"Steven Universe\" (Rebecca Sugar). One year later, a full episode based on the babies saving America from a foreign country's missile launch aired on August 20, 2015.\n\nIn light of the special premiering, reruns of \"Baby Looney Tunes\" returned to Cartoon Network.\n\nIn Canada, it premiered on September 2, 2013 on Cartoon Network. It also premiered on Cartoon Network channels in the United Kingdom and Ireland on April 14, 2014 and in Australia on May 5, 2014.\n\nOn April 30, 2014, Kaboom! announced that \"Uncle Grandpa\" comics were in the works.

It outlined the history of the Latter Day Saint movement up to that time, and included Mormonism's Articles of Faith.\n\nThe letter was written in response to Wentworth's inquiry on behalf of one of his friends, George Barstow, who was writing a history of New Hampshire. The letter was first published on March 1, 1842, in the \"Times and Seasons\" in Nauvoo, Illinois.\n\nA similar letter (with some slight revisions) was published by Daniel Rupp in 1844 in a book called \"An Original History of the Religious Denominations at Present Existing in the United States\". \n\nThe Wentworth Letter is significant for several reasons.\n\nFirst, it connects the message of what Mormons believe to be the Restoration with the history of said Restoration: \"By these things we know...\" (Doctrine and Covenants 20:1-17)\n\nSecond, it emphasizes the First Vision as an essential part of Latter-day Saint message.\n\nThird, it contains the Standard of Truth, a mission statement for missionaries:\n\n“Our missionaries are going forth to different nations . . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.” (History of the Church 4:540)\n\nFourth, it ends with the statements which later became the Articles of Faith. B. H. Roberts said of these,\n“These Articles of Faith were not produced by the labored efforts and harmonized contentions of scholastics, but were struck off by one inspired mind at a single effort to make a declaration of that which is most assuredly believed by the church, for one making earnest inquiry about the truth.\"\n\n\"The combined directness, perspicuity, simplicity and comprehensiveness of this statement of the principles of our religion may be relied upon as strong evidence of a divine inspiration resting upon the Prophet, Joseph Smith.” (B. H. Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, Vol.2, Ch.47, p.131)\nAnd finally, the Wentworth letter re-establishes Joseph Smiths teachings that the Lamanites are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. In the Wentworth letter we read,\n\n\"They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the second race fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century. \"The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country.\"\" (Wentworth Letter)\n\nThe wording of some of the articles was modified in 1851 and 1902:\n\n1. The fourth article of faith originally read, “We believe that these ordinances are: 1st. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; 2d. Repentance; 3d. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; 4th. Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.”\n\n2. The tenth article originally read, “that Zion will be built upon this continent . . .” It was later changed to \"that Zion will be built upon this [the American] continent . . .\"\n\n3. The eleventh article originally read, \"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience...\"\n\nJoseph Fielding Smith wrote:\n“The reason for the adding of the word \"principles,\" and that is the only change, was because the brethren considered when they were preparing the 1921 edition for publication of the D&C, that the term ordinances did not fully cover the article completely. For instance, \"faith\" is not an ordinance, neither is \"repentance,\" but they are principles. Therefore we felt fully justified in making the article so that it would convey clearly just what the Prophet intended. So now it reads: \"We believe that the first principles and ordinances are,\" and in doing this we were perfectly within the bounds of propriety. Were the Prophet here, he would fully justify our action.”\n\n\"We have no apology to make for this addition. We have in no sense destroyed the original meaning.” (\"Answers to Gospel Questions\" 2:92)\n\n"}
