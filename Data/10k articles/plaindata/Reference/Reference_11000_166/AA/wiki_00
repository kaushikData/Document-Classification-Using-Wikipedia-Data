{"id": "51009389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51009389", "title": "Antidotarium Nicolai", "text": "Antidotarium Nicolai\n\nThe Antidotarium Nicolai, also known as the \"Antidotarium parvum\" or small antidotarium, was a late 11th or early 12th-century Latin book with about 150 recipes for the creation of medicines from plants and minerals. It was written in the circles of the Schola Medica Salernitana, the center of European medical knowledge in the High Middle Ages. It was based in part on the \"Antidotarium\" of Constantine the African, an 11th-century work also written in Salerno which was itself partially a translation of older Arabic works. It has been called \"without doubt one of the most influential medical texts in medieval literature\", \"the essential pharmacopeia of the Middle Ages\" and \"the bible of medieval practical pharmacy\". It was often coupled with the \"Circa instans\", another 12th-century compendium of less complex medicines.\n\nThe oldest versions of the book contain some 115 recipes, while later versions can go to 175 recipes; most versions have about 150 descriptions of medicines. These recipes are not new inventions but a selection of existing recipes from the 11th-century \"Antidotarium magnum\" and other works. They are listed alphabetically. The book has little information on how medicines should technically be prepared, but focuses on ingredients, including their sequence and the quantities needed, and the manner in which they should be administered. The quantities were much reduced and standardized compared to older works. It introduces new names for many of the medicines, with etymological explanations: they are either named after the main ingredient, after the main effect they have, or after the supposed inventor of them. Much of this information was taken from the \"Etymologiae\" by Isidore of Seville.\n\nThe author of the \"Antidotarium Nicolai\" is unknown and has been the subject of a lot of speculation; even whether the writer was called Nicolaus or used a pseudonym is not certain. Suggestions include a doctor from Salerno, a professor at the Schola Medica, or a Salernian physician called Nicolò Aversano. Estimates of the date also vary from the eleventh century until the mid-thirteenth century. Some experts even claim that there were multiple works with the same name, including a French one from the 15th century written by Nicolas de Farnham.\n\nThe \"Antidotarium Nicolai\" is first mentioned in 1244, in the \"Speculum Naturale\" of Vincent of Beauvais; all known manuscript copies of the \"Antidotarium\" date to the middle of the 13th century or later. A twelfth-century commentary on the book, the \"Expositio super Antidotarium Nicolai\" may have been written by Mattheus Platearius, who died in 1161. This commentary was printed in Venice in 1549. Gilles de Corbeil (ca. 1140 – ca. 1224), a French royal physician, wrote \"De laudibus et virtutibus compositorum medicaminum\", partly based on the Antidotarium. Jean de St. Amand, medecin at the University of Paris in the 13th century, also wrote a \"Expositio supra Antidotarium Nicolai\". These works are only known through later manuscripts and printings though.\n\nThe \"Antidotarium\" is credited with having introduced the Salernian version of the apothecaries' system of weights, with 20 granum making 1 scrupulum.\n\nThe book was used as a textbook at the University of Paris by 1270 and in Montpellier by 1309. It was used as the official pharmaceutical guide in Naples and Sicily at the end of the 12th century, and in Ypres in the late 13th century. It was translated into Italian, French (once in the 14th, once in the 15th century), Hebrew (at least 17 different translations), Spanish, Arabic and Middle Dutch (at least five manuscripts known, one dated 1351). It was printed in 1471 in Venice and reprinted at least 8 times before 1500. It was in use until the 18th century.\n\n"}

Unfortunately, this fertiliser did not materially improve the growth of plants.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture conducted a trial on this fertiliser, which was partially funded by Bell-Booth, although it was agreed that this funding gave them no legal benefits.\n\nUltimately, the MAF trials found no material benefit to plant growth, and they released this information via the consumer affairs TV show Fair Go, which finally aired after several episodes were prevented from screening due to a court injunction.\n\nAs a result, sales of Maxicrop plummeted, and Bell-Booth sued both MAF and the New Zealand Broadcasting Commission for defamation, where the High Court awarded general damages of $25,000 against MAF.\n\nBell-Booth's contention is even though the 135-day trial revealed that Maxicrop \"didn't work\", that MAF owed them a duty of care for the trial research results to be released to them first, in order to take steps to mitigate any financial losses, rather than being released immediately to the public, via Fair Go, as they did.\n\nMAF appealed.\n\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's earlier award of $25,000 in general damages, as MAF owed a duty of care to the agriculture industry, and the public in general and not to Bell-Booth.\n"}

A variety of presses and other equipment demonstrate daily the printing process. The shop also hosts educational programs for children and adults, while manufacturing items for the Museum. \n\nToday the building accommodates a typical, small-town printing shop from the first half of the 20th century. Although larger printing businesses of the period adopted the modern process of offset lithography, the new technology arrived slowly to rural areas. Subsequently a press, such as the Ben Lane Printing Shop, continued to use moveable-type letterpress production similar to that devised by Johann Gutenberg in the mid-15th century.\n\nThe Ben Lane Printing Shop houses the type of equipment that a proprietor and his successors would accumulate in adapting their press to a half-century’s technological advancements. In the first decades of the 20th century print shops continued to use old-fashioned presses for specific purposes. In the case of the Ben Lane Printing Shop, even an 1820s vintage hand press remained in occasional service. Likewise, the Cotrell newspaper press, manufactured in 1871, rolled on a regular basis, as did a treadle-operated Dorman job press of the same vintage for smaller work. Although printers still utilized racks of wood and metal type, a complicated and often cantankerous Linotype machine fulfilled many of the shop’s composition requirements. The final addition of a high-speed Heidelberg press with automatic inking and paper feed operated quickly and efficiently and dramatically increased output.\n\nThe Museum named its printing shop in honor of Benjamin Battles Lane (1897–1987) whose father, Frank, founded the Lane Press of Burlington, Vermont in 1904. Ben Lane served as president and general manager of Lane Press from 1928-1961. His support enabled the Museum to install this exhibit and open it to the general public as a living tribute to a centuries-old craft.\n\nPrints, which are created by using a press and metal plate system, made possible the production of multiple copies of the same image. In the late 18th century America, the local silversmith with a talent for engraving on metal often worked with the town printer to produce printed pictures for the general public. Letterpresses and printing procedures are demonstrated in the Museum’s Print Shop.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4611600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4611600", "title": "Bychowiec Chronicle", "text": "Bychowiec Chronicle\n\nThe Bychowiec Chronicle (also spelled \"Bykhovets\", \"Bykovets\" or \" Bychovec\") is an anonymous 16th-century chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although one of the least reliable sources of the epoch, it is considered the most extensive redaction of the Lithuanian Chronicles.\n\nThe chronicle was most probably authored between 1519 and 1542, though some parts continued to be added until 1574. Authors of the chronicle are not known. The text highlights achievements of the Goštautai and Olshanski families, particularly to Jonas Goštautas. Therefore, scholars concluded that it was sponsored by a member of these families. Scholars proposed Grand Chancellor Albertas Goštautas, Bishop Paweł Holszański, and Duke Olelkovich.\n\nAleksander Bychowiec, a 19th-century Polish noble and historian, discovered the chronicle in 1830 and it is now known by his name. Teodor Narbutt studied, copied and published it in full in 1846 under the title \"Pomniki do dziejów litewskich\". The original 159-page manuscript went missing soon after Narbutt's publication and the chronicle is known only from Narbutt's copy. Because of that, earlier researcher were skeptical of the chronicle's authenticity. The chronicle was also published in 1907 in the volume 17 of the \"Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles\". A Lithuanian translation was published in 1971.\n\nIn 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of a chronicle that is essentially identical to the Bychowiec Chronicle at the and published it in 2018.\n\nNarbutt claimed that the reverse of the last page said that it is a Lithuanian chronicle translated from the Ruthenian language into Polish. In fact, it is in Ruthenian transcribed in the Polish alphabet. The chronicle is missing a beginning and an end. The first page was reconstructed by editors of the \"Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles\" using the writings of Maciej Stryjkowski. The chronicle ends in the middle of a sentence describing the 1506 Battle of Kletsk. In addition to being positively biased towards Lithuanian nobility, particularly the Goštautai family, the chronicle also pays closer attention to Catholic affairs, particularly the Franciscans. The legend of the Franciscan martyrs of Vilnius was first recorded in the chronicle.\n\nThe content can be broadly divided into three parts: legendary, historical, and contemporary. The legendary section elaborated on the Palemonids legends, tracing genealogy of Lithuanian nobility back to Apolon or Palemon, a 5th-century noble from the Roman Empire. The historical section describes historical events using other chronicles as a source. This section is often confused and contradictory. It rarely dates events and mixes them according to the theme; the reconstruction of proper chronology would be impossible without other sources. This section is not considered reliable. The contemporary section describes events during the chronicler's life, particularly the reign of Alexander Jagiellon (1492–1506). This section is considered valuable and reliable.\n\nThe Bychowiec chronicle used many medieval documents as its sources, primarily earlier versions of Lithuanian Chronicles, which in turn used other chronicles, including the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle. After about 1446, the chronicle became an independent source, using notes made during the reign of Alexander Jagiellon. The chronicles probably had access to notes or chronicles of Jonas Goštautas as his activities in 1440–53 are particularly detailed.\n\nAlthough one of the least reliable Slavonic chronicles, the Bychowiec chronicle is generally believed to have used many medieval documents as its sources. The research by the comparative text analysis, however, attempted to prove that a very important source of the Bychowiec manuscript was, in fact, the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle only, possibly in a copy or in excerpts that differed slightly from the versions which we know now.\n\n"}

Moldova (application No. 27138/04) was a case decided by European Court of Human Rights in 2010. Ciubotaru sought to have his ethnicity changed from Moldovan to Romanian on his birth and marriage certificates, which Moldova refused. The Court found that Moldova's procedure for changing ethnicity of record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn 2002, when applying to have his old Soviet identity card replaced with a Moldovan one, Mr. Ciubotaru submitted that his ethnicity was Romanian. As he was told that his application would not be accepted unless he indicated Moldovan ethnicity, as in his and his parents' Soviet documents, he complied.\n\nAfterwards he requested the relevant State authority to change his ethnic identity entry from “Moldovan” to “Romanian”. His request was refused with the argument that since his parents had not been recorded as ethnic Romanians in their birth and marriage certificates, it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian. He was advised to search the archives for traces of Romanian origin of his ancestors. Appeals to domestic courts were refused.\n\nThe Court found for Ciubotaru. The Court explained that it understood that authorities should be able to refuse a claim to change ethnicity of record when the claim is based purely on unsubstantiated subjective grounds. However, Moldova's legal requirements created insurmountable barriers on an individual wishing to record an ethnicity other than the ethnicity that Soviet authorities defined for the individual's parents. The Court also found that Ciubotaru's claim was based on more than merely subjective grounds, as Ciubotaru could produce objectively verifiable links with Romanian ethnic groups. Evidence such as language, name, and empathy cannot be relied on under Moldovan law in force.\n\nThe Court concluded, that the procedure of changing ethnicity record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the European Convention on Human Rights, and ordered Moldova to pay the applicant 5,000 Euros.\n\nJudge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, pointing that \"I consider self-identification primarily as a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and that is why I do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment\".\n\n"}

DNS sinkholes have also historically been used for non-malicious purposes.\n\nWhen a computer visits a DNS source to resolve a domain name, the provider will give a result if possible, and if not, it will send the resolution system to a higher-level provider to try again. The higher a DNS Sinkhole is in this chain, the more requests it will receive, and the more impactful it will be.\n\nA sinkhole is a standard DNS server that has been configured to hand out non-routable addresses for all domains in the sinkhole, so that every computer that uses it will fail to get access to the real website. The higher up the DNS resolution chain the sinkhole is, the more requests it will block as it will supply answers to a greater number of lower NS servers that in turn will serve a greater number of clients. Some of the larger botnets have been made unusable by TLD sinkholes that span the entire Internet. DNS Sinkholes are effective at detecting and blocking malicious traffic, and are used to combat bots and other unwanted traffic.\n\nBy default, the local hosts file on a Microsoft Windows, Unix or Linux computer is checked before DNS servers, and can also be used to block sites in the same way.\n\nSinkholes can be used both constructively, as has been done for the containment of the WannaCry and Avalanche threats, and destructively, for example disrupting DNS services in a DoS attack.\n\nOne use is to stop botnets, by interrupting the DNS names the botnet is programmed to use for coordination. The most common use of a hosts file-based sinkhole is to block ad serving sites. Ad serving can also be blocked using a locally running DNS server on your computer or on your local network effectively blocking Ads for all devices on the network.\n"}

The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros.

The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.\n\nThe show's title character is the superhero alter ego of geeky 16-year-old (later changed to 17-year-old) Dexter Douglas who attends Harry Connick High School. His name is a parody of various superheroes' alliterative names (e.g. Bruce Banner, Peter Parker). Dexter gained his abilities from a computer bug activated by a \"secret key sequence\" that must be typed (a reference to the Pentium FDIV bug). The sequence of keys is \"@[=g3,8d]\\&fbb=-q]/hk%fg\" (the quotes are included), as seen when Roddy MacStew types the combination in \"The Chip (Act 2)\". The bug manifests when the user presses Delete after entering the string, and was first activated when Dexter's cat crawled onto the keyboard. Becoming absorbed into his computer and instantly gaining all the information on the Internet, Freakazoid has enhanced strength and endurance, extraordinary speed and agility, and negligible amounts of sanity. These changes make him a powerful and fearsome force for upholding freedom and righteousness, unless he gets distracted by something like a bear riding a motorcycle. He has a base called the Freakalair, a parody of the Batcave, built by his mute butler, Ingmar. The Freakalair contains a \"Hall of Nifty Things to Know\" and even a mad scientist lab. His greatest weakness, as he once explained to Armando Guitierrez, is that he can be imprisoned in a cage with graphite bars charged with negative ions. He also expresses a great aversion to \"poo gas\".\n\nPeripheral powers come and go: Freakazoid once developed telekinesis triggered by anger that was never mentioned again after the episode, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk for raking too loudly, but apologizes to him later in the same plot. He also has the ability to assume the form of electricity and cover long distances instantaneously, although he just as often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while making swooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending to fly.\n\nDexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the words \"Freak out!\" and \"Freak in!\". When not in Freakazoid mode, Dexter looks and acts completely normal, and his family is unaware that anything has happened to him. Freakazoid spends this time in an area of Dexter's brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects, has profound thoughts, and watches reruns of \"The Rat Patrol\".\n\nWhile the show's setting is set around Washington, D.C., the locale often varies with the show's humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\"Freakazoid!\" features a number of campy villains and enemies, including:\n\n\nA few characters fall somewhere in the space between \"enemies\" and \"allies\" to land squarely in the category of \"nuisances.\"\n\n\n\"Freakazoid!\" also features several mini-segments, primarily during the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs, title cards and cast, and only rarely \"cross over\" into the continuity of the main show. These segments include:\n\n\nThe voice actors of the show \"Freakazoid!\" included various actors from other television series and films. Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche, Jeff Bennett, and Frank Welker, who all provided voices in the series \"Animaniacs\", were on \"Freakazoid!\". Actors Ed Asner, Ricardo Montalbán, Larry Cedar, Jonathan Harris, and Stephen Furst also provided voices for the series. Also, writers John P. McCann and Paul Rugg (who played Freakazoid) added voices themselves.\n\nCasting for the show had been difficult for the \"Freakazoid!\" staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions. Eventually, when writer Paul Rugg was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: \"I went in there and did it. Then they played it for Steven Spielberg and he said 'Yep! Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it.\" Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run.\n\nThe music for \"Freakazoid!\" was written by Richard Stone, Steve Bernstein, Julie Bernstein, Gordon Goodwin and Tim Kelly. Stone won a Daytime Emmy with lyricist (and senior producer) Tom Ruegger for the main title song in 1996. Julie Bernstein was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Original Song in 1998 for the song \"Invisibo\" from the episode \"Freak-a-Panel\".\n\nCartoonist Mike Allred has criticized the show and its lead character as plagiarism of his comic book \"Madman\", asserting that the title characters share several personality traits, and wear similar costumes featuring a chest emblem including an exclamation mark. During the short run of the show, Allred remained relatively silent on the subject, but in 2003, he responded to a question about the show on the message board of his official website:\n\nThe humor in \"Freakazoid!\" relied heavily on slapstick, parody and pop cultural references. Due to the series being metafiction, much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. breaking the fourth wall); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show toyetic. A typically strange running gag involves a repeated credit for \"Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman\", though no such character appears in any episode. Her credit is usually preceded by a number of other fictional names and followed by a fictional director. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the then-newly founded WB Network, such as questioning the meaning of the initials \"WB\", e.g., \"Weird Butt\" or \"Wet Bananas\" instead of Warner Bros.\n\n\"Freakazoid!\" made frequent use of stock footage, including the peaceful scene of a field of flowers (\"Relax-O-Vision\"), numerous people screaming (\"Scream-O-Vision\"), traditionally dressed Bavarians dancing and slapping each other, a man being shot in the belly with a cannonball and a man wrestling a bear.\n\nCameo appearances were also a major element of the show's humor. At various times, \"Freakazoid!\" hosted appearances by characters from other Warner Bros. Cartoons such as \"Pinky and the Brain\", \"Animaniacs\" and even an insinuation appearance of the \"Batman\" from Bruce Timm's , which has a similar drawing style (its concept of old movie-style title cards at the beginning of each episode was also replicated in \"Freakazoid!\"). Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer Steven Spielberg) and guest appearances by such figures as Jack Valenti, Leonard Maltin and Mark Hamill as themselves were also commonplace. Norm Abram had an entire episode, \"Normadeus\", built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a \"Where's Waldo\"-esque hunt for his constant cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits).\n\nOne of the show's longest cameo appearances was when Wakko (from \"Animaniacs\") and Brain (from \"Pinky and the Brain\") appeared in a scene in which they argue with Freakazoid over which of their shows is Steven Spielberg's favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite because \"we got a memo\". (\"Tiny Toon Adventures\" was not represented in the discussion as it was on Nickelodeon at the time, while the others were on Kids' WB.) However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he simply replies: \"Who are you people?\".\n\n\"Freakazoid\" was created by animator Bruce Timm, who had previously produced \"\", and Paul Dini, who was a story editor for \"Tiny Toon Adventures\". Timm was called upon by Steven Spielberg, who Timm said \"liked\" Timm's \"Batman\" series, to help create a new superhero show. After a meeting with Spielberg, Timm said that Spielberg had \"really liked\" the idea for the series, after which Timm and Dini created the character Freakazoid, an edgy superhero with a manic personality. Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, \"The name 'Freakazoid' just kind of jumped out of me, I don't even know where from. I said 'Oh, yeah, 'Freakazoid', that might be an interesting name.'\"\n\nTimm originally created \"Freakazoid\" to be a serious \"adventure show\" with some comedic undertones. However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated:\n\nAfter Timm left the series, Tom Ruegger, who developed other Spielberg series \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" and \"Animaniacs\", was brought in to redevelop the series Timm had created \"from the ground up\". Ruegger's version of the series used some of Timm's designs and concepts, but Timm said that the series was \"radically altered\" to become the comedy series that was more to Spielberg's liking.\n\nRuegger then began writing stories for the series, and came up with a pile of very short segments. Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well. Ruegger then asked writers John McCann and Paul Rugg to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, \"(...) figure out what this [\"Freakazoid!\"] was going to be, and the answer was like, 'We didn't know', and still don't\".\n\n\"Freakazoid\" premiered on Kids' WB's Saturday lineup on September 9, 1995. During its run, \"Freakazoid\" came across problems of appealing to its target demographic, young children. Tom Ruegger said that \"Freakazoid\" had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience. Also, \"Freakazoid\" ran into timeslot problems. Writer John McCann said that the timeslot of the series changed frequently: \"They put it at eight o' clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn't even find it, and we wrote the thing\". The series ran on Kids' WB until February 14, 1997, when it was canceled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program. Rugg said the series' demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, timeslot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that \"(...) there aren't a lot of Nielsen boxes in federal prisons. Had there been, I'm telling you, we'd still be on the air today\". Bruce Timm said that the series still has a cult following of fans who ask him questions about the series whenever they meet him.\n\nHowever, the show was later picked up by Cartoon Network and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997 until March 29, 2003. The series had a total number of 24 episodes. In 2006, \"Freakazoid!\" was one of the shows scheduled to be broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, In2TV.\n\nFreakazoid never had his own comic book, but he did make a special guest crossover in issue #35 of the \"Animaniacs\" comic published by DC Comics.\n\nWarner Home Video has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1.\n\n"}
{"id": "168205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168205", "title": "Gray's Anatomy", "text": "Gray's Anatomy\n\nGray's Anatomy is an English language textbook of human anatomy originally written by Henry Gray and illustrated by Henry Vandyke Carter. Earlier editions were called Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical and Gray's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied, but the book's name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, \"Gray's Anatomy\". The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The latest edition of the book, the 41st, was published in September 2015.\n\nThe English anatomist Henry Gray was born in 1827. He studied the development of the endocrine glands and spleen and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at St George's Hospital Medical School in London. In 1855, he approached his colleague Henry Vandyke Carter with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital mortuaries through the Anatomy Act of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by John William Parker in London.\nIt was dedicated by Gray to Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet.\nAn imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations.\nGray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the United Kingdom in 1860, also by J.W. Parker. However, Gray died the following year, at the age of 34, having contracted smallpox while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his \"Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical\".\nEven so, the work on his much-praised book was continued by others.\nLongman's publication reportedly began in 1863, after their acquisition of the J.W. Parker publishing business. This coincided with the publication date of the third British edition of \"Gray's Anatomy.\" Successive British editions of \"Gray's Anatomy\" continued to be published under the Longman, and more recently Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier imprints, reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years.\n\nThe full American rights were purchased by Blanchard and Lea, who published the first of twenty-five distinct American editions of \"Gray's Anatomy\" in 1862, and whose company became Lea & Febiger in 1908. Lea & Febiger continued publishing the American editions until the company was sold in 1990.\n\nThe first American publication was edited by Richard James Dunglison, whose father Robley Dunglison was physician to Thomas Jefferson. Dunglison edited the next four editions. These were: the \"Second American Edition\" (February 1862); the \"New Third American from the Fifth English Edition\" (May 1870); the \"New American from the Eighth English Edition\" (July 1878); and the \"New American from the Tenth English Edition\" (August 1883). W. W. Keen edited the next two editions, namely: the \"New American from the Eleventh English Edition\" (September 1887); and the \"New American from the Thirteenth English Edition\" (September 1893).\n\nIn September 1896, reference to the English edition was dropped and it was published as the \"Fourteenth Edition\", edited by Bern B. Gallaudet, F. J. Brockway, and J. P. McMurrich, who also edited the \"Fifteenth Edition\" (October 1901). There is also an edition dated 1896 which does still reference the English edition stating it is \"A New Edition, Thoroughly Revised by American Authorities, from the thirteenth English Edition\" and edited by T. Pickering Pick, F.R.C.S. and published by Lea Brothers & Co., Philadelphia and New York.\n\nThe \"Sixteenth Edition\" (October 1905) was edited by J. C. DaCosta, and the \"Seventeenth\" (September 1908) by DaCosta and E. A. Spitzka. Spitzka edited the \"Eighteenth\" (Oct. 1910) and \"Nineteenth\" (July 1913) editions, and in October 1913, R. Howden edited the \"New American from the Eighteenth English Edition\". The \"American\" editions then continued with consecutive numbering from the Twentieth onwards, with W. H. Lewis editing the 20th (September. 1918), 21st (August 1924), 22nd (August 1930), 23rd (July 1936), and 24th (May 1942). C. M. Gross edited the 25th (August 1948), 26th (July 1954), 27th (August 1959), 28th (August 1966), and 29th (January 1973). Carmine D. Clemente edited and extensively revised the 30th edition (October 1984). With the sale of Lea & Febiger in 1990, the 30th edition was the last American Edition.\n\nSometimes separate editing efforts with mismatches between British and American edition numbering led to the existence, for many years, of two main \"flavours\" or \"branches\" of \"Gray's Anatomy\": the U.S. and the British one. This can easily cause misunderstandings and confusion, especially when quoting from or trying to purchase a certain edition. For example, a comparison of publishing histories shows that the American numbering kept roughly apace with the British up until the 16th editions in 1905, with the American editions either acknowledging the English edition, or simply matching the numbering in the 14th, 15th and 16th editions. Then the American numbering crept ahead, with the 17th American edition published in 1908, while the 17th British edition was published in 1909. This increased to a three-year gap for the 18th and 19th editions, leading to the 1913 publication of the \"New American from the Eighteenth English\", which brought the numbering back into line. Both 20th editions were then published in the same year (1918). Thereafter, it was the British numbering that pushed ahead, with the 21st British edition in 1920, and the 21st American edition in 1924. This discrepancy continued to increase, so that the 30th British edition was published in 1949, while the 30th and last American edition was published in 1984.\n\nThe newest, 41st edition of \"Gray's Anatomy\" was published on 25 September 2015 by Elsevier in both print and online versions, and is the first edition to have enhanced online content including anatomical videos and a bonus \"Gray's\" imaging library. The 41st edition also has 24 specially invited online commentaries on contemporary anatomical topics such as advances in electron and fluorescent microscopy; the neurovascular bundles of the prostate; stem cells in regenerative medicine; the anatomy of facial aging; and technical aspects and applications of diagnostic radiology.\n\nThe senior editor of this book and accompanying website on ExpertConsult is Professor Susan Standring, who is Emeritus Professor of Anatomy at King's College London. The three most recent editions differ from all previous editions in an important aspect: they present anatomical structures by their regional anatomy (i.e. ordered according to what part of the body the structures are located in – e.g. the anatomy of the bones, blood vessels and nerves, etc. of the upper extremity is described in one place). All editions of \"Gray's Anatomy\" previous to the 39th were organized by systemic anatomy (i.e. there were separate sections for the body's entire skeletal system, entire circulatory system and entire nervous system, etc.). The editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches but switched to regional anatomy by popular demand.\n\nOlder, out-of-copyright editions of the book continue to be reprinted and sold, particularly on the internet. However it is not always clear which (British or American) edition these books are republications of. Many seem to be reprints of the 1901 (probably U.S.) edition. Additionally, there are several sites where various older versions can be read online.\nAlthough older editions may serve historic and artistic uses because their companion illustrations and anatomical cross sections are renowned for their rustic and often haunting presentation, they may no longer represent an up-to-date understanding of human anatomy.\n\nHenry Gray wrote \"Gray's Anatomy\" with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy appears to have been to make each edition come close to containing a \"fully comprehensive\" account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a metaphorical and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages. The current 41st edition has 1,584 pages.\nNewer editions of \"Gray's Anatomy\" – and even several recent older ones – are still considered to be the most comprehensive and detailed textbooks on the subject.\nDespite previous efforts to keep \"Gray's Anatomy\" readable by students, when the 39th edition was published, students were identified as a secondary market for the book, and companion publications such as \"Gray's Anatomy for Students\", \"Gray's Atlas of Anatomy\" and \"Gray's Anatomy Review\" have also been published in recent years.\n\nIn Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\", the book that Tom catches Becky Thatcher reading, and from which she tears a page, is implied to be \"Gray's Anatomy\".\n\nEarly in the 1970 Tamil film \"Malathi\", medical students Gemini Ganesan and B. Saroja Devi try to obtain the 28th edition of \"Gray's Anatomy\" from an old book shop.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat’s art was inspired by the book’s illustrations since it was read by him many times when he was a child, especially when recovering from an accident he suffered.\n\nIn the 1991 movie \"The Addams Family\" Granny (Judith Malina) binge reads Gray's Anatomy while Gomez (Raul Julia) is playing with his train sets.\n\nThe 1996 Steven Soderbergh film \"Gray's Anatomy\", featuring monologuist Spalding Gray, also takes its name from the title of the book, as does \"Gray's Anatomy: Selected Writings\", a 2009 book by British political philosopher John N. Gray.\n\nIn the 1998 \"\" episode \"\", the new Emergency Medical Hologram designed by Ensign Kim begins reciting the contents of \"Gray's Anatomy\" when activated, beginning with a description of the cell.\n\nThe American medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" (2005 –) takes its name from the textbook.\n\nThe name of Jim Leonard Jr.'s 2006 play \"Anatomy of Gray\", which centers on a doctor visiting a small town in Indiana in 1880, takes its title as a play on \"Gray's Anatomy\".\n\nIn Dan Brown's 2013 novel \"Inferno\", Sienna Brooks, as a child, reads all the 1,600 pages of \"Gray's Anatomy\" in ten days.\n\nIn the ABC television series \"The Good Doctor\" (2017–present), the lead character, Dr. Shaun Murphy, an autistic savant, often visualizes illustrations from \"Gray's Anatomy\" as he mentally diagnoses a patient's condition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "307967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307967", "title": "Hoodening", "text": "Hoodening\n\nHoodening (), also spelled hodening and oodening, is a folk custom found in Kent, a county in south-eastern England. The tradition entails the use of a wooden hobby horse known as a hooden horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. Originally, the tradition was restricted to the area of East Kent, although in the twentieth century it spread into neighbouring West Kent. It represents a regional variation of a \"hooded animal\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.\n\nAs recorded from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, hoodening was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of farm labourers. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, a man in female clothing known as a \"Mollie\", and several musicians. The team would then carry the hooden horse to local houses and shops, where they would expect payment for their appearance. Although this practice is extinct, in the present the hooden horse is incorporated into various Kentish Mummers plays and Morris dances that take place at different times of the year.\n\nThe origins of the hoodening tradition, and the original derivation of the term \"hooden\", remain subject to academic debate. An early suggestion was that \"hooden\" was related to the Anglo-Saxon pre-Christian god Woden, and that the tradition therefore originated with pre-Christian religious practices in the early medieval Kingdom of Kent. This idea has not found support from historians or folklorists studying the tradition. A more widely accepted explanation among scholars is that the term \"hooden\" relates to \"hooded\", a reference to the sackcloth worn by the individual carrying the horse. The absence of late medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the various British hooded animal traditions—among them the Mari Lwyd of south Wales, the Broad of the Cotswolds, and the Old Ball, Old Tup, and Old Horse of northern England—have led to suggestions that they derive from the regionalised popularisation of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century fashion for hobby horses among the social elite.\n\nThe earliest textual reference to the hoodening tradition comes from the first half of the eighteenth century. Scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had died out in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as \"The Hooden Horse\" in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the First World War, the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into some modern Kentish folk traditions.\n\nSurviving sources testify to the fact that while there was some variation in the hoodening tradition as it was practiced by different individuals in different parts of East Kent, it was nevertheless \"on the whole remarkably uniform\". The hooden horse, which was at the centre of the tradition, was usually made out of a wooden horse's head affixed to a pole about four feet long, with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string. This horse was then carried aloft by an individual who was concealed beneath a dark cloth. As part of the hoodening custom, a team of \"hoodeners\", consisting of between four and eight men, would carry the horse through the streets. This team included the horse operator, a \"Groom\", \"Driver\", or \"Waggoner\" who carried a whip and led the horse by a bridle, a \"Jockey\" who would attempt to mount the horse, a \"Mollie\" who was a man dressed as a woman, and one or two musicians. All of the men were farm labourers, usually being those who worked with horses. \n\nThe team performed the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. The team would arrive at people's houses where they would sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with a broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.\n\nHistorians have catalogued 33 recorded instances of the hoodening tradition extant in Kent prior to the twentieth-century revival. These are clustered in a crescent shape along the eastern and northern coasts of the county, and all were found within the area historically defined as East Kent, the tradition being unknown in neighbouring West Kent. More specifically, the folklorist Percy Maylam noted that there were no records of the tradition having been found west of Godmersham. This region was \"a well populated area\" during the period in which the hoodeners were active, and Maylam noted that all of the areas in which the tradition was found contained the East Kentish dialect. The folklorist E. C. Cawte analysed the historical distribution of the hoodeners and found that it did not correspond with the areas of early Anglo-Saxon settlement in Kent, nor did it accord with the county's coal mining areas. He concluded that \"there is no apparent reason why the custom did not spread further afield\".\n\nHoodening was part of a wider \"hooded animal\" tradition that Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. In South Wales, the Mari Lwyd tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In an area along the border between Derbyshire and Yorkshire, the Old Tup tradition featured groups knocking on doors around Christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat's head. The folklorist Christina Hole drew parallels between hoodening and the Christmas Bull tradition recorded in Dorset and Gloucestershire. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions—the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss festival and Minehead Hobby Horse—which take place not at Christmas time but on May Day.\nAlthough the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \"nation-wide craze\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\".\n\nMaylam noted that most nineteenth-century sources describing the tradition had spelled the word as \"hoden\", but that he favoured \"hooden\" because it better reflected the pronunciation of the word with its long vowel. He added that \"the word 'hooden' rhymes with 'wooden' and not with 'sodden' as some writers appear to think\". Given this pronunciation, Cawte suggested that \"oodening\" was a better spelling for the tradition's name. Maylam also noted that none of the hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of the etymology of the term, and that similarly they were unaware of the tradition's historical origins.\n\nThe term \"hoodening\" is thus of unknown derivation. One possible explanation for the origin of \"hooden\" was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of \"wooden\", referring to the use of the wooden horse. Maylam was critical of this idea, expressing the view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from the Kentish dialect. A second possibility is that the name \"hooden\" was a reference to the hooded nature of the horse's bearer. The historian Ronald Hutton deemed this to be the \"simplest\" derivation, while folklorists Cawte and Charlotte Sophia Burne also considered it the most likely explanation. Maylam was also critical of this, suggesting that the cloth under which the carrier was concealed was too large to be considered a hood.\nIn his \"History of Kent\", the antiquarian Alfred John Dunkin suggested that \"Hodening\" was a corruption of \"Hobening\", and that it was ultimately derived from the Gothic \"hopp\", meaning horse. Maylam opined that Dunkin's argument could be \"ignored\", stating that it rested on the erroneous assumption that \"Hodening\" began with a short vowel.\n\nMaylam concluded that the hoodening tradition was \"a mutilated survival\" of a form of Morris dance. Noting that some medieval Morris dancers had incorporated games devoted to the English folk hero Robin Hood into their custom, he suggested that \"hoodening\" might have originally been a reference to Robin Hood. This idea was challenged by Burne, who noted that in his legends, Robin Hood was always depicted as an archer rather than a horse-rider, thus questioning how he had come to be associated with the hooden horse. She further noted that the medieval games devoted to Robin Hood all took place in May rather than at Christmas, as hoodening did. Cawte also criticised Maylam's argument, noting that there was no evidence of Morris dancing in Kent prior to the twentieth century, and that neither hoodening nor Robin Hood had a particularly close association with the Morris dance to start with.\n\nIn 1807, an anonymous observer suggested that the term \"hoden\" was linked to the Anglo-Saxon god Woden, and that the tradition might be \"a relic of a festival to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in Thanet\". In 1891, it was suggested that the custom had once been known as \"Odining\", a reference to the early medieval Scandinavian god Odin. The author of this idea further suggested that the custom had begun either with the ritual wearing of the skins of horses sacrificed to Odin, or as an early Christian mockery of such Odinic practices. \n\nMaylam noted that he was initially attracted to the idea that the term \"hodening\" had derived from \"Woden\"—an Old English name that he thought a more likely origin than the Old Norse \"Odin\"—but that upon investigating this possibility found \"no sufficient evidence\" for it. He added that it would seem unlikely that the \"W\" would be lost from \"Woden\" in the Kentish dialect, citing the example of Woodnesborough, a Kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from \"Woden\" and which clearly retains its use of \"W\". He concluded that \"one feels that the theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry the building erected on them\". The idea of linking the tradition to Woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both Burne and Cawte.\n\nBelieving it likely that the hoodening tradition \"substantially pre-dates\" its earliest textual appearances, the folklorist Geoff Doel suggested the possibility that it had originated as a Midwinter rite to re-energise the vegetation. As evidence for this claim, Doel noted that other English winter folk customs, such as the Apple Wassail, have also been interpreted in this manner. He also suggested that the use of the horse in the tradition may have some connections to either the use of the white horse as the symbol of Kent, and the use of Hengist and Horsa (meaning \"stallion\" and \"horse\" in Old English) as prominent characters in the origin myths of the early medieval Kingdom of Kent.\n\nThe oldest known textual reference to hoodening comes from the \"Alphabet of Kenticisms\", a manuscript authored by Samuel Pegge, an antiquary who served as the vicar of Godmersham in Kent from 1731 to 1751. After Pegge died, the manuscript was obtained by the palaeographer Sir Frederic Madden, and after his death it was purchased by the English Dialect Society, who published it in 1876. In this manuscript, Pegge noted simply that \"Hoodening (huod.ing) is a country masquerade at Christmas times\", comparing it to Mumming and the Winster Guisers of Derbyshire.\n\nThe earliest known textual description of the tradition is provided by a letter that was published in a May 1807 edition of \"European Magazine\". The letter had been written by an anonymous individual who was describing an encounter with the hoodeners on a visit to the Kentish coastal town of Ramsgate in Thanet:\n\nLater commenting on this source, Maylam highlighted that its author did not appear to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.\n\nThe anonymously authored account was repeated almost verbatim in a range of other publications in the coming decades, giving its description far wider exposure. The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott's \"Guide to the Coast of Kent\", published in 1859, where he referred to a \"curious custom [which] used to prevail\" in Ramsgate. Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed elderly town residents in the early twentieth century and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could recall it happening in their own lifetime.\n\nMany years after the event, the Kentish antiquarian J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub on the outskirts of Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown, near Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse that had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which had been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres that had been active from at least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.\nIn a January 1868 edition of the \"Kentish Gazette\", an anonymous author mentioned that hoodening had taken place in Minster, Swale on the Christmas Eve of 1867. The author noted that the tradition featured carol singing and the ringing of handbells, which were accompanied by the appearance of a hooden horse; they expressed surprise at this latter event because they had thought that the horse was \"as extinct as the megatherium\".\n\nIn their 1888 \"Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect\", W. D. Parish and W. F. Shaw claimed that \"Hodening\" was a term used in Kent to refer to a custom involving the singing of carols, but that in the past \"Hoodening\" had been applied to \"a mumming or masquerade\" involving the hooden horse. They added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from the Reverend H. Bennett Smith of St Nicholas-at-Wade, who had in turn learned from a retired farmer in his parish that \"the farmer used to send annually round the neighbourhood the best horse under the charge of the wagoner, and that afterwards instead, a man used to represent the horse, being supplied with a tail, and with a wooden figure of a horse's head, and plenty of horse hair for a mane... The custom has long since ceased.\"\n\nParish and Shaw did not mention what time of year the tradition took place or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying at the time of writing. Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.\n\nIn December 1889, a letter written by a resident of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders appeared in the \"Bromley Record\". Saunders stated that he had conversed with many elderly residents of Thanet on the subject of hoodening, and that they informed him that the custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously, after a woman in Broadstairs was so scared by the hooden horse that she died. He added that a horse's skull was rarely used, \"owing to the difficulty procuring one\", and that the wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement. He stated that the hoodening company typically consisted of a \"Jockey\" who placed himself on the back of the individual carrying the horse, and that it was the \"sport\" that bystanders attempted to throw him off, resulting in violence. The horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers, two attendants, and an individual dressed as an \"old woman\" carrying a broom; when the company knocked on people's doors, it was the old woman's job to sweep the inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments. He was of the opinion that the custom had been restricted to the Isle of Thanet, noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, Acol, Monkton, and Birchington. Contradicting this were several letters published in the \"Church Times\" in January 1891 which attested to the continuing practice of the hooden horse tradition at both Deal and Walmer.\n\nPercy Maylam was born into a farming family in 1865 at Pivington Farm in Pluckley, and in 1890 became a solicitor of the Supreme Court before working as a solicitor at Canterbury. As well as being a keen cricketer and coin collector, Maylam was an amateur historian and in 1892 joined the Kent Archaeological Society. During the 1880s, Maylam came upon the hoodening tradition and began undertaking research into it, searching for textual references to the tradition in books, periodicals, and newspapers, and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions, at St Nicholas-at-Wade, Walmer, and Deal. He expressed the opinion that \"in these days Kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence. This is my excuse for my attempt to record the custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us.\" \n\nThe period in which Maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in the recording of Britain's rural folk culture, in particular by members of the professional classes—of which Maylam was a member—in part due to the fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out. Such folklore collecting was encouraged by The Folklore Society, with whom Maylam was associated, and also by the widely read book \"The Golden Bough\", a work of comparative folkloristics authored by the anthropologist James Frazer. Maylam published his research in 1909 as \"The Hooden Horse\", in an edition limited to 303 copies. The book was reviewed in the journal \"Folklore\" by Burne, who described it as \"an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself\". Cawte later described it as \"unusually good\", while Fran and Geoff Doel regarded it as \"a very enlightened piece of Edwardian folk research\".\n\nMaylam concluded that at the time, there was only one hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington, and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30 pm, accompanied by two musicians—one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina—and a man named Robert Laming who led the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.\n\nMaylam also interviewed those involved in the hoodening tradition at Deal, whom he encountered in the summer of 1909. One elderly gentleman, Robert Skardon, related that his father had once led the town's hoodening troupe, in which he personally carried the head, his father the drum, his \"Uncle John Beaney\" the fiddle, and \"old Harry Chorner\" the piccolo. For many years they had included a man dressed in woman's clothing, who was known as a \"Daisy\" rather than a \"Mollie\", but that this had been discontinued. Skardon had given up the tradition many years previously, and the hooden horse itself had come into the possession of Elbridge Bowles of Great Mongeham, who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after Christmas each year, visiting Deal as well as the neighbouring villages of Finglesham, Ripple, Tilmanstone, Eastry, and Betteshanger. Maylam was also informed that at the time of Britain's involvement in the Second Boer War, the horse had been decorated with military equipment. The fourth hooden horse that Maylam encountered was owned by the men who worked at George Goodson's farm in Fenland, Word, near Sandwich. They informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in Cleve, Monkton, before being brought to Word when one of the Cleve farm workers relocated there.\n\nMaylam believed that the custom—as a \"natural and spontaneous observance\" among the people—was clearly going to die out, expressing his hope that the hooden horses could be preserved in Kentish museums and brought out for specially arranged public processions so as to maintain their place in Kentish culture. In later life, Maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history, privately publishing \"Maylam Family Records\" in 1932, before dying in 1939. In the century following his death, Maylam's book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase, and so to mark the centenary of its first publication, it was republished in 2009 by The History Press, under the altered title of \"The Kent Hooden Horse\". Writing an introductory article for the second publication, Doel, a specialist in Kentish folklore, praised Maylam's book as a \"classic study\" which was \"impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to the origins and significance of the custom.\"\n\nWriting in 1967, the folklorist Barnett Field claimed that at some point after Maylam's book was published, hoodening had \"died out. The Horses were hung up in the stables, and when the tractors came, were taken out and burnt on the bonfire.\" Doel and Doel later suggested that it was the impact of the First World War which effectively ended the tradition. Field noted that the first revival of the custom after the war took place at the 1936 Kent District Folk-Dance Festival at Aylesford. A new horse was specially created for this festival, and was modelled on an older example that had been used at Sarre. The hobby horse had not previously had any connection with Morris dancing, although was adopted as a totem animal for several Morris sides after the Second World War. This revival in the usage of the horse was heavily influenced by Maylam's book. The Aylesford horse was adopted by the Ravensbourne Morris Men, a Morris troupe based in the West Kentish village of Keston, in 1947. The Ravensbourne Morris's hoodening tradition is the earliest known variant of the custom to exist in West Kent, although there are accounts of a hooden horse being located at Balgowan School in the West Kentish town of Beckenham during the 1930s. At the 1945 celebration marking British victory in the Second World War, a horse was brought out in Acol; this instance has been described as \"a kind of missing link between tradition and revival\" because the horse had been used as part of the historical hoodening tradition up until the mid-1920s.\n\nBarnett Field (1912–2000) as born at Wych Cross in the Ashdown Forest and subsequently educated at Tunbridge Wells. He trained as a banker before working as manager of the Hythe and Folkestone branches of the Westminster Bank until his retirement in 1979. Field and his wife, Olive Ridley, had a keen interest in folk dances; she established the Folkestone National Folk Dance Group in 1950, and he founded the East Kent Morris Men in 1953. Field constructed a hooden horse for the group to use, based in large part on the Deal horse photographed for Maylam's book, and unveiled it at the Folkestone celebrations for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. After this, it came to be used by both the East Kent Morris Men and the Folkestone District National Dance Group's Handbell Ringers, who took it with them for performances in various parts of continental Europe, including Austria, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, developing what came to be known as \"handbell hoodening\". The Handbell Ringers also brought out the horse to accompany them as they went around in public collecting money for charity at Christmas time.\n\nFrom 1954, the horse was also brought out for a Whitsun celebration in which it was paraded from Charing to the village green at Wye. A special service was held in the Charing Church, in which the Morris Men danced in the chancel and through the aisle, while the vicar put a bridle on the horse itself. The horse was also brought out for a July 1956 ceremony in which The Swan Inn, a pub at Wickhambreaux, was officially renamed as The Hooden Horse; present were the East Kent Morris Men, the Handbell Ringers, and the Ravensbourne Morris Men. This venture led to the groups establishing a new folk custom, \"hop hoodening\", which was derived in part from an older hop-picking ceremony found in the Weald area. Their new custom involved the different groups joining together on a tour around the villages of East Kent, beginning at Canterbury Cathedral and going through Ramsgate, Cliftonville, and Herne Bay before ending in a barn dance at Wickhambreaux.\n\nIn October 1957, Field was introduced to Jack Laming of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. Laming taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at Walmer's Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at Deal Maritime and Local History Museum. In June 1961 Field and his wife established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War, the hooden horse's use has been revived in Whitstable, where it is often brought out for the Jack in the Green festival each May, and is owned by a group called the Ancient Order of Hoodeners. Since 1981, the Tonbridge Mummers and Hoodeners have made use of a horse, incorporating it into a play specially written for the purpose by Doel and Nick Miller.\nAn annual conference of hoodeners was also established; initially meeting at the Marsh Gate Inn near Herne Bay, it subsequently moved to Simple Simon's in Canterbury. A member of the St. Nicholas-at-Wade hoodeners, Ben Jones, established a website devoted to the tradition. At the prompting of local residents, in December 2014 a pub named The Hungry Horse, located on the corner of Haine Road and Nash Road in Broadstairs, was renamed as The Hoodening Horse after the folk custom. Commenting on the Kentish revival of hoodening, Hutton suggested that its success was due largely to the desire of many Kentish folk to culturally distinguish themselves from neighbouring London.\n\n"}

The site is listed on New South Wales State Heritage Register and the Commonwealth Heritage List, and is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as one of 11 pre-eminent Australian Convict Sites as amongst \"the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.\"\n\nConstructed by convict labour by order of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, the Barracks is one of the most familiar works of the accomplished colonial England-born, Australian architect Francis Howard Greenway. As the principal male convict barracks in New South Wales it provided lodgings for convicts working in government employment around Sydney until its closure in mid-1848.\n\nIt has had many occupants since then. It was an Immigration Depot for single female immigrants seeking work as domestic servants and awaiting family reunion from 1848 to 1886 and also a female asylum from 1862 to 1886. From 1887 to 1979 law courts and government offices were based at the Barracks. Construction began in 1817.\n\nIn 1991, Hyde Park Barracks underwent conservation and adaptation work by award-winning architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and conservation architects Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners. The completed project won the Australian Institute of Architects national Lachlan Macquarie Award in 1992. Now, the newly installed Hyde Park Barracks is a museum operated by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales. Tourists who visit the building discover the daily lives of convicts and other occupants through exhibitions on Sydney's male convict labour force, Australia's convict system, an innovative soundscape, excavated artefacts, exposed layers of building fabric and the complex's rooms and spaces.\n\nIn June 2015, Mark Speakman the Minister for the Environment of New South Wales announced Unlocking Heritage, a two-year program aimed at giving children the opportunity to experience Sydney's living museums. This program will allow students to wear convict clothing and sleep in the Barrack's hammocks. A million dollars has been allocated for this program. Museum director Mark Goggin thinks that children will learn more about history if they can experience it hands-on, '\"Particularly for the kids to wear the convict shirts, eat the gruel, sleep over with their mates in hammocks and imagining what life was like 200 years ago.\"' The program is starting out with children and hoping to expand to adult participation.\n\nIn July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Hyde Park Barracks and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the Australian Convict Sites. The listing explains that the 11 sites present \"the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts\". Of the 11 sites the Old Great North Road, Old Government House at Parramatta and Cockatoo Island are also within the Sydney region.\n\nAccording to the Living Museum website, the fees for admission as of 2015 are $10 for adult admission, $5 for children or commissions, $20 for families (two adults and two children) and free to members. Group and school tours are available by phoning the museum. Hours of operation are 10am – 5pm daily. Closed on Christmas and Good Friday. The Hyde Barracks are one fourth of the Sydney Living History Museum series. The other three are the Susannah Place Museum, the Museum of Sydney and the Justice & Police Museum. A pass can be purchased at any of the locations that will enable visitors to visit all four locations at a discounted price. Adults $18, Children and Concessions $9.

Perry realizes there's something in the trunk of the car and shoots the lock in a rescue attempt but accidentally hits the female corpse inside as well. They cannot report the body because it appears Perry killed her.\n\nHarmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to Los Angeles, stole Harmony's credit cards, and later killed herself. Believing Harry is a detective, Harmony asks him to investigate Jenna's death as a murder. After she leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom and a planted pistol. Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police. Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case. He goes to see Harmony, who accidentally slams the door on his finger, cutting it off, and she takes him to the hospital.\n\nAt a party where Harmony is working, Harry is abducted, beaten, threatened, and ordered to cease the investigation by the killers from the lake and then let go. While taking Harry back to the hospital, Harmony sees the killers heading to Perry's stakeout. Realizing that Perry is heading into a trap, she leaves Harry in her car and rushes off to the stakeout, where she saves Perry, and one of the killers gets shot to death by a food-cart operator. A pink-haired girl, affiliated with the killers, steals Harmony's car and unwittingly drives an unconscious Harry to her safe house. The remaining lake killer arrives and shoots her; Harry recovers the pistol and shoots the killer. His finger has fallen off again, so he puts it on ice, but a dog jumps up and eats it. Harmony meets Harry at his hotel where she reveals she had told Jenna that Harlan Dexter was her real father. They quarrel in bed, when Harmony reveals she had previously slept with Harry's best friend, and he throws her out, being careful not to slam her fingers in the door.\n\nAfter Harmony disappears following a lead, Harry and Perry investigate a private health clinic owned by Harlan Dexter. Perry realizes Veronica Dexter was incarcerated there by Harlan so an impostor could drop her court case. The pair capture a guard to question him but accidentally kill him and then are captured by Dexter. He reveals he now plans to cremate his daughter's corpse to remove any remaining evidence. Harry calls Harmony, who had not actually disappeared but had simply gone to work. Harmony steals the van containing the coffin. Harry and Perry escape, but Harmony crashes the van. Perry is incapacitated in the ensuing shootout; Harry manages to kill Dexter and his thugs but is also shot.\n\nWaking in a hospital, Harry finds that Perry and Harmony are fine. Perry reveals Harmony's sister was not murdered but committed suicide. Jenna had escaped her sexually abusive father in Indiana and located Dexter, believing him to be her real father. She accidentally witnessed Dexter having sex with Veronica's impostor, the pink-haired girl. Believing this father was also incestuous, Jenna commissioned Perry and committed suicide.\n\nPerry travels back to Harmony's hometown and confronts Jenna's father, who is now bed-ridden, slapping him multiple times and calling him an animal. When the old man berates Perry for attacking a helpless old man, Perry says simply, \"Yeah, that's right. Big tough guy,\" and leaves.\n\nHaving lost the movie role to Colin Farrell, Harry gets a job working for Perry.\n\n\nFollowing the bad critical reception of \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\" and a rejection letter from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Shane Black decided he would attempt something out of the action genre. Following the example of James L. Brooks, Black attempted to make a romantic comedy, \"a quirky story of two kids in L.A.\" Brooks liked Black's first draft, but felt his later attempts were losing focus. Trying to salvage what he had liked, Brooks suggested Black to imagine Jack Nicholson from \"As Good as It Gets\" playing Nicholson's role from \"Chinatown\". This led Black to add action elements - \"I said, you know, 'Fuck it. I have to put a murder in it.'\" - and rework the screenplay, adding the character of detective \"Gay\" Perry, who Black said was an attempt to break stereotypes, as he had never seen \"the gay guy who kicks down the door, shoots everyone and bails your ass out before.\" Old detective novels were a major influence, with Black saying he tried to re-invent the genre \"using realistic characters, in a modern setting but with the spirit of 1950s and 1960s\". The crime plot drew from Brett Halliday's \"Bodies Are Where You Find Them\", and Black homaged Raymond Chandler by splitting the film into chapters named after Chandler's books.\n\nThe script, then titled \"You'll Never Die in This Town Again\", was rejected by various studios before Joel Silver, who gave Black his first break producing \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"The Last Boy Scout\", decided to help him. The leading role of the now retitled \"L.A.P.I.\" had been considered for Benicio del Toro, Hugh Grant and Johnny Knoxville. Robert Downey Jr. learned about the film from his then-girlfriend Susan Levin, who worked as Silver's assistant, and as he finished working with Silver in \"Gothika\", the producer and Black brought him in to audition. Downey was eventually cast as they liked his readings and knew he could fit into the small $15 million budget, as his career had been in a downfall following his time in prison. Levin also suggested to bring in Val Kilmer, who coincidentally had been long interested in making a comedy.\n\nBefore principal photography begun, the title became \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" because Black felt it was a \"blunt and austere title\" that described how the plot was \"half romantic comedy and half murder mystery.\" To achieve a neo-noir look, Black screened 1960s films of the genre to cinematographer Michael Barrett and production designer Aaron Osborne, such as \"Harper\" and \"Point Blank\". Osborne in particular drew inspiration from the detective book covers by illustrator Robert McGuinness, who was also brought in to draw the covers for the fictional Johnny Gossamer novels that appear in the film. The Hollywood party that opens the film was filmed in Black's own Los Angeles mansion.\n\n\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film's premiere happened at the Chinese Theatre on October 17, as the opener of the Hollywood Film Festival. \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was released on DVD June 13, 2006.\n\nThe film opened on October 21 in the United States, with a limited release. From its release until mid-November, the film's distribution increased every weekend due to its favorable critical reviews. It stayed in release in the United States until early January. The film earned a total of $4,243,756 in the United States. \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" grossed far more outside the United States, accounting for just over 70% of the film's worldwide gross, accumulating $11,541,392. The film ended up earning $15,785,148 worldwide, earning back its budget. Downey was disappointed at the low box office intake, but said \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" \"ended up being my calling card to \"Iron Man\",\" as his performance attracted director Jon Favreau. That film marked Downey's career resurrection, and Black would even be brought in to co-write and direct the sequel \"Iron Man 3\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 85% based on 174 reviews and an average rating of 7.5/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark, eclectic neo-noir homage.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score 72 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nMike Russell of \"The Oregonian\" observed that \"This is one of Downey's most enjoyable performances, and one of Kilmer's funniest. It's a relationship comedy wrapped in sharp talk and gunplay, a triumphant comeback for Black, and one of the year's best movies\". Jeff Otto, an IGN critic, wrote that \"It takes a bunch of genres and twists them into a blender, a pop relic that still feels current...one of the best times I've had at the movies this year.\" It was voted \"Overlooked Film of the Year\" by the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society on December 20, 2005.\n\nRoger Ebert's review of \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was a mixed 2.5 out of 4 stars. He wrote that the film \"contains a lot of comedy and invention, but doesn't much benefit from its clever style. The characters and plot are so promising that maybe Black should have backed off and told the story deadpan, instead of mugging so shamelessly for laughs.\"\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" with music by John Ottman was released on October 18, 2005.\n\n"}

The source code of these commercially developed and distributed video games is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\nCommercial video games are typically developed as proprietary closed source software products, with the source code treated as a trade secret (unlike open-source video games). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the end-of-life as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming abandonware.\n\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) software licenses to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. Sourceforge or GitHub), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an interpreted language such as BASIC or Python, and distributed as raw source code without being compiled; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book \"BASIC Computer Games\". In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community \"reconstructs\" source code from compiled binary files through time-demanding reverse engineering techniques. \nSource code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with unofficial patches to fix bugs or source ports to make the game compatible with new platforms.\n\nThe table below with available source code resulted not from correct releases of companies or IP holders but from unclear release situations, like lost & found and leaks of unclear legality (e.g. by an individual developer on end-of-product-life) or undeleted content.\nOnce games, or software in general, become an obsolete product for a company, the tools and source code required to re-create the game are often lost or even actively destroyed and deleted. On the closure of Atari in Sunnyvale, California in 1996, the original source code of several milestones of video game history (like Asteroids or Centipede) were thrown out as trash.\n\nWhen much time and manual work is invested it is however still possible to recover or restore a source code variant which replicates the program's functions accurately from the binary program. Techniques used here are decompiling, disassembling and reverse engineering the binary executable. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but a diverging version as a binary program does not contain all information originally carried in the original source code. Comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional debug information. The here given in \"bottom up\" development methodology re-created source-code of games is able to replicate the behaviour of the original game exactly (\"clock-cycle accurate\", \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\"), unlike game engine recreations which are often made in top down methodology resulting in general game engines and not accurately representing the original game.\n\n\n"}

This meaning is identical, and pronounced similarly to, the Manx hobby horse custom known as the \"Laare Vane\".

In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's Morris dance tradition, which became a \"nation-wide craze\" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into \"a set of sharply delineated regional traditions\".\n"}
{"id": "24077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24077", "title": "PDF", "text": "PDF\n\nThe Portable Document Format (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. Based on the PostScript language, each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it. PDF was standardized as an open format, ISO 32000, in 2008, and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation.\n\nToday, PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements, interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, rich media (including video content) and three dimensional objects using U3D or PRC, and various other data formats. The PDF specification also provides for encryption and digital signatures, file attachments and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features.\n\nAdobe Systems made the PDF specification available free of charge in 1993. In the early years PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows, and competed with a variety of formats such as DjVu, Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own PostScript format.\n\nPDF was a proprietary format controlled by Adobe until it was released as an open standard on July 1, 2008, and published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 32000-1:2008, at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1 granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe that are necessary to make, use, sell, and distribute PDF compliant implementations.\n\nPDF 1.7, the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO 32000-1, includes some proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe, such as Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) and JavaScript extension for Acrobat, which are referenced by ISO 32000-1 as normative and indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO 32000-1 specification. These proprietary technologies are not standardized and their specification is published only on Adobe’s website. Many of them are also not supported by popular third-party implementations of PDF.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, ISO 32000-2:2017 (PDF 2.0) was published. ISO 32000-2 does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references.\n\nThe PDF combines three technologies:\n\nPostScript is a page description language run in an interpreter to generate an image, a process requiring many resources. It can handle graphics and standard features of programming languages such as codice_1 and codice_2 commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as codice_3 remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and tokenized. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n\nA PDF file is a 7-bit ASCII file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the magic number and the version of the format such as codice_4. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format. A COS tree file consists primarily of \"objects\", of which there are eight types:\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (codice_9). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either \"direct\" (embedded in another object) or \"indirect\". Indirect objects are numbered with an \"object number\" and a \"generation number\" and defined between the codice_10 and codice_11 keywords. An index table, also called the cross-reference table and marked with the codice_12 keyword, follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file. This design allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (\"incremental update\"). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as \"object streams\". This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for \"Tagged PDF\".\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a trailer introduced with the codice_13 keyword. It contains\n\n\nThe dictionary contains\n\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion. PDF files may be optimized using Adobe Acrobat software or QPDF.\n\nThe basic design of how graphics are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of transparency, which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a device-independent Cartesian coordinate system to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a matrix to scale, rotate, or skew graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the \"graphics state\", which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a \"page description\". PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n\nAs in PostScript, vector graphics in PDF are constructed with \"paths\". Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic Bézier curves, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, clipping. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including \"patterns\".\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the \"tiling pattern\" in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a \"colored tiling pattern\", with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an \"uncolored tiling pattern\", which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a \"shading pattern\", which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the \"axial shade\" (Type 2) and \"radial shade\" (Type 3). \n\nRaster images in PDF (called \"Image XObjects\") are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an \"inline image\".) Images are typically \"filtered\" for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of \"external streams\" or \"Alternate Images\". Standardized subsets of PDF, including PDF/A and PDF/X, prohibit these features.\n\nText in PDF is represented by \"text elements\" in page content streams. A text element specifies that \"characters\" should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the \"encoding\" of a selected \"font resource\".\n\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital typeface. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded \"font file\". The latter case is called an \"embedded font\" while the former is called an \"unembedded font\". The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: Type 1 (and its compressed variant CFF), TrueType, and (beginning with PDF 1.6) OpenType. Additionally PDF supports the Type 3 variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. \n\nFourteen typefaces, known as the \"standard 14 fonts\", have a special significance in PDF documents:\nThese fonts are sometimes called the \"base fourteen fonts\". These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not \"guaranteed\" to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed. Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using \"character codes\" (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an \"encoding\". There are a number of predefined encodings, including \"WinAnsi\", \"MacRoman\", and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the Windows and Macintosh operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts). The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings \"Identity-H\" (for horizontal writing) and \"Identity-V\" (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a \"ToUnicode\" table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, \"opaque\": each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of \"transparency groups\", \"blending modes\", \"shape\", and \"alpha\". The model is closely aligned with the features of Adobe Illustrator version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by Adobe Photoshop at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects,\nbut they are not part of the imaging model.\n\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\nRich Media PDF is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\nInteractive Forms is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in PDF specification:\n\nAcroForms were introduced in the PDF 1.2 format. AcroForms permit using objects (\"e.g.\" text boxes, Radio buttons, \"etc.\") and some code (\"e.g.\" JavaScript).\n\nAlongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action’s ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files. The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text (CSV/TSV) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.\n\nThe Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\nBeginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document they apply to. FDF typically encapsulates information such as X.509 certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission. The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, filename extension .fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF'.\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary – such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in \"XML Forms Data Format Specification\". The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name \"ISO 19444-1:2016 – Document management – XML Forms Data Format – Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)\". This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1 / PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and accessibility. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including assistive technology (AT), is uneven at this time. ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; PDF/UA, was first published in 2012.\n\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication. However, since a SHA-1 collision was discovered making use of the PDF format, digital signatures using SHA-1 have been shown to be insecure.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a \"user password\", which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an \"owner password\", which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and AcroForm fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services. Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of information rights management. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce permissions in ways that the standard security handler does not.\n\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a bona fide granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using public-key cryptography. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a certificate from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.\n\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata. The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\nPDFs may be encrypted so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded DRM restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document. The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to Adobe Systems; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for royalty-free use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.\n\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people. PDF file formats in use can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more. Some software can automatically produce tagged PDFs, but this feature is not always enabled by default. Leading screen readers, including JAWS, Window-Eyes, Hal, and Kurzweil 1000 and 3000 can read tagged PDF. Moreover, tagged PDFs can be re-flowed and magnified for readers with visual impairments. Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\nPDF/UA, the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289-1 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named \"OUTLOOK.PDFWorm\" or \"Peachy\", uses Microsoft Outlook to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.\n\nA PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics, text, and bitmap graphics. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF – 3D drawings can be embedded using U3D or PRC and various other data formats.\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into macOS, iOS, and most Linux distributions, LibreOffice, Microsoft Office 2007 (if updated to SP2) and later, WordPerfect 9, Scribus, numerous PDF print drivers for Microsoft Windows, the pdfTeX typesetting system, the DocBook PDF tools, applications developed around Ghostscript and Adobe Acrobat itself as well as Adobe InDesign, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop. Google's online office suite Google Docs also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\nRaster image processors (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a raster format suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and prepress in a process known as rasterisation. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine from Adobe Systems and Jaws and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics.\n\nAdobe Illustrator reads and writes PDF as a semi-native format. With multipage documents, a dialog opens enabling the user to select a single page to edit. Editing paragraphs of text typically disturbs line justification and paragraph wrapping, as multiline text is converted to individual lines. In a multipage document, only the page being edited can be re-saved.\n\nInkscape version 0.46 and later allows PDF editing of a single page through an intermediate translation step involving Poppler, then the document can be exported again as PDF.\n\nScribus allows opening and editing multi-page PDF, then the document can be exported again as PDF.\n\nLibreOffice Draw (using a plugin PDFimport) can open and edit multi-page PDF, then the document can be exported again as PDF.\n\nSerif PagePlus can open, edit and save existing PDF documents, as well as publishing of documents created in the package.\n\nEnfocus PitStop Pro, a plugin for Acrobat, allows manual and automatic editing of PDF files, while the free Enfocus Browser makes it possible to edit the low-level structure of a PDF.\n\nDochub, is a free online PDF editing tool that can be used without purchasing anything.\n\nFoxit PhantomPDF is a proprietary PDF editor with an extensive set of advanced features for editing, converting and protecting PDF documents.\n\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be converted back and forth from many other formats such as:\netc.\n\nCompanies such as Adobe Acrobat provide SDK, libraries for developer to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides Adobe PDF Library, companies such as PDFTron Systems, Apache PDFBox, Foxit Software, PDFLib provide similar SDKs.\n\nAdobe Acrobat is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as free software (under the GNU General Public License) is PDFedit. Another GPL-licensed application native to the unix environment is Xournal. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The freeware Foxit Reader, available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux, allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's PDF-XChange Viewer allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. Apple's macOS's integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software Skim, with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX, SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software. Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.\n\nFor mobile annotation, iAnnotate PDF (from Branchfire) and GoodReader (from Aji) allow annotation of PDFs as well as exporting summaries of the annotations.\n\nThere are also web annotation systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats, e.g., A.nnotate, crocodoc, WebNotes.\n\nIn cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required. Some programs that accept ink input from the mouse may not be responsive enough for handwriting input on a tablet. Existing solutions on the PC include PDF Annotator and Qiqqa.\n\nExamples of PDF software as online services including Scribd for viewing and storing, Pdfvue for online editing, and Thinkfree, Zamzar for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws raster image processor from Global Graphics became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.\n\nAgfa-Gevaert introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same. The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" metafile format for Mac OS X, replacing the PICT format of the earlier classic Mac OS. The imaging model of the Quartz graphics layer is based on the model common to Display PostScript and PDF, leading to the nickname \"Display PDF\". The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the Safari web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a PNG file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the Open Source Development Labs Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the Common Unix Printing System and desktop application projects such as GNOME, KDE, Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice and OpenOffice have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable printers also support PostScript, but most PostScript printers do not support direct PDF printing.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation once considered one of their high priority projects to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\" In 2011, however, the GNU PDF project was removed from the list of \"high priority projects\" due to the maturation of the Poppler library, which has enjoyed wider use in applications such as Evince with the GNOME desktop environment. Poppler is based on Xpdf code base. There are also commercial development libraries available as listed in List of PDF software.\n\nThe Apache PDFBox project of the Apache Software Foundation is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents. PDFBox is licensed under the Apache License.\n\n\n"}

The Pāli texts are the oldest collection of Buddhist scriptures preserved in the language in which they were written down.\n\nThe society first compiled, edited, and published Latin script versions of a large corpus of Pāli literature, including the Pāli Canon, as well as commentarial, exegetical texts, and histories. It publishes translations of many Pāli texts. It also publishes ancillary works including dictionaries, concordances, books for students of Pāli and a journal.\n\nThomas William Rhys Davids was one of three British civil servants who were posted to Sri Lanka, in the 19th century, the others being George Turnour, and Robert Caesar Childers (1838–1876). At this time Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was struggling under the weight of foreign rule and intense missionary activity by Christians. It was an administrative requirement that all civil servants should be familiar with the language, literature, and culture of the land in which they were posted, so the three men studied with several scholar monks where, along with an introduction to Sinhala culture and language, they became interested in Buddhism.\n\nThe \"Pāli Text Society\" was founded on the model of the Early English Text Society with Rhys Davids counting on support from a lot of European scholars and Sri Lankan scholar monks. The work of bringing out the Roman text editions of the Pāli Canon was not financially rewarding, but was achieved with the backing of the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka who underwrote the printing costs.\n\nChilders published the first Pāli-English dictionary in 1874. This was superseded in 1925 by the new dictionary which had largely been compiled by T. W. Rhys Davids over 40 years, but was finished by his student William Stede. Currently another dictionary is being compiled by Margaret Cone, with the first of three volumes (A - Kh) published in 2001.\n\nBy 1922, when T. W. Rhys Davids died, the \"Pāli Text Society\" had issued 64 separate texts in 94 volumes exceeding 26,000  pages, as well a range of articles by English and European scholars.\n\nIn 1994 the Pāli Text Society inaugurated the Fragile Palm Leaves project, an attempt to catalogue and preserve Buddhist palm-leaf manuscripts from Southeast Asia. Prior to the introduction of printing presses and Western papermaking technology, texts in Southeast Asia—including the Pali scriptures—were preserved by inscription on specially preserved leaves from palm trees. The leaves were then bound together to create a complete manuscript.\n\nWhile palm-leaf manuscripts have likely been in use since before the 5th century CE, existing examples date from the 18th century and later, with the largest number having been created during the 19th century. Because of the materials used and the tropical climate, manuscripts from earlier eras are generally not found intact in palm-leaf form, and many manuscripts have been badly damaged. During the colonial era, many palm-leaf manuscripts were disassembled and destroyed, with individual pages of texts being sold as decorative \"objets d'art\" to Western collectors.\n\nThe Pāli Text Society created the Fragile Palm Leaves project to collect, catalogue, and preserve these artifacts, including scanning them into electronic formats in order to make them available to researchers without threatening their preservation. In 2001 the project was formalised as a nonprofit in Thailand as the Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation.\n\nPresidents of the Pāli Text Society since its foundation:\n\n"}

Surrounded on three sides by terraces of original intact Georgian houses, much of the southern part of the square and its centre is taken up by extensions of the Rotunda Hospital. The Garden of Remembrance is located along the northern side of this area. Its main entrance is on the eastern side of the square, with a smaller entrance on the northern side of the square.\n\nIn the south easterly corner of the square, where it meets with O'Connell Street, is sited the Gate Theatre, and the Ambassador and Pillar Room venues. Entertainments were originally developed here as part of the Rotunda Hospital scheme by Bartholomew Mosse as a revenue engine to pay for the running of what was Europe's first lying-in maternity hospital. Extensive pleasure gardens, subsequently forming the body of the square, were located to the rear of the hospital in the original development.\n\nThe Hugh Lane Gallery is on the north side of the square. It was erected in cut stone by Lord Charlemont to a design by William Chambers during the Georgian period. On this side also is the Dublin Writers Museum and the Irish Writers' Centre. The striking Gothic Revival Findlater's Church (Abbey Presbyterian Church) just up from the gallery on the same side was erected in the 1860s by Alexander Findlater, at his own expense, and which he presented to the Presbyterian congregation. One of Dublin's most acclaimed restaurants, Michelin Star since 2007, \"Chapter One\", is located on the northern side of Parnell Square between the Hugh Lane Gallery and the Writers Museum. On the south side of the square is Conway's bar (now closed), outside of which Pearse surrendered to the British Army after the 1916 Easter Rising. The political party Sinn Féin has its Dublin head office and shop on the western side of the square. The western side also is known for offices of a number of trades unions and other organisations. Also on the western side is the St. Martin's Apostolate office, which includes a small basement chapel. The St. Martin's Apostolate office is well known in Dublin for its moving crib that is open to the public each Christmas.\n\nNo 5 – Birthplace of Oliver St John Gogarty (1878–1957); writer, surgeon, and senator. A friend of Michael Collins and the writers WB Yeats and James Joyce, Gogarty was unwillingly immortalised as Buck Mulligan in the \"Ulysses\". From the early 1920s until the early 1930s No 5 served as headquarters of Cumann na nGaedheal, the governing party.\n\nNo 9 Cavendish Row – Dr Bartholomew Mosse (1713–1759); Philanthropist and surgeon. Mosse lived here, having originally hailed from Portlaoise. He founded the Rotunda Hospital, located in the square and which was built to designs of Richard Cassels between 1751 and 1757. The emergence of Parnell Square as a square is largely attributable to the pleasure gardens him as he laid out pleasure gardens to pay for the hospital.\n\nNo. 14 Parnell Square was the headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge in the 1940s and 1950s and perhaps into the 1960s. The Ard-chraobh of the Gaelic League was in this building.\n\nNo 25 Parnell Square, Gaelic League building. This building is of great significance during the period surrounding the War of Independence as it was here on 9 September 1914 that a meeting held by Supreme Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) with selected others agreed to rise up against the British before the Great War, subsequently known as the First World War, would be finished: In attendance were Eamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, James Connolly, Arthur Griffith, John MacBride, Sean MacDermott, Sean McGarry, William \"Bill\" O'Brien, Seán T. O'Kelly, Padraig Pearse, Joseph Plunkett.\n\nNo 29 – 30 Parnell Square – Formerly Vaughan's Hotel; a favourite hiding and meeting place for Michael Collins.\nNo 41 Parnell Square – this building was formerly the Irish National Forester's Hall. Prior to 1916 it was used for drilling both by the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and the Volunteers; on the eve of the outbreak of the Easter Rising Éamon de Valera assembled the 3rd Battalion here. In 1922, subsequent to the Treaty and prior to the Civil War, the IRB again met here in a failed attempt at achieving consensus on the Treaty; among the attendees were Michael Collins, Harry Boland, Liam Lynch and Eoin O'Duffy – all of whom, with the exception of O'Duffy, were dead by the end of the Irish Civil War.\n\nNo 44 Parnell Square – The Kevin Barry memorial hall is the current headquarters of Sinn Féin.\n\nNo 46 Parnell Square – Formerly the Headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge, the Irish language league, this was the venue where Thomas MacDonagh assembled the 2nd Battalion the Sunday night on the eve of the 1916 Easter Rising. In August 1917, the meetings that led to the National Executive of the Irish Republican Army being established were also here, with persons present including Éamon de Valera, Thomas Ashe, Cathal Brugha, and Michael Collins. Subsequently on 19 September 1919, in the company of Richard Mulcahy, Michael Collins set up his famous \"Squad\", composed of top-level operatives – men who would ultimately be involved with highest priority missions, such as the elimination of the British \"G Men\" agents in 1920.\n\nNo 58 Parnell Square – The Sinn Féin Bookshop and the offices of the \"An Phoblacht\" newspaper.\n\nIn June 2015, plans were revealed for the development of the northern side of Parnell Square into a cultural district. The street will be turned into a pedestrian space, the city's main library will move to the former Coláiste Mhuire buildings, a new auditorium will be built, and the gardens attached to the Rotunda Hospital will be opened up.\n\nIn September 2018, detailed plans for the new library were unveiled.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "803136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=803136", "title": "Routledge", "text": "Routledge\n\nRoutledge () is a British multinational publisher. It was founded in 1836 by George Routledge, and specialises in providing academic books, journals, & online resources in the fields of humanities, behavioural science, education, law and social science. \nThe company publishes approximately 1,800 journals and 5,000 new books each year and their backlist encompasses over 70,000 titles. Routledge is claimed to be the largest global academic publisher within humanities and social sciences.\n\nIn 1998, Routledge became a subdivision and imprint of its former rival, Taylor & Francis Group (T&F), as a result of a £90 million acquisition deal from Cinven, a venture capital group which had purchased it two years previously for £25 million. Following the merger of Informa and T&F in 2004, Routledge become a publishing unit and major imprint within the Informa 'academic publishing' division. Routledge is headquartered in the main T&F office in Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire and also operates from T&F offices globally including in Philadelphia, Melbourne, New Delhi, Singapore and Beijing.\n\nThe firm originated in 1836, when the London bookseller George Routledge published an unsuccessful guidebook, \"The Beauties of Gilsland\" with his brother-in-law W H (William Henry) Warne as assistant. In 1848 the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German Tauchnitz family, which became known as the \"Railway Library\".\n\nThe venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne's Brother Frederick Warne, to found the company, George Routledge & Co. in 1851. \nThe following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of Uncle Tom's Cabin, (in the public domain in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author Edward Bulwer-Lytton £20,000 for a 10-year lease allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their \"Railway Library\" series.\nThe company was restyled in 1858 as Routledge, Warne & Routledge when George Routledge's son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W.H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37). Gaining rights to some titles, he founded Frederick Warne & Co in 1865, which became known for its Beatrix Potter books. In July 1865, George Routledge's son Edmund Routledge became a partner, and the firm became George Routledge & Sons.\n\nBy 1899 the company was running close to bankruptcy. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist Sir William Crookes, banker Arthur Ellis Franklin, William Swan Sonnenschein as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912 the company took over the management of Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co., the descendant of companies founded by Charles Kegan Paul, Alexander Chenevix Trench, Nicholas Trübner, and George Redway.\n\nThese early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward, the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint \"Kegan Paul Trench Trubner\", as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the umlaut had been quietly dropped in the First World War) under the name of Routledge & Kegan Paul. Using C.K Ogden and later Karl Mannheim as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in philosophy, psychology and the social sciences.\n\nIn 1985, Routledge & Kegan Paul joined with Associated Book Publishers (ABP), which was later acquired by International Thomson in 1987. Under Thomson's ownership, Routledge's name and operations were retained, and, in 1996, a management buyout financed by the European private equity firm Cinven saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. Just two year later, Cinven and Routledge's directors accepted a deal for Routledge's acquisition by Taylor & Francis Group (T&F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.\n\nIn 2004, T&F became a division within Informa plc after a merger. Routledge continues as a primary publishing unit and imprint within Informa's 'academic publishing' division, publishing academic humanities and social science books, journals, reference \nworks and digital products. Routledge has grown considerably as a result of organic growth and acquisitions of other publishing companies and other publishers' titles by its parent company. Humanities and social sciences titles acquired by T&F from other publishers are rebranded under the Routledge imprint.\n\nThe famous English publisher Fredric Warburg was a commissioning editor at Routledge during the early 20th century. Novelist Nina Stibbe, author of \"Love, Nina\", worked at the company as a commissioning editor in the 1990s.\n\nRoutledge has published many of the greatest thinkers and scholars of the last hundred years, including Adorno, Bohm, Butler, Derrida, Einstein, Foucault, Freud, Hayek, Jung, Levi-Strauss, McLuhan, Marcuse, Popper, Russell, Sartre and Wittgenstein. The republished works of these authors have appeared as part of the Routledge Classics and Routledge Great Minds series. Competitors to the series are Verso Books' Radical Thinkers, Penguin Classics and Oxford World's Classics.\n\nTaylor and Francis closed down the Routledge print encyclopaedia division in 2006. Some of its publications were:\n\nReference Works by Europa Publications, published by Routledge:\n\nMany of Routledge's reference works are published in print and electronic formats as Routledge Handbooks and have their own dedicated website: Routledge Handbooks Online. The company also publishes several online encyclopedias and collections of digital content such as Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism Routledge Performance Archive, and South Asia Archive.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2636884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2636884", "title": "Source criticism", "text": "Source criticism\n\nSource criticism (or information evaluation) is the process of evaluating an information source, i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid, reliable or relevant. Broadly, \"source criticism\" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.\n\nProblems in translation: The Danish word \"kildekritik\" like the Norwegian word \"kildekritikk\" and the Swedish word \"källkritik\" derived from the German \"Quellenkritik\" and is closely associated with the German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886). Hardtwig writes: \"His [Ranke's] first work \"Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen Völker\" von 1494–1514 (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, \"Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber\" (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of textual criticism used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing\" (Hardtwig, 2001, p. 12739).\nThe larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies would be dominated by the research-oriented\nconception of historical method of the so-called\nHistorical School in Germany, led by historians as\nLeopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception\nof history, long been regarded as the beginning\nof modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the\n'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the\nmethodical character of history to source criticism\" (Lorenz, 2001).\nBible studies dominate the use of \"source criticism\" in America (cf. Hjørland, 2008). The term is thus relatively seldom used in English about historical methods and historiography (cf. Hjørland, 2008). This difference between European and American use of \"source criticism\" is somewhat strange considering the influence of Ranke on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been suggested that differences in the use of the term are not accidental but due to different views of the historical method. In the German/Scandinavian tradition this subject is seen as important, whereas in the Anglo-American tradition it is believed that historical methods must be specific and associated with the subject studied, for which reason there is no general field of \"source criticism\".\n\nIn the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere source evaluation (or information evaluation) is also studied interdisciplinarily from many different points of view, partly caused by the influence of the Internet. It is a growing field in, among other fields, library and information science. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.\n\nThe following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997) written by historians:\n\nWe may add the following principles:\n\n\"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out\". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).\n\"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand\" (Savolainen, 2007).\nThe following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):\n\n\nFor literary sources we might add complementing criteria:\n\n\nHow general are principles of source criticism?\nSome principles are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources. One may ask whether principles of source criticism are unique to the humanities?\n\nThere is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between natural science and humanities. Logical positivism claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas hermeneutics is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of Jürgen Habermas. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Thomas Kuhn understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory. The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus \"doubly hermeneutic\".\n\nNatural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and, for example, academic fraud).\n\nEpistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources. Empiricism evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid. Rationalism provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful observations must be grasped by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view. Historicism evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development. Pragmatism evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.\n\nThe evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If we accept the principle of fallibilism we also have to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section is source criticism intimately linked to scientific methods.\n\nThe presence of fallacies of argument in sources is another kind of philosophical criteria for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the 'ad hominem fallacy' (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the 'straw man fallacy' (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) See also fallacy.\n\nResearch methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook & Crouch (1998). See also Unobtrusive measures, Triangulation (social science).\n\nStudies of quality evaluation processes such as peer review, book reviews and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of scientific misconduct.\n\nHarris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, Little Albert, has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of reception history (how Watson's paper was received). It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.\n\nSee also Hjørland (2008): Empirical studies of the quality of science.\n\nTextual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of philology, which is not just devoted to the study of texts, but also to edit and produce \"scientific editions\", \"scholarly editions\", \"standard editions\", \"historical editions\", \"reliable editions\", \"reliable texts\", \"text editions\" or \"critical editions\", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept \"source criticism\" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed \"kildekritisk udgave\" (directly translated \"source critical edition\").\n\nIn other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce \"scholarly editions\". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.\n\n\ncomplete works and monumental editions\n\nThe study of eyewitness testimony is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that eyewitness memory is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.\n\nAnderson (1978) and Anderson & Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.\n\nIn psychoanalysis the concept of defence mechanism is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.\n\nIn schools of library and information science (LIS) is source criticism of taught as part of the growing field Information literacy.\nStudy issues like relevance, quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) and related issues are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. Bibliometrics is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. The study of book reviews and their function in evaluating books should also be mentioned. The well-known comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica (Giles, 2005) - although not done by information scientists - contained an interview with an information scientist (Michael Twidale) and should be obvious to include in LIS.\n\nIt could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School (see Gudmundsson, 2007).\n\nIn library and information science the checklist approach has often been used. A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): \"Chucking the checklist\".\n\nLibraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.\n\nThe Library of Congress has a \"Teaching with Primary Sources\" (TPS) program.\n\nSource criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., Whistleblower).\n\nPhotos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.\n\nMuch interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as Wikipedia) is reflected in the scholarly literature of Library and information science and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch & Cromwell (2001), Leth & Thurén (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, & Oliver (1997).\n\n\"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, \"Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem\" (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved.\" (Lorenz, 2001, p. 6870).\n\nAs written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).\n\nTwo of the best-known rule books from History's childhood are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois & Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell & Prevenier, 2001, p. 70-71):\n\nGudmundsson (2007, p. 38) writes: \"Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected\" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to \"tendency analysis\".\n\nIn archaeology, radiocarbon dating is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on \"scientific\" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both \"source criticism\" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of \"source materials\" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as facsimiles or transcriptions).\n\nHistoriography and Historical method include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.\n\nSource criticism, as the term is used in biblical criticism, refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term \"literary criticism\" is occasionally used as a synonym.\n\nBiblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of Jean Astruc, who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of Classical antiquity (Homer's Iliad in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the Book of Genesis. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as \"the Higher Criticism\", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.\n\nRelated to Source Criticism is Redaction Criticism which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is form criticism and tradition history which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.\n\nJournalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of information sources such as news bureaus, persons which may be interviewed, newspapers, journals and so on (see journalism sourcing). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.\n\nThe most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: Legal positivism is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while legal realism, interpretivism (legal), critical legal studies and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4512544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4512544", "title": "Sworn declaration", "text": "Sworn declaration\n\nA sworn declaration (also called a \"sworn statement\" or a \"statement under penalty of perjury\") is a document that recites facts pertinent to a legal proceeding. It is very similar to an affidavit, but unlike an affidavit, it is not witnessed and sealed by an official such as a notary public. Instead, the person making the declaration signs a separate endorsement paragraph at the end of the document, stating that the declaration is made under penalty of perjury.\n\nIn legal proceedings, generally, facts that rely upon an individual's memory or knowledge are most reliably proven by having the person give testimony in court: he appears in person before a judge, at a time and place known to other interested persons, swears that his testimony will be true, states his testimony so that all can hear it, and can be cross-examined by opposing parties. Generally, the written record of his testimony is taken down in written form by an official of the court, the court reporter.\n\nSuch a procedure, although maximizing fairness and the likelihood of obtaining the truth, is expensive, troublesome, and time-consuming. Therefore, in many instances, especially in preliminary or uncontested proceedings, a court will allow testimonial evidence to be given in a document filed with the clerk of court. Traditionally, this has required an affidavit: the person must put his testimony into written form and then sign the document in front of an official, such as a notary public or clerk, swearing to the official that the contents of the document are true. The official then endorses the document and generally stamps it with an official seal. Such an affidavit has several advantages over simple signed testimony: \n\nIn recent years, however, to provide for even greater economy of time and money, courts have increasingly allowed persons to omit the step of swearing before a notary public or official. Instead, the affiant puts a separate paragraph at the end of the document, such as the following (for United States federal courts):\nI declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). Where allowed, such an endorsement gives the document the same weight as an affidavit, per The document is called a \"sworn declaration\" or \"sworn statement\" instead of an affidavit, and the maker is called a \"declarant\" rather than an \"affiant\", but other than this difference in terminology, the two are treated identically by the court.\n\nA sworn declaration used in place of an affidavit must be specifically authorized by statute. The federal courts and a few states have general statutes allowing a sworn declaration in any matter where an affidavit can be used. In other cases, sworn statements are allowed for some purposes, but not others.\n\nOne drawback to the use of a sworn statement instead of an affidavit is that, while the protection of liability for perjury is retained, the protection of having an independent official witness the signing, check the affiant's identification, etc., is lost. This function is essentially taken over by the attorney for the party in whose favor the affidavit is given; the court relies upon the honesty of the attorney, or, perhaps more realistically, upon the attorney's fear of being disbarred, to guarantee that the declarant is competent to testify, is who he says he is, and has actually sworn to the truth of the facts stated. Another incentive for attorneys to make sure that the text of a declaration precisely matches the declarant's recollection is that the witness may be subject to impeachment at trial if the discrepancies between the declaration and any later testimony turn out to be significant.\n\nYet another more practical drawback is the conservative nature of the law. Even if use of a sworn statement is fully authorized, another individual to the transaction—such as a party to a business transaction or another person's attorney—may be unacquainted with the form and refuse to accept it in lieu of a notarized affidavit.\n\n"}
{"id": "39509646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39509646", "title": "Tiangong Kaiwu", "text": "Tiangong Kaiwu\n\nThe Tiangong Kaiwu (天工開物), or The Exploitation of the Works of Nature was a Chinese encyclopedia compiled by Song Yingxing. It was published in May 1637 with funding provided by Song's patron Tu Shaokui. The \"Tiangong Kaiwu\" is an encyclopedia covering a wide range of technical issues, including the use of various gunpowder weapons. Copies of the book were very scarce in China during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) (due to the government's establishment of monopolies over certain industries described in the book), but original copies of the book were preserved in Japan. \n\nIt featured detailed illustrations that were valuable for historians in understanding many early Chinese production processes. For example, illustrations for brick-making; one shows a kilnmaster checking the temperature of a furnace while an assistant stands by and douses the kiln to induce superficial glazing; another illustration shows a brick-maker filling a wooden mold with clay while he dresses the brick's surface with a finishing wire strung on a bow.\n\nAs the historian Joseph Needham points out, the vast amount of accurately drawn illustrations in this encyclopedia dwarfed the amount provided in previous Chinese encyclopedias, making it a valuable written work in the history of Chinese literature. \nAt the same time, the Tiangong Kaiwu broke from Chinese tradition by rarely referencing previous written work. It is instead written in a style strongly suggestive of first-hand experience. In the preface to the work, Song attributed this deviation from tradition to his poverty and low standing.\n\nThe technical encyclopedia of the \"Tiangong Kaiwu\" was divided into separate chapters with broad overall themes, which included \n\nIn the first chapter, The Growing of Grains, Song Yingxing wrote about the great necessity of rural farmers in society, and although they were emulated by tradition, were scoffed at by aristocrats throughout time. Song Yingxing began the chapter with the context of this paragraph in mind:\n\nSong wrote about the general terms used in agriculture, saying that the \"hundred grains\" referred to crops in general, while the \"five grains\" were specifically sesamum, legumes, wheat, panicled millet, and glutinous millet (rice was not included in this, says Song, because the ancients were only used to the environment of northern China, which was devoid of rice at the time). He wrote about the meticulous and proper cultivation of each crop, as well as how to avoid agricultural disasters in the process.\n\nIn aiding the text, he also provided many different drawn illustrations, including a man loosening the soil by ploughing with an ox, soil broken into fine particles by an ox-drawn harrow, men engaging in foot weeding and hand weeding of rice, a vertical waterwheel with hollow wooden cylinders dipping water into an open woodwork tub feeding an irrigation canal, a cylinder-type chain pump powered by a vertical waterwheel placed in a narrow, low-lying stream with a mounted rotating wheel placed at the top of an elevated plane, whereupon the cylinders fed water into an irrigation canal, a wooden river dam correcting the flow of water around a field of crops, a sluice gate controlling the flow of a water channel, a square-pallet chain pump powered by a horizontal waterwheel, connected by an axle to a gear-tooth wheel above, which in turn engaged a vertical gear-tooth wheel, another square-pallet chain pump employing an ox-drawn set of geared wheels, two different types of foot-treadle operated chain pumps, a counterweighted lever for raising or lowering a bucket, a pulley-wheel for raising or lowering a bucket, an ox-drawn plough-seeder with a cone-shaped filter, an ox-drawn pair of stone rollers, used for pressing seeds into the soil, the simpler process of sewing seeds by hand and pressing them into the dirt by foot, and finally, an illustration of men cultivating wheat with broad-headed hoes.\n\nIn another chapter, The Preparation of Grains, he also provided illustrations for rolling rice grains with a wooden ox-drawn roller, a crank-operated rotary-fan winnowing machine that separated husks, a hand-operated wooden hulling mill, a hand-operated earthen hulling machine, a process of sieving to separate husk-free grains, two types of foot-operated trip hammers, a hydraulic-powered trip hammer powered by a waterwheel that rotated an axle of overhead cams, a horse-drawn hulling mill, an oxen-drawn grinding mill, a grinding mill operated by a vertical waterwheel, and a rolling mill operated by a horizontal waterwheel, the waterwheel placed in a rushing current found under a wooden deck that rotated the axle of the stone roller above within the interior of a building.\n\nThe subject of maritime and nautical technology and engineering was discussed extensively by Song Yingxing. Song noted that in northern China the chief means of transportation was by carriage and cart, while in southern China it was by ship and boat. He provided various nuances about nautical matters, such as metal anchors for battleships and seagoing vessels weighing up to 30,000 catties. Song noted that there were thousands of names classifying different boats found in China, which was often named in accordance to their overall shape, cargo capacity, and quality (of material used and construction). For example, he described the layout and construction of the grain tribute boat as a shallow, flat-bottom craft, with the preferred woods of cedar and chestnut being used to construct the bulkhead compartments of the hull. Song also wrote of the methods used by the Chinese in his day for pearl diving in Guangdong. Song wrote that these divers were able to stay underwater for prolonged periods of time since a secure rope was tied around their waists connected to the ship as they breathed through a long curving pipe that led up above the surface of the water. This long breathing tube was strengthened by rings of tin and fastened to a watertight leather face mask. A drawn illustration of this was provided in his book.\n\nIn his admiration for the stern-mounted steering rudder (which had been known to the Chinese since at least the 1st century AD), he wrote:\n\nSong Yingxing opened his chapter on clothing with the aspects of sericulture in producing silk. He gave an accurate description of the raising of silkworms, along with their instinctual mating tradition. Those raising the silkworms had their eggs deposited on sheets of paper or cloth, and stored for use in the following year. He wrote that in some regions a bathing process was used on these sheets, employing rain water, lime water, or brine, and gave specifications on the timing for this during winter, in the 12th month of the year. The reason for this, he said, was so that the inferior eggs would die in the process, hence less mulberry leaves would be consumed needlessly. He also provided specifications on how to avoid damaging the eggs in the long process of preparation before the bathing process in the 12th month. He noted the differences between two general forms of silkworms, late and early, while providing information on a wide variety in different silkworm breeds and cocoons, and even silkworm diseases. After their eventful hatching, he described the proper living conditions and environment that the silkworms should be immersed in, as well as the care that should be given in feeding them. He warned of different sources of foul odors and smoke that had the capability of killing the silkworms if they came into contact. He described the spinning of cocoons, gathering of cocoons, sorting of cocoons, and the different pests such as birds and mosquitoes that should be avoided, He also described the proper planting of mulberry trees and how to harvest them. For the process of making silk, he noted that raw silk could not be reeled into normal silk until a formal wadding process was done. He described the reeling of silk fabric with a reeling machine, the spooling of silk fibers, the spinning of silk fibers into weft yarns, the silken threads drawn into a warp frame for weaving, and the \"ingenious\" works of figure designing. He also described the proper dimensions of different draw looms,\n\nSong Yingxing wrote that although silk was reserved for those with economic means, both rich and poor used cotton clothing during the winter. In ancient times, he said, cotton was called \"xima\" ('nettle-hemp'). He outlined two different types of cotton and their characteristics: tree cotton (Ceiba pentandra) and the cotton plant (Gossypium indicum). He noted their planting in spring and their picking by autumn, as well as use of a cotton gin to separate cotton seeds that are naturally tightly fastened to fiber bolls of cotton. He noted the process of straightening the cotton fibers with wooden boards, which prepared them for the spinning wheel, the \"slivers drawn out to desired size and twisted into yarns.\" After describing the weaving process of cotton and the different patterns used, he also described cotton padding during winter, in ancient times it was hemp padding, and that the rich could afford silk padding in their winter attire. In addition to these he also described different fur, woolen, and felt clothing.\n\nIn China, the 'five metals' were gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, although the term could be extended in general terms to any sort of metal. He wrote of how gold was held to be the most precious metal of them all, and that it could be obtained in the mountains, panned from river sand, and from underground mining. He also outlined the different grades of gold and its malleable qualities. To eliminate trace elements of other metals found in gold alloys, Song Yingxing outlined the use of a crucible technique.\n\nSong Yingxing wrote that ancient rulers of early China cast inscriptions of writing onto bronze tripods since this was a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls. He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron. He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 catties of copper, 4,000 catties of tin, 50 oz. of gold, and 120 oz. of silver in its composition. In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a drymold construction of lime and mortar that was dried and covered in ox fat and beeswax. Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and charcoal powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread on the surface of the wax several inches thick. When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold. With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans, metal statues, metal barrels of cannons, metallic mirrors, and different metallic coins of copper or iron. He described the processes of hammer forging with the initial casting of an anvil, and noted that in the heating process of forging, coal accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%. He also outlined the quench-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and steel products were forged. He outlined the different types of knives, axes, hoes, file tools, awls, saws, wood chisels, anchors, and metal needles that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after \"a hundred smeltings,\" but the core of the sword was still made of wrought iron; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.\n\nThere were many manufacturing processes described in the \"Tiangong Kaiwu\". For example, for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions, the book illustrated how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize. For the preparation of saltpetre, Song Yingxing wrote:\n\nMany of the gunpowder weapons that Song Yingxing described were similar to those in the Chinese \"Huolongjing\" of the earlier 14th century, although there are many noted differences between the two. For example, the \"Huolongjing\" described a land mine that was triggered by motion of the enemy above, with a pin release that let down falling weights which would use rope and axle to rotate a flint steel-wheel which in turn sent sparks onto a train of fuses for the mines. It also described an explosive naval mine that was timed by a fuse and sent down river to an enemy ship. However, it was the \"Tiangong Kaiwu\" of Song Yingxing that outlined the use of a rip-cord pulled from ambushers hidden on a nearby shore that would trigger the steel-wheel mechanism in producing sparks for the naval mine placed in the river or lake. Song Yingxing also outlined the different types of metals that were preferable in casting different types of handguns and cannons.\n\nSong Yingxing described a 'match for ten thousand armies' bomb as follows:\n\nThe historian Needham notes that Song Yingxing must not have been much of a military man with extensive knowledge of martial matters, due to his enthusiasm for this archaic type of bomb that had been used by the Chinese since the Song Dynasty in the 12th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "233217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233217", "title": "Tiger shark", "text": "Tiger shark\n\nThe tiger shark (\"Galeocerdo cuvier\") is a species of requiem shark and the only extant member of the genus Galeocerdo. It is a large macropredator, capable of attaining a length over . Populations are found in many tropical and temperate waters, especially around central Pacific islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which resemble a tiger's pattern, but fade as the shark matures.\n\nThe tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, with a range of prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and even other smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a \"garbage eater\", consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach. Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups of killer whales. It is considered a near threatened species due to finning and fishing by humans.\n\nThe tiger shark is second only to the great white in recorded fatal attacks on humans.\n\nThe shark was first described by Peron and Lesueur in 1822, and was given the name \"Squalus cuvier\". Müller and Henle in 1837 renamed it \"Galeocerdo tigrinus\". The genus, \"Galeocerdo\", is derived from the Greek \"galeos\", which means shark, and \"kerdo\", the word for fox. It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.\n\nThe tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes, the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also including the small catsharks and hammerhead sharks. Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the blue shark (\"Prionace glauca\"), lemon shark (\"Negaprion brevirostris\"), and bull shark (\"Carcharhinus leucas\").\n\nThe tiger shark commonly attains a length of and weighs around . It is dimorphic, with exceptionally large females reportedly measuring over , and the largest males . Weights of particularly large female tiger sharks can exceed . One pregnant female caught off Australia reportedly measured long and weighed . Even larger unconfirmed catches have been claimed. Some papers have accepted a record of an exceptional length for a tiger shark, but since this is far larger than any scientifically observed specimen, verification would be needed.\n\nAmong the largest extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark (\"Rhincodon typus\"), the basking shark (\"Cetorhinus maximus\"), and the great white shark (\"Carcharodon carcharias\"). Some other species such as megamouth sharks (\"Megachasma pelagios\"), Pacific sleeper sharks (\"Somniosus pacificus\"), Greenland sharks (\"Somniosus microcephalus\"), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (\"Hexanchus griseus\") broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are comparatively poorly studied, whether their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark is unclear. The great hammerhead (\"Sphyrna mokarran\"), a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark, has a similar or even greater average body length, but is lighter and less bulky, with a maximum known weight of .\n\nTiger shark teeth are unique with very sharp, pronounced serrations and an unmistakable sideways-pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the shark's life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter than those of a great white shark, but they are nearly as broad as the root as the great white's teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.\n\nA tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.\n\nThe skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged, since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.\n\nSharks do not have moveable upper or lower eyelids, but the tiger shark—among other sharks—has a nictitating membrane, a clear eyelid that can cover the eye. A reflective layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture photons of visible light. This enhances vision in low-light conditions.\n\nThe tiger shark is often found close to the coast, mainly in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world. Its behavior is primarily nomadic, but is guided by warmer currents, and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months. It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs, but it does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters. In the western Pacific Ocean, the shark has been found as far north as Japan and as far south as New Zealand. It has also been recorded in the Mediterranean, but so far only on two occasions, firstly off Spain and then off Sicily.\n\nTiger sharks can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico, North American beaches, and parts of South America. It is also commonly observed in the Caribbean Sea. Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa, China, India, Australia, and Indonesia.\n\nCertain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of , but some sources claim they move into shallow water normally thought to be too shallow for a species of its size. A recent study showed the average tiger shark would be recorded at , making tiger sharks uncommonly seen in shallow water. However, tiger sharks in Hawaii have been observed in depths as shallow as and regularly observed in coastal waters at depths of .\n\nThe tiger shark is an apex predator and has a reputation for eating almost anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, and mollusks including cephalopods. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (\"Tursiops\"), common dolphins (\"Delphinus\"), spotted dolphins (\"Stenella\"), dugongs (\"Dugong dugon\"), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (\"Dermochelys coriacea\"), the loggerhead (\"Caretta caretta\") and the green sea turtles (\"Chelonia mydas\"),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (\"Carcharhinus plumbeus\")), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.\n\nDue to high risk of predation, dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (\"Megaptera novaeangliae\") in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and has been documented doing so alongside great white sharks.\n\nEvidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast. Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks. To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.\n\nThe broad, heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark to take on these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.\n\nNotably, terrestrial mammals, including horses (\"Equus ferus caballus\"), goats (\"Capra aegagrus hircus\"), sheep (\"Ovis aries\"), dogs (\"Canis lupus familiaris\"), cats (\"Felis catus\"), and brown rats (\"Rattus norvegicus\"), are fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes were found in the stomach of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.\n\nAll tiger sharks generally swim slowly, which, combined with cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks are one of the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.\n\nMales reach sexual maturity at and females at . Typical weight of relatively young sexually mature specimens, which often locally comprise the majority of tiger sharks encountered per game-fishing and scientific studies, is around . Females mate once every three years. They breed by internal fertilization. The male inserts one of his claspers into the female's genital opening (cloaca), acting as a guide for the sperm. The male uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure, often causing the female considerable discomfort. Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May, with birth between April and June the following year. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place in November, December, or early January. The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed.\n\nThe young develop inside the mother's body up to 16 months. Litters range from 10 to 80 pups. A newborn is generally long. How long tiger sharks live is unknown, but they can live longer than 12 years.\n\nThe tiger shark is captured and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined where they have been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future. They are considered a near threatened species due to excessive finning and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nWhile shark fin has very few nutrients, shark liver has a high concentration of vitamin A, which is used in the production of vitamin oils. In addition, the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin, as well as by big-game fishers.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list, which is a list of fish commonly sold around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\n\nAlthough sharks rarely bite humans, the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large share of fatal shark-bite incidents, and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. Typically, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal; one notable survivor of such an attack is surfing champion Bethany Hamilton, who lost her left arm at age 13 to a tiger shark in 2003. This bite rate is very low, considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.\n\nBetween 1959 and 2000, 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in an effort to protect the tourism industry. Despite damaging the shark population, these efforts were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks. Feeding sharks in Hawaii (except for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices) is illegal, and interaction with them, such as cage diving, is discouraged. South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 Discovery Channel special, and underwater photographer Fiona Ayerst swam with them in the Bahamas. At \"Tiger Beach\" off Grand Bahama, uncaged diving with - and even the handling of - female tiger sharks has become a routine occurrence.\n\nThe tiger shark is considered to be sacred \"na aumakua\" (ancestor spirits) by some native Hawaiians, who think their eyeballs have special powers of visual perception. This aligns with the generally known facts about sharks and their highly developed senses.\n\n\n"}

It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like anchor plates, flue liners or LED lamps. \n\nOriginally released in 1997, Uniclass allows project information to be structured to a recognised standard. This original version has now been heavily revised, to make it more suitable for use with modern construction industry practice, and to make it compatible with BIM (Building information modeling) now and in the future. \n\nLed by the National Building Specification (NBS), experts from across the industry have developed the new system, known as Uniclass 2015. This significantly extends the scope of the previous version, and responds to industry feedback on the draft tables known as Uniclass 2, published by CPI in 2013.\n\nUniclass 2015 provides:\n\n\nUniclass 2015 has been restructured and redeveloped to provide a comprehensive system suitable for use by the entire industry, including the infrastructure, landscape, and engineering services as well as the building sector, and for all stages in a project life cycle.\n\nUniclass 2015 provides a means of structuring project information essential for the adoption of BIM Level 2. Information about a project can be generated, used and retrieved throughout the life cycle.\n\nThe initial classification work has focussed on the seven core tables that describe an asset required to support the Digital Plan of Work; additional tables covering Form of Information, Project Management and Construction Aids are also under development.\n\nUniclass 2015 has been carefully structured to be in accordance with ISO 12006-2 \"Building construction – Organization of information about construction works – Part 2: Framework for classification\". This means that Uniclass 2015 is particularly suited to use in an international context, as mapping to other similarly compliant schemes around the world is streamlined.\n\nUniclass 2015 is divided into a set of tables, each accommodating a different ‘class’ of information. These can be used to categorise information for costing, briefing, CAD layering, etc. as well as when preparing specifications or other production documents.\n\nThese tables are also suitable for buildings and other assets in use, and maintaining asset management and facilities management information.\n\nThe suite of tables are broadly hierarchical, and allow information about a project to be defined from the broadest view of it to the most detailed. For detailed design and construction, the main starting point are Entities, which are composed of Elements; Elements are made up of Systems which in turn contain Products. \n\nEntities can also be described using the Spaces and Activities tables if required, and at the more general level the Complexes table contains terms that can be thought of as groupings of Entities, Activities and Spaces. \n\nLooked at more closely, the tables comprise:\n\n\nThe tables need to be flexible and to be able to accommodate sufficient codings to ensure coverage, to allow for a multitude of items and circumstances, including new technologies and developments that are yet to emerge.\n\nEach code consists of either four or five pairs of characters. The initial pair identifies which table is being used and employs letters. The four following pairs represent groups, sub-groups, sections and objects. By selecting pairs of numbers, up to 99 items can be included in each group of codes, allowing plenty of scope for inclusion.\n\nFor example, Systems are arranged in groups with subgroups which are sub divided, which leads to the final object code.

It is part of the National Museums Liverpool group, and is promoted as \"the National Gallery of the North\" because it is not a local or regional gallery but is part of the national museums and galleries administered directly from central government funds.\n\nThe Walker Art Gallery's collection dates from 1819 when the Liverpool Royal Institution acquired 37 paintings from the collection of William Roscoe, who had to sell his collection following the failure of his banking business, though it was saved from being broken up by his friends and associates.\n\nIn 1843, the Royal Institution’s collection was displayed in a purpose-built gallery next to the Institution’s main premises. In 1850 negotiations by an association of citizens to take over the Institution’s collection, for display in a proposed art gallery, library and museum, came to nothing.\n\nThe collection grew over the following decades: in 1851 Liverpool Town Council bought Liverpool Academy’s diploma collection and further works were acquired from the Liverpool Society for the Fine Arts, founded in 1858. The competition between the Academy and Society eventually led to both collapsing.\n\nWilliam Brown Library and Museum opened in 1860, named after a Liverpool merchant whose generosity enabled the Town Council to act upon an 1852 Act of Parliament which allowed the establishment of a public library, museum and art gallery, and in 1871 the council organised the first Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, held at the new library and museum.\n\nThe success of the exhibition enabled the Library, Museum and Arts Committee to purchase works for the council’s permanent collection, buying around 150 works between 1871 and 1910. Works acquired included WF Yeames’ \"And when did you last see your father?\" and Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s \"Dante’s Dream\".\n\nDesigned by local architects Cornelius Sherlock and H. H. Vale, the Walker Art Gallery was opened on 6 September 1877 by Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby. It is named after its founding benefactor, Sir Andrew Barclay Walker (1824–1893), a former mayor of Liverpool and wealthy brewer born in Ayrshire who expanded the family business to England and moved to live in Gateacre.\n\nIn 1893, the Liverpool Royal Institution placed its collection on long-term loan to the gallery and in 1948 presented William Roscoe's collection and other works. This occurred during post-war reconstruction when the gallery was closed, re-opening in 1951. During the Second World War the gallery was taken over by the Ministry of Food and the collection was dispersed for safety.\n\nExtensions to the gallery were opened in 1884 and 1933 (following a two-year closure) when the gallery re-opened with an exhibition including Picasso and Gauguin. In 2002 the gallery re-opened following a major refurbishment.\n\nIn 1986, the gallery achieved national status, as part of the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside.\n\nThe Walker's collection includes Italian and Netherlandish paintings from 1300–1550, European art from 1550–1900, including works by Giambattista Pittoni, Rembrandt, Poussin and Degas, 18th and 19th-century British art, including a major collection of Victorian painting and many Pre-Raphaelite works, a wide collection of prints, drawings and watercolours, 20th-century works by artists such as Lucian Freud, David Hockney and Gilbert and George and a major sculpture collection. The select collection of minor or decorative arts covers a wide range, from Gothic ivories to British ceramics up to the present day.\n\nThe first John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize exhibition was held in 1957. Sponsored by Sir John Moores, founder of Littlewoods, the competition has been held every two years ever since and is the biggest painting prize in the UK.\n\nThere is a regular programme of temporary exhibitions which in 2009-10 has included Aubrey Williams, Bridget Riley, Sickert and Freud.\n\nIn 2004, the gallery staged \"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\", the first national museum exhibition of the Stuckist art movement. The Gallery also takes part in the Liverpool Biennial.\n\nThe gallery is located on William Brown Street (the only street in the UK to consist of nothing other than museums, galleries and libraries) in a neo-Classical building.\n\nThe neighbouring area includes the William Brown Library, World Museum Liverpool, St. George's Hall, Wellington's Column, Lime Street Station and the entrance to the Queensway Tunnel. The other major art gallery in Liverpool is Tate Liverpool, at the Albert Dock, which houses modern art.\n\nOn 17 December 2011, the Walker Art Gallery got a new addition to its collection - a statue of a priest vandalised by Banksy. The renowned graffiti artist has sawn off the face of an 18th-century replica stone bust and glued on a selection of bathroom tiles. The resulting 'pixellated' portrait is entitled \"Cardinal Sin\" and is believed to be a comment on the abuse scandal in the Church and its subsequent cover-up. This piece of art is displayed in Room three, which is one of the 17th-century Old Master galleries.\n\nAs of 2 July 2013, the \"La Masseuse\" sculpture by Edgar Degas, previously owned by Lucian Freud, found a permanent home at the Walker Art Gallery, thanks to the donation-in-payment system put in place by the Arts Council England.\n\n\n"}
