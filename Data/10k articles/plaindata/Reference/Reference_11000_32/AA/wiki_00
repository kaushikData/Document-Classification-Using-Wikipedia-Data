It was edited and largely authored by Joseph E. Schwartzberg, professor emeritus of South Asian Studies at the University of Minnesota. Although much of the coverage in the atlas is principally focused on India and Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh are included and to some extent Myanmar (Burma). It is highly regarded by scholars of South Asian history for its vast amount of detail and coverage of the region's lengthy and complex history. The atlas is divided into two main sections: Maps and photographs and historical text which corresponds to and explains the maps. \n\nThe initial assembly of the Atlas began in 1964 with many authors, historians, cartographers and researchers contributing over a fourteen-year period. Although many consider the atlas to be the ultimate resource for students and scholars alike, the authors stress that \"it is intended to supplement existing histories of South Asia...not to be used in place of them.\" \n\nThe atlas was first published in 1978 by the University of Chicago Press. About 3,300 total copies were produced and all of them sold, which caused the atlas to become out of print. In 1992, Schwartzberg and a new team of historians released a slightly updated second edition titled Second Impression, with Additional Material and published by Oxford University Press. This edition is now also out of print.\n\nIn 1980 the American Historical Association bestowed the Watumull Prize on the \"Atlas\".\n\n"}

For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. it claims to have over a million \"human-edited\" and verified definitions.\n\nAcronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the USAF. Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the Randolph Air Force Base in Texas His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.\n\nMolloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as \"MSG\" which Madison Square Garden wanted as a domain name (\"msg.com\") claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as monosodium glutamate and message among others.

Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority\n\nBosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority is a 2013 Supreme Court of Oklahoma case that held for the first time that the Oklahoma state constitution provided a civil remedy for violations of state constitutional rights. The recognition of civil remedies directly under the state constitution was viewed as a watershed moment in the development of civil rights in Oklahoma. Since the decision issued, claims asserting violations of state constitutional rights in Oklahoma are now colloquially referred to as \"Bosh claims.\"\n\nThe Bosh decision resulted from an incident at a local jail. Video from the facility showed a handcuffed man, later identified as Daniel Bosh, exchanging words with a jailer. The video shows the jailer leave his chair to confront Mr. Bosh. As the two men continued exchanging words, the jailer grabbed Mr. Bosh by the back of the neck and drove his head into the front of the booking desk. The jailer then placed Mr. Bosh's head underneath his arm and fell backwards causing Mr. Bosh's head to strike the floor causing injuries.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Oklahoma law provided absolute immunity for conduct occurring within a jail facility. In Bosh, the Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized that immunity conflicted with the state constitution which prohibited the use of excessive force. For this reason, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that recognizing immunity in this circumstance would nullify rights granted by the state constitution.\n\nSince the decision issued, both state and federal courts have wrestled with the scope of the opinion and how it might apply in contexts outside excessive force within a jail.\n\nThe case was argued to the Court by lawyers from the Bryan & Terrill law firm.\n"}
{"id": "7312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7312", "title": "Chauvinism", "text": "Chauvinism\n\nChauvinism is a form of extreme patriotism and a belief in national superiority and glory. Whereas patriotism and nationalism may represent temperate pride, chauvinism is \nintemperate. It can be also defined as \"an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people\". Moreover, the chauvinist's own people are seen as unique and special while the rest of the people are considered weak or inferior.\n\nAccording to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic wars. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical Bonapartist despite the unpopularity of this view in Bourbon Restoration France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.\n\n\"Chauvinism\" has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs, especially when such partisanship includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition. This French quality finds its parallel in the British term \"jingoism\", which has retained the meaning of \"chauvinism\" strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism.\n\nIn modern English, the word has come to be used in some quarters as shorthand for \"male chauvinism\", a trend reflected in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, which, as of 2018, begins its first example of use of the term \"chauvinism\" with \"an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex\".\n\nIn 1945, political theorist Hannah Arendt described the concept thus:\n\nMale chauvinism is the belief that men are superior to women. The first documented use of the phrase \"male chauvinism\" is in the 1935 Clifford Odets play \"Till the Day I Die\".\n\nThe balance of the workforce changed during World War II. As men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war, women started replacing them. After the war ended, men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employments, but they soon realized women had taken over many of their positions to fill the void, says Lloyd.\n\nLloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominate, holding positions of power while women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls, this phenomena could be a result of men being more skilled in their respective areas as well as it could be because their inherent manly nature was preferable for the purposes of productivity. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.\n\nChauvinism is seen by some as an influential factor in the TAT, a psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the \"potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation\" for women.\n\nAn often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.\n\nThe term \"female chauvinism\" has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of feminism; second-wave feminist Betty Friedan is a notable example. Ariel Levy used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, \"Female Chauvinist Pigs\", in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older misogynist stereotypes.\n"}
{"id": "19038577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19038577", "title": "Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge", "text": "Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge\n\nThe Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge is a body of knowledge, set forth in a proposal by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) entitled \"Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21st century\". This proposal seeks to identify and implement improvements to the education and licensure process for civil engineers in the United States of America. The proposal is intended to increase occupational closure by increasing the requirements to become a licensed engineer. Some have identified this joint effort with the \"Raising the Bar\" as not necessary.\n\nCivil engineering as a profession has long studied and evaluated issues associated with educational preparation for the practice of its profession and to that end, engineering societies have held conferences and prepared reports on the subject since 1918.\n\nThe first systematic efforts to evaluate and improve engineering curricula began in 1907 when the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education or SPEE, presently the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE). The Society invited several engineering societies, including the American Society of Civil Engineers to participate in a \"Joint Committee on Engineering Education of the National Engineering Societies\".\nThe committee's objective was to determine the appropriate scope of engineering education and the degree of cooperation required from the various engineering schools. \nIn 1908, the committee initially invited the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the General Education Board to appoint delegates. Notwithstanding financial assistance from ASCE, the committee approached the Foundation to assume the project and fully fund a comprehensive report. Carnegie agreed and selected Charles R. Mann (1869-1942) professor of physics at the University of Chicago. to lead the effort to prepare the 1918 formal report. \nMann recommended that knowledge and practice be equal parts of the engineering curriculum with principles of engineering distilled from practice and science and mechanics taught simultaneously. These concepts, first advanced in the early part of the 20th century, remain the \"...general organization of most engineering education today.\" Foreshadowing the emergence of the total quality management initiative, Mann argued that \"the ultimate success of any organization depends on ... the manner in which those in control coordinate and interrelate the intelligences and imaginations of men. Further, Mann claimed that engineering education was in need of \"...a healthy dose of managerial and \"humanistic\" courses...\" \n\nStarting with Mann report recommendations, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education or SPEE again organized a study on examining the results of efforts to standardize and otherwise increase the efficacy of engineering education conducted by a newly formed but temporary Board of Investigation and Coordination (BIC) supported by formal arrangements with over 150 colleges and universities, nearly every engineering institution of that time. Again, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching provided assistance along with support from the American Society of Civil Engineers and other engineering societies, the effort resulted in a seven year effort and final report- \"Report of the investigation of Engineering Education (1923-1929)\" \n\nThe report dealt with two separate but very much related issues in engineering education; separate versus unified undergraduate/graduate education and the length of this engineering education. \nThe report noted that a unified process implies in a 21st-century context is that the undergraduate and graduate engineering curriculums are complete and self-contained under the direction of a single engineering department. A divided education process implies that there is a distinct, pre-professional education stage such as that practiced by the medical, legal and dental professions The Board in 1930 found that the needs of the engineering profession was best served by allowing secondary school graduates to directly enter the engineering curriculum and this should be the norm of engineering education. This meant that unlike the unified approach to engineering education, medical, legal and dental education programs were divided and could only be entered after a distinct and separate, undergraduate education process not managed by the profession. As to the question of the appropriate length of the engineering curriculum, the Board recommended staying with the \"usual distinction between undergraduate and graduate programs where the undergraduate degree was an accredited engineering degree of fours years as the normal length (unified process). This 1930 recommendation by the BIC became the standard discipline organization for civil engineering education in specially accredited institutions: the four-year bachelor's of science degree in civil engineering or BSCE with optional graduate school coursework for advanced skills and methods, the masters of science in civil engineering, or MSCE degree. The objective of the engineering curriculum was to integrate humanistic, scientific and technological studies into a coherent program of study which is different than a degree in science by virtue of \"... a well-marked professional orientation\".\n\nThe 1930 Board report also discussed the \"normal path to progress\" taken by engineering graduates. The Board observed that industry was less inclined to emphasize differences between engineering disciplines and more inclined to focus on the distinction between discipline activities such as design from management activities. The Board noted even in the 1920s, a clear trend where graduates would work on technical activities in the early part of their career and then work on increasing percentage of what was then termed administrative activity and implicitly by today's standards, management activity.\n\nWhile reforms were being made in civil engineering education, concerns were being expressed over licensing engineering practice over self-regulation by the Societies themselves. By 1910, the civil engineering society accepted and supported the concept of State licensure of engineering practice. In 1920, the National Council of State Boards of Engineering Examiner, currently known as the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) was organized to promote fair licensure for engineers in the United States, help enforce such licensure regulations. and determine and administer appropriate levels of experience and education for professional practice and still does in the current period. In 1932, working with other engineering societies and educators such as ASCE and ASEE, the Council organized the Engineers' Council for Professional Development or ECPD. \n\nFormal accreditation by the ECPD of engineering curricula began in 1936. ECPD grew and in 1980, changed its name to Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and focus solely to accreditation of engineering education programs.\n\nASCE conducted its first engineering education conference in 1960 at Ann Arbor, Michigan. The first of six conferences on this topic over the next 35 years. The conference attendees resolved the earlier BIC recommendation of four years as the curriculum norm be changed to a five-year undergraduate degree in civil engineering. A 9168 joint study between ASCE and ASEE resulted in a report entitled \"Goals of Engineering Education\" advocated for one more year of engineering education in the form of one year of graduate level coursework. Accreditation partner, ABET experimented with dual-level accreditation where basic programs were four years in length and advanced criteria for additional undergraduate coursework. Twenty-percent of ABET's civil engineering programs requested such dual-level accreditation. Despite the initial interest, the five year undergraduate programs had a difficult time competing against the four year programs for the same bachelor's degree of science in civil engineering and ABET dropped dual-accreditation by the mid 1980s.\n\nBy 1995, the effort was again made to address the question of curriculum length as a norm. Questions at this point were again on curriculum integration but also that of the first professional degree. A professional degree, formerly known in the US as a \"first professional degree\", is a degree that prepares someone to work in a particular profession such as civil engineering and meets the minimum academic requirements for licensure or accreditation. The preparation for the 1995 conference focused on four topics: technical competence, communication skills, management concepts and teamwork. This was a clear recognition of weaknesses in curriculum content as one observer remarked -\"an engineer is hired for his or her technical skills, fired for poor people skills and promoted for leadership and management skills.\" The question was raised why recreate elementary coursework in fields such as economics or management. Attendees noted that educators must balance depth versus breadth in developing engineering curricula. With management as an example, it was noted that students can take management instruction in any number of non-engineering environments but it was important for an engineering education program to possess a design that ensured all graduates acquired a \"particular base of knowledge.\" One of the authors (Walesh) noted that one of the biggest problems faced by consulting engineers was poor project management and how few in academia recognized the importance of \"effective project management on the survival of an engineering firm...\". Noting the increased importance of management in civil engineering practice in the 21st century, the Conference stated that civil engineers must have a larger skillset than their counterparts in the 1920s with respect to knowledge in communication, teamwork and project management. This Conference then, laid the conceptual framework for looking at specialized applications of management within civil engineering curricula such as engineering management, design management construction management and project management.\n\nConferees reported out from the conference on proposed initiatives, barriers and recommended actions in eight areas, namely: faculty development, communication skills, project management, teamwork and leadership, project based learning, practitioner participation, pre-professional and professional degrees and implementation of National Science Foundation recommendation for engineering education. \n\nFormed out of recommendations from the CEEC 95 conference, the committee was chartered to investigate four areas: faculty development; integrated curriculums; practitioner involvement in the education process and the adoption of the master's degree as the first professional degree necessary to enable practice of civil engineering. The basis for the 1995 recommended change was the existence of a well developed and diverse group of graduate civil engineering programs that did not exist in the 1920s and 1930s when the earlier BIC had worked. Whereas, the 1930 BIC recommended no changes to the typical undergraduate and graduate engineering programs, the 1995 Task Committee recommended that the master's degree of science in civil engineering be recognized as the \"first professional degree\" to be recognized for professional practice. The committee also noted that this also required instruction in the principles of project management. Ultimately, the Committee recommendation to ASCE in 1998 was that the \"first professional degree\" become the new paradigm of engineering education, replacing the earlier BIC model from 1930. That same year, ASCE formalized the recommendations in a policy statement saying that ASCE supported the concept of \"...the master's degree as the First Professional Degree (FPD) for the practice of civil engineering (CE) at the professional level.\" \nThus, the impetus for the development and adoption of ASCE's Policy 465 in 1998 can be traced directly to the 1995 ASCE Education Conference held in Denver, CO, USA. \nThis proposed change was not widely accepted within the civil engineering profession \n\nIn 1999, ASCE then organized the Task Committee for the First Professional Degree and instructed it to develop an implementation strategy for ASCE's new vision and policy. The new task committee reported back in 2001 that although the earlier recommendations and adopted policy had been focused on graduate education, the committee recommended developing a holistic picture of prerequisite requirements for formal education. In this manner, it had identified the fundamental issue as the increasing inadequacy of the four year bachelor's degree as \"... formal academic preparation for the practice of civil engineering at the professional level in the 21st century.\" The report cited examples of this were inadequate communication skills, inability to manage projects profitably and failure to meet stakeholder expectations among others. It also noted that a lack of education in leadership to support the current prevalent career path of \"...starting from primarily technical work through project management and into management and leadership.\" There was an intense competition for desired leadership positions that was shared in common with other engineering disciplines, as well as from non-engineers. The best example of this is in project management which requires better educated civil engineers. In the case of the latter, more and more non-engineers are managing \"...civil engineers with the principal reason being that the non-engineers possess stronger leadership, communication and business skills...\" and leadership positions with titles such as Director of Public Works, Chief Engineer, City Engineer, Secretary of Transportation, etc. are now being filled by non-engineers \"...possessing skills which are perceived to be of greater value than those of a typical engineer.\" \n\nIn order to fully implement its vision of civil engineering, the committee recommended that the policy focus on the core principle that\n\nThe Committee's report in addition to strategies also included recommendations for an implementation plan consisting of four major action items to implement the ASCE policy over the next twenty years:\n\nIn 2001, ASCE accepted the 1999 task committee recommendations on policy. ASCE also organized the Committee on Academic Prerequisites for Professional Practice on a temporary or task basis and charged it to \"...develop, organize, and execute a detailed plan for the full implementation of the policy statement.\" In 2003, ASCE changed the committee from a task basis to a standing committee; acknowledging the effort will take many years. The 1999 committee had in fact recommended a 20-year timeframe. This is committee was also charged in 2003 with implementing another ASCE initiative, \"Raise the bar\". In 2004, the committee recommended changing the policy to reflect the society's belief that the body of knowledge necessary to practice of civil engineering at the professional level includes the \"...knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to be a licensed professional civil engineer.\" ASCE accepted those recommendations and in 2004 and modified its policy to state that \"the attainment of a body of knowledge for entry into the practice of civil engineering at the professional level\" .\n\nIn 2006, the American Society of Civil Engineers convened a \"Summit on the Future of Civil Engineering\" in response to concerns for the future of the civil engineering profession. This \"...highly-varied group of civil engineers, engineers from other disciplines, architects, educators, association and society executives, and other leaders, including participants from eight countries outside the United States...\" conceived of and developed its vision for civil engineers practicing in the global economy, in the year 2025 and then produced a report documenting that vision. Their purpose was to produce an aspirational vision that addressed \"... all levels and facets of the civil engineering community, that is, professional (licensed) civil engineers, non-licensed civil engineers, technologists, and technicians.\" The aspirational vision produced was a civil engineering profession that was \"(e)ntrusted by society to create a sustainable world and enhance the global quality of life, civil engineers serve competently, collaboratively, and ethically ...\" These civil engineers would practice using \"...widely recognized and valued knowledge ... (and) ... skills\" and attitudes. Accomplishing this aspirational vision required these future professionals to possess attributes such as formal education, work experience, and professional achievement and attitudes supportive of orchestrating \"... solutions to society's most pressing current needs while helping to create a more viable future.\" In this vision, civil engineers function as \"... planners, designers, constructors, and operators of society's economic and social engine—the built environment...\" The only way to accomplish that was for the engineering profession to agree on \"...a vision, transform engineering education, present engineers as broad-based technology leaders, accommodate innovations from non-engineering fields, and become more interdisciplinary.\" This vision also recognized an increasing requirement for the application of project management in civil engineering project due to increasing complexity and stakeholder expectations with respect to project delivery.\n\nIn discussing these future aspirations, the report also acknowledged the past efforts to reform engineering education noting that there had been \"...broad changes to the academic prerequisites to professional practice...\" where future civil engineers must provide evidence of competency with \"...the appropriate body of knowledge through education and experience.\" The Summit report in conclusion observed that ASCE's civil engineering body of knowledge was now widely accepted and more importantly, would form the basis for establishing the requirements for formal education and pre-licensure experience for civil engineers.\n\nThe National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) issued its Engineering Body of Knowledge (EBOK) in 2013.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in cooperation with the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES), issued its first edition of its Engineering Competency Model (ECM) in 2015. These reports were five or more years after the Second Edition or (CEBOK2). The Engineering Competency Model outlined \"...engineering knowledge, skills, and abilities (not attitudes) collectively referred to as competencies.\" The model is depicted in the form of a pyramid with tiers of knowledge. Although the arrangement of the tiers was not intended to be hierarchical, nor to necessarily imply some skill sets were higher than others. \"Instead, the model's tapered shape represents the increasing specialization and specificity of proficiencies covered. Its tiers are further divided into blocks that represent competency areas (i.e., groups of knowledge, skills, and abilities), which are defined using critical work functions and technical content.\" These DOL engineering competencies were not meant to be discipline specific, nor linked to specific stages of professionals development or education and importantly, do not recognize licensure as a step to professional practice. Competency models such as the ECM produced by the Department of Labor communicate a vision of business and industry requirements essential for the \"...development of curriculum, skill assessment instruments, and certifications. \" The Engineering Competency Model as developed by the DOL \"...identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for workers to perform successfully in the field of engineering.\" One commentator noted that the CEBOK2 lacked coverage in seven areas; namely, \"...Client/Stakeholder Focus, Creative Thinking, Engineering Economics, Manufacturing and Construction, Operations and Maintenance, Quality Control and Quality Assurance, and Safety.\" \n\nASCE recognized in the 1999 Committee's work that a body of specialized knowledge was required for the practice of civil engineering. This body of professional knowledge had four components: a technical and non-technical core knowledge elements, technical knowledge electives, and technical and non-technical learning to support an individual's career objectives.\nCreating a body of knowledge for the civil engineering profession was as complicated as any mega-project a civil engineer might attempt.\n\nIn the United States, the body of knowledge necessary to obtain a license to practice engineering is defined by the laws or regulations of each state or territory. Most states have a standard that is a four-step process. First, an individual must obtain a Bachelor's degree from a university program that is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. A two-step examination process administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying must be completed. The first eight-hour test is the Fundamentals of Engineering exam; the second, also eight hours long, is the Principles and Practice of Engineering exam. The other step is to work an apprenticeship, usually of four years in length, under an already-licensed engineer. The second exam is generally the fourth and final step; the fundamentals exam can be taken before or after the apprenticeship in most states.\n\nThe first state to regulate the practice of engineering was Wyoming in 1907. After that, ASCE established a model law for licensure. The last state to pass licensure laws for engineers was Montana.\n\nMany states now require continuing education to maintain a license to practice engineering. In 1979, Iowa became the first. Since then about half of the states have added continuing education to their engineering laws.\n\nThe body of knowledge defines twenty-four outcomes that make up the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to practice civil engineering. The outcomes are divided into three categories: foundational, technical, and professional, foundation, technical and professional. The body of knowledge uses Bloom's Taxonomy to outline the necessary level of achievement for each of the twenty-four outcomes.\n\nASCE has formed the BOK Educational Fulfillment Committee (BOKEdFC) to focus on self-proposed changes that the professional organization believes needs to be made to engineering education. This committee is composed of representatives from universities with four-year civil engineering programs.\n\nNCEES considered the implementation of the BOK at their 2008 annual meeting and decided to establish a task force. The task force is provide an analysis of \"(1) the potential educational, professional, regulatory, and economic impact of the master's or equivalent; and (2) any alternative solutions besides the master's or equivalent that could potentially address the challenge of better preparing engineering licensure candidates to enter the profession.\"\n\nIn 2008, Nebraska became the first to consider legislation requiring college-level education beyond the bachelor's degree as a requirement for a professional engineering license. The legislation was not enacted, in part to testimony from engineering associations. The Nebraska section of the American Council of Engineering Companies stated that the new requirement might have made it more difficult for companies located in their state to hire and keep entry-level engineers.\n\n\n"}

For instance, the price of a good, the time of its promised delivery and the description of the good will all be terms of the contract.\n\nA contractual \"[a]ny provision forming part of a contract\" Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, breach of which can give rise to litigation. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract.\n\n\nIt is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract. By way of illustration, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a theatrical production is a condition, whereas a singers obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.\n\nStatute may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s15A provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample (as described in the Act) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances.\n\n\nStatus as a term is important as a party can only take legal action for the non fulfillment of a term as opposed to representations or mere puffs. Legally speaking, only statements that amount to a term create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types:\n\nThere are various factors that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include:\n\nThe parol evidence rule limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract. This rule has practically ceased operation under UK law, but remains functional in Australian Law.\n\nA term may either be expressed or implied. An Express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract.\n\nThe Privy Council established a five stage test in \"BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings\":\n\nIn Australia, the High Court has ruled that the test in BP Refinery applies only to formal contracts, while the test in \"Byrne and Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd\" shall apply to informal contracts:\n\nThese are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships.\n\nCommon law.\n\n\nThese terms will be implied into all contracts of the same nature as a matter of law.\n\nStatutory.\n\nThe rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects. Most countries, for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each American state except Louisiana has adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which regulates contracts for the sale of goods. The most important legislation implying terms under United Kingdom law are the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided.\n\nOne is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable.\n\nIf two parties have regularly conduct business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each contract made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In \"Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd\" four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In \"British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd\" written terms were held to have been implied into an oral in which there was no mention of written terms.\n\nIt is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, Australian courts will imply an obligation to negotiate in good faith provided that certain conditions are satisfied\n\nThe test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably. There is no general obligation to act in good faith term under English contract law: an attempt was made by Lord Denning in a series of case during the 70s and 80s but they are no longer considered 'good law'. European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances. For the circumstances when an obligation of good faith may in certain circumstances be implied see Yam Seng PTE Ltd v International Trade Corporation Ltd.\n\nThe Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 reg 8 will render ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.\nRegulation 5 of the Statutory Instrument further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to English law. 'Unfair' is a term that was not individually negotiated (i.e. standard form) that \"causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer\". This is not possible if the term is not contrary to 'good faith'; such as in \"Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank\", wherein the lack of a seemingly unfair interest term would leave the bank open to a very poor deal whereby no interest could be charged.\n\nIf a contract specifies \"subject to contract\", it may fall into one of three categories:\nSubsequent authorities have been willing to recognize a fourth category in addition to those stated in \"Masters v Cameron\".\nIf a contract specifies \"subject to finance\", it imposes obligations on the purchaser:\n\nThis may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent.\nConditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract\nWith conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met.\nFailure of a condition repudiates the contract this is not to necessarily discharge it. Repudiation will always gives rise to an action for damages.\n"}

The principal series are the \"Series Graeca\" (CCSG), \"Series Latina\" (CCSL), and the \"Continuatio Mediævalis\" (CCCM). There is also a smaller section, the \"Series Apocryphorum\" (CCSA), devoted to Apocryphal works, and a collection of autographs, the \"Autographa Medii Ævi\" (CCAMA). In the series \"Conciliorum Oecumenicorum Generaliumque Decreta\" (COGD) is published confessional documents from Churches and Ecumenical organisations in the World with start in Nicæa 325 until today. The principal series are seen in some ways as successors to Migne's Patrologiae.\n\nIn 1947 Dom Eligius Dekkers, O.S.B. of the Sint-Pietersabdij in Steenbrugge, drew up a plan for editing afresh early Christian texts. His intention was to produce in a short timespan a \"Corpus Christianorum\", comprising new editions of the writings of Christian authors from Tertullian through to the Venerable Bede. Although some critics thought the project to be impracticable, Dom Eligius found support from the outset in Brepols Publishers from Turnhout. Collaboration started in 1951 with the publication of a highly valued and essential tool, the Clavis Patrum Latinorum, which paved the way for the future success of the series. New editions followed from 1953 on and ever since Corpus Christianorum has continued to flourish. New series within Corpus Christianorum have been established and new volumes were ever more regularly published. Although in the early years the modus laborandi relied on updating existing editions, this was soon replaced by the preparation of entirely new critical editions. This demanding ambition required increasing supervision and, together with the establishment of new Corpus-related initiatives, it has been necessary to establish new academic partnerships, comprising leading scholars and academic centres, to supervise every single Corpus series.\n\n"}

Over the centuries, the Enderun School was fairly successful in creating Ottoman statesmen by drawing among the empire's various ethnic groups and giving them a common Muslim education. The school was run by the \"Inner Service\" (\"Enderûn\") of the Ottoman palace and had both academic and military purposes. The graduates were expected to devote themselves to government service and be free of links to lower social groups.\n\nThe Enderun School's gifted education program has been called the world's first institutionalized education for the gifted.\n\nThe growth of Ottoman Empire is attributed and was dependent on the selection and education of statesmen. A vital component of Mehmet II's goal to revive the Roman Empire was to establish a special school to select the best youngsters within the Empire and to mold them for government. Mehmet II improved the existing palace school founded by his father, Murat II and established the Enderun Academy (Enderun) in Istanbul. \n\nThe third courtyard of the Topkapı Palace was surrounded by the Imperial Treasury, the Pavilion of the Holy Mantle, and the buildings of the Palace School, which educated the top tier of students from Enderun as well as princes of the House of Osman. There were seven halls or grades within the Palace School, and within each hall there were 12 teachers responsible for the students' mental and academic development. Students wore special uniforms designated by their achievement level, and Miller indicated that additional buildings included the library, mosque, music conservatories, dormitories, and baths.\n\nThe Enderun system consisted of three preparatory schools located outside of the palace in addition to the one within the palace walls itself. According to Miller, there were 1,000-2,000 students in three Enderun Colleges, and about 300 students in the top school in the Palace. The curriculum was divided into five main divisions:\n\n\nAt the end of the Enderun school system, the graduates would be able to speak, read, and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in science, have at least a craft or art, and excel in army command as well as in close combat skills.\n\nThe graduation ceremony for students leaving the Enderun School was known as çıkma. The graduates themselves were referred as çıkma. The name çıkma literary means \"leaving\" or \"pulling out\". The pages were leaving Palace School and palace service to continue their training in the functional service. This \"transferral\" occurred every two to seven years, or after the accession of new sultan to the throne.\n\nThe successful graduates were assigned according to their abilities into two mainstream positions: governmental or science, and those who failed to advance were assigned to military. One of the most distinctive properties of the school was its merit system consisting of carefully graded rewards and corresponding punishments.\n\n"}

{"id": "48663706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48663706", "title": "Florence Annie Conybeare", "text": "Florence Annie Conybeare\n\nFlorence Annie Conybeare (13 September 1872 – 29 February 1916) was a British campaigner for the Women's Suffrage movement. She was a fundraiser and Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) worker during the First World War, and an active member of the Women's Liberal Federation.\n\nFlorence Conybeare was born Florence Annie Strauss on 13 September 1872 at 10 St. Johns Villas, Brixton Road, Brixton, London. She was the eldest daughter of Gustave Strauss, a successful German-speaking Bohemian glass merchant and patented inventor, who emigrated to Britain and later became a naturalised British subject. Florence's father was born in 1843 in Gablonz, North Bohemia, a town in the Czech Republic known for glass and jewellery production. Florence's mother was Frances Lehmaier (b. 1852 New York, USA; d. 1893 London, England). Florence was the elder sister of Bernard Edwin Strauss (born 1874) and Lily Julia Strauss (1877-1955), who later married George May, 1st Baron May, and became Lady Lily Julia May, 1st Baroness of Weybridge.\n\nIn 1881, Florence (8) was living with her father (38) and mother (29) in \"Bleak House\", 7 Elgin Gardens, Effra Road, Brixton, in the Borough of Lambeth, London. She lived there with her brother Bernard Edwin (6 yrs) and sister Lily (4 yrs). Their household was run by four domestic servants and a cook.\n\nBy 3 April 1891, aged 18, Florence Strauss had moved to 2 West Bolton Gardens, Kensington, London—with her parents. No-one is listed as head of the household on that day as her parents were not present for census purposes. There were six servants looking after the household.\n\nOn 15 October 1896, Florence Annie Strauss, a twenty-four-year-old spinster from West Kensington, married the 43-year-old bachelor, former Liberal MP for Camborne, Cornwall, and practising barrister, Charles Augustus Vansittart Conybeare. The marriage was conducted in accordance with to the rites and ceremonies of the Theistic Church. The service was officiated by Charles Voysey, a freethinking Yorkshire vicar who was deposed for publishing heretical sermons and for denying the doctrine of everlasting hell. The church was situated in Swallow Street, Piccadilly, in the District of Westminster, London. Florence's brother and sister, Bernard and Lily, also got married in the same Theistic Church in 1900 and 1903, respectively.\n\nOn marriage, Florence Conybeare became the 'beneficial owner' of, among other properties, the \"Tregullow Offices\", a small dwelling and former mine office in Scorrier in the County of Cornwall, as part of a marriage settlement which her husband, Charles A.V. Conybeare, arranged with various parties including the wealthy merchant banker Isaac Seligman. The marriage settlement was effected by means of a Deed of Trust signed by three moneylenders, two of whom had attended the same public school as Charles Conybeare: Tonbridge School, in Kent, and one family member (uncle). \"In those days, a marriage settlement was settled upon the marriage.\" Such settlements can be compared to prenuptials and should not be confused with financial settlements made on the dissolution of a marriage. In those days, it was a convenient way for a husband-to-be to make adequate financial provision for his wife-to-be. This prevented a wife from otherwise becoming destitute as a result of the husband deserting his wife, or from having to resort to prostitution in order to support herself.\n\nBackground<br>\nOn 11 March 1891, Florence's husband Charles Conybeare conveyed various properties by way of a mortgage to William Henry Luard Pattisson and to the parties referred to in Point 2 of the 1896 Deed of Trust. In this mortgage arrangement, Charles Conybeare was able to secure a loan of ₤3,000 from his moneylenders, using the properties as collateral for the loan and the repayment of interest on the outstanding loan.\n\nDeed of Trust<br>\nOn 14 October 1896, the day before Florence got married, Charles A. V. Conybeare placed those \"various properties\" including the \"Tregullow Offices\" (known together as \"the estate\") in trust—which properties were still subject to a mortgage—to Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (Charles's brother and JP) and merchant banker Isaac Seligman. As a result, Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the legal owners and trustees of the estate. This construction enabled Charles Conybeare to confer financial benefits to Florence Conybeare, so that when parts of the estate were sold, she would be entitled to a share of the proceeds. The Deed of Trust that was drawn up to make this possible, recognised four interested parties:\n1. Charles A.V. Conybeare (husband and trustor).\n2. Jacob Luard Pattisson (civil servant), James Jollie Pattisson (teacher) and Bixby Garnham Luard (vicar and uncle to the first two): the mortgagees (read: moneylenders).\n3. Charles A.V. Conybeare and Florence Annie Conybeare (beneficial owners).\n4. Isaac Seligman and Henry Grant Madan Conybeare (legal owners and trustees).\n\n\"Although Henry Conybeare and Isaac Seligman became the owners of the legal estate the moment it was conveyed to them in 1896, they never actually owned the properties themselves. They simply held on to the properties in trust as part of a marriage settlement, and were only entitled to act on the couple's instructions\", not independently of them.\n\nFlorence sells property interest<br>\nOn 21 July 1902, Florence Conybeare was a co-signatory to the \"1902 Deed of Conveyance\" (Indenture) which instructed Isaac Seligman and Henry Conybeare to sell her beneficial interest in one of the estate's properties, namely, the \"Tregullow Offices\". In doing so, she effectively sold that property with her husband, for ₤170, to a mining engineer called Charles Rule Williams, who had recently returned from Mexico after working 15 years in silver mines at Zimapan. The new owner changed the name of the property to \"Zimapan Villa\".\n\nFlorence and Charles Conybeare lived the first part of their married life in the fashionable part of London at No. 3 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, in a flat overlooking the Thames. She lived very close to another Women's Rights campaigner, Sylvia Pankhurst, who lived down the road at No. 120 Cheyne Walk. In 1891, Florence and Charles Conybeare MP Camborne, Cornwall, moved to Tregullow House, Scorrier, Cornwall, a country pile owned by John Williams the 5th, a direct descendant of the Williams mining-moguls' dynasty. She remained there in Cornwall until at least 1902. The couple later moved to \"Oakfield Park\" in Dartford, Kent.\n\nFlorence Conybeare was an active organiser, supporter and voice within the Women’s Suffrage movement. Florence Conybeare had supported Mr. W.H. Dickenson's Women's Enfranchisement Bill which received its first reading on 8 March 1907. Up till then, married women living in the same house were not regarded as 'joint owners' of that property in the eyes of the law. The Dickenson Bill proposed that husband and wife living under the same roof should both be considered as 'joint occupiers' of the property which, as a consequence, would give married women equal status with men and the right to vote.\n\nIn her ‘treatise’ \"Some Objections Answered\" published in 1908, in which she claimed that \"Women’s Suffrage is essentially a Liberal principle\", Florence Conybeare (aka: Mrs C.A.V. Conybeare) wrote a reply to an article written by Edith Calkin, one of the women critics of Women’s Suffrage. She rebuked Calkin for wanting to deny women political recognition and argued why women should be given the right to vote, and aired her objections to Edith Calkin’s approach to women's rights.\n\nThe inequities of legislation\n\nThe plight of working women\n\nOn 24 July 1913, a meeting of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was held in a meadow in Bullace Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss Muriel Matters, had been invited to address a gathering on the subject of votes for women. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction made it clear that they were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.\n\nSpeech: Australian vs. British suffragism\n\nMuriel Matters, who had been sentenced to a month in Holloway Prison for obstruction, having earlier chained herself to a grille in the House of Commons, arrived by car with her entourage, as part of a publicity tour around the area, termed a 'pilgrimage'. In her speech, she contrasted the situation in this country with that in Australia where women already had the vote [ed. in 1902, see Women's suffrage in Australia], pointing out that women in Britain were being treated in the same way as criminals, foreigners and lunatics, despite having to pay taxes.\n\nThe journalist who reported on the event believed that most people who turned up for the meeting were not actually interested in votes for women at all, but had instead come to witness any trouble if there was any. The only violence on the day of the Dartford meeting, however, was a stone which was thrown at the wagon from a neighbouring backyard, but no damage was caused. At the end of the speech, Florence Conybeare invited Councillor W.H.D. King to give the vote of thanks. He said that he felt ashamed that he had the vote while they did not, but thanked the party for recognising Dartford as a place of importance worth visiting.\n\nFlorence Conybeare was actively engaged in Voluntary Aid Detachment work at Charing Cross Hospital, London. On 13 January 1916, when Lady Henry Grosvenor held a meeting at the new YMCA Hut at Dartford, Florence was present in VAD uniform. \"Whatever she took up, Mrs Conybeare did thoroughly and with a will\".\n\nFlorence Conybeare was actively involved in fundraising in Dartford during the First World War. \"As the grim reality developed in France, an appeal went out from Florence Conybeare, to 'all Florence's'. Her plan was to raise money to purchase and equip an ambulance which would be sent to the Western Front which would be used to move wounded British soldiers—referred to as \"the devoted sons of our Empire\" on Florence's memorial stone—from the battlegrounds back to the field hospitals. Not only did she want this done, she wanted volunteers called \"Florences\" to \"man\" the ambulance in France! She managed to raise the money, but she never got her wish to man the ambulance with Florence's.\n\nFlorence was President of the Dartford Women's Liberal Association [ed. Federation], and had largely been responsible for the setting up and running of the Babies Club.\n\nFlorence Conybeare died at her father's home in 2 West Bolton Gardens, Kensington, London, on 29 February 1916, aged 43. She left no issue. During the preceding 18 months, she had been in failing health, but no-one had anticipated her sudden demise from pneumonia. Her husband, Charles Conybeare, was unfortunately at Canterbury at the time. Florence was cremated and a memorial service was held for her in London. She was buried in the cemetery of St Mary the Virgin Church, Fryerning, Ingatestone, Essex, and lies close to Charles Conybeare's parents. Charles Conybeare had a large obelisk-shaped memorial erected in her memory, which is mounted upon a square stone plinth, and devised the following poignant inscription:\n\n\"Here rest the ashes of Florence Annie\"\n\"The beloved wife of Charles Augustus Vansittart Conybeare\"\n\"Late of 'Tregullow', Cornwall\"\n\"Who gave her life in devoted service to the gallant sons of our Empire\"\n\"She passed into immortality\"\n\"on February 29th 1916\"\n\"aged 43\"\n\"She is not dead\"\n\nOn 18 August 1916, probate was granted on Florence Conybeare's will in London to her husband Charles A.V. Conybeare. Florence died a wealthy lady, leaving effects totalling £5,392 6s 2d, which in today's money [2010] is equivalent to £232,193.\n\n1. What is Bohemian glass?<br>\n2.

Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. Lesser magic is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology and glamour (or \"wile and guile\") to bend an individual or situation to one's will.\n\nOutlined in \"The Satanic Bible\", LaVey defined magic as \"the change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable.\" This definition incorporates two broadly distinguished kinds of magic: \"greater\" and \"lesser\". According to LaVey, one of the goals of ritual magic is \"to isolate the otherwise dissipated adrenal and other emotionally induced energy, and to convert it into a dynamically transmittable force.\" LaVey defined lesser magic as \"wile and guile obtained through various devices and contrived situations, which when utilized, can create change in accordance with one's will.\" Within this system of magic, the terms warlock and witch are most commonly used by, and to refer to, male and female practitioners, respectively.\n\nLaVey espoused the view that there was an objective reality to magic, and that it relied upon natural forces that were yet to be discovered by science. Rather than characterising these as supernatural, LaVey expressed the view that they were part of the natural world. He believed that the successful use of magic involved the magician manipulating these natural forces using the force of their own willpower. LaVey also wrote of \"the balance factor\", insisting that any magical aims should be realistic. LaVey refused any division between black magic and white magic, attributing this dichotomy purely to the \"smug hypocrisy and self-deceit\" of those who called themselves \"white magicians\". Such neutrality correlates with LaVey's philosophical view of an impersonal, and therefore amoral, universe. \n\nLaVey explains his reasons for writing \"The Satanic Bible\" in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic, dismissing them as \"nothing more than sanctimonious fraud\" and \"volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy.\" He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by \"right-hand path\" authors. He tells that \"The Satanic Bible\" contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, \"What you see may not always please you, but you \"will see\"!\" Much of LaVey's ideas on magic and ritual are outlined in The Satanic Bible. LaVey explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis. The Satanic Rituals, published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely. The third book of \"The Satanic Bible\" describes rituals and magic. According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley's \"\". \n\nGreater magic is a ritual performed in order to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes, including \"compassion\" (love), \"destruction\" (hate), and \"sex\" (lust). These rituals are often considered to be magical acts, with LaVey's Satanism encouraging the practice of magic to aid one's selfish ends. Much of Satanic ritual is designed for an individual to carry out alone; this is because concentration is seen as key to performing magical acts. The ritual is referred to as an \"intellectual decompression chamber\", where skepticism and disbelief are willfully suspended, thus allowing the magicians to fully express their mental and emotional needs, holding back nothing regarding their deepest feelings and desires. LaVey listed the key components to successful ritual as: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and \"The Balance Factor\" (awareness of one's own limitations). LaVeyan rituals sometimes include anti-Christian blasphemies, which are intended to have a liberating effect on the participants. In some of the rituals, a naked woman serves as the altar; in these cases it is made explicit that the woman's body itself becomes the altar, rather than have her simply lying on an existing altar. There is no place for sexual orgies in LaVeyan ritual. Neither animal nor human sacrifice takes place. Children are banned from attending these rituals, with the only exception being the Satanic Baptism, which is specifically designed to involve infants.\n\nDetails for the various Satanic rituals are explained in \"The Book of Belial\", and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of Baphomet) are given. LaVey described a number of rituals in his book, \"The Satanic Rituals\"; these are \"dramatic performances\" with specific instructions surrounding the clothing to be worn, the music to be used, and the actions to be taken. This attention to detail in the design of the rituals was intentional, with their pageantry and theatricality intending to engage the participants' senses and aesthetic senses at various levels and enhancing the participants' willpower for magical ends. LaVey prescribed that male participants should wear black robes, while older women should wear black, and other women should dress attractively in order to stimulate sexual feelings among many of the men. All participants are instructed to wear amulets of either the upturned pentagram or the image of Baphomet. According to LaVey's instructions, on the altar is to be placed an image of Baphomet. This should be accompanied by various candles, all but one of which are to be black. The lone exception is to be a white candle, used in destructive magic, which is kept to the right of the altar. Also to be included are a bell which is rung nine times at the start and end of the ceremony, a chalice made of anything but gold, and which contains an alcoholic drink symbolizing the \"Elixir of Life\", a sword that represents aggression, a model phallus used as an aspergillum, a gong, and parchment on which requests to Satan are to be written before being burned. Although alcohol was consumed in the Church's rites, drunkenness was frowned upon and the taking of illicit drugs was forbidden.\n\nThe final book of \"The Satanic Bible\" emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic. An \"Invocation to Satan\" as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given. The \"Invocation to Satan\" commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust\" is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction\" commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion\" requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation. The rest of \"The Book of Leviathan\" is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee's original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English. LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an \"unvarnishing\" of the translations performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the 1800s, but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.\n\nIn designing these rituals, LaVey drew upon a variety of older sources, with scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld noting that LaVey \"assembled rituals from a hodgepodge of historical sources, literary as well as esoteric\". LaVey openly toyed with the use of literature and popular culture in other rituals and ceremonies, thus appealing to artifice, pageantry, and showmanship. For instance, he published an outline of a ritual which he termed the \"Call to Cthulhu\" which drew upon the stories of the alien god Cthulhu authored by American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. In this rite, set to take place at night in a secluded location near to a turbulent body of water, a celebrant takes on the role of Cthulhu and appears before the assembled Satanists, signing a pact between them in the language of Lovecraft's fictional \"Old Ones\".\n\nLesser magic, also referred to as \"everyday\" or \"situational\" magic, is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology. LaVey wrote that a key concept in lesser magic is the “command to look”, which can be accomplished by utilizing elements of “sex, sentiment, and wonder”, in addition to the utilization of looks, body language, scents, color, patterns, and odor. LaVey wrote that the terms \"fascination\" and \"glamour\" have origins in the world of \"coercive\" magic. The word \"fascination\" comes from the Latin word \"fascinare\", which means \"to cast a spell upon\". This system encourages a form of manipulative role-play, wherein the practitioner may alter several elements of their physical appearance in order to aid them in seducing or \"bewitching\" an object of desire.\n\nLaVey developed “The Synthesizer Clock”, the purpose of which is to divide humans into distinct groups of people based primarily on body shape and personality traits. The synthesizer is modeled as a clock, and based on concepts of somatotypes. The clock is intended to aid a witch in identifying themselves, subsequently aiding in utilizing the “attraction of opposites” to “spellbind” the witch's object of desire by assuming the opposite role. The successful application of lesser magic is said to be built upon one's understanding of their place on the clock. Upon finding your position on the clock, you are encouraged to adapt it as seen fit, and perfect your type by harmonizing its element for better success. LaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract his or her attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor.\n\nDyrendal referred to LaVey's techniques as “Erving Goffman meets William Mortensen”. Drawing insights from psychology, biology, and sociology, Petersen noted that lesser magic combines occult and “rejected sciences of body analysis [and] temperaments.”\n\nIn the \"Book of Belial\", he discusses three types of rituals: lust rituals which work to entice another person, destruction rituals to destroy another person and compassion rituals to improve health, intelligence, success. Lust rituals are designed to attract the desired romantic or sexual partner and can involve masturbation, with orgasm as the goal. Destruction rituals are designed to do harm to others and involve the symbolic annihilation of an enemy through the use of \"vicarious\" human sacrifice often involving a customized effigy representing the intended victim which is then put through ritual fire, smashing, or other representation of obliteration. Compassion rituals are designed with the intent of helping people (including oneself), to evoke overwhelming pathos or sadness, and crying is strongly encouraged.\n\nIn \"The Satanic Rituals\", LaVey makes a distinction between the ritual and the ceremony, stating that rituals \"...are directed for a specific end that the performer desires\", and that ceremonies are \"...pageants paying homage to or commemorating an event, aspect of life, admired personage, or declaration of faith [...] a ritual is used to attain, while a ceremony serves to sustain\". LaVey emphasized that in his tradition, Satanic rites came in two forms, neither of which were acts of worship; in his terminology, \"rituals\" were intended to bring about change, whereas \"ceremonies\" celebrated a particular occasion. \n\nA satanic baptism is a ceremony for a child is intended to be a symbolic recognition of the infant as being born a Satanist and is only to be performed for those under the age of four, as LaVey claimed that beyond this age, the child has already begun to be influenced by \"alien\" ideas. Adult baptisms serve as a declaration of \"faith\", where \"falsehoods, hypocrisy and shame of the past\" are symbolically cast away. In 1967, LaVey performed the first publicly recorded Satanic baptism in history for his youngest daughter Zeena, which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on \"The Satanic Mass\" LP. The Satanic Baptisms were written by LaVey and published in \"The Satanic Rituals\".\n\nIn February 1967, LaVey officiated the first Satanic wedding, the much publicized marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The Satanic Wedding ceremony was written by LaVey, but was never officially published. An official Satanic wedding ceremony was published in \"The Satanic Scriptures\" in 2007. The first Satanic funeral was for U.S. naval machinist-repairman, third-class, and Church of Satan member Edward Olsen. It was performed by LaVey at the request of Olsen's wife, complete with a chrome-helmeted honor guard. The Satanic Funeral rite was first published in \"The Satanic Scriptures\".\n\nLaVey also developed his own Black Mass, which was designed as a form of deconditioning to free the participant from any inhibitions that they developed living in Christian society. He noted that in composing the Black Mass rite, he had drawn upon the work of Charles Baudelaire and Joris-Karl Huysmans.\n\nLaVey utilized the symbolism of the Four Crown Princes of Hell in \"The Satanic Bible\", with each chapter of the book being named after each Prince. \"The Book of Satan: The Infernal Diatribe\", \"The Book of Lucifer: The Enlightenment\", \"The Book of Belial: Mastery of the Earth\", and \"The Book of Leviathan: The Raging Sea\". This association was inspired by the demonic hierarchy from \"The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage\". \n\nThe adversary, representing opposition, the element of fire, the direction of the south, and the Sigil of Baphomet during ritual. \nThe bringer of light, representing pride and enlightenment, the element of air, the direction of the east, and candles during ritual. \nThe baseness of the earth, independence and self-sufficiency, the element of earth, the direction of the north, and the sword during ritual. \nThe great dragon, representing primal secrecy, the element of water, the direction of the west, and the chalice during ritual.\n\n\"Hail Satan\" a common greeting and ritual term in the Church of Satan, both in its English form, \"Hail Satan\", as well as in the Latin version of it, \"Ave Satanas\". When \"Ave Satanas\" is used, it is often preceded by the term \"Rege Satanas\" (\"Reign, Satan\"). (\"Rege Satanas\" can be heard in the video of a widely publicized Church of Satan wedding performed by LaVey on February 1, 1967.) The combination \"Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Hail Satan!\" is found as a greeting in early Church of Satan correspondence, as well as in their 1968 recording \"The Satanic Mass\", and ultimately in their 1969 book \"The Satanic Bible\". The phrase is used in some versions of the Black Mass, where it often accompanies the phrase Shemhamforash and is said at the end of each prayer. This rite was performed by the Church of Satan\nappearing in the documentary Satanis in 1969. \n\n"}

It was originally published by Beacon Press, in Boston MA, United States, in 1998. The piece is both memoir and cookbook. Short essays precede recipes written in personal vernacular, and these recipes cover locations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the United States.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of celebrations and the food that accompanies them, mentioning Frederick Douglass's lack of enthusiasm for the celebration of the Fourth of July, and asking why \"would they want to celebrate the American Declaration of Liberation while the Fugitive Slave Act, which allowed the kidnapping of free slaves back to slave states on the word of any white man, was in effect?\" It details a winter during which Shange, determined to give her daughter a traditional Owens/Wilsons holiday, searches Clinton - Washington for ingredients. She looks for ways to recreate the traditional flavors, for she \"tried to make again my very colored childhood and my very 'black' adolescence.\" In this first chapter, Shange expresses feeling a connection to her ancestors through the re-creation of pig's feet, chitlins' Hoppin’ John, baked ham, collard greens and cornbread with syrup despite experiencing the holiday in a friends home and eating alone.\n\nChapter 2 takes the reader to St. Louis and Shange uses the experience of listening to a short wave radio emanating the sounds of Fidel Castro as a child to talk about her experiences in Cuba as an adult. She says that her child was one of Cuba's Young Pioneers and shared food, recipes and traditions with children from a multitude of other locations, such as Zimbabwe and Palestine. While in Cuba, the author experiences a blackface performance, which she is horrified by. She eats avocado with beer and reminds herself that \"history, our history, mustn't scare me.\" Cuba's slave trade history is discussed, and Shange is concerned with \"How'd all these hardworking - cutting cane is torturous labor - Africans get fed and what'd they eat?\"\n\nIn Chapter 3, Shange is in Nicaragua. She describes it as the \"little country with the black people on one side of the mountain and the mestizoes and blancos on the other, while the Amerindians made a way for themselves in the jungles as best they could.\" She shows the East and West coast as being uncommunicative and disconnected and the area she is familiar with being left with no infrastructure, which she describes as detrimental to the community. Shange's journey to the house of the esteemed poet Rubén Darío leads her to participate in a bus ride during the entire bus singing along to Usted Abuso, by Shange's favorite salsa singer. This makes her feel at home. Shange runs into Carlos Johnson and partakes in the experience of a dance hall. saying \"we connect to the culture of the people we live with\",\n\nShange is in Brixton, a working-class West Indian neighborhood and she describes shopping in the area with her daughter, as they look for food items. Savannah and Shange prepare for her friend Leila's birthday dinner, and each of the ingredients used is described. At the end of the chapter, she mentions the fact that Leila's partner Darcus Howe is from Trinidad and Tobago, and makes a reference to the presence of slavery in East India. She ends with the quote: \"Now we are independent. We own the soil. We have our own name. We have our own flag. Let us have some wine and some music.\"\n\nIn Chapter 5, Shange is in the world of the Caribbean, and looking at the \"matter of the flyin' fish\" in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. Here, she describes the different ways in which two communities looked at one commodity. The Trinidad and Tobago fishermen were catching the flyin fish that were essential to the Barbadian diet, and didn’t eat it. While the Barbadians argued that it was wrong for them to catch the fish that they didn’t even eat and then sell it back as a profit, they said that they were only supplying the demand. She then says that who knows what would happen if the Barbadians came after shark meat, which is treasured by the Trinidadians.\n\nChapter 6 is about Brazil. Shange talks about the different colors of the populations of different sections of Brazil, saying that the south is industrialized and \"mythologically white\", while it's thought that the \"Africans\" live in the north. She talks about how when she was at a university in Bahia she asked each student to bring in the beginning of a performance piece or something based either off their lives or the world as they knew it. Each student talked about a myth, which she found disturbing and says that \"My students were validating themselves as the 'other' where they were not the other.\" Shange says that \"We are not folklore.\" In terms of Brazil, she says that \"the epitome and apex of Brazilian life may be the continually multiplying mulatta, but we must all eat whatever our hue, or the hue and cry over who we are.\" She then goes about looking at what makes up the primary dishes, focusing on Brazilian rice. Shange makes the point that Brazil has the highest percentage of people of African descent who live outside continent and that \"We eat what they eat, just differently. These recipes have stayed with us for centuries, being improvised here and there, where we found somethin' we were accustomed to in, say, Guinea was not available at the mouth of the Amazon.\"\n\nIn Chapter 7, Shange talks about the Juba, \"a dance of coutrin'\", that is found in the Caribbean and the community of slaves in North America. Chapter 7 briefly discusses dance in slave culture and says that \"it's time to tend to our own gardens. Let's grow some sweet potatoes to keep the niggah alive.\" It mentions the crops that were carried into the new world, and talks about Carolina rice, which Shange was raised on. It talks about different preparations of rice, and Shange relates style of cooking to location. She chides her mother for thinking that spice and a burnt bottom are ruining the rice, when rice with a crusty bottom is common in the Caribbean. Shange then goes back to dance, talking about classes taken at the Clark Center.\n\nChapter 8 talks about the assimilation of people to western territories and how old dishes are adapted to new locations, as well as the lack of knowledge newly arrived slaves had about the treatment of Native Americans. It talks about the ramifications of the Dred Scott decision. Oklahoma is mentioned as \"our nearest place of safety\", and A. G. Belton is mentioned as an entrepreneur who wrote to the American Colonization Society about the problems of post slavery communities. She questions the Buffalo Soldiers' treatment of the Native Americans and the way that \"we changed, made necessary readjustments to our gods and belief systems to accommodate the Christianity thrust upon us as our salvation.\" (p. 54). She also discusses debate around bones of freemen that were found along Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia. She says that bones have to be moved to make room for other things and that it was acceptable for the removed bones to be moved because they belonged to what were considered a \"lower species of man\". This leads to a part about the treatment of deceased African - Americans and what happens to their remains. Shange says that the world of slavery and the European took \"what the world was to us out of our control?\"\n\nChapter 9 looks at African Americans in Texas. She says that slaves in Texas weren't immediately informed that they were free until General Order number three was issued. African American Texans created their own independence day (Juneteenth) and she asserts that they found ways of finding community. She describes arenas commanded by African American cowboys who were continuing tradition, as well as her own participation. She says that rodeos were another venue for food, with women producing barbecue; she provides a recipe for Texan beef barbecue. She tells a story about convincing her father to come see her race barrels in Hitchcock, Texas, and about the barbecue they had. She details her father's reaction the barbecue and sauce, and his comparison of it to his own barbecue. Shange makes mention of the fact that \"I was raised to experiment with taste and sound, thus my interest in music, language, and food, but more importantly to never turn my nose or chin up to any kinda food that anybody ate.\"\n\nChapter 10 begins with a mention of Elijah Muhammad's column \"How to Eat to Live\". Shange talks about Frank Yerby's play Foxes of Harrow and looks at his characters \"defiant and self - determining\" and at Yerby as someone who actively rejected Southern antebellum life, without denying its existence. From there, Shange looks at refusing food as \"one of many methods Africans used to maintain some dignity, some control of their lives\". She discusses the relationship between crackheads, dope fiends and slavery and writes that \"Cooking is a way of insisting on living,\" and saying that \"When we are hungry for life, we search out spice, aromas, and texture to entice and please those around us.\" She uses gumbo as an example here and references the cities of Charleston and New Orleans. She discusses different ways to make roux and then the way to add okra to gumbo, yet says that her own immediate family does not like okra.\n\nChapter 11 looks at boys. Shange says that from the first, she was expected to serve boys food, and that this was part of a dating ritual \"to prove I was of value, valued my visitors and our time together so much that I made a hands-on effort to create something for whoever this person was\". She discusses her adolescent reaction to it and her later realization that was being taught an important \"Southern/African tradition of sharing the best I had with visitors\". (p. 80). She describes the link between cooking and self value, as well as the energy and importance of time in the kitchen. She mentions that music can assist the kitchen process.\n\nChapter 12 looks at the need \"to re-create a 'where' for our people\". It looks at people who do not commit to the American way of life. Shange talks about meeting a Rastafarian in Cancun, Mexico, and the ways in which African culture was destabilized during slavery. She uses the limitation of diet as an example. Yvette, a friend, is used as an example; she explains that her vegetarianism is an alternative choice to the meat and dairy diet suggested by America. In this chapter, Shange looks at the idea that African Americans are a \"people in transition\" describes the first bembe she ever attended and talks about African-American Jews.\n\nThe epilogue contains references to Shange's dance experience and talks about sugar, giving people something to make them happy, and providing dessert recipes.\n\nThe author herself once described this difficult to define project as one of \"writing some thoughts about food\", It allows the author to see herself both within the tradition she is exploring as an individual, and is a tribute to black cuisine as a food that reflects the spirit and history of a people. Shange actually moved her bedroom into the kitchen while writing the book. She looks at food as something that celebrates the history, migration and soul of a people. Here, food provides the backdrop and basis for questions of identity that involve origin, relocation and what ultimately has the power to bring people together. The essays before each recipe endow them with historical, emotional, and communal importance. The small essays allow her to \"understand or recognize herself in the history and culture of other African - origin people of the world... travels to Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or places undeniably products of the African Diaspora launch Shange's thoughts on being and identity.\" Shange puts extreme value on food, evident in an interview with The Sun, in which she says that \"I believe you should eat and prepare food with the same care you treat a newborn infant\",\n\n\"if i can cook / you know god can\" explores history, and the ways in which food and culture are intertwined. Different people, cultures and locations come together in the food put on the table, and the recipes that the food comes from. By writing about the food culture she comes from, Shange asserts the importance of the food she details and provides recipes for, the food that is important to her people. She claims this food culture, and history, as important, worthy of recognition, remembrance, and immortality in writing. Shange refuses to let this history be ignored. As stated by \"Mosaic Literary Magazine\": \"This is not a cookbook, it's a food lesson, a means by which the African diasporic existence is ultimately justified.\" Shange sees connection between food and history, and has said that \"I also wanted to write about {blacks'} relationship to food as a people in bondage and how that changed.\" In this work, Shange actively addresses the past, and \"goes well beyond mere listings of ingredients to show how various foods reflect the black experience from the slave ships to the present\". For example, Shange introduces the readers to \"Afro-Atlantic foodways\", which is a type of food that came to being on slave ships.\n\nThis piece discusses the importance of location in relation to food. Eating brings people together. Shange displays the ways in which recipes are adapted according to location. When people move, they bring a food history with them, and yet it evolves according to the availability of ingredients, culture, traditions and influence of present location. Therefore, recipes are spread to different locations, evolving and yet simultaneously staying true to tradition. In a review in \"The Booklist\" by Alice Joyce, she says that Shange \"paints a fervent, richly impassioned chronicle of African-American experience, at the same time making note of political situations and discord among the peoples of these nations and recording how connections are made beyond issues of class or skin color. Recipes serve as savory, nourishing garnishes\" Shange displays the ways in which certain recipes and traditions have survived over time, allowing people to remember and recall Africa, even when in a different place. Food is a way for \"black folks in the Western Hemisphere to be full\". For example, Shange \"identifies the African-American migration west after the Civil War and how the voyage was fueled by the hunting and farming skills folks learned during slavery. She makes these connections from a fundamental love for and admiration of the development of African contributions to the new world order\". Shange claims that by continuing, but adapting, past food culture to location, African Americans declare the presence and importance of their culture in a new location, such as the United States. She is asking the questions \"Where did black folks end up? How did they cope with relocation?\" and realizing that the answer is \"at the table, where hearts, minds, and bellies come together and are made full\".\n\nShange looks at food as a feature of memory as well, for not only is the memory of history bestowed upon food but food, as a product of a long and rich culture, can trigger memory. When Shange spends New Years with her daughter in New York, she has an \"insatiable desire to recreate for her daughter the family holidays she remembered\".\n\nThis work is a tribute to the universality and individuality of food, for it connects an entire group of people and yet can remain a specific, unique experience. As said in \"The Austin Chronicle\", \"it's clear in her book that Shange takes a great deal of pleasure in the preparation, presentation, and savoring of well-prepared food\". Shange writes her recipes with a specific reader in mind, one who will understand the references she makes and who has a prior knowledge of the foods she discusses. Shange reclaims the food history of her people, while dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions through an identification of facts, experiences, and feelings both cultural, historical, and social. Food ties people together, and Shange makes the point that \"Our food isn't reflective of our lack of culture, it is, in fact, the very opposite - it's the foundation from which we grow and continue to thrive.\"\n\nThe recipes and essays are written informally in a personable tone of an experienced person conveying exactly how to recreate a recipe. The recipes make allowances for individual preference and skill level, while at the same time making basic assumptions about the reader's knowledge base. Shange writes in \"trademark lilting vernacular\" The voice of a piece is extremely important, for Shange said in an interview with Neal A. Lester in 1990 that \"I'm a firm believer that language and how we use language determines how we act, and how we act then determines our lives and other people's lives.\"\n"}

Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works \"The Hobbit\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"The Silmarillion\".\n\nHe served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\n\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including \"The Silmarillion\". These, together with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings.\n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". \"Forbes\" ranked him the 5th top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.\n\nTolkien's paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family had emigrated from Germany in the 18th century but had become \"quickly intensely English\". According to the family tradition, the Tolkiens had arrived in England in 1756, as refugees from Frederick the Great's invasion of the Electorate of Saxony during the Seven Years' War. Several families with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling live in northwestern Germany, mainly in Lower Saxony and Hamburg.\n\nTolkien believed his surname derived from the German word \"tollkühn\", meaning \"foolhardy\", and jokingly inserted himself as a \"cameo\" into \"The Notion Club Papers\" under the literally translated name Rashbold. However, this origin of the name has not been proven.\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, \"née\" Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.\n\nAs a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.\n\nWhen he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm of Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.\n\nMabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.\n\nTolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked \"Treasure Island\" and \"The Pied Piper\" and thought \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll was \"amusing but disturbing\". He liked stories about \"Red Indians\" (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by George MacDonald. In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.\n\nMabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family, which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J.R.R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could live without treatment—insulin would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, \"My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"\n\nPrior to her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called \"Father Francis\": \"He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was \"not\". I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about 'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists.\"\n\nAfter his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St. Philip's School. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's Officers Training Corps who helped \"line the route\" for the 1910 coronation parade of King George V. Like the other cadets from King Edward's, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.\n\nWhile in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.\n\nTolkien learned Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears. Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.\n\nIn 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library. After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a \"council\" in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.\n\nIn 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter, noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, \"the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams\". They went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.\n\nIn October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. He initially studied Classics but changed his course in 1913 to English Language and Literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class honours in his final examinations.\n\nAt the age of 16, J.R.R. Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey Carpenter,\nHis guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien's having \"muffed\" his exams and considered it \"altogether unfortunate\" that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, Protestant woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter, with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled:\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at Cheltenham. He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. Edith said, however, that she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\". Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick, on 22 March 1916. In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.\n\nIn August 1914 the United Kingdom entered the First World War. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the British Army. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled, \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\", and entered a programme wherein he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his Finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\". He was then commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915. He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, for eleven months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained, \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\" Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote, \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then ... it was like a death.\"\n\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's (BEF) base depot at Étaples. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division.\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled \"The Lonely Isle\", which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.\n\nHe left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempré, near Amiens. He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire. According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"\n\nTolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the British Army's postal censorship, the Tolkiens developed a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the Western Front. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n\nOn 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien came down with trench fever, a disease carried by the lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916. Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.\nTolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.\n\nAccording to John Garth: \n\nIn later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the Second World War were entirely mistaken:\nA weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.\n\nDuring his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called \"The Book of Lost Tales\", beginning with \"The Fall of Gondolin\". \"Lost Tales\" represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-Boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\".\n\nTolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918. When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,\n\nThis incident inspired the account of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nOn 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant. His first civilian job after World War I was at the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter \"W\". In 1920, he took up a post as Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, and became the youngest professor there. While at Leeds, he produced \"A Middle English Vocabulary\" and a definitive edition of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" with E. V. Gordon, both becoming academic standard works for several decades. He also translated \"Sir Gawain\", \"Pearl\", and \"Sir Orfeo\". In 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.\n\nIn mid-1919 he began to privately tutor undergraduates, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years.\n\nDuring his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote \"The Hobbit\" and the first two volumes of \"The Lord of the Rings\", whilst living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford (where a blue plaque was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \"Nodens\", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.\n\nIn the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of \"Beowulf\", which he finished in 1926. He never published it. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than forty years after Tolkien's death and almost 90 years since its completion.\n\nTen years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, \"\", which had a lasting influence on \"Beowulf\" research. Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about \"Beowulf\" is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements. At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated \"Beowulf\" for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of \"Beowulf\" was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem. Where \"Beowulf\" does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements. In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: \"Beowulf is among my most valued sources\", and this influence may be seen throughout his Middle-earth legendarium.\n\nAccording to Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on \"Beowulf\":\n\nDecades later, W.H. Auden wrote to his former professor,\n\nIn the run-up to the Second World War, Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker. In January 1939, he was asked whether he would be prepared to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency. He replied in the affirmative and, beginning on 27 March, took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School. A record of his training was found which included the notation \"keen\" next to his name, although Tolkien scholar Anders Stenström suggested that \"In all likelihood, that is not a record of Tolkien's interest, but a note about how to pronounce the name.\" He was informed in October that his services would not be required.\n\nIn 1945, Tolkien moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for University College, Dublin, for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed \"The Lord of the Rings\" in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.\n\nTolkien also translated the Book of Jonah for the \"Jerusalem Bible\", which was published in 1966.\n\nThe Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.\n\nDuring his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement. At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"\n\nFan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.\n\nAccording to Humphrey Carpenter:\n\nEdith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to Simon Tolkien:\n\nTolkien was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 New Year Honours and received the insignia of the Order at Buckingham Palace on 28 March 1972. In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary Doctorate of Letters.\n\nTolkien had the name Lúthien engraved on Edith's tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, with Beren added to his name. The engravings read:\n\nIn Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.\n\nTolkien was a devout Roman Catholic, and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with libertarian, distributist, and monarchist leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, \"My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to 'unconstitutional' Monarchy.\"\n\nAlthough he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, \"The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies.\"\n\nTolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and simpler life. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle. This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced \"industrialization\" of the Shire in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nMany commentators have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. \"The Lord of the Rings\" is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory. This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Tolkien objected strongly to C. S. Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical. However, Tolkien wrote that the Mount Doom scene exemplified lines from the Lord's Prayer.\n\nHis love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed mythology to be the divine echo of \"the Truth\". This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled \"Mythopoeia\". His theory that myths held \"fundamental truths\" became a central theme of the Inklings in general.\n\nTolkien's devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of C. S. Lewis from atheism to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the Church of England.\n\nHe once said, \"It may be said that the chief purpose of life, for any one of us, is to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\"\n\nAccording to his grandson Simon Tolkien, Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the liturgical reforms and changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council:\n\nTolkien voiced support for the Nationalists (eventually led by Franco during the Spanish Civil War) upon hearing that communist Republicans were destroying churches and killing priests and nuns.\n\nTolkien was contemptuous of Joseph Stalin. During World WarII, Tolkien referred to Stalin as \"that bloodthirsty old murderer\". However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that \"The Lord of the Rings\" was an anti-communist parable and identified Sauron with Stalin. Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such \"reading\", which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought.\"\n\nTolkien vocally opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party prior to the Second World War, and was known to especially despise Nazi racist and anti-Semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release \"The Hobbit\" in Nazi Germany. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of Aryan origin. In a letter to his British publisher Stanley Unwin, he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\". He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"Aryan\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of Indo-Iranian languages. He continued,\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\":\n\nIn 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \"Nordic\", a term he said he disliked because of its association with racialist theories.\n\nTolkien criticized Allied use of total-war tactics against civilians of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:\n\nHe also reacted with anger to the excesses of anti-German propaganda during World War II. In 1944 he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:\n\nTolkien was horrified by the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, referring to the scientists of the Manhattan Project as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"Babel-builders\".\n\nDuring most of his own life conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.\n\nTolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his \"legendarium\", beginning with \"The Book of Lost Tales\", written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme. The two most prominent stories, the tale of Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin, were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in \"The Lays of Beleriand\").\n\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, from which he took hints for the names of features such as the Dead Marshes in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Mirkwood, along with some general aspects of approach.\n\nEdward Wyke-Smith's \"The Marvellous Land of Snergs\", with its \"table-high\" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in \"The Hobbit\".\n\nTolkien also cited H. Rider Haggard's novel \"She\" in a telephone interview: \"I suppose as a boy \"She\" interested me as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving.\" A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the \"Testament of Isildur\" in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the \"Book of Mazarbul\". Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.\n\nTolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by S. R. Crockett's historical novel \"The Black Douglas\" and of basing the Necromancer (Sauron) on its villain, Gilles de Retz. Incidents in both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are similar in narrative and style to the novel, and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.\n\nTolkien was inspired by early Germanic, especially Old English, literature, poetry, and mythology, which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included Old English literature such as \"Beowulf\", Norse sagas such as the \"Volsunga saga\" and the \"Hervarar saga\", the \"Poetic Edda\", the \"Prose Edda\", the \"Nibelungenlied\", and numerous other culturally related works. Despite the similarities of his work to the \"Volsunga saga\" and the \"Nibelungenlied\", which were the basis for Richard Wagner's opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", Tolkien dismissed critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\" However, some critics believe that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to Wagner for elements such as the \"concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ...\" Two of the characteristics possessed by the One Ring, its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner's opera.\n\nTolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas. Sophocles' play \"Oedipus Rex\" he cited as inspiring elements of \"The Silmarillion\" and \"The Children of Húrin\". In addition, Tolkien first read William Forsell Kirby's translation of the Finnish national epic, the \"Kalevala\", while attending King Edward's School. He described its character of Väinämöinen as one of his influences for Gandalf the Grey. The \"Kalevala\"'s antihero Kullervo was further described as an inspiration for Túrin Turambar. Dimitra Fimi, Douglas A. Anderson, John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of Celtic (Irish, Scottish and Welsh) history and legends. However, after the \"Silmarillion\" manuscript was rejected, in part for its \"eye-splitting\" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin:\n\nOne of Tolkien's purposes when writing his Middle-earth books was to create what his biographer Humphrey Carpenter called a \"mythology for England\" with Carpenter citing in support Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman complaining of the \"poverty of my country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil)\" unlike the Celtic nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which all had their own well developed mythologies. Tolkien himself never used the exact phrase \"a mythology for England\", but he often made statements to that effect, writing to one reader that his intention in writing the Middle-earth stories was \"to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own\". In the early 20th century, proponents of Irish nationalism like the poet William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory and others had succeeded in linking in the public mind traditional Irish folk tales of fairies and elves to Irish national identity while denigrating English folk tales as being merely derivative of Irish folk tales. This had prompted a backlash by English writers, leading to a savage war of words about which nation had the more authentic and better fairy tales with for example the English essayist G. K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales. Even though there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic. Tolkien with his determination to write a \"mythology for England\" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences. Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\" of the semi-divine Tuatha Dé Danann who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland. Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha Dé Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians. Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha Dé Danann are driven underground, which causes their \"fading\", leading them to become diminutive and pale.\n\nCatholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit. Tolkien acknowledged this himself:\nSpecifically, Paul H. Kocher argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in \"The Lord of the Rings\", such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as Thomas Aquinas, \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\". Tom Shippey makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\", known as the \"Lays of Boethius\". Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond. He goes on to argue that in \"The Lord of the Rings\" evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good (though not independent to the point of the Manichaean heresy), and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.\n\nStratford Caldecott also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"\n\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic \"Beowulf\" by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. \"Beowulf\" is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of \"Beowulf\" which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:\n\nIn addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as \"The Father Christmas Letters\"). Other works included \"Mr. Bliss\" and \"Roverandom\" (for children), and \"Leaf by Niggle\" (part of \"Tree and Leaf\"), \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", \"Smith of Wootton Major\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\". \"Roverandom\" and \"Smith of Wootton Major\", like \"The Hobbit\", borrowed ideas from his \"legendarium\".\n\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called \"The Hobbit\", which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel \"The Lord of the Rings\" (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for \"The Lord of the Rings\", during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". Both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are set against the background of \"The Silmarillion\", but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be a children's tale in the style of \"The Hobbit\", but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to \"The Hobbit\", it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in \"The Silmarillion\" and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted by the BBC, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was found to be the UK's \"Best-loved Novel\". Australians voted \"The Lord of the Rings\" \"My Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\". In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd \"greatest Briton\" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the SABC3's Great South Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK's \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be their favourite work of literature.\n\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the \"Quenta Silmarillion\", an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with \"The Lord of the Rings\", but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be published in three volumes. The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series \"The History of Middle-earth\", edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of \"The Fall of Númenor\", which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis.\n\nTolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his literary executor, and he (with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as \"The Silmarillion\" in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.\n\nIn 1980 Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title \"Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth\". In subsequent years (1983–1996) he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called \"The History of Middle-earth\". They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\", the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing \"The Hobbit\" for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.\n\nOne of Tolkien's least-known short works is the children's storybook \"Mr. Bliss\", published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of \"The Hobbit\". The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.\n\nMore recently, in 2007, \"The Children of Húrin\" was published by HarperCollins (in the UK and Canada) and Houghton Mifflin (in the US). The novel tells the story of Túrin Turambar and his sister Nienor, children of Húrin Thalion. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from \"The Silmarillion\", \"Unfinished Tales\", \"The History of Middle-earth\", and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n\"The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún\", which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of Sigurd and the fall of the Niflungs from Germanic mythology. It is a narrative poem composed in alliterative verse and is modelled after the Old Norse poetry of the Elder Edda. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\" In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien wrote,\n\n\"The Fall of Arthur\", published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is alliterative, extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the Old English \"Beowulf\" metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman Migration Period, both in form (using Germanic verse) and in content, showing Arthur as a British warlord fighting the Saxon invasion, while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the Saxon lands (\"Arthur eastward in arms purposed\").\n\n\"\", published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem \"Beowulf\" from Old English to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\". The book also includes the previously unpublished \"Sellic Spell\" and two versions of \"The Lay of Beowulf\". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background, while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme.\n\n\"The Story of Kullervo\", first published in \"Tolkien Studies\" in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.\n\n\"The Tale of Beren and Lúthien\" is one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien's legendarium. The story is one of three contained within \"The Silmarillion\" which Tolkien believed to warrant their own long-form narratives. It was published as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, under the title \"Beren and Lúthien\" in 2017.\n\n\"The Fall of Gondolin\" is a tale of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces, which Tolkien called \"the first real story\" of Middle-earth, was published on 30 August 2018 as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien and illustrated by Alan Lee.\n\nBefore his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\"—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\" mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. The Library held an exhibition of his work in 2018, including more than 60 items which had never been seen in public before.\n\nIn 2009, a partial draft of \"Language and Human Nature\", which Tolkien had begun co-writing with C. S. Lewis but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.\n\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject. He worked for the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including walrus, over which he struggled mightily. In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\". He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.\n\nPrivately, Tolkien was attracted to \"things of racial and linguistic significance\", and in his 1955 lecture \"English and Welsh\", which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which he termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak. He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own \"native language\", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, \"I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).\"\n\nParallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages. The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's \"legendarium\". Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of esthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek. A notable addition came in late 1945 with Adûnaic or Númenórean, a language of a \"faintly Semitic flavour\", connected with Tolkien's Atlantis legend, which by \"The Notion Club Papers\" ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"Second Age\" and the story of Eärendil was grounded in the \"legendarium\", thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture \"A Secret Vice\", \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"Volapük, Esperanto, Ido, Novial, &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings \"dwarves\" and \"dwarvish\" (alongside \"dwarfs\" and \"dwarfish\"), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been \"dwarrows\" or \"dwerrows\".) He also coined the term \"eucatastrophe\", though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\nHe was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life. From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in \"Mr Bliss\" and \"Roverandom\", and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of \"The Hobbit\". Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: \"\". The book discusses the paintings, drawings, and sketches of J.R.R. Tolkien and in total includes 200 reproductions of his art.\n\nIn a 1951 letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\". The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\") and Donald Swann (who set the music to \"The Road Goes Ever On\"). Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to \"The Lord of the Rings\" in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.\n\nHowever, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of \"The Hobbit\" as \"too Disnified ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of\".\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging Tolkien fandom in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of \"The Lord of the Rings\":\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", first presented in 1939:\nTolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word \"Tollywood\", a portmanteau derived from \"Tolkien Hollywood\", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in Tolkien's legendarium aimed at generating good box office results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.\n\nOn receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote:\nTolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene (\"yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings\"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" to United Artists in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of \"The Lord of the Rings\". In 1977, an animated musical television film of \"The Hobbit\" was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film \"The Return of the King\", which covered some of the portions of \"The Lord of the Rings\" that Bakshi was unable to complete.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, New Line Cinema released \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by Peter Jackson. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous Oscars.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema released \"The Hobbit\", a series of three films based on \"The Hobbit\", with Peter Jackson serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer. The first instalment, \"\", was released in December 2012; the second, \"\", in December 2013; and the last instalment, \"\", in December 2014.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, it was announced that Amazon had acquired the global television rights to \"The Lord of the Rings\". The series will not be a direct adaptation of the books, but will instead introduce new stories that are set before \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" The press release referred to \"previously unexplored stories based on J. R. R. Tolkien's original writings\". Amazon will be the producer in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and The Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema.\n\nTolkien and the characters and places from his works have become the namesake of various things around the World. These include street names, mountains, companies, species of animals and plants as well as other notable objects.\n\nBy convention, certain classes of features on Saturn's moon Titan are named after elements from Middle-earth. \"Colles\" (small hills or knobs) are named for characters, while \"montes\" (mountains) are named for mountains of Middle-earth. There are also asteroids named for Bilbo Baggins and Tolkien himself.\n\nThree mountains in the Cadwallader Range of British Columbia, Canada, have been named after Tolkien's characters. These are Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn. On 1 December 2012, it was announced in the New Zealand press that a bid was launched for the New Zealand Geographic Board to name a mountain peak near Milford Sound after Tolkien for historical and literary reasons and to mark Tolkien's 121st birthday.\n\nThe \"Tolkien Road\" in Eastbourne, East Sussex, was named after Tolkien whereas the \"Tolkien Way\" in Stoke-on-Trent is named after Tolkien's eldest son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains. In the Hall Green and Moseley areas of Birmingham there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien—most notably, the Millstream Way and Moseley Bog. Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks. Also in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England there are a collection of roads in the 'Weston Village' named after locales of Middle Earth, namely Hobbiton Road, Bree Close, Arnor Close, Rivendell, Westmarch Way and Buckland Green.\n\nIn the Dutch town of Geldrop, near Eindhoven, the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself (\"Laan van Tolkien\") and some of the best-known characters from his books.\n\nIn the Silicon Valley towns of Saratoga and San Jose in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien's works. About a dozen Tolkien-derived street names also appear scattered throughout the town of Lake Forest, California. The Columbia, Maryland, neighbourhood of Hobbit's Glen and its street names (including Rivendell Lane, Tooks Way, and Oakenshield Circle) come from Tolkien's works.\n\nIn the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\", and other works set in Middle-earth.\nSeveral taxa have been named after the character Gollum (also known as Sméagol), as well as for various hobbits, the small humanlike creatures such as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. Various elves, dwarves, and other creatures that appear in his writings as well as Tolkien himself have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod \"Leucothoe tolkieni\", and the wasp \"Shireplitis tolkieni\". In 2004, the extinct hominid \"Homo floresiensis\" was described, and quickly earned the nickname \"hobbit\" due to its small size. In 1978, Paleontologist Leigh Van Valen named over 20 taxa of extinct mammals after Tolkien lore in a single paper. In 1999, entomologist Lauri Kaila described 48 new species of \"Elachista\" moths and named 37 of them after Tolkien mythology. It has been noted that \"Tolkien has been accorded formal taxonomic commemoration like no other author.\"\n\nSince 2003 The Tolkien Society has organized Tolkien Reading Day, which takes place on 25 March in schools around the world.\n\nThere are seven blue plaques in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote \"The Hobbit\" and most of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nAnother two plaques marking buildings associated with Tolkien are:-\n\nIn 2012, Tolkien was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\n\nUnlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of \"The Hobbit\" from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, a traditional low mass was held at the Oxford Oratory to mark the anniversary of his death. The mass was offered, however, not for the repose of Tolkien's soul – but rather praying for his Cause for beatification to be opened. Since then religious groups were founded promoting his cause towards sainthood.\n\n\nA small selection of books about Tolkien and his works:\n\n"}

The staircase is one of the few parts of the palace retaining the original 18th-century style. The massive grey granite columns, however, were added in the mid 19th century.\n\nThe staircase was badly damaged by a fire that swept the palace in 1837, but Nicholas I ordered the architect in charge of reconstruction, Vasily Stasov, to restore the staircase using Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli's original plans. Stasov made two small changes: he replaced the original gilt bronze handrails with white marble and the original pink columns with gray granite.\n\nThe stair hall, which has an 18th-century ceiling depicting the Gods at Olympus, is decorated with alabaster statues of Wisdom and Justice by Mikhail Terebenev (1795-1866);\nGrandeur and Opulence by Alexander Ustinov (1796-1868); Fidelity and Equity by Ivan Leppe; and Mercury and Mars by Apollon Manyulov.

{"id": "38340874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38340874", "title": "National syndicalism", "text": "National syndicalism\n\nNational syndicalism is an adaptation of syndicalism to suit the social agenda of integral nationalism. National syndicalism developed in France, and then spread to Italy, Spain, and Portugal.\n\nFrench National syndicalism was an adaptation of Georges Sorel's version of revolutionary syndicalism to the monarchist ideology of integral nationalism, as practised by Action Française. \"Action Française\" was a French nationalist-monarchist movement led by Charles Maurras.\n\nIn 1900, Charles Maurras declared in \"Action Française\"'s newspaper that anti-democratic socialism is the \"pure\"\nand correct form of socialism. From then on, he and other members of \"Action Française\" (like Jacques Bainville, , and Georges Valois) interested in Sorel's thought discussed the similarity between the movements in \"Action Française\"'s conferences and in essays published in the movement's newspaper, hoping to form a collaboration with revolutionary syndicalists. Such collaboration was formed in 1908 with a group of labor unions' leaders led by Émile Janvion . As a result of this collaboration, Janvion founded the journal \"Terre libre\".\n\nThe collaboration between the integral nationalism of \"Action Française\" and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel began in 1909. The connection was formed after Sorel read the second edition of Maurras' book, \"Enquête sur la monarchie\". Maurras favorably mentioned Sorel and revolutionary syndicalism in the book, and even sent a copy of the new edition to Sorel. Sorel read the book, and in April 1909 wrote a praising letter to Maurras. Three months later, on 10 July, Sorel published in \"Il Divenire sociale\" (the leading journal of Italian revolutionary syndicalism), an essay admiring Maurras and \"Action Française\". Sorel based his support on his anti-democratic thought. For example, he claimed that \"Action Française\" was the only force capable to fight against democracy. \n\"Action Française\" reprinted the essay in its newspaper on 22 August, titled \"Anti-parliamentary Socialists\".\n\nIn 1910 Sorel and Valois decided to create a national-socialist journal called \"La cité française\". A prospectus for the new journal was published in July 1910, signed by both revolutionary syndicalists (Georges Sorel and Édouard Berth) and \"Action Française\" members (Jean Variot, Pierre Gilbert and Georges Valois). \"La cité française\" never got off the ground because of Georges Valois's animosity toward Jean Variot.\n\nAfter the failure of \"La cité française\", Sorel decided to found his own journal. Sorel's biweekly review, called \"L'Indépendance\", was published from March 1911 to July 1913. Its themes were the same as the journal of \"Action Française\", such as nationalism, antisemitism, and a desire to defend the French culture and heritage of ancient Greece and Rome.\n\nDuring the preparations for launching \"La Cité française\", Sorel encouraged Berth and Valois to work together. In March 1911, (a member of \"Action Française\") suggested to Valois that they found an economic and social study group for nationalists. Valois persuaded Lagrange to open the group to non-nationalists who were anti-democratic and syndicalists (Valois wrote later that the aim of the group was to provide \"a common platform for nationalists and leftist anti-democrats\").\n\nThe new political group, called \"Cercle Proudhon\", was founded on 16 December 1911. It included Berth, Valois, Lagrange, the syndicalist Albert Vincent and the royalists , René de Marans, André Pascalon, and Marius Riquier. As the name \"Cercle Proudhon\" suggests, the group was inspired by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. It was also inspired by Georges Sorel and Charles Maurras. In January 1912 the journal of \"Cercle Proudhon\" was first published, entitled \"Cahiers du cercle Proudhon\".\n\nIn the early 20th century, nationalists and syndicalists were increasingly influencing each other in Italy. From 1902 to 1910, a number of Italian revolutionary syndicalists including Arturo Labriola, Agostino Lanzillo, Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, Alceste De Ambris, Filippo Corridoni and Sergio Panunzio sought to unify the Italian nationalist cause with the syndicalist cause and had entered into contact with Italian nationalist figures such as Enrico Corradini. These Italian national syndicalists held a common set of principles: the rejection of bourgeois values, democracy, liberalism, Marxism, internationalism, and pacifism while promoting heroism, vitalism, and violence. Not all Italian revolutionary syndicalists joined the Fascist cause, but most syndicalist leaders eventually embraced nationalism and \"were among the founders of the Fascist movement,\" where \"many even held key posts\" in Mussolini's regime. Benito Mussolini declared in 1909 that he had converted over to revolutionary syndicalism by 1904 during a general strike.\n\nEnrico Corradini promoted a form of national syndicalism that utilized Maurassian nationalism alongside the syndicalism of Georges Sorel. Corradini spoke of the need for a national syndicalist movement that would be able to solve Italy's problems, led by elitist aristocrats and anti-democrats who shared a revolutionary syndicalist commitment to direct action through a willingness to fight. Corradini spoke of Italy as being a \"proletarian nation\" that needed to pursue imperialism in order to challenge the \"plutocratic\" nations of France and the United Kingdom. Corradini's views were part of a wider set of perceptions within the right-wing Italian Nationalist Association (ANI) that claimed that Italy's economic backwardness was caused by corruption within its political class, liberalism, and division caused by \"ignoble socialism\". The ANI held ties and influence amongst conservatives, Catholics, and the business community.\n\nA number of Italian fascist leaders began to relabel national syndicalism as Fascist syndicalism. Mussolini was one of the first to disseminate this term, explaining that \"Fascist syndicalism is national and productivistic… in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility.\" By the time Edmondo Rossoni became secretary-general of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations in December 1922, other Italian national syndicalists were adopting the \"Fascist syndicalism\" phrase in their aim at \"building and reorganizing political structures… through a synthesis of State and labor.\" An early leader in Italian trade unionism, Rossoni and other fascist syndicalists not only took the position of radical nationalism, but favored \"class struggle.\" Seen at the time as \"radical or leftist elements,\" Rossoni and his syndicalist cadre had \"served to some extent to protect the immediate economic interests of the workers and to preserve their class consciousness.\" Rossoni was dismissed from his post in 1928, which could have been due his powerful leadership position in the Fascist unions, and his hostilities to the business community, occasionally referring to industrialists as \"vampires\" and \"profiteers.\"\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Sergio Panunzio noted the national solidarity within France and Germany that suddenly arose in response to the war and claimed that should Italy enter the war, the Italian nation would become united and would emerge from the war as a new nation in a \"Fascio nazionale\" (national union) that would be led by an aristocracy of warrior-producers that would unite Italians of all classes, factions, and regions into a disciplined socialism.\n\nIn November 1918, Mussolini defined national syndicalism as a doctrine that would unite economic classes into a program of national development and growth.\n\nNational syndicalism in the Iberian Peninsula is a political theory very different from the fascist idea of corporatism, inspired by Integralism and the Action Française (for a French parallel, see Cercle Proudhon). It was formulated in Spain by Ramiro Ledesma Ramos in a manifesto published in his periodical \"La Conquista del Estado\" on 14 March 1931.\n\nNational syndicalism was intended to win over the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) to a corporatist nationalism. Ledesma's manifesto was discussed in the CNT congress of 1931. However, the National Syndicalist movement effectively emerged as a separate political tendency. Later the same year, Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista was formed, and subsequently voluntarily fused with Falange Española. In 1936 Franco forced a further less voluntary merger with traditionalist Carlism, to create a single party on the Nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War.\nDuring the war, Falangists fought against the Second Spanish Republic, which had the armed support of CNT.\nIt was one of the ideological bases of Francoist Spain, especially in the early years.\n\nThe ideology was present in Portugal with the Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista (active in the early 1930s), its leader Francisco Rolão Preto being a collaborator of Falange ideologue José Antonio Primo de Rivera.\n\nThe Spanish version theory has influenced the Kataeb Party in Lebanon, the National Radical Camp Falanga in Poland and various Falangist groups in Latin America.\n\nThe Unidad Falangista Montañesa maintains a trade union wing, called the Association of National-Syndicalist Workers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2955470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2955470", "title": "OpenStreetMap", "text": "OpenStreetMap\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Rather than the map itself, the data generated by the project is considered its primary output. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information.\n\nCreated by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere. Since then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users, who can collect data using manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other free sources. This crowdsourced data is then made available under the Open Database License. The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales.\n\nThe data from OSM is available for use in both traditional applications, like its usage by Facebook, Craigslist, OsmAnd, Geocaching, MapQuest Open, JMP statistical software, and Foursquare to replace Google Maps, and more unusual roles like replacing the default data included with GPS receivers. OpenStreetMap data has been favourably compared with proprietary datasources, although in 2009 data quality varied across the world.\n\nSteve Coast founded the project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom. In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the Ordnance Survey created massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. The first contribution, made in the British city of London in 2005, was thought to be a road by the Directions Mag. \n\nIn April 2006, the OpenStreetMap Foundation was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its aerial photography as a backdrop for map production.\n\nIn April 2007, Automotive Navigation Data (AND) donated a complete road data set for the Netherlands and trunk road data for India and China to the project and by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included Google, Yahoo! and Multimap. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a US Census TIGER road dataset. In December 2007, Oxford University became the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website.\n\nWays to import and export data have continued to grow – by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps. In March, two founders announced that they have received venture capital funding of €2.4million for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data. In November 2010, Bing changed their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps.\n\nIn 2012, the launch of pricing for Google Maps led several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors. Chief amongst these were Foursquare, Craigslist who adopted OpenStreetMap, and Apple, which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform which uses TomTom and OpenStreetMap data.\n\nMap data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. Mapathon competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.\n\nThe availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.\n\nEditing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called iD, an HTML5 application using D3.js and written by Mapbox, which was originally financed by the Knight Foundation. The earlier Flash-based application Potlatch is retained for intermediate-level users. JOSM and Merkaartor are more powerful desktop editing applications that are better suited for advanced users.\n\nVespucci is a first full featured editor for Android, it was released in 2009. StreetComplete is new easy Android app launched in 2016, which allows users without any OpenStreetMap knowledge to answer simple quests for existing data in OpenStreetMap, and thus contribute data. Maps.me is a mobile application (which runs on both Android and iOS) offering offline maps which also includes a limited OSM data editor. is an iOS app that lets you create and edit information in OpenStreetMap. Pushpin is another iOS app that lets you add POI on the go.\n\nThe project has a geographically diverse user-base, due to emphasis of local knowledge and ground truth in the process of data collection. Many early contributors were cyclists who survey with and for bicyclists, charting cycleroutes and navigable trails. Others are GIS professionals who contribute data with Esri tools. Contributors are predominately men, with only 3-5% being women.\n\nBy August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009, there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000. In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors. On 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached 1 million registered users. Around 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database.\n\nGround surveys are performed by a mapper, on foot, bicycle, or in a car, motorcycle or boat. Map data are usually collected using a GPS unit, although this is not strictly necessary if an area has already been traced from satellite imagery.\n\nOnce the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.\n\nSome committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.\n\nIn addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: Bing Streetside 360º image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced Mapillary and OpenStreetCam platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.\n\nSome government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under public domain.\n\nIn the United States, OSM uses Landsat 7 satellite imagery, Prototype Global Shorelines from NOAA, and TIGER from the Census. In the UK, some Ordnance Survey OpenData is imported, while Natural Resources Canada's CanVec vector data and GeoBase provide landcover and streets.\n\nOut-of-copyright maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK Crown copyright expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1 inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.\n\nIn February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely OSRM, GraphHopper and MapQuest.\n\nThere are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.\n\n\nThe web site OpenStreetMap.org provides a slippy map interface based on the Leaflet JavaScript library (and formerly built on OpenLayers), displaying map tiles rendered by the Mapnik rendering engine, and tiles from other sources including OpenCycleMap.org.\n\nCustom maps can also be generated from OSM data through various software including Jawg Maps, Mapnik, Mapbox Studio, Mapzen's Tangrams.\n\nOpenStreetMap maintains lists of online and offline routing engines available, such as the Open Source Routing Machine. OSM data is popular with routing researchers, and is also available to open-source projects and companies to build routing applications (or for any other purpose).\n\nThe 2010 Haiti earthquake has established a model for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with international organisations. OpenStreetMap and Crisis Commons volunteers using available satellite imagery to map the roads, buildings and refugee camps of Port-au-Prince in just two days, building \"the most complete digital map of Haiti's roads\".\n\nThe resulting data and maps have been used by several organisations providing relief aid, such as the World Bank, the European Commission Joint Research Centre, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOSAT and others.\n\nNGOs, like the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and others, have worked with donors like United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to map other parts of Haiti and parts of many other countries, both to create map data for places that were blank, and to engage and build capacity of local people.\n\nAfter Haiti, the OpenStreetMap community continued mapping to support humanitarian organisations for various crises and disasters. After the Northern Mali conflict (January 2013), Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (November 2013), and the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa (March 2014), the OpenStreetMap community has shown it can play a significant role in supporting humanitarian organisations.\n\nThe Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team acts as an interface between the OpenStreetMap community and the humanitarian organisations.\n\nAlong with post-disaster work, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has worked to build better risk models and grow the local OpenStreetMap communities in multiple countries including Uganda, Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo in partnership with the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, World Bank, and other humanitarian groups.\n\nOpenStreetMap data was used in scientific studies. For example, road data was used for research of remaining roadless areas.\n\nSince 2007, the OSM community has held an annual, international conference called \"State of the Map\".\n\nVenues have been:\n\nThere are also various national, regional and continental SotM conferences, such as State of the Map U.S., SotM Baltics and SotM Asia.\n\nOpenStreetMap data was originally published under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence (CC BY-SA) with the intention of promoting free use and redistribution of the data. In September 2012, the licence was changed to the Open Database Licence (ODbL) published by Open Data Commons (ODC) in order to more specifically define its bearing on data rather than representation.\n\nAs part of this relicensing process, some of the map data was removed from the public distribution. This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object. Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.\n\nAll data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.\n\nSoftware used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application – what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by Ruby on Rails. The application also uses PostgreSQL for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by Mapnik, stored in PostGIS, and powered by an Apache module called \"mod_tile\". Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor Potlatch2, have been made available as public domain.\n\nSome OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.\n\nNotably, Automotive Navigation Data provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a free and open licence, until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011. In November 2010, Microsoft announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors. For a period from 2009 to 2011, NearMap Pty Ltd made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a CC BY-SA licence.\n\nIn June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project - four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.\n\nWhile OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.\n\nOpenStreetMap uses a topological data structure, with four core elements (also known as \"data primitives\"):\n\nThe OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.\n\nThe main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows. All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.\n\nFor data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called . These dumps exist in two formats, one using XML and one using the Protocol Buffer Binary Format (PBF).\n\nThe LinkedGeoData data uses the GeoSPARQL and well-known text (WKT) RDF vocabularies to represent OpenStreetMap data.\nIt is a work of the Agile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web (AKSW) research group at the University of Leipzig, a group mostly known for DBpedia.\n\nA variety of popular services incorporate some sort of geolocation or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24571941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24571941", "title": "Palmetto Leaves", "text": "Palmetto Leaves\n\nPalmetto Leaves is a memoir and travel guide written by Harriet Beecher Stowe about her winters in the town of Mandarin, Florida, published in 1873. Already famous for having written \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of \"Palmetto Leaves\" appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.\n\nScion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a sense of Christian responsibility that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty to help improve the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of \"excessive\" heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness. Although it is a minor work in Stowe's \"oeuvre\", \"Palmetto Leaves\" was one of the first travel guides written about Florida and stimulated Florida's first boom of tourism and residential development in the 1880s.\n\nBy the time Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811–1896) moved to Florida in 1867, she was already internationally famous for authoring \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. She had grown up the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.\n\nIn 1860, Stowe's son Frederick \"Fred\" William Stowe enlisted in the First Massachusetts Infantry Regiment when Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers in anticipation of the Civil War. Much beloved, yet troubled, Fred Stowe had developed a problem with alcohol as early as sixteen. He took to army life, however, and was promoted to lieutenant. After receiving a head wound at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, he endured severe headaches and was forced to resign his commission. His alcoholism worsened, and he may have compounded it with a liberal use of opiates and narcotics, which were widely available.\n\nIn 1866, Fred encountered two young farmers in Connecticut who had spent time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.\n\nStowe intended that Fred would manage the estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As an extension of her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: My plan...is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which whoever seizes has them.\nCorrupt politicians are already beginning to speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads with all sorts of vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.\n\nCharles Stowe, her son, later wrote that his mother searched for higher purpose in everything she did, from growing potatoes to writing. She wrote that the prospect of setting up a series of churches along the St. Johns River would be the best way to train former slaves, remarking \"I long to be at this work and cannot think of it without my heart burning within me\". Florida was little populated and developed: it had just a fraction of the population of Georgia and Alabama. South of Ocala, approximately two people lived per square mile.\n\nFlorida's school system was in disarray at the end of the Civil War; in 1866 a Northerner named A. E. Kinne noted there were fewer schools for white children than freedmen's schools for black children. In 1860, there were no official schools for black children and slaves were prohibited from any education. At the same time, there were 97 public schools for white children and 40 private academies for them, some of which appeared to get public funding. In May 1865, the total Florida population was 154,000, and an estimated 47% of it was black, almost all of whom were former slaves. A difference in attitudes about education between the races was apparent as freed blacks saw education as the key to increasing their opportunities, or at least escaping conditions they had endured during servitude.\n\nIn the late winter of 1867, Stowe followed her son to Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her to spend more time on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become \"young & frisky\". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe fell in love with a cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking \"How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?\" She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: \"I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing. [Ralph Waldo] Emerson could \"insulate\" himself here and keep his electricity. [Nathaniel] Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida.\"\n\nWithin a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced and made poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, plantations had been largely self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off at a time to visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (\"Helicoverpa zea\") destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York, and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.\n\nCitrus was distributed primarily in a regional market and was a luxury in northern cities; oranges in New York sold for about 50 cents per fruit. The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her on the progress of improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1884, Stowe split her time between her residence in Hartford, Connecticut, a mansion named Oakholm, and her house in Mandarin. A few weeks before Christmas each year, she would oversee arrangements to close Oakholm for the season, which involved preparing the house for the winter, packing all their clothes, living necessities, her writing materials, and the carpets in the house and shipping everything to Florida. Various family members would accompany her, living in the comfortable two-story house she modestly called a \"cottage\" or \"hut\". In Hartford she was barraged with requests and at the center of a whirl of activity. Mandarin was not connected to a telegraph line until the 1880s and mail was received only once a week by boat. Stowe was able to relax somewhat in Mandarin and write for at least three hours a day. \n\nStowe remained active, attending speaking engagements, writing, traveling frequently and publishing several novels while she was wintering in Mandarin. Though she promised her publishers, J. R. Osgood, another novel, she instead compiled a series of articles about Florida and letters to relatives in New England about her daily life. Some of them were first published in \"Christian Union\", a local New England newspaper established by her brother Henry Ward Beecher. In all, twenty chapters make up \"Palmetto Leaves\" that vary in tone depending upon Stowe's audience. \"Buying land in Florida\", \"Florida for Invalids\", and \"Our Experience in Crops\" are addressed more to general readers who may be considering moving to the region. Some essays are directed to describing the best sights in the area, such as \"Flowery January in Florida\", \"Picnicking up Julington\", \"The Grand Tour up River\", and \"St. Augustine\". A more personal touch is included in chapters entitled \"A Letter to the Girls\", \"Letter-Writing\", and \"Our Neighbor Over the Way\" as Stowe includes intimate details about her daily life in Mandarin. Her observations of the state and characteristics of emancipated slaves are mentioned intermittently in letters and essays, but the final two chapters, \"Old Cudjo and The Angel\" and \"Laborers of The South\", are dedicated solely to this topic.\n\n\"Palmetto Leaves\" was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she published \"Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands\" about her first trip to Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe. She followed this with \"Agnes of Sorrento\" that appeared as a serial in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" from 1861 to 1862. Source material for \"Agnes of Sorrento\" was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of \"Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida\", recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to \"Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands\", writing: If the criticism be made that every thing is given \"couleur de rose\", the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with too bright a pencil, the reader will consider that, after all, there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors. \nThe object of publishing these letters is, therefore, to give to those who are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners which met the writer's own eyes.\n\nBecause little was known about the region, the elements of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, \"Palmetto Leaves\"—published in 1873—to be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was still very much a rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book \"Orange Blossoms\", but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.\n\nIn the first chapter of \"Palmetto Leaves\", Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes attached to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals to take care of the poor and suffering.\n\nThe impressive orange tree served as a metaphor for Stowe in \"Palmetto Leaves\". She calls it \"the fairest, the noblest, the most generous, it is the most surprising and abundant of all trees which the Lord God caused to grow eastward in Eden\", and compares it to her task of educating emancipated slaves. When she first arrived in Mandarin, from 1868 to 1870, religious services were held in the Stowes' home, with Calvin presiding and Stowe teaching Sunday School to both black and white children and sometimes serving as an acolyte during services. Stowe purchased a lot in 1869 to build a church for her neighbors that would double as a school to educate children, freed slaves, and anyone eager to learn. Though she encountered considerable frustration in dealing with the bureaucracy of the Freedmen's Bureau, construction was finished within a year and a teacher was in place, procured from Brooklyn, New York. Stowe had an organ that was rolled from her home to the church, but after it became too difficult to roll back and forth, they locked it in a closet in the school. The building burned down to Stowe's deep dismay, probably because of some drifters who spent the night in it and caught the southern pine wood on fire from carelessness, although Olav Thulesius suggests it was arson committed by Stowe's neighbors who did not appreciate her efforts to educate black children. After a frost in 1835, the orange trees in north Florida were killed, even underground, but they sprouted back only to be assaulted by insects, yet they recovered. While her neighbors helped to raise funds to rebuild the church, Stowe and the small community handed spellers to local blacks who were eager to learn. She decried the delay in the children's education: \"To see people who are willing and anxious to be taught growing up in ignorance is the sorest sight that can afflict one\".\n\nFrom her first sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In \"Palmetto Leaves\", she sings the praises of Florida in January as a beautiful land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (\"Gelsemium sempervirens\") and another to magnolia (\"Magnolia grandiflora\") flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things to find in the woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (\"Cardinalis cardinalis\") in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.\n\nIn an honest description of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers of the notion that the region is perfect. She writes, \"In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk\" and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an \"indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it\". Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness. Malaria is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions. In \"The Journal of Southern History\", Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a \"woman's rights woman\".\n\nStowe recounts several sailing trips she takes on the St. Johns and Julington Creek and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, \"water-turkeys\" (\"Anhinga anhinga\"), and \"fish-hawks\", or ospreys (\"Pandion haliaetus\"). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her as part of the \"earthquake\" of the annual relocation from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being pulled up a steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same. Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in \"Palmetto Leaves\" to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: \"it must be something that \"enjoys\" and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it\". In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.\n\nThe final two letters in \"Palmetto Leaves\" address the newly freed slaves in Florida. Two strong women who are less docile than Stowe is accustomed are included. One, a field hand turned domestic named Minnah, whom Stowe has tried in vain to teach how to do household chores, is so forthright in her speech that Stowe writes, \"Democracy never assumes a more rampant form than in some of these old negresses, who would say their screed to the king on his throne if they died for it the next minute. Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech.\" Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons off to see to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and \"the negligent habits inducted by slavery\"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.\n\nAlthough Stowe describes Minnah and Judy with some tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave owned by the captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues to work for him following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.\n\nIn another story, Stowe and Calvin meet a man on a Mandarin dock who has been cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small homestead on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.\n\n\"Palmetto Leaves\" became a best-seller for Stowe and was released in several editions. It was published again in 1968 as part of \"Bicentennial Floridiana\", a series of original facsimile texts about the history of the state. It was so popular that through publishing it, Stowe virtually ruined the peace and quiet she sought in Mandarin to be able to work. The year following the publication of \"Palmetto Leaves\", Stowe reported that 14,000 tourists had visited North Florida. Two years after its initial publication, a writer working for \"Harper's\" magazine noted that Stowe was \"besieged by hundreds of visitors, who do not seem to understand that she is not an exhibition\".\n\nStowe's house, which was located on the bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats shuffling tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.\n\nStowe was among several authors who wrote about Florida following the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something that may have been allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of \"Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State\" writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.\n\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was clearly Stowe's \"magnum opus\" (although she considered \"Old Town Folks\", which was written while she was in Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying \"So this is the little lady who made this big war?\" Compared to it, \"Palmetto Leaves\" is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The \"Cambridge Introduction to Literature\" series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it \"uneven in quality and unstable in stance\". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. \"Cambridge Introduction to Literature\" author Sarah Robbins called it \"downright offensive\" and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.\n\nThe effects of Stowe's writings about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During a visit to his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff on the steps of the state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.\n\nIn 1882 Stowe purchased a plot of land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever to spend the rest of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across. She died in 1896.\n\nA frost in 1886 killed much of the orange industry in Mandarin and the town saw an economic decline. In 1916, an ornate stained glass window constructed by Louis Comfort Tiffany was installed in the Church of Our Saviour, depicting a large oak tree overlooking the river. The church and Mandarin residents offered no more than $500 for the window; for three years ten cent subscriptions were raised around Mandarin, and notices were placed in New York magazines to solicit finances for it. Although scholars have stated that Stowe's efforts to educate local blacks were ultimately unsuccessful, the woman who spearheaded the fundraising effort for the memorial window noted that the project was enthusiastically supported by local black churches and residents, who gave what they could out of affection for Stowe, remembering that she taught some of them to read. The window probably cost Tiffany $850 ($ in 2009), and though there is no record of exactly how much Tiffany was paid, he took the project on because he liked the design: the tree, the moss, the Southern motif, and because it was to memorialize the Stowes. He probably made no profit from it.\n\nBeneath it read \"In that hour, fairer than daylight dawning/ Remains the glorious thought, I am with Thee\", part of a hymn penned by Stowe. The school Stowe sponsored closed in 1929. Following Stowe's departure, the next owners of the house turned it into a lodge named after her. It closed in the 1940s and was subsequently replaced by a spacious home; what survives is the 500-year-old oak tree, which the Stowes built around instead of removing. The oak had continued to grow and upset the foundation of the new home.\n\nThe stained glass window became a tourist attraction and the last memorial to Stowe in Florida; in later decades some of the parishioners and clergy had doubts about its \"churchliness\" as it was a rare depiction in an Anglican church not referencing a Biblical theme. In 1964 Hurricane Dora destroyed the Church of Our Saviour, including the stained glass window. Across the street, is the Mandarin Community Club, the former school sponsored by Stowe; the structure was given to Mandarin in 1936. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mandarin has since grown into a suburb of the expansive city of Jacksonville.\n\nArtist Christopher Still created an oil on linen painting named \"The Okeehumkee on the Oklawaha River\" that hangs in the Florida House of Representatives. It is one of a series of images that encompass symbols of cultural and historical significance to Florida that were commissioned by the State of Florida in 1999 and completed in 2002. \"Palmetto Leaves\" is shown lying next to a large alligator and hollowed tree trunk in front of a riverboat passing through a swamp.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55461117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55461117", "title": "Rouse Hill House", "text": "Rouse Hill House\n\nRouse Hill House is a heritage-listed homestead and estate at Windsor Road, Rouse Hill, City of Blacktown, New South Wales, Australia. Rouse Hill House and farm was the family home of Richard Rouse, the Colonial Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at Parramatta.\n\nThe homestead, in the Australian Georgian style, was developed between 1813 and 1819 with further developments in . The homestead is managed by Sydney Living Museums as a museum that is open to the public. Much of the former grounds have been transformed into Rouse Hill Regional Park and subsequent residential and commercial developments. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nRichard Rouse (1774-1852) appears to have begun building at Rouse Hill in 1813 although the grant of was not made until October 1816. Sometime between 1818 and 1825, Rouse, his wife Elizabeth (1772-1849) and family moved from Parramatta to the new house. The son of an Oxfordshire cabinet maker and shop-keeper, Rouse came to the colony, free, in 1801. Prospering quickly, by 1805 he was Superintendent of Public Works and Convicts at Parramatta.\n\nIn this role he supervised the building of Governor Lachlan Macquarie and his wife's additions to Old Government House, Parramatta, in the mid 1810s. It is possible that these works influenced Rouse to build a bigger house than he first intended, adding larger, longer rooms behind the front range.\n\nHe chose the site of his new house while building toll houses for Macquarie's upgraded road to the Hawkesbury River. Rouse sited the new house prominently, possibly with an eye to its possible use as an inn, on a hilltop adjacent to the toll house (also built by him) on the Parramatta to Windsor Turnpike. He acquired other properties, more fertile than the Rouse Hill farm, but Rouse Hill had the advantage of strategic siting. While other early colonial homesteads overlooked their crops or pastures, Rouse Hill has always overlooked the busy Windsor Road. It was from here that Rouse and his descendants oversaw their distant pastoral and agricultural interests, rather than the estate itself being the focus of those interests.\n\nRouse was not bred to the land, but was shrewd and capable, careful of money and acquisitive of property. He left, on his death in 1852, extensive holdings throughout the colony. The Rouse Hill estate grew to by Rouse's death, by purchase of an adjacent grant. Rouse consolidated his land holdings at North Richmond from around 1806 and increased his pastoral holdings in the north west of New South Wales, using his sons to colonise further west while he continued to acquire land in Parramatta and Western Sydney.\n\nA number of the property's outbuildings finished construction following the completion of the house, including the laundry wing, cottage, barn and woolshed. The garden layout reflects the construction of the house between 1813 and 1818. Some trees remain from the plantings in the mid 19th century. With the exception of outbuildings, Rouse seems to have made no other alterations to the property's buildings. This was left to later generations. Rouse died in 1852 leaving the property to his son Edwin Rouse. The property went to Edwin's son Edwin Stephen Rouse on his death in 1862.\n\nA summerhouse, woolshed and a two storey service wing was added in the 1860s, the stables built in 1876 and 1877 and the house redecorated and partly furnished in 1885. The service wing made no direct connection with the house. A verandah, weighted sash windows, a modified front door and sidelights and other late 19th century innovations were also installed. These too have been done in such a way as to preserve the integrity of the house.\n\nRouse Hill Public School opened to the east of Rouse Hill House and farm in 1888.\n\nEdwin Stephen Rouse's eldest daughter Nina, who had left the house in 1895 to marry George Terry, returned with her husband to live at Rouse Hill in 1924. This was a result of their bankruptcy. Following the death of Edwin Stephen Rouse in 1931 his estate was administered by Trustees, mainly family members and later a family company, until 1969. In 1932 the studio was converted into a breakfast room. Estate subdivision had begun in 1951 and the property had been reduced to by 1963. Nina Terry died at Rouse Hill House in 1968 and the following year the remaining were subdivided. The homestead block of went to her two sons Gerald and Roderick Terry as tenants in common.\n\nWhen a family dispute occurred following the death of Edwin Rouse's grand-daughter Nina Terry in 1968, architect John Fisher (early member of the Institute of Architects, member of the Cumberland County Historic Buildings Committee and National Trust of Australia (NSW) Board member after its reformation in 1960) chaired the Rouse Hill Preservation Committee, which brought together the family and representatives of the National Trust of Australia (NSW). This led to the NSW Government resuming the property, which later became a property under the care of the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales (HHT).\n\nA further subdivision in 1974 reduced the homestead block to .\n\nIn March 1978 the NSW government purchased the property which also contained 24 outbuildings (and half its contents). It was administered by the Planning and Environment Commission, later the Department of Planning, which commissioned restoration works from the Public Works Department.\n\nThe Heritage Council's Restoration Steering (HC RS) Committee resolved to have a conservation statement prepared for the buildings and their site. Urgent repair works to the outbuildings were identified and undertaken under the supervision of the Government Architect's Branch, Public Works Department and the main entrance driveway was regraded and regravelled. Urgent repair and stabilisation on the homestead and outbuildings continued and a fire control service was installed in the garden. A gardener was contracted to carry out urgent garden maintenance. The HC RS Committee considered the need for accurate documentation of interior finishes and contents of the buildings and for curatorial and materials conservation work to be carried out. The initial conservation programme was endorsed and circulated to various interested conservation bodies for comment. The Royal Australian Historical Society was requested to undertake an historical research programme on the property. An archaeologist was contracted to be present during any excavation works associated with the repairs programme.\n\nThere has been a continuity of family ownership at Rouse Hill until 1978. Particular forces in the family's history and those of wealth in the 19th century, followed by financial hardship, longevity and resistance to change in the 20th century have left the property in a poignantly fragile condition. This fragility is inherent in much of the property's historic fabric and is integral to the archival significance of the place.\n\nIn 1984 the summer house was repaired/reconstructed, and the property was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust in 1987. Family association with the property continued through the occupancy of Gerald Terry from 1968, Roderick Terry, 1968-80, and the latter's daughter and son in law, Miriam and Ian Hamilton and the Hamiltons' ownership of a significant portion of the collection. The collection was subsequently transferred to the Hamilton Rouse Hill Trust.\n\nSince 1978 descendents have returned many significant family items and the collection now comprises over 20,000 objects as diverse as costume, furniture, tools and automobiles.\n\nBy 1993, there were 25 acres (10 hectares) of land left, in the management of the Historic Houses Trust.\n\nWhen the HHT opened Rouse Hill House and Farm to the public in 1999 it was in a limited capacity and a very different context. In 2007, anticipating the extraordinary residential growth in the area, the HHT sought funding of $19m from Treasury to provide new visitor and cultural facilities (interpretation, programs, research and access to the collection) along with commercial activities (cafe, retail, auditorium and flexible public spaces to be used as venues). The project aimed to improve the property's sustainability and allowed it to be opened up to thousands of visitors a year.\n\nThe property received an Energy Australia National Trust Heritage Award in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, HHT got first stage funding for the education component of its vision for the site. To protect the heritage precinct the State Government established the Rouse Hill Regional Park, transferred the 1888 Rouse Hill Public School (former) and adjacent lands to the HHT and diverted the upgraded Windsor Road (to the east away from the house and school). Advocacy by the Friends of the HIstoric Houses Trust was in large part responsible for moving the road to create this bypass, protecting the site's setting from encroachment.\n\nOn 10 March 2009, remnant Roads & Traffic Authority (RTA) lands were transferred to the HHT (from the Windsor Road bypass which is open further to the east than the old road alignment (in a cutting). The Hills Shire Council approved stage one development application for works.\n\nIn 2009-10, the construction program was almost complete on former RTA land and Rouse Hill Public School (former) adjoining re-aligned Windsor Road. The school house was conserved, repainted in Victorian colour scheme and interpreted as 19th century school; cafe, retail, education centre and outdoor auditorium (for 60); parking; security; flexible public spaces to be used as venues and landscaping works completed. The property's capacity and visitation rate increased, including increasing numbers of local schools (capacity now for 20,000 children a year to visit).\n\nTransfer of the remnant RTA lands created a new opportunity for research and interpretation. HHT historians Joy Hughes, Jane Kelson and curator Fergus Clunie began gathering historic maps of the region. Searching for the location of the original Toll House at Rouse Hill, he unearthed new evidence about the line of the old Hawkesbury Road (1794-1813) on which the pursuit and \"battle of Vinegar Hill\", an armed conflagration between convicts and troops, took place in 1804. Although the road has long since disappeared, it defined the boundary of the first land grant in the area, the 1000 acre \"Copenhagen\" given to Captain William Bligh. It also ran close to the surviving kilometre stretch of the old Windsor Road built by convicts in 1812-13 as the first turnpike in the colony between Sydney and the Hawkesbury. The exact location of the battle of Vinegar Hill has long been debated, but the map evidence and line of the old Hawkesbury Road indicate that it most likely took place between Second Ponds Creek and the crest of Rouse Hill, formerly known as Vinegar Hill. A line of very early trees at the edge of the road is believed to date back to the time of the battle.\n\nRouse Hill House dating from 1813, is remarkable as one of the longest continuously occupied houses in Australia, set in the oldest surviving garden in Australia and with original outbuildings, interiors and collections intact. As the likely site of the battle of Vinegar Hill, it now has a new level of significance, with exciting interpretive possibilities, and this has encouraged HHT to rethink its approach to the property.\n\nBy June 2016, increased visitation had been achieved by introducing a series of limited-number tours of the house's interiors. Works to conserve the farm's dairy precinct had been completed. Two main posts whose subsoil bases had decayed were re-footed, with new spliced material and a pad footing. Guttering was replaced, along with some roof sheeting where discrete patching was no longer sufficient and deacyed timber trimming on the milk house has been replaced\n\nThe bathhouse was conserved and repaired in September 2017.\n\nSince its establishment in 1813, when the house was begun on the property, the following modifications have occurred:\n\nRouse Hill House is arguably unrivalled in Australia for the wealth of physical evidence of its own history and its use by the family which built it. This intactness extends to all aspects of the property.\n\nThe property is perhaps unique for its survival as a largely intact estate with an unbroken chain of occupancy, allwing the survival of major garden and interior elements of every period of its history to the present. This layering of artefacts and fashions is especially prevalent in the gardens where designs and physical details such as edging, fencing, planting containers, bed designs and paths provide a case history for the study of the development of garden practices in Australia.\n\nThe physical condition of the property was reported as being good as at 18 September 1997.\n\nRouse Hill House is a large two storey Georgian House set on top of a ridge which falls away gradually to all cardinal points. The house is oriented to the northeast, midway between Parramatta & Windsor. The house has a separate two storey brick service wing, offices forming an arcaded courtyard, 22 rooms, staircase hall, service stair and two cellar rooms. The house gas a fine stone-flagged stair hall with cantilevered timber stair. The doors are all six panelled with some architraves and panelled jamb linings. The main house is built of sandstone with a slate roof, timber floors(kitchen, scullery, staircase, hall, arcade and verandah are flagged) and oakgrained hardwood joinery.\n\nThe garden is perhaps Australia's oldest surviving colonial garden in relatively intact form. The surviving physical evidence in the gardens includes borders in a variety of materials, fence and gate remnants, fragments of trellis and arbours, paving and numerous soil displacements that become evident with the location's annual dry spells. These physical remains, matched with pictorial evidence from photographs, drawings and engravings of the property, and writings, have resulted in the identification of four stages of the garden's development: , , and .\n\nThis continuity and evidence of evolution of a very early intact garden from the first quarter of the 19th century to the Edwardian era and 20th century is extremely rare in Australia. The effects of new technologies in Australian estate gardening with replacement of palings with wire fences, displacement of stone and brick garden or path edgings with terracotta tile edgings, etc. are quite evident.\n\nDominating the garden and seen from afar are tall, mature Araucaria pines (Bunya pine, \"A. bidwillii\" and hoop pine, \"A. cunninghamii\").\n\nPicturesque building in the garden thought to have been built by Scottish-born Parramatta buildder and architect, James Houison, it originally featured ine arched timber trellises on the two verandahs and porches on each side. This treillage supported climbing plants and gave some privacy to users of the bathroom and lavatory. MOrewood & Rogers roofing (tin) tiles, stone flagging. Restored in 2017.\n\nThe dairy design is essentially the same as one for a model dairy promoted in 1947 by the NSW Department of Agriculture as suitable for smaller farmers. \"Model dairies\" (a term dating to the 1800s) were structures that exemplified the most up-to-date hygiene and production principles and materials, and could serve as a model to other farmers to copy. The Rouse dairy contains a linear row of bails, with a gabled, fibre-cement-clad \"milk house\" at the western end that held the pumping machinery and generator. As per 1947 plan specifications, the floor was laid with easily washed concrete to maintain strict hygiene. A much earlier timber structure, containing two cow bails for hand-milking, also survives at Rouse Hill House and features in tours of its outbuildings.\n\nOther buildings on the site include a slab built cow shed, brick bath house, a reconstructed timber summer house, brick stables. The property also has an extant caretaker's house.\n\nRouse Hill House is one of the most significant and substantial houses of the Macquarie period which dates from 1810 to 1822. Rouse Hill House Estate is the largest and most complete publicly owned physical record - in the form of buildings, furnishings, artefacts and landscape relationship - of the occupancy and culture of a European-Australian family, encompassing the tastes, fortunes, and endeavours of seven generations from the early 19th century to the late 20th century.\n\nThe property is perhaps unique for its survival as a largely intact estate with an unbroken chain of occupancy, allowing the survival of major garden and interior elements of every period of its history to the present.

This continuity and evidence of evolution of a very early intact garden from the first quarter of the 19th century to the Edwardian era and 20th century is extremely rare in Australia.\n\nRouse Hill House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nRouse Hill House is significant for the record of the Rouse and Terry family occupancy over the seven generations and 180 years which the property constitutes.

It is perhaps the earliest garden design to have survived in NSW, almost unaltered in form although modified slightly in detail.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe historical relationship of Rouse Hill to other properties owned by the Rouse family is representative of historical patterns of settlement in NSW in which first generation properties on the Cumberland Plain were supplemented or eclipsed.\n\n"}

It uses sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate protein molecules.\n\nSDS-PAGE is a discontinuous electrophoretic system developed by Ulrich K. Laemmli which is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 KDa. The publication describing it is the most frequently cited paper by a single author, and the second most cited overall.\n\nSDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein, corresponding to one SDS molecule per two amino acids. SDS acts as a surfactant, covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.\n\nSDS tends to form spherical micelles in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules (monomer) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules. However, only SDS monomers bind to proteins via hydrophobic interactions, whereas the SDS micelles are anionic on the outside and do not adsorb any protein. SDS is amphipathic in nature, which allows it to unfold both polar and nonpolar sections of protein structure. In SDS concentrations above 0.1 millimolar, the unfolding of proteins begins, and above 1 mM, most proteins are denatured. Due to the strong denaturing effect of SDS and the subsequent dissociation of protein complexes, quaternary structures can generally not be determined with SDS. Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent cross-linking and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the chemical equilibrium of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against proteases and an increased biological half-life.\n\nAlternatively, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can also be performed with the cationic surfactants CTAB in a CTAB-PAGE, or 16-BAC in a BAC-PAGE.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or western blotting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.\n\nWhen using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the diffusion does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by radical polymerisation in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75 mm or 1.5 mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst TEMED and the radical initiator ammonium persulfate (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the meniscus and protects the gel solution of the radical scavenger oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with filter paper. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for protein sequencing, the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with cysteines in proteins.\n\nBy using a gradient mixer, gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses. Commercial gel systems (so-called \"pre-cast gels\") usually use the buffer substance Bis-tris methane with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel. These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer (continuous gel electrophoresis) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins. Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes. This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using MES or MOPS in the running buffer.\n\nDuring sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95 °C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein by disrupting hydrogen bonds and stretching the molecules. Optionally, disulfide bridges can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing thiols such as β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME, 5% by volume), dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 millimolar) or dithioerythritol (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.\n\nIn addition to the samples, a molecular-weight size marker is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel. The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.\n\nFor separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a voltage (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged anode. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.\n\nThe fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye bromophenol blue to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different pore size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), ionic strength and pH values (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing Tris-glycine-chloride buffer system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the zwitterionic form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-Tricine buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.\n\nAt the end of the electrophoretic separation, all proteins are sorted by size and can then be analyzed by other methods, e. g. protein staining such as Coomassie staining (most common and easy to use), silver staining (highest sensitivity), stains all staining, Amido black 10B staining, Fast green FCF staining, fluorescent stains such as epicocconone stain and SYPRO orange stain, and immunological detection such as the Western Blot. The fluorescent dyes have a comparatively higher linearity between protein quantity and color intensity of about three orders of magnitude above the detection limit, i. e. the amount of protein can be estimated by color intensity. When using the fluorescent protein dye trichloroethanol, a subsequent protein staining is omitted if it was added to the gel solution and the gel was irradiated with UV light after electrophoresis.\n\nProtein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. Glycoproteins have differential levels of glycosylations and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands. Membrane proteins, because of their transmembrane domain, are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower solubility in aqueous solutions, tend to bind lipids, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to hydrophobic effects when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in \"tailing\" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color (\"smear\") below a band. The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a gel extraction can be performed.\n\nAfter protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet cellophane film to which the gel and a one percent glycerol solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50 °C.\n\nFor a more accurate determination of the molecular weight, the relative migration distances of the individual protein bands are measured in the separating gel. The measurements are usually performed in triplicate for increased accuracy. The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility. Bands of proteins with glycosylations can be blurred. Proteins with many basic amino acids (e. g. histones) can lead to an overestimation of the molecular weight or even not migrate into the gel at all, because they move slower in the electrophoresis due to the positive charges or even to the opposite direction. Accordingly, many acidic amino acids can lead to accelerated migration of a protein and an underestimation of its molecular mass.\n\nThe SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low scalability, it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.\n\nAdditionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the western blot for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a \"band shift\") or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).\n\nIn mass spectrometry of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using in-gel digestion. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical ultracentrifugation, but less exact than a mass spectrometry or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the DNA sequence.\n\nIn medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the HIV test and to evaluate proteinuria. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific antibodies of the patient, if they are present in his blood serum. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various serum proteins in the urine, e.g. Albumin, Alpha-2-macroglobulin and IgG.\n\nSDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis sequentially combines isoelectric focusing or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. Native PAGE is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, agarose gel electrophoresis can be used, e.g. the SDD-AGE. Some enzymes can be detected via their enzyme activity by zymography.\n\nWhile being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different chromatographic methods with subsequent photometric quantification, for example affinity chromatography (or even tandem affinity purification), size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography. Proteins can also be separated by size in a tangential flow filtration or a ultrafiltration. Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a pull-down assay. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of extractions and precipitations using kosmotropic molecules, for example the ammonium sulfate precipitation and the polyethyleneglycol precipitation.\n\nIn 1948, Arne Tiselius was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field. The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a zone electrophoresis improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect. The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by David F. Summers in the working group of James E. Darnell to separate poliovirus proteins. The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of bacteriophage T4.\n\n"}

This country is set in Central America, and was created by Australian comedic writers Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch (of \"The D-Generation\" and \"The Panel\" fame).\n\nIn Spanish, San Sombrèro would be translated into English as \"Saint Hat\", \"San\" being the shortened word for the Spanish word \"santo\" meaning saint, and \"sombrero\" (no accent mark in real-world Spanish) meaning hat.\n\nAccording to the book the \"full and technically correct\" name of San Sombrèro is the \"Democratic Free People's United Republic of San Sombrèro\", and citizens may be arrested, without a warrant, if the title is \"not\" used.\n\nThe \"Democratic Free People’s United Republic of San Sombrèro\" is a composite of many stereotypes and clichés about Central America and South America. It would be difficult to position the fictional San Sombèro on a map of Central America. Although it is presented as a thin country between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea (similar to Panama), it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest, in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast, or west to east. If San Sombrèro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and Costa Rica.\n\nThe book says the nation has \"362 separate public holidays (not including the 'carnivale' long weekend)\". San Sombrèro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable banana republic with seemingly endless revolutions and counter-revolutions. The country is said to have had 17 different presidents over 10 years.\n\nSan Sombrèro is described as having a very high literacy rate because of an anti-illiteracy campaign in which \"over 53,000 citizens who were unable to read [were] jailed or deported to Haiti\".\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish, San Sombrèro was said to inhabited by several \"Amer-Indian\" ethnic groups, called the \"Ciboney\" (Siboney) (Nomadic hunter-gatherers), \"Taino\" (who lived on seafood), \"Puorcina\" (who practiced simple agriculture) and the most dominant \"Guanajaxo\" (they just stole from everyone else). But there was a tribe that existed before called the \"Bollivquar\", fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society, which is said to be odd because they \"never quite\" mastered fire, irrigation or star jumps. But they learnt how to farm tobacco, which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet, explaining their stunted growth. Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking.\n\nSan Sombrèro is a Spanish-speaking country, but a dialect has developed known as San Sombrèran, which combines Castilian grammar, Portuguese pronunciation, and indigenous shouting. San Sombrèran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish, because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence (particularly since their breath is so foul). San Sombrèran Spanish has many English loanwords, some of which are \"beisbol\" - baseball, \"hamburgesa\" - hamburger (these two are actual Spanish words), \"beeras\" - beers, and \"dryvebyshooting\" - drive by shooting.\n\nThe San Sombrèran national anthem is \"O Patria Gloriosa\" (O Glorious Motherland), written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro, who is famous for uttering \"He who loves his country, lives forever\" shortly before falling off a ladder and dying. The national anthem is set to a bossa nova beat, and loyal citizens of San Sombrèro will stand respectfully, place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played.\n\n\nThe flag of San Sombrèro is the \"Camouflagio\", which resembles military camouflage, with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side. When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered tablecloth made an impromptu flag.\n\nThe capital city of San Sombrèro is Cucaracha City in Polluçión. There are five provinces in San Sombrèro including Polluçión, the other provinces are: \n\nThe book advertises (fictional) guides on the following places: Unaudited Arab Emirates (the Middle East), Costa Lottsa (akin to Monaco), the Barbituros Islands (the Caribbean), Alpenstein (the Alps), Tyranistan (Former Soviet Union), Nuku'la Atoll (Polynesia), frozen Norgborg (Scandinavia), and the miserable Isle of Fogg (North Sea). It also advertises its website's forum, as well as world tours for botanists and golfers, and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe.\n\nThe book ends with The Jetlag Story.\n\n"}

The budget Inria is providing for the project is €500,000 over three years.\n\nSoftware Heritage was founded by computer scientists Roberto Di Cosmo and Stefano Zacchiroli. Its repository holds over 20 million software projects, with an archive of over 2.7 billion unique source files as of July 2016. \n\nAdditional sponsors of the Software Heritage initiative include Microsoft and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the\nNetherlands Organisation for Scientific Research's Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS). Creative Commons, Free Software Foundation, GitHub, Jason Scott, the Linux Foundation, and Microsoft among others have endorsed the project.\n\nSoftware Heritage's goal is to preserve software in its original source code that is free/open source software (FOSS). The focus of the initiative is to collect, preserve, and share software that is across cultural heritage, industry, education, science, and research communities, with the concern that software that is made up of technical and scientific knowledge will be lost without preservation. The project came about because software code is seen as being even more vulnerable to corruption and obsolescence than typical archival holdings like books and other media like video and film.\n\nThe interface is built using open source code, with an initial focus on search, where end-users search by SHA-1 hashes. The Software Heritage initiative is open to scientific researchers, with the idea that it would be a Library of Alexandria type resource for software. Additionally, Software Heritage will be an infrastructure resource upon which developers can build applications on top of the archive. Another goal is to get guidance from researchers on what features might be valuable as a way to structure output and collection curation.\n\nOther grass-roots initiatives exist, like archivist Jason Scott's Textfiles.com project, the Code Archive (which attempts to archive GitHub), as well as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Software Heritage is gathering software that has free licenses from sources that include GitHub, Debian package archive, and GNU Project FTP archive and from entities like Gitorious and Google Code, projects that no longer exist. \n\nThe archive is structured so knowledge can be preserved, enabling continuous access to digital information, as well as creating a building block for thematic portals and collections of software. The initiative can be used to create better software for the industry, where original software has often been lost. Software Heritage will ensure long-term preservation of software, making software provenance more traceable, integrated, and reusable, with an ability to know licensing (which is not always present) and use constraints, track security vulnerabilities, and assist in the discovery of prior code assets.\n\n"}

{"id": "40633763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40633763", "title": "The Scarecrow (2013 film)", "text": "The Scarecrow (2013 film)\n\nThe Scarecrow is a 2013 animated short film and advertisement by the American restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill. The film features Fiona Apple singing a cover version of \"Pure Imagination\", originally performed by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\".\n\nIn a dystopian world, the main character, Scarecrow, starts work at the \"smoke-spewing\" Crow Foods Incorporated. He sees a tube extracting a substance labeled \"100% Beef-ish\", but being marketed to consumers as \"all natural\". He then witnesses a robotic crow injecting a chicken with green fluid to promote expansion, followed by cows being held captive in small metal boxes while machines continuously milk the cows forcefully. Scarecrow returns to his small farm, seemingly upset by what he witnessed during the workday. He picks a red pepper, which inspires him to harvest other vegetables and open a burrito stand in the city. Above his stand is a banner that reads \"Cultivate a Better World\".\n\nThe computer-animated film features a cover version of \"Pure Imagination\" (Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley) by Fiona Apple, a song originally performed by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in the film \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971), itself an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964). According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", Apple's performance \"scores scenes of dark devastation\" and offers \"stark contrast between the world of pure imagination of the lyrics\" and the animals being processed. In the film, when Scarecrow returns home from work and picks a red pepper, the song transitions from \"mournful\" and \"menacing\" to a \"happier\" tone. Apple released the recording on iTunes, with proceeds benefiting the nonprofit organization, Chipotle Cultivation Foundation.\n\n\"The Scarecrow\" ends with a brief teaser for a mobile app game available for iPhones and iPads, where the player can take down the fictional Crow Foods. Chipotle described the film as a \"companion\" piece to the game.\n\nChief Marketing Officer Mark Crumpacker stated that because his company \"is on a mission to change the way the world thinks of and eats fast food,\" they wished to inform the public about how the food they eat is raised. Brand Voice Lead William Espey added that they wanted to create \"this experience, this film and mobile game that would help us support that mission.\" Crumpacker also stated that the film depicts the \"elaborate facade that's been created by the industrial food producers,\" who have done a \"very good job of creating a rosy picture of their industry.\" The film reflects Chipotle's marketing strategy of avoiding television advertising; the company's goal is to come across as an alternative to factory farming and a more \"highbrow\" option over other fast food restaurants.\n\n\"The Scarecrow\" was animated by Moonbot Studios, a small firm co-founded by William Joyce and Brandon Oldenburg that won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2012. Moonbot liked Chipotle's food and ethos and created a video centered around scarecrows, which \"normally protect food,\" but in this film they protect \"something we call food, but it's something that seriously overproduced on a dramatic scale... which is not that far from the truth.\" Co-directors Oldenburg and Limbert Fabian found inspiration from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", as well as from Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\".\n\nChipotle originally selected Frank Ocean to perform \"Pure Imagination\" for the commercial, but he asked to be removed after the chain declined to remove its logo from the spot. He was ultimately replaced by Fiona Apple. In March 2014, Chipotle sued Ocean for the $212,500 advance that they had paid him to perform in the commercial. The lawsuit was dismissed later that month after Ocean repaid the advance in full.\n\nThe short film was released on September 11, 2013. By September 19, it had been viewed 5.5 million times on YouTube.\n\n\"The Scarecrow\" has been praised as innovative marketing and a \"beautiful\" work of art. \"AdWeek\" felt that the effective animation and Apple's voice \"connects the viewer emotionally to the story,\" but felt that it was \"not quite as magical\" as Chipotle's similarly-themed \"Back to the Start\" video. The \"Los Angeles Times\" Randall Roberts called the film surreal, direct and \"visually magnetic\", and wrote that \"the song as covered by Apple is gorgeous, filled with electronic flourishes and rococo arrangements. The images imbue her version with a melancholy, but, taken on its own, the song shimmers.\" \"Slate\" Matthew Yglesias complimented the film's animation and music, and called the scene in which cows are seen in small crates \"the most poignant moment you've ever witnessed in fast food marketing\". He wrote that, if Chipotle's goal was to create \"high-quality high-impact stuff that really gets attention and is designed to be memorable\", the company was successful. Marketing reporter Bruce Horovitz, contributing for \"USA Today\", named it the fifth best advertisement of the year.\n\nThe film won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approaches – Original Daytime Program or Series and for Outstanding Directing in an Animated Program at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards. It also won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions in June 2014.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18775928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18775928", "title": "Ushahidi", "text": "Ushahidi\n\nUshahidi, Inc. is a non-profit technology company with staff in nine countries whose mission is to help marginalized people raise their voice and those who serve them to listen and respond better. It has been instrumental in creating the Kenyan tech ecosystem, known as the Silicon Savannah, and its employees have gone on to found iHub, Akirachix, and BRCK.\n\nThe organisation uses the concept of crowdsourcing for social activism and public accountability, serving as an initial model for what has been coined as \"activist mapping\"—the combination of social activism, citizen journalism and geospatial information. Ushahidi offers products that enable local observers to submit reports using their mobile phones or the internet, while simultaneously creating a temporal and geospatial archive of events. The Ushahidi platform is often used for crisis response, human rights reporting, and election monitoring. Ushahidi offers products that enable local observers to submit reports using their mobile phones or the internet, while simultaneously creating a temporal and geospatial archive of events. Ushahidi (Swahili for \"testimony\", closely related to shahidi which means \"witness\") created a website in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election that collected eyewitness reports of violence reported by email and text message and placed them on a Google Maps map.\n\nThe Ushahidi platform has been deployed over 125,000 times in over 160 countries, used by The Obama Campaign for America 2012, The United Nations Department of Field Services and Peacekeeping, in response to the Haiti Earthquake in 2010, to monitor the Nigerian elections in 2011, by the Nepalese army to respond to the earthquake of 2015, in and by local activists groups such as Humanitarian Tracker to monitor violence in the Syrian civil war and HarassMap to help women report on sexual harassment.\n\nUshahidi v3 was released in September 2015. As an improvement to the v2 platform it is built as an API with a web client. It allows for custom survey creation, and the running of multiple surveys on a single deployment, amongst other feature improvements from v2 such as embeddable maps and surveys, analytics, private deployments, and management of roles and permissions. It is built on the Laravel PHP web framework. It is open source under the AGPL license.\n\nUshahidi v2 is built on the Kohana web framework, a fork of the CodeIgniter framework. It includes support for Nexmo wholesale SMS API and Clickatell SMS Gateway. Furthermore, the official Ushahidi-hosted websites use the commercial service. Ushahidi provides the option of using OpenStreetMap maps in its user interface, but requires the Google Maps API for geocoding. Ushahidi is often set up using a local SMS gateway created by a local FrontlineSMS set-up.\n\n\nCrowdmap is designed and built by the team behind Ushahidi, a platform that was originally built to crowdsource crisis information. As the platform evolved, so did its users. Crowdmap now allows users to set up their own deployments of Ushahidi without having to install it on a web server. Since its release in 2010, prominent deployments of Crowdmap have documented the global Occupy movement and the 2011 London anti-cuts protest. The original Crowdmap was a hosted version of the Ushahidi v2 open source software platform.\n\nOn 31 December 2010, the Ushahidi team announced a new version of Crowdmap, that differed from the Ushahidi v2 codebase: Checkins, a geosocial add-on to Crowdmap that allows users to create a white-label alternative to sites like Foursquare and Gowalla. Rather than filling out submission forms online, checkins allow Crowdmap users to expedite data entry to their deployment, focussing first on location and adding more detailed information later. Ushahidi describes the effort as \"checkins with a purpose\".\n\nSwiftRiver was designed as a suite of intelligence and real-time data gathering products that complement Ushahidi's mapping and visualization products. Often referred to as \"the SwiftRiver Initiative\" the goal of the project was \"to democratize access to the tools for making sense of information\". The project attracted a lot of interest from newsrooms.\n\nIn December 2014, Ushahidi announced that it would stop development and support and reallocate the resources.\n\nSwiftRiver was a free and Open-source platform that helped people make sense of a lot of information in a short amount of time. It was born out of the need to understand and act upon a wave of massive amounts of crisis data that tends to overwhelm in the first 24 hours of a disaster. There had been a great deal of interest in Swift for other industries such as newsrooms, political analysts and marketers as an open-source alternative to more expensive, proprietary intelligence software platforms. The SwiftRiver platform offered applications which combine natural language/artificial intelligence process, data-mining for SMS and Twitter, and verification algorithms for different sources of information.\n\nUshahidi built RollCall after a team member was involved in the terrorist attack at Westgate Malle in Nairobi in 2013. Rollcall is a quick way to check in with the people someone is responsible for during critical situations. Rollcall sends a one-click message with a binary question such as \"Are you okay?\" to a pre-prepared contact list, such as list of colleagues, parents at a school, or an embassy's list of citizens in a country at that time, via text, email, mobile app, and Slack. The recipients respond with a \"yes\" or \"no\" allowing the organization responsible for them to quickly triage who is in danger.\n\nUshahidi (Swahili for \"testimony\" or \"witness\") is a website created in the aftermath of Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election (see 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis) that collected eyewitness reports of violence sent in by email and text-message and placed them on a Google map. It is also the name of the open source software developed for that site, which has since been improved, released freely, and used for a number of similar projects around the globe.\n\nThe Kenyan site was developed and run by several bloggers and software developers, all current or former residents of Kenya. They include Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich, Ory Okolloh, and David Kobia. The site was initially proposed by Okolloh, developed cheaply, and put online within a few days. International media, government sources, NGOs, and Kenyan journalists and bloggers were used to verify eyewitness testimony. The site was later also used to facilitate donations from abroad.\n\nAn analysis by Harvard's Kennedy School of Government found that Ushahidi was better overall at reporting acts of violence as they began. The data collected by Ushahidi was superior to that reported by the mainstream media in Kenya at the time. The service was also better at reporting non-fatal violence as well as information coming in from rural areas.\n\nOn 23 December 2010, Ushahidi Co-founder and Executive Director Ory Okolloh announced that she was stepping down from her role to become Manager of Policy for Africa at Google.\n\nSoon after its initial use in Kenya, the Ushahidi software was used to create a similar site to track anti-immigrant violence in South Africa, in May 2008. The software has since been used to map violence in eastern Congo, beginning in November 2008. Ushahidi is used in Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in June 2009 to track pharmacy stockouts in several Southeast African countries. Finally, it was used to monitor elections in Mexico and India, among other projects. It was also used by Al Jazeera to collect eyewitness reports during the 2008–09 Gaza War.\n\nThe post election violence in Kenya was the subject of a Harvard Humanitarian Institute study and mentioned in a Berkman Center report.\n\nIn 2010, due to the earthquake in Haiti, Patrick Meier launched a joint effort between Ushahidi, The Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University, UN OCHA/Colombia and the International Network of Crisis Mappers (CM*Net) to start the Haiti implementation. A few hours later many humanitarian/tech workers joined this initiative. Nearly 40,000 independent reports were sent to the Ushahidi Haiti Project of which nearly 4,000 distinct events were plotted.\n\nOnly a month after the Haiti earthquake, the 2010 earthquake in Chile prompted Patrick Meier to launch Ushahidi-Chile within hours of the initial quake. The Chile site is co-managed with the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University in the United States, supported by Chilean Americans.\n\nOn 20 April 2010 BP’s offshore Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded killing eleven workers and precipitating the largest accidental offshore oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. On 3 May the Louisiana Bucket Brigade (LABB) publicly released the Oil Spill Crisis Map, the first application of the Ushahidi platform in a humanitarian response in the United States.\n\nIn the years since the BP oil spill, LABB continues to use the map (now the iWitness Pollution Map) as a repository of eyewitness reports and photos documenting the impacts of petrochemical pollution on human health and the environment. Reports to the map come from cities all over Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, St. Rose, and Chalmette. Since 2010 LABB has collected over 14,000 reports, making it the largest and longest-running deployment of an Ushahidi instance.\n\nIn the wake of winter storms, the \"Washington Post\" and the web development company PICnet used the software to create a site mapping blocked roads and other information.\n\nElena Rapisardi, together with Giovanni Lotto, launched the first Italian crowdmap Open Foreste Italiane in order to list and map information to prevent and manage forest fires; the meaning of this project has been reported on the Ushahidi blog.\n\nThough OpenForeste did not completely achieve his goals, it showed importance for two reasons: (1) unlike previous instances, the platform was utilized in absence of an acting crisis or emergency to collect, map, share and spread information in order to manage future and potential emergencies, thus joining the awareness of the possibilities of Web 2.0 and a different approach to natural risk prevention; (2) it brought to Italy the knowledge and potential of Ushahidi, crowdmapping and social use of crowdsourcing, which was then used in following years in several instances, both private and public, especially from local Civil Protection structures and based on the new approach to the Ushahidi platform (see here a non-complete crowdmap of Italian Crowdsourcing Projects).\n\nUshahidi was used in Russia to set up a \"map of help\" for voluntary workers needed after the 2010 Russian wildfires.\n\nUsing Ushahidi, the Christchurch Recovery Map website was launched less than 24 hours after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. The site maps locations of services such as food, water, toilets, fuel, ATMs, and medical care. Information was gathered via Twitter using the #eqnz hashtag, SMS messages, and email. The site was founded by a group of web professionals, and maintained by volunteers.\n\nThis software allowed pro-democracy demonstrators across the Middle East to organise and communicate what was happening around them in early 2011. On 2 March, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) requested that the Standby Volunteer Task Force be activated for Libya. The Task Force's Tech Team set up a password protected Ushahidi platform almost immediately and several days later launched a public version at OCHA's request. This allowed users to contribute relevant information about ground conditions as they occurred.\n\n\nIn July 2011, Giuseppe Calamita had created the first crowdmap to monitor a WIMAX/LTE Internet Service Provider to answer the issues not due to the ISP (jammer, etc.)\n\nIndia Citizen Reports has been using Ushahidi since 2011 to collect and disseminate reports in various categories like civic problems, crimes and corruption. TelecomMap.com uses Ushahidi to map 3G network quality and Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation used Ushahidi to map the Queensland floods in January.\n\nThe MightyMoRiver Project used Ushahidi's hosted service Crowdmap to track the Missouri River floods of 2011.\n\nTransparency Watch Project is using the Ushahidi platform to track corruption reported cases in the Republic of Macedonia. PrijaviKorupcija is a joint project by Transparency International and the Center for International Relations allowing citizens to report cases of corruption via ONE by sending SMS from their mobile phones, sending an email, using the web form, the hashtag #korupcijaMK on Twitter or by reporting via phone call.\n\nNigerian Elections\n\nUshahidi was used to monitor the Nigerian 2011 elections under the project Reclaim Naija. A published article in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics by Catie Snow Bailard & Steven Livingston showed that, \"Controlling for a number of factors, we find that the number and nature of crowdmap reports generated by citizens is significantly correlated with increased voter turnout (by 8%) in the 2011 Nigerian presidential election as a result of providing officials with improved information about the functionality of local polling stations.\"\n\n\nAl Jazeera Balkans deployed Ushahidi crisis mapping platform on 5 February 2012 to track the snow/cold emergency in the Balkans.\n\nKenya Elections\n\nUshahidi helped run the Uchaguzi partnership to monitor the 2013 Kenyan elections. The deployment gathered over 8000 reports, a report \"Uchaguzi: A Qualitative and Quantitive Analysis of ICTS, Statebuilding, and Peacebuilding in Kenya.\" showed that 75% of reporters said their report was responded to.\n\nKenya\n\nUshahidi announced Ping (now called Rollcall) in response to the attacks on Westgate Mall in Nairobi. The software was used to map out all the blood drive center locations in Nairobi and let users quickly identify places to donate, see which blood types were in demand, and identify whether equipment or volunteers were needed at any locations. Among the goals of this map was to help ensure that when the Kenyan population came out to donate blood, they would know which donation centers needed their blood type the most.\n\nCrowd sourced data were extensively used during the relief and rescue operations at Quakemap.org. Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), a volunteer organization, set up a platform to collect and manage data from crowd using Ushahidi. KLL further managed to conduct first level of verification as well, providing the Nepalese Army with the following details: location, number of affected people, number of death/injured, support requirements, level of urgency, and contact information.\n\nThe Nepalese army report said that \"Crowd Sourcing is one of the common approaches to collect information from the public. Although it is not new in the context of disaster management, but during April Earthquake in Nepal, this approach was appropriately used in a matured way. The systematic process defined by Kathmandu Living Labs volunteers marked a path in utilization of crowd sourced data by implementing agency like Nepalese Army.\"\n\nUshahidi created USAelectionmonitor.com to monitor the USA 2016 Presidential Election. After the election Ushahidi set up Documenthate.org to monitor the spike in hate crimes against minorities in the USA post election. Ushahidi partnered with journalist and activist Shaun King and non-profit journalism group Propublica. The New Yorker covered the story, saying: \"Now Shaun King, a writer for the \"Daily News\", is working with the open-source software company Ushahidi to create a map of post-election intimidation. “Thousands of people have emailed me incident reports over the past seven days,” King wrote me in an e-mail. “The team at Ushahidi is helping me go through them, verify them the best we can, catalogue and then map them, then share them.” The aim is to raise awareness of politically motivated violence and help people stay safe, report it to authorities as needed, and create a database of such incidents.\"\n\nUshahidi ran the Uchaguzi partnership to monitor the 2017 Kenyan elections, the fourth country-wide election monitoring effort for the organization. Ushahidi integrated a Facebook Messenger bot to allow the 7 million Facebook users in Kenya to report via Messenger. The platform received over 7000 reports on election day.\n\nUshahidi has received several awards in recognition to its effectiveness and creativity, latest being The MacArthur Award. The awards received by Ushahidi so far include the following:\n\nOn July 9, 2017, allegations surfaced online of Ushahidi covering up a sexual harassment incident perpetrated by one of the members of their senior leadership. Ushahidi released a statement the next day confirming they were aware of the allegations which were the subject of an ongoing internal inquiry.\n\nFormer Ushahidi board member and co-founder Ory Okolloh, strongly condemned the laxity with which the board dealt with the issue on Jul 11 saying:\n\n“More clarity on steps that have been taken so far and the relevant timelines should be shared and those found culpable either by their action or inaction should resign”.\n\nUshahidi released a second statement on July 17, 2017 detailing the chronology of events showed that the incident occurred on January 19, 2017 and was reported to the board on May 4, 2017, and that on May 5th the accused was placed on temporary leave, given due process, and an investigation was undertaken. After back and forth with both parties' lawyers, the board held an inquiry on July 3 and the accused was alerted of his firing 14 days later on July 17 the date of the statement.\n\nAngela Kabari came out publicly on July 20 as the victim in a Medium post detailing a 6-month ordeal and called for the resignation of the entire Ushahidi board that consisted of David Kobia, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich and Jenny Stefanotti at the time. She identified Daudi Were, Ushahidi's Executive Director, as the accused. Her statement to the board when she reported the matter included an un-notarized transcript of the recording of the incident and claimed an earlier occurrence the previous year. In her post, she said she encountered 11 other victims some of whom were current employees of the organisation and that the board members were aware of Daudi's misconduct in separate incidents spanning 10 years, however, no others came forward. She castigated the board for lack of support, victim shaming, slander, delays and character attacks. Angela resigned on June 28 citing frustration due to “continual stalling and inaction from the board 55 days after my complaint.”\n\nDaudi Were was alerted of his dismissal on July 17th, formally dismissed on July 22, and Ushahidi released an apology to Angela for the harassment she experienced while working at Ushahidi.\n\nUshahidi staff and staff from Ushahidi related organizations, under the banner \"Women in Tech Kenya\", released a statement on Jul 24 that supported Angela's speaking out, condemned Daudi Were's conduct, applauded his dismissal, and supporting the board following due process.\n\nThe Ushahidi board did not resign and through a series of posts defended their conduct, saying that they followed due process in the pursuit of justice. In a statement released on July 28, Ushahidi said that due to the legal process, agreed upon by all parties, all communications had to go through the legal representation and called Ms. Kabari's claims that they did not care about her disingenuous for not understanding the neutral position the board undertook in the sexual harassment investigation.\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Ggulu and the brother of Nambi. His name is translated as \"disease\" or \"death\" and he is responsible for death on Earth according to Ganda mythology.\n\nIn The Legend of Kintu, after Kintu passes all of Ggulu's tests, Ggulu gives him his daughter, Nambi, among other gifts to take back to Earth. He gives them multiple vegetable plants, a hen, and some millet. He warns them then to hurry back to Earth to avoid gaining the attention of Walumbe, Nambi's brother. He tells them not to come back for anything, but when Kintu forgets the hen's millet, he returns for it. After much deliberation, Kintu and Nambi allow Walumbe to stay with them on Earth for a time.\n\nIn tradition with Gandan culture, Walumbe, as a brother of the bride, claimed one of Kintu's children as his own. Kintu refuses Walumbe and continues to do so throughout the years. Frustrated, Walumbe, then begins to kill a single child every day. After conversing with Ggulu, Kaikuzi is sent to aid Kintu in sending Walumbe back to heaven. Walumbe grapples with Kaikuzi and then retreats by digging and hiding within the ground. Kaikuzi soon tires of pursuing Warumbe and asks all of mankind to be silent for two days to lure Walumbe out. When Walumbe finally emerges, children cry out at the sight of him and he again retreats into the earth. Upon Kintu's dismissal, Kaikuzi then returns to Ggulu and explains the situation. Upon hearing of this, Ggulu allows Walumbe to remain on Earth.\n\nWalumbe is therefore blamed as the reason for death on Earth.\n\n"}
