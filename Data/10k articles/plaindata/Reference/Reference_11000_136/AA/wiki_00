It is called the Independent State of Azawad.\n\nFollowing the return of several hundreds of soldiers after the Libyan Civil War in 2011 and the formation of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, an insurgency commenced on 17 January 2012 with an attack in the Kidal Region, near the border with Algeria. Following the March coup d'état, the rebels made further inroads to capture the three biggest cities of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu in three days, respectively. At this point, other factions joined the fighting, including the Islamist Ansar Dine and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa. Despite reports of Ansar Dine taking control of most of what was initially captured by or with the help of the MNLA, the group established their writ over large swathes of the territory. The Tuareg peoples had also long complained of marginalisation within Mali.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the MNLA, Bilal ag Acherif, signed the declaration in Gao, the site of the largest Malian military outpost in the north, on 6 April 2012. It was announced by Moussa ag Attaher on \"France 24\".\n\nThe declaration was issued in French on behalf of the \"voice of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad\" and in consultation with the Executive Committee, the Revolutionary Council, the Consultative Council, the State-Major of the Army of Liberation and the regional offices. It also cited as reasoning France's unilateral attachment of the region to Mali despite an appeal to French President Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe document concluded by adding that the new state declared by the MNLA would recognise international state borders, despite having split the traditional Azawagh over several modern-day states; absolute accordance with the United Nations Charter; and a commitment by the MNLA to establish the \"conditions for a durable peace\" and create state institutions in accordance with a democratic constitution. Before \"irrevocably\" acclaiming the Independent State of Azawad, the document called on the Executive Committee, who would run the country in the interim period, to invite the international community to immediately recognise the new state in the interests of \"justice and peace\".\n\nThe day before the declaration, the Foreign Ministry of Algeria said that an armed faction raided the Algerian consulate in the northeast kidnapping the consul and six staff members. Though Attaher called it \"deplorable\", he said the MNLA went along with the action in order not to result in deaths. The \"AFP\" also quoted a Malian military source as saying that to the best of Malian Army's intelligence \"the MNLA is in charge of nothing at the moment... it is Iyad <nowiki>[</nowiki>Ag Ghaly<nowiki>]</nowiki> who is the strongest and he is with AQIM\". His Ansar Dine said that it was \"against rebellions. We are against independence. We are against revolutions not in the name of Islam.\" Some of the MLNA's leadership were also said to have been surprised by the declaration. Europe-based Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed, one of the spokesmen of the MNLA and the head of external relations, said: \"I think it's premature — premature to speak of this right now, without a consultation and an understanding with some of the actors that are very active on the local level, and with which we need to work, and we need to find common objectives, common strategies.\"\n\nSupranational bodies\n\n\nStates\n\n\nAcademia\n\nAlessandra Giuffrida of the African Studies Department at the School of Oriental and African Studies said:\n[The MNLA] is taking advantage of a new situation:the lack of a constitutional government and power vacuum in Bamako after the coup. This is a new fact which has never occurred before in the history of the Tuareg in Mali. According to international law experts, this actually gives the Tuareg some ground to fight legally for the independence of their state. [The international reactions reflect that] there are economic interests in maintaining the status quo in the north of the country after the discovery of mineral resources.\n\n\n"}

The full title name of the atlas reads as Cedid Atlas Tercümesi (meaning, literally, \"A Translation of a New Atlas\") and in most libraries outside Turkey, it is recorded and referenced accordingly.\n\nAlthough manuscripts and hand-drawn maps were widely available throughout the Muslim world, the massive printing of books started only in 1729 by Ibrahim Muteferrika and the \"Cedid Atlas\" could only be published in 1803 by Müderris Abdurrahman Efendi in a style based on European sources.\n\nThe \"Cedid Atlas\" includes a monochrome celestial chart and 24 hand-coloured copper engraved maps of various parts of the world; the celestial chart and maps measure at least (53 cm by 72 cm) and all the maps are actually adaptations of William Faden's \"General Atlas\". The maps are preceded by a (1+79) page-long treatise of geography, \"Ucalet-ül Coğrafiye\" by Mahmud Raif Efendi and a title page. The \"Ucalet-ül Coğrafiye\" of Mahmud Raif Efendi was printed one year later, in 1804, and bound together with the atlas.\n\nFrom a point of view of art, the atlas is notable for the color of the maps as well as the beauty of the script on the maps.\n\nThe \"Cedid Atlas\" was published in parallel with the developments of the Ottoman Empire's Nizam-ı Cedid, the \"New-Order\" or the \"New System\" (\"Cedid\" means \"new\" and \"Nizam\" means \"system\", \"regime\", or \"order\") and its title-name reflects this clearly. The atlas was new in terms of cartographical knowledge and well suited to the new system which tried to introduce new institutions into the Ottoman Empire while trying to replace existing ones with contemporary counterparts from the West. Introduced by the ruling padishah (the sultan) of the Ottoman Empire, Selim III, the \"New-Order\" included a series of reforms which mainly modernized and changed the structure of the then existing Ottoman army and changed the administrative structure of the Empire. It was an effort to catch up with technical, military, economic, and administrative achievements of the West against which the Ottoman Empire was losing grounds since the 17th century. New military and engineering schools were established and governmental units related with the foreign relations and affairs were re-organized to align with the new system. For these schools, governmental units, and the wholly re-organized army reformed according to the European practice, a new understanding and applications of geography of the standards of the West were necessary and the \"Cedid Atlas\" was translated and printed for this purpose.\n\nOnly 50 copies of this atlas (measuring 36 cm x 53 cm) were printed at the press. A copy was presented to Selim III; several copies were also presented to the high-ranking officials of the Empire, some were reserved for the library of Muhendishane (military engineering school of the time), and the remaining were reserved for sale. However, during the \"Alemdar Vakası\", an uprising of the janissaries in Constantinople during November 15–18, 1808, a fire at the warehouse of the press destroyed an unknown (unaccounted) number of the copies reserved for sale. Based on several estimates and accounting for the single maps (torn-out from bound volumes of the atlas) sold or being sold worldwide, it is believed that a maximum of 20 complete examples could be present in libraries or in private collections whereas some sources suggest that there exist only 10 complete and intact copies in the world. As such, it's one of the rarest printed atlases of historical value.\n\nA few sources outside Turkey and the Muslim world also refer to this atlas as the New Great Atlas. In Turkey, since the printing press of the book was located in the historical Üsküdar (Scutari) region (now a municipality) of Istanbul, the atlas sometimes is referred to as the Üsküdar Atlası.\n\nThese are the only 12 complete copies known to exist in the world:\n\n\nThese are the incomplete copies known to exist in the world:\n\nThe following libraries possess very limited portions of the atlas :\n\n\nOccasionally, single maps of the Cedid Atlas are presented for sale by on-line book sellers or auctioneers.\n\nIn addition to the (53 cm x 72 cm) monochrome celestial map, there are 24 coloured maps in the atlas; some of them are larger than (53 cm x 72 cm). In order of appearance, these maps show:\n\n\nThe watermark of the papers on which the maps were printed were examined. While some Princeton University professors believe the papers are Russian-made, John Delaney, the historical maps curator for the Princeton University Library, believes the paper is possibly from Venice, Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is said to be the oldest military ceremony in the world, and is the best-known ceremonial tradition of the Tower. \n\nAt exactly 9.53 pm, the Chief Yeoman Warder, dressed in Tudor watchcoat and bonnet, and carrying a candle lantern, leaves the Byward Tower and falls in with the Escort to the Keys, a military escort made up of armed members of the Tower of London Guard. The Warder passes his lantern to a soldier, and marches with his escort to the outer gate. The sentries on duty salute the Queen’s Keys as they pass.\n\nThe Warder first locks the outer gate and then the gates of the Middle and Byward Towers. The Warder and escort march down Water Lane, until they reach the Bloody Tower archway where a sentry challenges the party to identify themselves:\n\nThe Warder and escort march down to the foot of Broadwalk Steps where the main Tower Guard is drawn up to meet them. The party halts, and the officer in charge gives the command to present arms. The Chief Warder steps forward, doffs his bonnet, and proclaims:\n\nOn the answering “Amen” the clock of the Waterloo Barracks strikes 10pm and the Last Post is sounded, marking the end of the ceremony.\n\nThe Guard is dismissed, and the Chief Warder takes the keys to the Queen's House for safekeeping overnight.\n\nThe origins of the ceremony are unknown. It may have begun during the Middle Ages, and it is often stated that a ceremony in some form has been held since the 14th century. Written instructions that the keys should be placed in a safe place by a Tower officer, after securing the gates, date back to the 16th century. In its current form the ceremony is likely to date to the 19th century when the institution of the Yeomen Warders was reformed by the then Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington.\n\nThe ceremony has never been cancelled, and has been delayed only on a single occasion due to enemy action during the Second World War. During an air raid on London, a number of incendiary bombs fell on the old Victorian guardroom just as the Chief Warder and the escort were coming through the Bloody Tower archway. The Chief Warder and the escort were blown off their feet, but they recovered and carried on. The Tower holds a letter from the Officer of the Guard apologising to King George VI that the ceremony was late, along with a reply from the King which says that the officer is not to be punished as the delay was due to enemy action.\n\nBetween 40 and 50 visitors are allowed access to the ceremony each night, under escort. Tickets are free but must be obtained in advance from Historic Royal Palaces, the organisation that looks after the Tower. The event is usually sold out at least 12 months in advance.\n\n"}

Instead, Java classes are compiled into a proprietary bytecode format and run on Dalvik (or compiled version thereof with newer ART), a specialized virtual machine (VM) designed for Android. Unlike Java VMs, which are stack machines (stack-based architecture), the Dalvik VM is a register machine (register-based architecture).\n\nDalvik has some traits that differentiate it from other standard VMs:\n\nBecause the bytecode loaded by the Dalvik virtual machine is not Java bytecode and due to the way Dalvik loads classes, it is impossible to load library packages as jar files. A different procedure must be used to load Android libraries, in which the content of the underlying codice_1 file must be copied in the application private internal storage area before it is loaded.\n\nAs is the case for the Java SE class , the Android class allows retrieving system properties. However, some mandatory properties defined with the Java virtual machine have no meaning or a different meaning on Android. For example:\n\nCurrent versions of Android use the latest Java language and its libraries (but not full graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks), not the Apache Harmony Java implementation, that older versions used. Java 8 source code that works in latest version of Android, can be made to work in older versions of Android.\n\nBy default, the default output stream and do not output anything, and developers are encouraged to use the class, which logs Strings on the LogCat tool.

User interfaces are built using View objects. Android uses a framework similar to Swing, based on s rather than s. However, Android widgets are not JavaBeans: the Android application must be provided to the widget at creation.\n\nAndroid widget library does not support a pluggable look and feel architecture. The look and feel of Android widgets must be embedded in the widgets. However, a limited ability exists to set styles and themes for an application.\n\nContrary to Swing where layout managers can be applied to any container widget, Android layout behavior is encoded in the containers.\n\nAndroid includes only a small subset of the codice_8 package ( and related classes).\n\n"}

The document was first ciculated in July 2012. The document warns of seven dangerous Western values, allegedly including media freedom and judicial independence. Teaching on any of the seven topics is forbidden. There is an emphasis on controlling and preventing communication using the internet of ideas subversive to one party rule. The document was issued in the context of planned economic reforms and increased calls for political reform. It has been described as a critique of the \"liberal ways of thinking\".\n\nThe document was not made available to public by the Chinese government, but in July 2013 was allegedly leaked by Chinese dissident journalist Gao Yu, who was in turn sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment for \"leaking state secrets\".\n\nIt is unclear whether this document is official Chinese policy or just a faction within the government. However, \"The New York Times\" suggests that it \"bears the unmistakable imprimatur of Xi Jinping\".\n\nIt is thought that Document No. 9 was issued by the Central Committee General Office, and would have required the approval of Mr. Xi and other top leaders.\nA harsh crackdown against human rights lawyers, media outlets, academics, and other such independent thinkers has followed the document's publication.\n\nThe document has been described as a communiqué or circular. The name of the document (\"Document Number Nine\"), as it came to be commonly referred in Western English-language press, comes from the fact that it was the ninth such document issued that year in China.\n\nThe document is highly critical of what can be broadly described as \"Western values\" (the document itself uses terms such as \"Western values\", \"Western principles\", \"Western standards\", \"Western ideas\", and more precisely, \"Western constitutional democracy\" and \"Western-style theories of governance\", as well as making references to \"Western anti-China forces\"). The document is critical of \"extremely malicious\" ideals spreading in the Chinese society, such as ideas of (Western) constitutional democracy, civil society, universal values (freedom, democracy, and human rights), neo-liberalism, and freedom of the press (described as the \"Western news values\"). The document warns that such subjects undermine the Chinese Communist Party's control over the Chinese society. The document also promotes ways of dealing with these problems, which include \"Unwavering adherence to the principle of the Party's control of media.\"\n\nThe document specifically addresses the following issues that were seen as problems. These are the terms used in the document itself:\n\nThe contents of the memo became known when accounts of presenting it to cadre in the Liaoyuan municipal government were published in the local paper. In May 2013 cadre at the Chongqing Party Committee for Urban and Rural Construction studied the material, as did cadre in Anyang. However, there were no explicit mentions of the seven Western values above.\n\nIn April 2015, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Josh Chin reported a 71-year-old Chinese journalist was convicted for releasing Document 9. Journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to seven years in prison by Beijing's Third Intermediate People’s Court after being found guilty in a closed trial of leaking state secrets to foreign media. Ms Gao was accused by the court of leaking an internal Communist Party directive to an overseas Chinese news site in 2013, according to her lawyer, Mo Shaoping. Known as Document No. 9. Historically, it is rare for Chinese authorities to detain or jail elderly critics, who were traditionally given quiet warnings when they crossed political red lines. The article suggests that the charge is a pretext for aggressive action against political dissent and cites other examples of elderly publishers and journalists being prosecuted.\n\nAccording to news analysis by a reporter at \"The New York Times\", the emphasis on political discipline is intended to forestall leftist, or Maoist, opposition to needed economic reforms avoiding the split which resulted in the Soviet Union during Gorbachev's reform efforts when media freedom resulted in publishing of a great deal of critical historical material and alienation of the mass of party workers.\n"}

There were three secondary sections, covering mechanical appliances used to process raw materials, specimens of historical products, and foreign materials imported in their raw state.\n\nIn the summer of 1933, the Geological Museum, still at its old location, was the focus of worldwide attention when it served as the venue of the London Economic Conference, bringing together the representatives of 66 nations in a failed effort to end the then-prevalent global depression. \n\nWhen the museum was reopened in 1935 following the move to Exhibition Road in South Kensington, it became well known for the many dioramas (three-dimensional paintings) used to interpret geology and one or two mining techniques. These have largely been dismantled since the Natural History Museum took over the Museum in 1986.\n\nIn 1965, the museum was merged with the British Geological Survey and Overseas Geological Surveys, under the name \"Institute of Geological Sciences\". In 1971 the Museum employed the late designer James Gardner to design and produce \"The Story of the Earth\", which was acknowledged as a significant breakthrough in science museum design and critically acclaimed and imitated worldwide. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and became well known for the huge reproduction of a rock face, cast from site in Scotland, and for its planetarium, active volcano model and earthquake machine.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974 the museum formed its own design team which, working closely with the scientists and technicians, produced a series of temporary and permanent exhibitions starting with the re-presentation of the gem collection and then, with a design team led by Giles Velarde (Head of Exhibition Design from 1974–1988), produced \"Early Days of Geology in Britain\", \"Black Gold\", \"Britain Before Man\", \"Journey to the Planets\", \"British Fossils\", \"Pebbles\", \"Treasures of the Earth\" and finally \"British Offshore Oil and Gas\", which opened in 1988.\n\n\"Treasures of the Earth\" was the first major museum gallery in the world to integrate computers presenting images and text adjacent to artefacts as part of the information process within the exhibition. The central feature film, \"Liquid Assets\", in the \"Oil and Gas\" exhibition was shot and viewed vertically from a circular gallery and won a major award from the IVCA in 1989.\n\n\"The Power Within\" exhibition on seismology includes a reconstruction of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.\n\nFollowing the relocation of the British Geological Survey's academic activities to Keyworth, the museum was transferred from the custody of the Natural Environment Research Council to the newly independent Natural History Museum. Although an administrative merger with the Natural History Museum had been effected by 1988 (from which time the former Geological Museum was promoted as \"The Earth Galleries\"), it was not until 1998 that the previously difficult to find corridor between the two museum buildings was replaced by a new link gallery. The former Geological Museum galleries are now known as the \"Red Zone\" in the Natural History Museum's plans and internal directional signage.\n\nSurveys had shown that relatively few visitors navigated the Geological Museum's monumental staircase to the top floors. A major re-ordering of the galleries means that visitors are now encouraged to start their visit at the top of the building by ascending an escalator as part of the visit itinerary. \n\nThe former Central Hall of the museum, renamed as Visions of Earth, was transformed in 1996 to a design by Neal Potter. This included the installation of a large escalator (rising eleven metres at a 30° slope) that ascends continuously over two storeys and passes through a model globe. The previously open-sided balconies of the atrium space are now solid walls lined with slabs of recycled slate. These are sand-blasted to show the major stars in the night sky and the planets in the solar system. When first opened, the globe rotated around the escalator, with dramatic sound effects based on Jimi Hendrix's \"Third Stone from the Sun\", attempting to give an impression of the flux in the core of the Earth.\n\nThe Museums Association's journal \"Museum Practice\" reported in 2007 that \"the contrast between galleries just before and just after Potter’s arrival (at the Natural History Museum) is like switching over from a television programme made for schools to a big-screen epic, choreographed by Busby Berkeley.\"\n\nThe museum hires out the hall as a venue for occasional events including dinners and receptions for up to 500 guests.\n\n"}

Wartberge used previous chronicles (Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and Chronicle of Henry of Livonia), archival documents, and personal experiences. As the narrative became more detailed around 1358, it is believed that Wartberge joined the Order around the time and began describing the events as an eyewitness. For example, in 1366 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Gdańsk (Danzig) and took part in numerous military campaigns against the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Wartberge provided extensive details on localities of the frequent raids and on construction of Livonian fortresses.

{"id": "29946187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29946187", "title": "Hermitage Volunteer Service", "text": "Hermitage Volunteer Service\n\nThe Hermitage Volunteer Service of the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia is an organisation of volunteers that unites foreign and Russian students with the goal of providing assistance to this world-renowned museum. The program aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities and functions as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, making the knowledge of the museum’s experts accessible to the general community. Volunteers also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests in connection with the museum.\n\nThe mission statement of the Hermitage Volunteer Service is \"Fostering a sense of responsibility for the preservation of cultural heritage.\" The principal mission of the Volunteer Service is to acquaint young people with international culture and heritage through access to the Hermitage's extensive international collections. The volunteer program aims to help younger generations understand the value of tradition and to instill in them a feeling of responsibility for its preservation. The Volunteer Service involves young students in various cultural projects, many of which are directly linked to various museum activities.\n\nShortly before the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, Mikhail Kozhukhovskij approached the Hermitage Administration and proposed to create a volunteer service to help the organisation of the tricentennial activities. At the same time, he began to search for individuals with experience in the creation of educational programs who were interested in being part of such a project. Due to his efforts, the Hermitage was able to choose from among a group of 150 individuals prepared to help. On 23 May, 2003 a group of volunteers wearing red uniforms entered the Hermitage for the first time and began to assist in any way they could. Kozhukovskij was assigned to head this new Volunteer Service. While still in its infancy, the program created many projects in collaboration with various departments of the Hermitage, which allowed volunteers to become an integral part of the museum's staff.\n\nThe program is continually renewed through a constant flow of new volunteers of diverse background; students and workers, Russians and foreigners, young and old work together for the general improvement of the Hermitage. Currently volunteers involved with the program come from all over the world including Russia, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Lebanon, Brazil, Korea, Ireland, and other countries. Each volunteer devotes time to the program according to their individual schedules and skills. They include linguists, art historians, journalists, teachers, computer scientists, and individuals from other professions not necessarily linked to the cultural sphere. For instance, the volunteer service includes a bus driver, an arachnologist, and a dancer. After Hermitage volunteers leave the Service, many keep in touch with the program and its other members. In this way, the volunteer program has established an extensive international network of contacts.\n\nOn November 23, 2013, the government of Saint Petersburg’s Council for Youth Politics organised a celebration in honour of the State Hermitage Museum’s volunteer program in the atrium of the museum. The celebration’s main goal was to promote the museum’s young volunteer movement and raise awareness for the volunteer’s activities and projects among the citizens, authorities and companies.\nAmong the 150 organisations participating in the competition, the best were awarded honorary diplomas and prizes. As a competitor in the competition for “Most Effective Volunteer Program”, the State Hermitage won the award in the category “Execution of Municipal Events”. \nAn honorary diploma and the bronze statue of the “Little Prince” were awarded to the volunteer program’s coordinator Mikhail Kozhukhovskij.\n\nBelow are some examples of the activities in which members of the program may participate:\n\nWorld Heritage & Youth (WHY) is the flagship project of the Volunteer Service. Its main goal is to bring into focus the importance of tradition. This project involves volunteers in various programs and conferences concerning cultural preservation. One example of the sort of issues tackled by the WHY project is the debate regarding the construction of the Okhta Center, one of the most criticized building projects proposed in contemporary Saint Petersburg. Many volunteers have reacted negatively to its potential construction. Stressing the importance of preserving the historic center of Saint Petersburg, the program is actively involved in the discussion surrounding this controversial project.\n\nThe Summer University of the State Hermitage Museum is the direct result of the WHY project. Since 2009, the Volunteer Service has organized the Summer University each July in collaboration with the Russian company Rosatom. Students, often from remote areas of Russia, are invited to participate in a series of events and activities designed to educate them about cultural tradition. For many of them, the Summer University is the first opportunity to discover and to explore the notion of cultural heritage. The Volunteer Service organizes various activities in conjunction with this programme.\n\nProject Ropsha was the first project created by the Volunteer Service. The city of Ropsha, located southwest of Saint Petersburg, is the site of a palace included in UNESCO’s World Heritage List. Hermitage volunteers took part in a campaign to stop the destruction of this monument. They started by gathering information about the location, and then created a unique archive. The project involved the creation of the Christmas Tree Museum at the site of the palace, which helps the children of the city to understand this almost universal holiday tradition.\n\nEvery year the Volunteer Service organizes games conquests and activities for school-aged children and students. For example, in one fun and interesting game, students can get acquainted with the pages of world history and culture. It is a fascinating journey through the halls of the museum in search of unusual treasures and exhibits. The aim is to present world history on a level easily understood by children. Each game focuses on a particular aspect of history, cultural heritage, or tradition. In February 2009 the Service created a game called \"The Day of the Scythians\" which helped children not only discover the ancient Scythians, but also the nomads of the rich Pazyryk culture.\n\nThe Service also organizes educational contests developed through collaboration with schools as part of their academic programs. Various Hermitage departments are also involved in this kind of activity. When visiting the thematic excursions and engaging in some investigations, students can discover a wonderful world of history and culture.\n\nGames and quests organized by the Volunteer Service of the Hermitage:\n\nSince 2005 the Volunteer Service of the State Hermitage has been hosting contests for students in the field of information technology. Every year the Volunteer Service develops and organizes contests with the NMO \"School Center.\" The theme of the contest depends on the Hermitage Museum exhibitions and events. The contest includes special educational programs for participants aged 6 to 17 years, a staff of volunteers and informatics teachers, and an official awards ceremony. The types of competition entries include animations, multimedia performances, and computer arts. The winning entries are displayed on monitors in the halls of the Museum.\n\nThe contests held by the Volunteer Service of the State Hermitage:\n\n"}

The expression \"Partes Transsylvanæ\" \"area beyond the forest\" appears in the 12th century in \"Legenda Sancti Gerhardi\" and subsequently as \"Transsilvania\" in medieval documents of the Hungarian kingdom.\n\nThe names of \"Ardeal\" in Romanian and \"Erdély\" in Hungarian are believed to be connected. However, the original source and meaning are disputed and claimed by both Romanians and Hungarians. \n\nThe first Hungarian form recorded was \"Erdeuelu\" (12th century, in the \"Gesta Hungarorum\"), while the first Romanian form recorded was in 1432 as \"Ardeliu\". The initial \"a\"/\"e\" difference between the names can be found in other Hungarian and Romanian words, such as Hung. \"egres\" ‘gooseberry’ → Rom. \"agriș\", \"agreș\", as well as in placenames, e.g., \"Egyed\", \"Erdőd\", \"Erdőfalva\", \"Esküllő\" → \"Adjud\", \"Ardud\", \"Ardeova\", and \"Așchileu\".\n\nThe consensus of Hungarian linguists and Hungarian historians on the etymology of both \"Erdély\" and \"Transylvania\" is as follows:\n\nSeveral Romanian perspectives have suggested alternative etymologies:\n\nThe oldest occurrences of this form are from the 13th century:\n\nThere exist a number of theories on the etymology of \"Siebenbürgen\", the German name for Transylvania.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory is that \"Siebenbürgen\" refers to the seven principal fortified towns of the Transylvanian Saxons. The name first appeared in a document from 1296. An alternate Medieval Latin version, \"Septem Castra\" (\"Seven fortresses\") was also used in documents. The towns alluded to are: Bistritz (Bistrița, Beszterce), Hermannstadt (Sibiu, Nagyszeben), Klausenburg (Cluj-Napoca, Kolozsvár), Kronstadt (Brașov, Brassó), Mediasch (Mediaș, Medgyes), Mühlbach (Sebeș, Szászsebes), and Schässburg (Sighișoara, Segesvár). \n\nOther theories include:\n\nThe Slavic names of the region (\"Sedmigradsko\" or \"Sedmogradsko\" (\"Седмиградско\" or \"Седмоградско\") in Bulgarian, \"Sedmogradska\" in Croatian, \"Sedmograjska\" in Slovene, \"Sedmihradsko\" in Czech, \"Sedmohradsko\" in Slovak, \"Siedmiogród\" in Polish, \"Semihorod\" (\"Семигород\") in Ukrainian), as well as its Walloon name (\"Zivenbork\"), are translations of the German one.\n\nIn Ukrainian, the name Zalissia (), meaning \"beyond the forest\" is also used.\n"}
{"id": "5066100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5066100", "title": "Homo Necans", "text": "Homo Necans\n\nHomo Necans: the Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth () is a 1972 book on ancient Greek religion and mythology by Walter Burkert. It won the Weaver Award for Scholarly Literature, awarded by the Ingersoll Foundation, in 1992.\n\nBurkert's core thesis is that when paleolithic man became a hunter, in spite of the generally omnivorous orientation of the great apes, lack of a predator instinct was made up for by turning patterns of intra-species aggression against the prey: \"Homo necans\" means \"man the killer\". Thus, the animal hunted by ancient man automatically acquired aspects of an equal, as if it were of one of the hunter's relations. In a first attempt at applying ethology to religious history, Burkert confronts the power and effect of tradition in uncovering traces of ancient hunting rituals so motivated in historical animal sacrifice and human sacrifice (by his thesis unified as deriving from the same fundamental principle) in specific historical Greek rituals with relevance to human religious behaviour in general. Burkert acknowledges that a decisive impulse for the thesis derived from Konrad Lorenz' \"On Aggression\" (1963).\n\nThe thesis is an extension of the hunting hypothesis, which states that hunting as a means of obtaining food was a dominant influence on human evolution and cultural development (as opposed to gathering vegetation or scavenging). The guilt incurred in the violence of the hunt was reflected in sacred crimes, which through rituals of cleansing and expiation served to unify communities. Burkert supports his thesis by integrating a multitude of examples that elaborate primitive ritual as it is reflected in Greek mythology. He examines various cult-complexes in detail, confronting \"sacrificial ritual with its tension between encountering death and affirming life, its external form consisting of preparations, a frightening central moment, and restitution\", and affirming in detail the initial hypothesis.\n\n\"Homo Necans\" was conceived in the 1960s; it controversially introduced functionalism, along the lines of Jane Ellen Harrison's \"Themis\", to a German audience, and employed a form of structuralism in interpreting complexes of ritual and festival, to apply some findings of ethology for the first time to mythology. René Girard's \"Violence and the Sacred\" appeared the same year. The book that was controversial at its first appearance was less revolutionary when it finally appeared in English, Burkert noted, in an introduction to the English translation (1983). Historian Peter Gay praised \"Homo Necans\" as a suggestive discussion of the impulse to revenge.\n\nRobert Parker, in reviewing \"Homo Necans\" for \"The Times Literary Supplement\", observed of Burkert that \"boldness of theory and consummate learning are united in him as in few others\". M.L. West, in \"Journal of Hellenic Studies\", remarked that the book was \"an exceptional intellectual experience\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2926944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2926944", "title": "Intercultural learning", "text": "Intercultural learning\n\n\"'Intercultural learning\"is an area of research, study and application of knowledge about different cultures, their differences and similarities. On the one hand, it includes a theoretical and academic approach (see e.g. \"Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS)\" by Milton Bennett, Dimensions of Culture by Geert Hofstede). On the other hand, it comprises practical applications such as learning to negotiate with people from different cultures, living with people from different cultures, living in a different culture and the prospect of peace between different cultures.\nCurrently, intercultural learning is a topic which receives much interest. This is mainly due to the rise of cultural studies and globalization. Culture has become an instrument for social interpretation and communicative action. Intercultural learning is primarily important in the context of the foreign language classroom.\n\nBasic training modules include:\n\nThe main goal of intercultural learning is seen as the development of intercultural competence, which is the ability to act and relate appropriately and effectively in various cultural contexts:\nIntercultural competence is generally thought to require three components on the learner's side: a certain skillset, culturally sensitive knowledge, and a motivated mindset. In greater detail, the skills, values, and attitudes that constitute intercultural competence include\nThe teacher's task is to induce the learning of all in these aspects in the learner. Being successful, intercultural learning results in culturally competent learners.\n\nIn the context of intercultural learning, it is important to be aware of different subcategories of culture, such as \"little c\" and \"big C\" culture. While the latter one is also called \"objective culture\" or \"formal culture\" referring to institutions, big figures in history, literature, etc., the first one, the \"subjective culture\", is concerned with the less tangible aspects of a culture, like everyday patterns. In intercultural learning, a mixture of these two is to be employed, but it is especially the apprehension of subjective culture that triggers the development of intercultural competence.\nAlso, it is important to differentiate between \"culture-specific\" and \"culture-general\" approaches when intercultural learning is concerned:\nIntercultural learning requires the teacher to employ a mix of \"culture-specific\" and \"culture-general\" approaches in order to address the larger issues of ethnocentrism, cultural self-awareness, etc. because intercultural competence cannot be achieved by the single acquisition of knowledge about a specific culture or the pure ability to behave properly in that culture.\n\nThe MUSIC Intercultural Model was designed by Jon Jeeves in 1996 to help businesses become more aware and effective when dealing with people from different cultures. The name for the model is an acronym and is based on five cultural dimensions, which through research and practical experience of international projects, have shown to represent the major value differences with conflict potential in global business.\n\nThe model compliments research from Hall, Trompenaars and Hofstede in addition to the validation and refinement carried out by Jon Jeeves and his ongoing work with international teams.\n\nThe five categories are:\n\n\nContexts that are seen as appropriate for intercultural learning in the classroom are those which promote the acquisition of intercultural competence consisting of the components mentioned above. Examples:\n\nOf particular importance to intercultural learning is understanding cultural differences in learning processes. Intercultural learning programs could benefit greatly from the analysis of cultural trends in these processes. By doing so, educators can see how indigenous people of America are affected by classroom norms. In indigenous American ways of learning, children are included in the community and have lots of experience collaborating with each other and adults in productive ways.\n\n\nAnalysis of cultural differences in learning can provide new and useful insight that can be applied to intercultural learning practice. In other words, learning trends in students' cultural backgrounds can be used by teachers to create more well informed pedagogy. For example, if indigenous American or indigenous-heritage American students were in an intercultural learning program, teachers could communicate knowledge by creating a more collaborative setting, and by adjusting pace of speech to be consistent with the students'.\n\nAs with most activities employed in the classroom, activities for intercultural learning are supposed to keep the affective domain of learning in mind, that is, they are to keep the students motivated and enable them to somehow identify with topic that is dealt with. For intercultural learning this is especially true because this field is likely to turn into a delicate matter.\n\nThe concept of intercultural learning aiming at the development of intercultural competence also requires a new understanding of the teacher him/herself. S/He is no longer a mere communicator of knowledge, but a mediator and moderator, and has to be educated accordingly. In times of globalization and hope for peace, this issue needs to be researched further and remain of huge interest.\n\n\n\n"}

They are defined by the ITU-T in standards E.123 and E.164. The prefixes enable international direct dialing (IDD), and are also referred to as \"international subscriber dialing\" (ISD) codes.\nCountry codes are a component of the international telephone numbering plan, and are necessary only when dialing a telephone number to establish a call to another country. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local international call prefix must first be dialed. For example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the North American Numbering Plan is 011, while it is 00 in most European, Asian and African countries. On GSM (cellular) networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.\n\nCountry calling codes are prefix codes and can be organized as a tree. In each row of the table, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.\nWhile there is a general geographic grouping to the zones, some exceptions exist for political and historical reasons.

{"id": "2530829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2530829", "title": "Maxim (philosophy)", "text": "Maxim (philosophy)\n\nA maxim is a concise expression of a fundamental moral rule or principle, whether considered as objective or subjective contingent on one's philosophy. A maxim is often pedagogical and motivates specific actions. The \"Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy\" defines it as:\n\nIn deontological ethics, mainly in Kantian ethics, maxims are understood as subjective principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1) the action, or type of action; (2) the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3) the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the categorical imperative provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.\n\nThe categorical imperative is stated canonically as: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\nIn his \"Critique of Practical Reason\", Immanuel Kant provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:\nI have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.\n\nAlso, an action is said to have \"moral worth\" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his duty purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason. Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely \"from duty\", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.\n\nMichael Polanyi in his account of tacit knowledge stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern...Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2697306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2697306", "title": "Old Moore's Almanac", "text": "Old Moore's Almanac\n\nOld Moore's Almanac is an almanac which has been published for nearly two and a half centuries. Its founder, Theophilus Moore, ran a classical academy at Milltown which was then a village near Dublin (since that time, it has been incorporated into the city). A teacher of Irish, English, Greek and Latin, he became known as a clever mathematician and a veritable wizard of astrology, gaining the nickname 'The Irish Merlin'. He published his \"Old Moore's Almanac\" for the first time in 1764, and received such support that the other Irish almanacs gradually dwindled away. Theophilus Moore is now buried in the Drumcondra Churchyard, in Dublin, but the tradition of \"Old Moore's Almanac\" continues unbroken to this day.\n\nThe \"Old Moore's Almanac\" is not to be confused with \"Old Moore's Almanack\" (with a \"k\"), an English publication.\n\nThe \"Old Moore's Almanac\" is published annually in November. The current owners of the \"Old Moore's Almanac,\" the Lithographic Group, possess back issues dating from 1914 onwards. Issues before this time are held in the National Library of Ireland. The magazine was traditionally a resource for the merchants and business people of the late 1760s, and later, an entertainment-style publication for the agricultural community in rural Ireland. Farmers and fishing folk of the day found the tables of moon and tide times, and transport information, among other useful information very handy on a daily basis. \n\nNow that such information is available on the internet, the magazine was re-launched in 2010, offering a more diverse product to capture new audiences. The magazine is now full colour and now has editorial features. Topics include the revival of lost Irish traditions, technology, urban farming, country sporting pursuits, unusual breeds of animals, recipes, hints and tips, the paranormal, traditional medicine, horoscopes, and an analysis of antique issues of the Almanac (pre-1950). The circulation of the hard copy is around 47,000, with most sales achieved in Athlone, Dublin, Galway and Cork. The predictions are the most popular section of the \"Almanac\". The in-house psychic remains anonymous, often quoting that he \"likes to stay under the radar\" and away from public life.\n\nThe magazine has increased its circulation year-on-year since 2010, which is unusual as printed magazines across the board have seen their circulations fall as more people turn to online reading material.\n\nBeginnings\n\nIn 1764, an almanac called \"The Irish Merlin\" burst onto the scene. It was published by Theophilus Moore, known henceforth to generations of Irish people as “Old Moore.” But when it was first published, this almanac did not bear the compiler's name, but it was indeed the first \"Old Moore's Almanac\". There was a good reason why Theophilus did not put his name to the \"Irish Merlin\". At the time, the Catholic faith was actively being quashed, and Theophilus, a convinced Catholic, wanted to publish anonymously so he could be free to be completely Catholic in the \"Irish Merlin\", without attracting undue attention from authorities to his entrepreneurial efforts.\n\nJohn McCall (editor of \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" from 1874 to 1902) in his manuscript \"History of Irish Almanacks\" confirmed that \"The Irish Merlin\" was published by Theophilus Moore. He says it was known as one of 'Stewart's Merlins' because it was printed by A. Stewart, a well-known printer and editor of the time. \n\nAccording to McCall, Moore did indeed commence his almanac in 1764. \"“At the same time he removed to Dublin where he opened an academy in Charlemont St. and annually supplied the almanack. He was related to Thomas Moore, the poet, who attended his school for a considerable time before he entered college. Theophilus frequented the house of Thomas Moore's father in Aungier St.; they were kinsmen in name and race and consequently allied to each other by ties of close intimacy for many years. Moore's almanack had not the registry of his name till after the period of 1782 when Catholic disabilities were partially removed, when his name appeared in his almanacks. He died at the close of the eighteenth century.\"\" \n\nAnother account of his early life seems to match the one above. The alternative account gives his birth as 1730 in Offaly, the territory of the O'Moores. It has been asserted that he was a descendant of Rory Oge O'Moore, the ruins of whose castle may still be seen on the rock of Dunamase, three miles east of Port Laoise. The future astrologer spent his youth on the plains of Offaly. He had a great thirst for learning and acquired a deep knowledge in English, Irish, Latin and Greek. He also studied mathematics and astrology. When aged about 30 he went to Dublin, where for a time he led a precarious existence. Ultimately he settled on the Palmerston estate in Old Rathmines, between Milltown and \"The Bloody Fields.\" Here he opened an Academy and taught mathematics and classics as well as astronomy and astrology. He is said to have taught the young members of the Palmerston household, but his fidelity to the Catholic faith and refusal to conform to the Established Church lost him their patronage. Before entering Trinity College, Thomas Moore, the poet, attended the academy of Theophilus as a pupil, and it is said that master and pupil, namesakes and kinsmen, remained always firm friends. \n\nThese two separate accounts do match up. Both agree that Theophilus Moore commenced his almanack shortly after coming to Dublin (the almanack would later be spelled almanac). In its early issues the \"Merlin\" did not bear the compiler's name, but merely his nom-de-plume: \"Philomath.\" (Philomath means “tutor.”)\n\nAfter the \"Merlin\" had been published for about thirty years, \"Philomath\" became very well known for his prognostications. But many people wanted in on Theophilus’ growing fortune, and claimed to be \"Philomath,\" so in 1793, Theophilus Moore came out from the shelter of his \"nom-de-plume\", and claimed his success. From that point onwards, the almanac appeared bearing his name. The title was now \"The Irish Merlin, or Moore's Almanack, 1793, by Theophilus Moore, Philomath.\" Soon after, it simply became known as \"Moore's Almanack.\"\n\nFrom 1793 until his death, the almanac appeared with the compiler's name. It grew in popularity and fame. It was in the first decade of the nineteenth century that the famed astrologer died, or as the media reported, that he “was gathered to his fathers.” He was then nearly 80 years old.\n\nThe woodcut picture of Theophilus Moore used in the book for centuries was carved towards the end of his life, and it shows him bent over, with a walking stick. It seems to be an accurate portrait of Theophilus. Before photos were widely available, people described people's looks with “pen pictures.” A pen picture by the Revd. Patrick O'Byrne, of Ralston Street, described him well. \"In his early manhood his figure was tall, slight, elastic and graceful; towards the end of his life it naturally was inclined to be stooped. His face was long, narrow and handsome, and his fine head was covered to the last with long masses of soft and wavy hair. His eagle eyes were set deep beneath shaggy beetling eyebrows. His nose was long and aquiline; and the furrowed lines on his high and intellectual forehead proclaimed to the world the deep and anxious thought that ever occupied his great and active mind.\" \n\nThe editorship of the almanac is not clear for a considerable time after the death of Theophilus. However, the magazine continued to be published every year under the name \"Moore's Almanack\". And more copycat magazines appeared (“spurious editions” as they were called). The many copycat editions raised the irk of the real Old Moore's Almanac. In fact they editors of the time often wrote to newspapers complaining about it. \n\nHe is an article from the Weekly Telegraph in 1852, in the literature section:\n\n\"Moore's Almanack\" for the year of Our Lord 1853 \n\n\"We are calling attention to this work, the genuine Old Moore’s Irish Almanack, we feel bound especially to notice because we are aware that the attempt is made to the great injury of the author, and to the great injury of the Irish trade, as well as great injury to the honest fame and fair reputation of the country to call upon the public to either spurious imitations of the real work or to import amongst the people a contraband article called “Moore's Almanack” which is we believe written and printed in England. The attempt should be made by Englishman to despoil us of our Moore's Almanac cannot be a matter of surprise when we know that our neighbours on the other side of the channel have long been endeavouring to despoil us of our Wellington by constantly speaking and writing of the Duke as an Englishman, never as an Irishman. We now conceive it to be the duty of the Irish press to earnestly resist the one dishonest attempt as the other.\"\n\n\"We will not let the English have our Theophilus Moore no more than our Arthur Wellesley and we insist on proving that none but the real genuine Theophilus Moore, Philomath, abiding at Skerries could write such prophecies as to be found in The Almanac embellished with his portrait; as in the same manner it has been proved that none but the Irishman Wellington could have fought in the Battle of Waterloo and won it. The Verity of the Irish prophet is proved by his words as the valour of the Irish general was demonstrated by his deeds.\"\n\n\"Theophilus Moore, Philomath, the author of The Almanack before us, may be regarded as the only genuine living representative of the extraordinary class of beings who lived ages ago and combined together the power of foretelling future events with the gift of poesy and to whom the name “Vates” was applied in differently. In ancient times the “Vates” was the oracle of his neighbourhood and many such were to be found. But at present we believe there is but one “Vates” in all of Europe and that is our Theophilus Moore and most happy are we to perceive that our Theophilus Moore eschews all sorts of magic fortune telling and conjuring tricks of every kind and description whatsoever. Mr Theophilus Moore abjures alike heresy and idolatry. He is a genuine prophet, a poet and we feel confident, judging from his prophesies, that he is not only a pious Christian, but also a true-hearted Irishman.\"\n\n\"In order that the public may judge for themselves, and that the public may better distinguish between the real Theophilus Moore and the fictitious Theophilus Moore whoever they are concocted in England or Ireland, we shall place a few extracts from his prophecies before them.\"\n\nIn 1874, the editorship was given to John McCall. It was thought that just before this sometime, the word “\"Old\"” was added to the title, in honour of how long Theophilus actually lived, which was a remarkable achievement of the time. \n\nMcCall was editor from 1874 to 1902, when he died at the age of 81 years. McCall held this position for more than a quarter of a century; he actually edited it until a month before his death. McCall was quite well known at this time in Ireland for many accomplishments in publishing. And he was also known during his editorship to have advanced the almanac to a very considerable extent. McCall was known as “a man of wonderful knowledge and natural ability.” \n\nDuring John McCall's editorship he gathered around him a number of vivid personalities, who all contributed to the almanac. They linked together into a clan, and John McCall was regarded as Chieftain. They considered themselves as the successors of the Irish Bards, and wrote of themselves as \"The Bards of Di.\" This title is thought to be derived from the Goddess of the Moon, Diana; the connection of the bards with astrology makes the reference easily understood. \n\nOften in the pages of the \"Moore’s Almanack\" we see references to \"Lady Di\" and the contributors are also spoken of as \"Diarians\" – this latter term is, of course, derived from the word \"diary,\" and may be the explanation of the title of the followers of Di. But whatever be the reason of their title, the bards were very proud of it, and had developed close bonds of fellowship and friendship. \n\nThe later issues of \"Old Moore’s Almanack\" have many elegies penned for departed bards of this clan. On the death of John McCall, the bards became very vocal, and many elegies appeared for many years in praise of his work and in his memory. \n\nAfter McCall, the relatively famous Patrick Keary edited the \"Moore’s Almanack\" under the pen name “Kevin Kay” for two years. He was succeeded by Michael Fanning, and then by Seamus Bolger. \n\nIn 1940 the circulation was 200,000 copies, and even more than that were sold \"“in every part of the globe whither Irishmen have gone.The popularity of Old Moore's Almanack was well grounded, upon its usefulness and its interest. As regards the former, it supplied, in cheap and handy form, much information of everyday service to the farmer and rural worker, as well as to many town-dwellers.”\"\n\nEven beggars were said to have bought the \"Old Moore’s Almanack\", they gained the best begging takings at the fairs and marts that were listed faithfully in each edition. \n\nHistorian B. P. Bowen said in 1940, \"“It is not surprising that such a publication should have found favour among the people of the country, when newspapers were scarce, before modern progress had so changed means of communication. It has been said, with much truth, that the books in the average country cabin during the nineteenth century consisted of a prayer book, a chap-book [\"a small paperback booklet, typically containing poems or fiction\"] and an Old Moore's Almanack. This last provided much material of a puzzling nature to while away long winter evenings, and encouraged those of an ingenious turn to try their skill in solving the problems proposed. As prizes were given for solutions to the puzzles, and for new puzzles for next year, the connection between issues was maintained. Let it not be thought that the poems have been mere drivel—far from it; many show distinct merit, and sometimes herald the rise of a new poet. John Keegan Casey (\"Leo\" of the Nation) appeared in the pages of Old Moore as a youthful and aspiring poet. So did Charles Kickham, under the nom-de-plume of \"Cavellus.\" The late P. J. McCall made many contributions to Old Moore's Almanack in his early days. The pages of Old Moore were always open to the budding rhymester, and the better his work the more likely he was to have it published.”\" \n\nThe huge success of the \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" meant that more copycat versions sprang to life, all wanting a piece of the pie. In 1851 the enterprising John Francis Nugent, of 35 Cook Street, Dublin, started his own almanac, in opposition to \"Old Moore's Almanac\". It was called \"Nugent’s Old Moore’s Almanac.\" The original \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" was, at this point, fed up to the gills of other publishers stealing their thunder, and also their name. \n\nNugent acted as manager and editor of this rip-off version of the \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" until his death in 1866, and after that it was taken over by his assistant. But then something strange happened. In 1886, McCall, long-time editor of the genuine \"Old Moore’s Almanac\", became editor of \"Nugent's Moore's Almanac\" simultaneously. He carried on like this for 12 years. It would seem to be a conflict of interest: Nugent's Almanac was very similar to \"Old Moore’s Almanac\"; there were the usual prophecies and weather forecasts. In the end, Nugent's almanac was taken over by Nugent’s widow but in 1898 she re-married and allowed it to lapse. \n\nThere were other copycats. An edition in 1900 of \"Old Moore\" by W. A. Quirke of 25, Wicklow Street, was the subject of a legal action by the proprietor of the genuine \"Old Moore's Almanac\" at the time, P.C.D. Warren. Not only was this new copycat edition stealing its thunder, it wasn’t even producing original copy; it was stealing the exact copy from \"Old Moore’s Almanac\", and printing it under its own name. \n\nWarren obtained an injunction against Quirke restraining him from publishing any almanac containing a list of fairs taken from the plaintiff's publication. This stopped the sale of Quirke's almanac and he was debarred from selling any copies of the issue in question. \n\nThe \"Genuine Old Moore’s Almanac\" then tried to copyright the name “Moore’s Almanack.” The court refused to grant exclusive use of the words \"Old Moore\" or “Moore’s Almanack” to the plaintiff. This was due to the fact that many copycat almanacs were already published in England called “Old Moore's” and it would be too difficult to police. The ship had sailed. It is assumed that \"Old Moore's Almanack\" became \"Old Moore's Almanac\", to distinguish it from all of the other non-genuine competitors. The almanac without the “k” was forevermore the genuine one. \n\nThe perceived accuracy of the predictions gave \"Old Moore's Almanac\" its staying power. Theophilus Moore himself was said to have had a great skill in prophecy, and subsequent editors made sure that whoever did the predictions was good at it.\n\nThe editor and the prophet have not always been the same person, as is the case in the 2018 edition. Michael Fanning, a native of Brackenstown, Co. Dublin, was a regular contributor to almanacs, and did some of the predictions for \"Old Moore's Almanac\"; Bernard O'Neill, of Blackwatertown on the Moy near Armagh, was the prophet for some time previous to 1914-15. \n\nThere are famous examples of predictions coming true in the past which made readers talk endlessly. In 1903 it was foretold that \"a crown would fall from a kingly head\" – the chance was, no doubt, rather a wide one, but when, in June, 1903, the King and Queen of Sebia were assassinated, who could doubt the vision of the prophet? In that year also, Old Moore declared that \"the Eternal City would have cause to go into mourning,\" and the death of Pope Leo XIII in July, 1903 was the apparent fulfilment of that prophecy. \n\nThe \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" once foretold that the Derby would be run in a snowstorm; as this race takes place in June, the likelihood seemed remote, but it happened, and the \"Almanac\" received much kudos. After Old Moore's successful prediction of the victory of a horse called Blenheim in the Derby, many half-crowns were sent direct to the editor to be staked on the winner of the next big race. But he had to decline the responsibility and return the money. \n\nOld Moore was so popular at one time that the travelling pedlar or the man walking the roads had often cause to bless the \"Almanac\". It was seen as having the powers of \"open sesame\" to many a country cabin and often ensured a meal or a night's lodging for the wayfarer. One pedlar has said that he always set out with a bundle of the recently issued \"Almanacs\" under his arm, knowing that for many a day he could obtain his bed and board from those he visited, thanks to the welcome given to \"Old Moore\" in the countryside. \n\nIn 2018, the editor and the prophet are once again two different people. \n\nHistorical Copies\n\nHistorical copies of the \"Almanac\" are in the National Library of Ireland in Dublin. The books cannot be borrowed, but they can be perused in the reading rooms. \n\n-The title started its life as \"The Irish Merlin\" in 1764 \n\n-The title was changed to \"Moore's Almanack\" around 1782 \n\n-By 1853 it was called \"Old Moore’s Almanack\" \n\n-After around 1900 it was called \"Old Moore’s Almanac\"\n\nOccasionally, old copies of the Almanac are offered for sale on eBay or other auction sites. Recently, an \"Irish Merlin\" from 1765 was sold on eBay. You can also find copies in the Marsh Library in Dublin, and in Trinity's Old Library, which also holds the Book of Kells. \n\nHistorian B. P. Bowen B.L., B.Sc. He wrote an article about the \"Old Moore’s Almanac\" in 1940 for the \"Dublin Historical Record\" Vol. 3, No. 1 (Sep., - Nov., 1940), pp. 26-37. The \"Dublin Historical Record\" is a history journal established in 1938, published biannually by the Old Dublin Society, which still exists today. (olddublinsociety.ie) \n\nThe almanac includes predictions for Ireland and the world. The weather predictions always receive a lot of attention in Ireland, where the weather is a highly prized conversation subject. For example, the 2018 predictions include:\n\n-This is the year of the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies will change the world in a short span of time. Trade sanctions will be ignored as people move around them with e-money. Governments will scramble to try to regulate and tax it. Entrepreneurial spirit will use the cryptocurrencies to create and build whole new disruptive businesses. Western free-economy countries will thrive using it. \n\n-This year, there will be a lot of well-known people who will die suddenly/unexpectedly. 2018 will be the year of the shock-death of famous people. \n\n-In Ireland, there will be more discussions about getting religion out of school. Irish Millennials to move abroad in increasing numbers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1908669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1908669", "title": "Royal Frankish Annals", "text": "Royal Frankish Annals\n\nThe Royal Frankish Annals (Latin: \"Annales regni Francorum\"; also \"Annales Laurissenses maiores\" and German: \"Reichsannalen\") are Latin annals composed in Carolingian Francia, recording year-by-year the state of the monarchy from 741 (the death of Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel) to 829 (the beginning of the crisis of Louis the Pious). Their authorship is unknown, though Wilhelm von Giesebrecht suggested that Arno of Salzburg was the author of an early section of the \"Annaes Laurissenses majores\" surviving in the copy at Lorsch Abbey. The Annals are believed to have been composed in successive sections by different authors, and then compiled. \n\nThe depth of knowledge regarding court affairs suggests that the annals were written by persons close to the king, and their initial reluctance to comment on Frankish defeats betrays an official design for use as Carolingian propaganda. Though the information contained within is heavily influenced by authorial intent in favor of the Franks, the annals remain a crucial source on the political and military history of the reign of Charlemagne.\n\nCopies of the annals can be categorized into five classes, based on additions and revisions to the text. The chronicles were continued and incorporated in the West Frankish \"Annales Bertiniani\" and in the East Frankish \"Annales Fuldenses\" and \"Annales Xantenses.\"\n\nThe annals give a brief individual description of events for each year (a few omitted), with a focus on the actions of the Carolingian monarchy, beginning with the account of Pepin the Short’s ascension through the dethronement of the Merovingian king Childeric III. The annalists pay particular attention to the military campaigns of the Carolingian kings, justifying their actions in terms of a grand narrative of Carolingian peacekeeping and conquest in the name of expanding the Christian faith. The overthrow of the Merovingians is also portrayed in such a way as to legitimize the transfer of royal power between dynasties, emphasizing Carolingian adherence to Frankish traditions and the approval of Pope Zacharias in the matter.\n\nOf the three kings—Pepin, Charlemagne, and Louis—Charlemagne’s military chronicles are the most detailed, covering his victories against the Saxons, Bretons, and other peoples. The account of Charlemagne’s campaign against the Saxons is also notable as one of the few extant references to the Irminsul, an important if enigmatic part of the Germanic paganism practiced by the Saxons at the time. Its destruction is a major point in the annals, written to continue a jingoistic theme of Frankish triumphs against the “un-Frankish” and unchristian barbarian. The unrevised text neglects to mention defeats suffered by Charlemagne, such as the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778 (later dramatized in the \"Song of Roland\") and the Battle of Süntel in 782. \n\nThe Battle of Süntel is portrayed in the annals as a victory, as opposed to a crushing Frankish defeat at the hands of the Saxons. The 792 conspiracy of Pepin the Hunchback against Charlemagne is also omitted, along with any reference to potential misconduct on Charlemagne’s part. The revised text, however, incorporates these events while maintaining a positive tone towards the emperor, presented as a peerless leader in battle.\nCharlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, is rarely shown engaging in battle by the annalists, but rather directs others to do so, or negotiates for peace. The contrast between Louis and his father and grandfather is clear. While the past kings were unshakeable figures, depicted as the better of their foes even in defeat by the revised edition, the annalists’ Louis is a smaller man who invests the power of the military in others, not unlike the annals’ earlier depiction of the Merovingian kings. Miracles aid Charlemagne and his men, and the grace of God leads him to victory; mostly ill portents surround Louis, such as an omen in the stars supposedly foretelling his army’s defeat at the hands of Count Aizo, and the sudden collapse of a wooden arcade atop him in 817.\n\nSuch references to striking natural phenomena, strange happenings, and miracles become increasingly common in the annal entries for the 9th century. In addition to astronomical oddities, such as eclipses, the supernatural begins to enter the account, set against almost ritualistic yearly notices of the regular passages of Christmas and Easter. Nearly two-dozen villages are reported to have been destroyed by heavenly fire in 823, while at the same time an unnamed girl is said to have begun a three-year fast.\n\nScholz regards this preoccupation as a reflection of a belief in a divine will and control of history. Many of the worse omens also parallel growing dissatisfaction with Louis the Pious, which immediately after the end of the annals spilled into civil war between him and his sons. Divine intervention through the relics of saints play an important role as well, with mention of Hilduin’s translation of the relics of St. Sebastian to the Abbey of St. Medard, and Einhard’s transport of the relics of SS. Marcellinus and Peter into Francia.\n\nA more detailed account of Einhard’s procurement of the relics exists in his \"Translation and Miracles of Marcellinus and Peter\".\nAdditionally, the annals provide the only attestation to the existence of Charlemagne’s personal elephant Abul-Abbas, aside from a mention by Einhard drawn from the annals. The gift of the elephant to Charlemagne, amongst other treasures, by Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid is evidence of the attempts to form an Abbasid-Carolingian alliance at the time, which the annals document loosely.\n\nThe annals survive in multiple versions, widely distributed across the Frankish empire, though none of these are original copies. Each version is marked with distinguishing features, and based on these features, Friedrich Kurze formulated five classes for the categorization of these texts. This system still remains in use. The five classes of texts are lettered A through D, with an additional E class for the revised text. They are as follow:\n\nClass A texts end at the year 788, and are reflected in one of the earliest modern printings of the annals, that of Heinrich Canisius’s \"Francicorum Annalium fragmentum\". Canisius also includes the years up to 793 in his printing, however, and Rosamond McKitterick speculates that the manuscript originally ran to that date. These manuscripts are now lost.\n\nClass B texts go to, at the latest, 813. Kurze notes that one of these was used by Regino of Prüm in his \"Chronicon\".\n\nClass C texts are complete through 829. These contain various additions not found in the previous two classes, and Kurze divides them based on what other texts are found in their codices, such as the \"Liber historiae Francorum\".\n\nClass D texts are derived from a complete copy, though McKitterick points out that the derivatives are often not complete themselves. These also contain insertions not found in the other classes, including mention of Pepin the Hunchback. The revised texts are based on a Class D manuscript.\n\nClass E comprises the revised editions of the annals, and are by far the most numerous. These are often found paired with Einhard’s \"Vita Karoli Magni\", and it is partially from this that they are sometimes believed to have been written by him as well, and thus called the \"Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi\" (English: \"Annals which are said to be of Einhard\"). The revised editions correct the Latin of the originals and elaborate on many of the earlier entries, which were written by a terse hand in their unedited states. The major edits go up to 801, with minor stylistic changes through 812.\n\nThough the number of sections into which the annals should be divided is debated, they undoubtably were written in at least four stages, corresponding roughly to the entries for 741-795, 796-807, 808-819, and 820-829. Additionally, an unknown editor produced the revised text at some point during the third stage. The identities of any of the authors save that of the fourth section are unknown, but production by a group of clerics associated with the Carolingian court is likely.\n\nBetween the years 741 and 768, the annals overlap with the continuations of the \"Chronicle of Fredegar\". On account of this, scholars such as Scholz have suggested that the annals are based on the continuation of \"Fredegar\" up to 768, and then on minor annals up to some point between 787 and 793. McKitterick, however, contends that the continuation of \"Fredegar\" and the minor annals are more likely based upon the \"Annales regni Francorum\", which is the most ordered and precise of them. Neither argument considers these entries to be contemporaneous with the events described. The manner of reporting for these years is typically terse, though they include the convention of mentioning Easter and Christmas, which continues throughout the annals.\n\nThe author of this section is unknown. Scholz posits the work of multiple authors in the royal chapel. The year 795 is not definitive as the date of authorial change, but it is the latest of those suggested.\n\nUnlike the first section, these entries were written contemporaneously and with greater depth. Considering this and the fact that the subject matter remains fixed on the actions of Charlemagne, composition by members of the royal chapel again seems likely, as few other groups would have had access to the same information. However, the identities of these authors remains unknown.\n\nThis section, as well as the fourth, are also both contemporaneous accounts. Scholz notes an increased eloquence in the language employed from here on. At this time, the editor of the revised edition also began his work on the earlier entries, bringing the Latin up to a similar level as the new entries and adding lengthy passages where detail was lacking, again in the style of the later years. For this reason, the editor is believed to have belonged to or been affiliated with this third group of authors.\n\nThis section ends abruptly after the events of 829, and for this reason has been associated with Hilduin of St. Denis. The case for his authorship is founded on Hilduin’s involvement in the first civil war between Louis and his sons in 830. In that year, he left the emperor’s service to join the sons’ uprising and was subsequently banished, which would account for the termination of the annals. His increasing distaste for Louis would also correspond with the veiled negativity towards the emperor which surfaces in the later entries of the annal, in the form of faint praise and the recording of omens and disasters. Additionally, the entry for 826 mentions Hilduin’s translation of relics, and is followed in 827 by Einhard’s translation. The inclusion of these somewhat obscure events, both of which Hilduin was involved with, would be explained by his authorship of the section.\n\nThe revised text is believed to have been edited after Charlemagne’s death in 814 but prior to Einhard’s \"Vita Karoli Magni\", which references the revisions, written in 833 at the latest. It covers the years 741 through 812, variously adding detail and modifying style. Leopold von Ranke put forth Einhard as the editor, an association which has carried with the revised annals in references to the \"Annales qui dicuntur Einhardi\". However, while no other names have been suggested for the editor, the case for Einhard cannot be argued definitively either.\n\nThree major annals take up the work of the Annales regni Francorum after 829: the \"Annales Bertiniani\", the \"Annales Fuldenses\", and the \"Annales Xantenses\". The \"Annales Bertiniani\" concern the West Frankish Kingdom from 830 to 882, serving as a direct unofficial continuation. The \"Annales Fuldenses\" use the \"Annales regni Francorum\" as a basis up to the year 829, and then continue on their own until 901, documenting the East Frankish Kingdom. The \"Annales Xantenses\" run from 832 to 873 and are largely independent from the other two continuations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is almost flawless and is unusual in that it has stars on both sides of the stone. The greyish blue gem was mined in Sri Lanka and is housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\n\nThe milky quality of the stone is caused by the traces of the mineral rutile, which is also responsible for the star effect, known as asterism. The tiny fibers of the mineral, aligned in a three-fold pattern within the gem, reflect incoming light into the star pattern.\n\nMineralogist and Tiffany gem expert George Kunz (1856–1932) was commissioned by wealthy financier J.P. Morgan (1837–1913) to acquire an impressive gem collection for an exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900; the Star of India was among the stones Kunz procured. After the Exposition, Morgan donated the Star of India along with the rest of the collection to the American Museum of Natural History. Apart from its Sri Lankan origin, the gem's history prior to its acquisition for this collection is unknown. Kunz wrote in 1913 that the Star of India \"has a more or less indefinite historic record of some three centuries\".\n\nOn October 29, 1964, the famous golf-ball-sized stone was stolen, along with several other gems of note, including the Midnight Star, the DeLong Star Ruby, and the Eagle Diamond. The thieves unlocked a bathroom window during museum open hours, climbed in that night, and found that the sapphire was the only gem in the collection protected by an alarm—and the battery for that was dead. The stones stolen were valued at more than $400,000. Within two days the culprits were arrested: Jack Murphy (also known as \"Murph the Surf\"), Allen Kuhn and Roger Clark; however, the gems had already been handed off. In January 1965, in a bid for leniency, Kuhn led authorities to a bus locker in Miami where the uninsured Star of India and some of the other stolen stones were recovered.\n"}

The Blacksmith Shop, a one-room brick structure built about 1800, and its later frame addition, originally stood near the railroad tracks in the village of Shelburne, Vermont.\n\nWhile little is known of its early occupancy, records show that John Dubuc had established a blacksmith shop there by 1869. Following Dubuc, a succession of craftspeople occupied the building until it was abandoned in 1935. \n\nShelburne Museum acquired the Blacksmith Shop in 1955 and moved it to its present location on the Museum grounds. In preparation for the move the building was fitted with a footing of reinforced concrete, braced internally, and jacked up before being rolled onto the bed of a twenty-four-ton trailer, which transported it twenty-four hundred feet down Route 7. The Blacksmith Shop opened in 1956 as the Museum’s first working exhibit having been re-outfitted with blacksmith and wheelwright tools acquired from a variety of local sources. \n\nCommunities of the 18th and 19th centuries depended heavily on village blacksmiths as their primary source for tools, utensils, agricultural implements, architectural hardware, vehicle parts, and many other items. Many blacksmiths also served as farriers, not only manufacturing shoes for horses and oxen, but outfitting the animals as well. \n\nIn larger communities blacksmiths often worked in conjunction with wheelwrights to manufacture and repair vehicle wheels. Although combination blacksmith-wheelwright shops persisted into the 20th century, their focus gradually changed from the manufacture of one-of-a-kind items to the repair of factory-produced goods. Eventually the availability of mass-produced parts as well as the advent of the automobile age rendered both blacksmiths and wheelwrights obsolete. \n\nShelburne Museum’s Blacksmith Shop represents the trade as it was practiced at the turn of the 20th century. Both the efficient, electric blower, which replaced the wood and leather bellows still resting by the forge, and the electric trip-hammer enabled smiths, who at that time often found themselves working alone as the apprentice system broke down, to handle larger work without assistance. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1873508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873508", "title": "The Fabulous Freebirds", "text": "The Fabulous Freebirds\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds were a professional wrestling tag team that attained fame in the 1980s, performing into the 1990s. The team usually consisted of three wrestlers, although in different situations and points in its history, just two performed under the Freebirds name.\n\nThe Fabulous Freebirds started performing together in 1979 when Mid South Wrestling promoter Bill Watts put together the duo of Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes and Terry \"Bam Bam\" Gordy. Though originally meant to be a tag team, he soon added Buddy \"Jack\" Roberts into the mix, and they became a \"three man gang\" type of tag-team—an unusual concept at the time. They invented a concept that is now called The Freebird Rule in their honor, in which any two of three members can defend the team's championships. They usually worked as heels but also had several face runs as well.\nAfter wrestling for Watts in Mid South, they worked for Memphis based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they feuded with Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee .\nThe group next wrestled in the Dallas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) territory, where they had a legendary feud with the Von Erichs (David, Kevin, Kerry, Chris and Mike). This feud was ignited by an infamous incident in which Terry Gordy slammed Kerry Von Erich's head in a steel cage door inciting a riot and igniting the legendary wrestling feud. During this feud, they started using the Confederate battle flag as a group symbol as the Von Erichs would wave the flag of Texas so they chose to use the flag of Georgia, which at the time contained the Confederate battle flag, to counter it.\n\nThey also performed in the NWA-affiliated Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). While in the AWA they feuded primarily with The Road Warriors, costing them the World Tag Team Titles in a match against long time Freebird ally Jimmy Garvin and his partner Steve Regal.\n\nThey had a very brief run in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1984, where they were a part of the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection period. In the WWF, they wrestled under the guidance of Cyndi Lauper's manager David Wolff, but soon left the promotion after an altercation with André the Giant, who was upset when the Freebirds arrived late to a show.\n\nThe group then moved on to their AWA run, returned to World Class, and then started a stint in the UWF where Gordy became the promotion's champion, Roberts held its TV title, and Hayes usually acted as their manager or served as a heel commentator on television broadcasts. After JCP purchased UWF in 1987, Hayes wrestled in World Class and several independent promotions, sometimes with Gordy, who began spending most of his time in Japan, and Roberts began to wind down his career.\n\nHayes and Garvin were paired as the Freebirds in WCW in 1989, enjoying several reigns as World and United States tag-team champions, and were joined by Gordy for a while as well. They later employed the services of masked third partner Brad Armstrong (under the name Badstreet) and manager Little Richard Marley. The Freebirds were last together when Hayes, Gordy, and Garvin worked for the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in 1994, ending the group after 15 years.\n\nGordy died of a heart attack, caused by a blood clot on July 16, 2001, at age 40 while Roberts died on November 29, 2012, at the age of 67, of pneumonia and on November 1, 2012, Armstrong died of a suspected heart attack making Hayes and Garvin the only living members of the Freebirds. Hayes (who retired from in-ring competition shortly after the Freebirds disbanded) is currently the head of the road agents/producers within WWE, while Garvin retired from wrestling shortly after disbanding and has become an Airline Transport Pilot.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, The Fabulous Freebirds (excluding Brad Armstrong) were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by The New Day.\n\nThe Freebirds concept was heavily derived from the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Free Bird\" and the image of \"Southern pride\" evoked by the band. For most of the team's early existence, the song was used as their entrance music, in both television and live appearances. On occasion, they would also enter the ring to Willie Nelson's rendition of \"Georgia on My Mind\". The Freebirds are sometimes credited as the first wrestlers to use entrance music for their ring introductions, although Gorgeous George's use of \"Pomp and Circumstance\" predates the Freebirds.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s, a number of North American wrestling promotions who licensed copyrighted music faced difficulties in continuing those licenses. Other promotions which did not license music were under scrutiny for the practice. Promotions began looking for solutions. The WWF, which hired Jimmy Hart and Jim Johnston in 1985, used their talents to write and produce music under which the copyrights could be controlled by the company. Around this same time, Hayes recorded the song \"Badstreet USA\" and released a music video, which included the other Freebird members. This song would largely be used as the entrance music for the Freebirds from that point forward, though they would use the other songs on occasion.\n\nDuring the Freebirds' career in the NWA, they won several of its regional tag team championships. While holding the title, promoters added a sub-gimmick to the team – \"The Freebird Rule\" – which allowed any two of the three members of the team to defend the title on any given night.\n\nThis rule has been re-used by a number of other companies when a three (or more) man team captures a tag team championship. Examples include:\n\nIn some cases, the Freebird rule has been applied to singles titles, most notably when Chyna and Chris Jericho co-held the WWF Intercontinental Championship in 2000. Other such cases included when 3 Count won the WCW Hardcore Championship in 2000, and when Matt Bentley and Frankie Kazarian co-held the TNA X Division Championship in 2004. In 2010, after Layla won the WWE Women's Championship, Team LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool) co-held the title. This was a slight variation to the Freebird rule, as while both women defended the title, only Layla was recognized as the official champion. Later that year, the same rule was instituted when Michelle McCool won the WWE Divas Championship; both members of Team LayCool defended the title, but only McCool was recognized as official champion. A similar situation happened in Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2017, where Bullet Club invoked \"Bullet Club Rules\", which allowed Cody, Kenny Omega and Marty Scurll to defend the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. However, only the title's original winners, Adam Page, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson, were recognized as official champions.\n\nThe Blackbirds were formed in 1988 in World Class Championship Wrestling by Iceman Parsons. He had just teamed with Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts as the \"Blackbirds\" in their feud with Michael Hayes. He teamed up with Perry \"Action\" Jackson and Harold T. Harris to form the Blackbirds. They also wrestled as the Blackbirds in the Global Wrestling Federation in 1992.\n\nThe Extreme Freebirds were formed in NWA Wildside and the NAWA by the son of Terry Gordy, Ray Gordy. He teamed up with Tank and Iceberg in 2004 to form this group.\n\nThe original three Freebirds briefly appear in a match against Greg Gagne, The Tonga Kid, and Jim Brunzell during the opening sequence of the 1986 fantasy film \"Highlander\", which occurs at a show in Madison Square Garden (although the scene was actually filmed at the Brendan Byrne Arena across the river).\n\n\nChampionship (1 time) – Hayes\n\n"}

{"id": "8934260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8934260", "title": "VirtualBox", "text": "VirtualBox\n\nOracle VM VirtualBox (formerly Sun VirtualBox, Sun xVM VirtualBox and Innotek VirtualBox) is a free and open-source hosted hypervisor for x86 computers currently being developed by Oracle Corporation. Developed initially by Innotek GmbH, it was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008 which was in turn acquired by Oracle in 2010.\n\nVirtualBox may be installed on a number of host operating systems, including: Linux, macOS, Windows, Solaris, and OpenSolaris. There are also ports to FreeBSD and Genode.\n\nIt supports the creation and management of guest virtual machines running versions and derivations of Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, Solaris, Haiku, OSx86 and others, and limited virtualization of guests on Apple hardware.\n\nFor some guest operating systems, a \"Guest Additions\" package of device drivers and system applications is available which typically improves performance, especially that of graphics.\n\nVirtualBox was initially offered by Innotek GmbH from Weinstadt, Germany, under a proprietary software license, making one version of the product available at no cost for personal or evaluation use, subject to the VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL). In January 2007, based on counsel by LiSoG, Innotek GmbH released VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) as free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2.\n\nInnotek GmbH also contributed to the development of OS/2 and Linux support in virtualization and OS/2 ports of products from Connectix which were later acquired by Microsoft. Specifically, Innotek developed the \"additions\" code in both Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server, which enables various host-guest OS interactions like shared clipboards or dynamic viewport resizing.\n\nSun Microsystems acquired Innotek in February 2008.\n\nOracle Corporation acquired Sun in January 2010 and re-branded the product as \"Oracle VM VirtualBox\".\n\nThe core package is, since version 4 in December 2010, free software under GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). The separate \"VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox extension pack\" providing support for USB 2.0 and 3.0 devices, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), disk encryption, NVMe and Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot is under a proprietary license, called \"Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL)\", which permits use of the software for personal use, educational use, or evaluation, free of charge. Oracle defines personal use as the installation of the software on a single host computer for non-commercial purposes.\n\nPrior to version 4, there were two different packages of the VirtualBox software. The full package was offered free under the PUEL, with licenses for other commercial deployment purchasable from Oracle. A second package called the \"VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE)\" was released under GPLv2. This removed the same proprietary components not available under GPLv2.\n\nBuilding the BIOS for VirtualBox requires the use of the Open Watcom compiler, for which the Sybase Open Watcom Public License is approved as \"Open Source\" by the Open Source Initiative but not as \"free\" by the Free Software Foundation or under the Debian Free Software Guidelines.\n\nAlthough VirtualBox has experimental support for Mac OS X guests, the end user license agreement of does not permit the operating system to run on non-Apple hardware, and this is enforced within the operating system by calls to the Apple System Management Controller (SMC) in all Apple machines, which verifies the authenticity of the hardware.\n\nUsers of VirtualBox can load multiple guest OSs under a single host operating-system (host OS). Each guest can be started, paused and stopped independently within its own virtual machine (VM). The user can independently configure each VM and run it under a choice of software-based virtualization or hardware assisted virtualization if the underlying host hardware supports this. The host OS and guest OSs and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility. Guest VMs can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so.\n\nIn the absence of hardware-assisted virtualization, VirtualBox adopts a standard software-based virtualization approach. This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel ring architecture.\n\n\nIn both cases, VirtualBox uses CSAM and PATM to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs. VirtualBox also contains a dynamic recompiler, based on QEMU to recompile any real mode or protected mode code entirely (e.g. BIOS code, a DOS guest, or any operating system startup).\n\nUsing these techniques, VirtualBox can achieve a performance comparable to that of VMware.\n\nVirtualBox supports both Intel's VT-x and AMD's AMD-V hardware-virtualization. Making use of these facilities, VirtualBox can run each guest VM in its own separate address-space; the guest OS ring 0 code runs on the host at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode rather than in ring 1.\n\nVirtualBox supports some guests (including 64-bit guests, SMP guests and certain proprietary OSs) only on hosts with hardware-assisted virtualization.\n\nThe system emulates hard disks in one of three disk image formats:\n\nA VirtualBox virtual machine can, therefore, use disks previously created in VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC, as well as its own native format. VirtualBox can also connect to iSCSI targets and to raw partitions on the host, using either as virtual hard disks. VirtualBox emulates IDE (PIIX4 and ICH6 controllers), SCSI, SATA (ICH8M controller) and SAS controllers to which hard drives can be attached.\n\nVirtualBox has supported Open Virtualization Format (OVF) since version 2.2.0 (April 2009).\n\nBoth ISO images and host-connected physical devices can be mounted as CD/DVD drives. For example, the DVD image of a Linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by VirtualBox.\n\nBy default VirtualBox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics-card that is VESA compatible. The Guest Additions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, or OS/2 guests include a special video-driver that increases video performance and includes additional features, such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the VM window\nor desktop composition via virtualized WDDM drivers .\n\nFor an Ethernet network adapter, VirtualBox virtualizes these Network Interface Cards:\n\nThe emulated network cards allow most guest OSs to run without the need to find and install drivers for networking hardware as they are shipped as part of the guest OS. A special paravirtualized network adapter is also available, which improves network performance by eliminating the need to match a specific hardware interface, but requires special driver support in the guest. (Many distributions of Linux ship with this driver included.) By default, VirtualBox uses NAT through which Internet software for end-users such as Firefox or ssh can operate. Bridged networking via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured. Up to 36 network adapters can be attached simultaneously, but only four are configurable through the graphical interface.\n\nFor a sound card, VirtualBox virtualizes Intel HD Audio, Intel ICH AC'97 and SoundBlaster 16 devices.\n\nA USB 1.1 controller is emulated so that any USB devices attached to the host can be seen in the guest. The proprietary extension pack adds a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 controllers and, if VirtualBox acts as an RDP server, it can also use USB devices on the remote RDP client as if they were connected to the host, although only if the client supports this VirtualBox-specific extension (Oracle provides clients for Solaris, Linux and Sun Ray thin clients that can do this, and have promised support for other platforms in future versions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome features require the installation of the closed-source \"VirtualBox Extension Pack\":\n\n\nWhile Guest Additions are installed within each suitable guest virtual machine, the Extension Pack is installed on the host running VirtualBox.\n\nSince version 5 (July 2015), VirtualBox has stated that they are dropping support for Windows XP host, thus leaving its users with Windows XP hosts vulnerable to flaws of earlier releases. VirtualBox can also be run under GNU/Linux, macOS, Sun Solaris and FreeBSD.\n\n\n"}
