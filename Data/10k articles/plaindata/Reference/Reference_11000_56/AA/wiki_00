Founded in 1917, its collection is one of the finest of any college or university museum in the United States, consistently ranking among those of Harvard and Yale. The collection contains over 14,000 works of art.\n\nThe AMAM is primarily a teaching museum, and it is a vital cultural resource for the students, faculty, and staff of Oberlin College as well as the surrounding community. Notable strengths include seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish art, nineteenth and early twentieth-century European and contemporary American art, and Asian, European, and American works on paper. The collection is housed in an impressive Italian Renaissance-style building designed by Cass Gilbert and named after its founder, Dr. Dudley Peter Allen (B.A., 1875), a distinguished graduate and trustee of Oberlin College.\n\nThe AMAM is also known for its art rental program which enables Oberlin College students to rent works of art by notable artists such as Renoir, Picasso, and Dalí for five dollars a semester.\n\nIn 1977, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown designed an addition that represents one of the earliest and finest examples of postmodern architecture in the United States. In 2011, the historic museum underwent a two-year retrofit; after which it was awarded with USGBC LEED Gold certification.\n\nThe Allen Memorial Art Museum has an outstanding collection of more than 12,000 objects – including paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, prints, drawings and photographs – that provide a comprehensive overview of the history of art from a variety of cultures. The collection is particularly strong in European and American paintings and sculpture from the 15th century to today, and has important holdings of Asian paintings, scrolls, sculpture and decorative art, including a large group of Ukiyo-e prints. High-quality ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, African and Pre-Columbian art is represented. The museum also houses the Eva Hesse archives, which includes the artist’s notebooks, diaries, photographs and letters, and is proud to oversee, along with the Art Department, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Weltzheimer/Johnson House.\n\nAt the beginning of every semester students camp out in front of the north gate of the museum to get first pick of original etchings, lithographs and paintings by artists including Renoir, Warhol, Dalí, and Picasso. For five dollars per semester, students can hang these works on their dorm room walls. The program was started in the 1940s by Ellen H. Johnson, a professor of art at Oberlin, in order to \"develop the aesthetic sensibilities of students and encourage ordered thinking and discrimination in other areas of their lives.\"\n\n"}

It is updated with operational and deployment guidance in . Application specific usage of DANE is defined in for SMTP and for using DANE with Service (SRV) records.\n\nTLS/SSL encryption is currently based on certificates issued by certificate authorities (CAs). Within the last few years, a number of CA providers suffered serious security breaches, allowing the issuance of certificates for well-known domains to those who don't own those domains. Trusting a large number of CAs might be a problem because any breached CA could issue a certificate for any domain name. DANE enables the administrator of a domain name to certify the keys used in that domain's TLS clients or servers by storing them in the Domain Name System (DNS). DANE needs the DNS records to be signed with DNSSEC for its security model to work.\n\nAdditionally DANE allows a domain owner to specify which CA is allowed to issue certificates for a particular resource, which solves the problem of any CA being able to issue certificates for any domain.\n\nDANE solves similar problems as:\n\n\nHowever, unlike DANE, those technologies have wide support from browsers.\n\nUntil recently, there has been no widely implemented standard for encrypted email transfer. Sending an email is security agnostic; there is no URI scheme to designate secure SMTP. Consequently, most email that is delivered over TLS uses only opportunistic encryption. Since DNSSEC provides authenticated denial of existence (allows a resolver to validate that a certain domain name does not exist), DANE enables an incremental transition to verified, encrypted SMTP without any other external mechanisms, as described by . A DANE record indicates that the sender must use TLS.\n\nAdditionally, a draft exists for applying DANE to S/MIME, and standardises bindings for OpenPGP.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TLSA RR (Resource Record) for a service is located at a DNS name that specifies certificate constraints should be applied for the services at a certain TCP or UDP port. At least one of the TLSA RRs must provide a validation (path) for the certificate offered by the service at the specified address.\n\nNot all protocols handle Common Name matching the same way. HTTP requires that the Common Name in the X.509 certificate provided by the service matches regardless of the TLSA asserting its validity. SMTP does not require the Common Name matches, if the certificate usage value is 3 (DANE-EE), but otherwise does require a Common Name match. It is important to verify if there are specific instructions for the protocol being used.\n\nThe RR itself has 4 fields of data, describing which level of validation the domain owner provides.\n\n\nE.g. codice_1\n\nThe first field after the TLSA text in the DNS RR, specifies how to verify the certificate.\n\n\nWhen connecting to the service and a certificate is received, the selector field specifies which parts of it should be checked.\n\n\nThe actual data to be matched given the settings of the other fields. This is a long \"text string\" of BASE64 data.\n\nThe HTTPS certificate for \"www.ietf.org\" specifies to check the SHA-256 hash of the public key of the certificate provided, ignoring any CA.\n\nTheir mail service has the same exact certificate and TLSA.\n\nFinally, the following example, does the same as the others, but does the hash calculation over the entire certificate.\n\n\n\n"}

As the first man to bill himself as \"The Man of 1,000 Holds\" (a nickname used many times since), Caddock was one of professional wrestling's biggest stars between the years of 1915 and 1922.\n\nEarl Caddock was born February 27, 1888 in Huron, South Dakota to parents of German Jewish heritage. His family name may have been \"Caddach,\" \"Craddock,\" or \"Caddack,\" but he used the spelling \"Caddock\" exclusively throughout his wrestling career.\n\nAs a child, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and the family moved to Chicago where he could be treated. Swimming was recommended as part of this treatment and he was given a membership in the local YMCA to facilitate this. During his time at the YMCA young Earl Caddock was exposed to wrestling. After his father was killed in a bizarre accident in which he fell down a manhole, Earl Caddock moved to his uncle's farm in Anita, Iowa. He continued to wrestle and won many local championships.\n\nIn 1907 Earl Caddock returned to Chicago to enter college. There he received further training from Benny Reubin and joined the Chicago Athletic Association. It was around this time that he met Charlie Cutler and Ernest Kartje, two professional wrestlers. From 1914 to 1915, Earl Caddock won the AAU Lightheavyweight Championship twice, and the AAU Heavyweight Championship once.\n\nThrough Cutler and Kartje, Caddock was introduced to Frank Gotch and Martin 'Farmer' Burns who began to train him for Professional wrestling. On June 8, 1915 Earl Caddock made his professional debut in a match against Jesse Westergaard. His popularity grew and on April 19, 1917 he defeated Joe Stecher for the World Heavyweight Championship in Omaha, Nebraska. \n\nIn December 1917 a tournament was held with the winner to be declared World Heavyweight Champion. Caddock walked out of this tournament over promoter Jack Curley's refusal to bill him as World Heavyweight Champion. Wladek Zbyszko won the tournament and was declared the new World Heavyweight Champion. The appetite for a match between Caddock and Zbyszko was fierce and on February 8, 1918 it happened. The result was predictable with Caddock once again becoming World Heavyweight Champion. In August of that year his wrestling career was temporarily put on hold for his service in the First World War.\n\nCaddock was discharged from the Army on June 1, 1919 and he returned to his career in wrestling. The World Heavyweight Championship had changed hands a few times while he was at war and was once again held by Joe Stecher. A match between the two was immediately set. On January 30, 1920 fans packed Madison Square Garden to see Stecher defeat Caddock. This match was filmed by pioneer cinematographer Freeman Harrison Owens, and is currently the oldest surviving filming of a professional wrestling match. \n\nCaddock's career continued successfully for the next few years but he wouldn't be in another World Title match until 1921. In January of that year Caddock faced Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis for the championship. Caddock's loss to Lewis in this match resulted in a near riot. Another title match in November against Stanislaus Zbyszko resulted in another failure to recapture the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nEarl Caddock's final match took place on June 7, 1922. He lost his last bid to regain the World Heavyweight Title to Ed Lewis.\n\nAfter he retired from wrestling Earl Caddock would continue to run his own business which he started while still wrestling. He ran a Ford agency selling cars, tractors and heavy machinery to farmers in Walnut, Iowa. He would also go on to become President of the United Petroleum Corporation. Earl Caddock died in 1950 after major surgery for a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The only remaining intact example of a Tyne-built paddle tug, and one of only two surviving British-built paddle tugs (the other being the former Tees Conservancy Commissioners' vessel, ), she is preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park in San Francisco, California.\n\n\"Eppleton Hall\" was built in 1914 by Hepple and Company of South Shields, for the Lambton and Hetton Collieries Ltd, and named after the house near Penshaw owned by the Hetton Coal Company. She was designed to tow seagoing colliers from sea to wharf side and back, primarily in the River Wear and to and from the River Tyne. For sailing ships this saved time, while for larger steam and motor vessels it saved navigation and pilotage costs. She was also used to tow newly built ships out to the North Sea.\n\nShe is one of two survivors of a once-numerous type of steam powered paddle tug that began with the 1814 \"Tyne Steam Boat\", later named \"Perseverance\". One of the last of her type built, \"Eppleton Hall\" was equipped with twin surface condensing side-lever engines of the \"grasshopper\" or \"half-lever\" type, totalling , also built by Hepple & Company. Her speed was , and her engines could function independently of each other to aid manoeuvrability, enabling her to turn inside her own length.\n\nThe tug was operated from 1914 by the Lambton & Hetton Collieries Ltd which, merged with the Joicey Collieries in 1924 to form the Lambton, Hetton & Joicey Collieries Ltd. In November 1945, a little before the collieries themselves were nationalised and vested in the National Coal Board, the towage business was sold to France, Fenwick Tyne and Wear Ltd which, after refurbishment, operated her at Sunderland on the River Wear until 1964. In 1952, the tug was modified slightly to obtain a passenger certificate, so that she could transport officials from newly built ships after they had completed their sea trials.\n\nIn November 1964 France, Fenwick Tyne & Wear disposed of their last paddle tugs, \"Houghton\" (built in 1904, also by Hepple, for the Lambton Collieries, and which was scrapped) and \"Eppleton Hall\". The latter was sold to the Seaham Harbour Dock Company, where she worked alongside \"Reliant\".\n\nSold to shipbreakers Clayton and Davie Ltd for scrap in 1967, she was left sitting on a mud bank in Dunston. As part of the scrapping process her wooden afterdeck and interior were destroyed by fire prior to being broken up. The tug remained there for two years, deck frames warped, wood burned or rotted, hull part flooded and engines rusty but intact.\n\nNews of the sale of the last steam paddle tug still in service anywhere in the world, the \"Reliant\", reached Karl Kortum, then director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum. Kortum informed museum trustee Scott Newhall, who proceeded to Newcastle to purchase the ship.\n\nThe plan met with opposition, as the British National Maritime Museum had prior claim to the 1907 built \"Reliant\", as they planned to scrap the hull and preserve one or both of the Side Lever ( or Grasshopper ) engines and perhaps a paddle wheel. It was suggested that a deal could be done, if the SMM were to buy the Eppleton Hall and pay for the cost of fitting out the display for the NMM in exchange for the operable \"Reliant\".\n\nDespite the fact that \"Eppleton Hall\" was already in a partially scrapped condition and would have been equally suitable to provide either or both of her two engines, attempts to negotiate with the then NMM Curators Mr. Basil Greenhill and the Viscount Runciman of Doxford collapsed following six months of deliberations on the part of the NMM. The final communication between the two museums was described by Newhall in his book as being \"fatuous, uncooperative or downright insulting\", as it seemed to suggest that adapting the identical non-running engines from the scrap tug for display in Greenwich would require \"massive re-planning\", that \"Reliant\" could not possibly steam intact from Newcastle to San Francisco, and, by implication, that the San Francisco Maritime Museum could not afford to pay for either venture.\n\nNewhall then attempted to acquire \"Reliant\" by subterfuge, leading a team to Seaham to collect the tug pretending to be representatives of the NMM. This attempt apparently failed when the police were called.\n\nThe day after this Newhall acquired the remains of the derelict \"Eppleton Hall\" from Mr. HW Clayton of Clayton and Davey with the intention of restoring her for return to San Francisco.\n\nRebuilt at Bill Quay, near Hebburn on the river Tyne, during 1969, the tug was modified to enable her to cross the Atlantic Ocean under her own steam, requiring the fitting of modern navigational aids, radio, an enclosed wheelhouse and conversion from coal to diesel oil firing. Thus \"Eppleton Hall\" was made to serve as Kortum's \"private yacht\" and was re-registered as such. On 18 September 1969 the tug sailed on the first leg of the journey to San Francisco (via the Panama Canal) to pass under the Golden Gate bridge by late March, 1970, six months and nine days after setting sail.\n\nNewhall subsequently wrote the book \"The Eppleton Hall\" which tells the story of the discovery and restoration of the ship, the events surrounding \"Reliant\", and the eleven thousand mile journey from the Tyne to San Francisco. The route chosen was determined by the tug's conversion to diesel firing with the resultant limited fuel capacity and her low overall power output. Sailing via Dover, Lisbon, Cape Verde, Georgetown, via Panama and San Diego to name but a few of her scheduled stops; not counting running out of fuel in the Bay of Biscay, vacuum pump failure in mid Atlantic, rescuing a fishing vessel off the coast of Mexico, and nearly foundering in a storm out of San Diego on the final leg to San Francisco.\n\nDonated by Kortum to the National Park Service in 1979, she is now berthed at Hyde Street Pier, San Francisco. She has been restored to resemble her condition post-War 1946, when refurbished for France Fenwick, Tyne and Wear Ltd.\n\nNot eligible for grants reserved for US built vessels, the ship is visible from and moored to Hyde Street Pier but is not open to the public for boarding. Despite this it is in a superior condition to , a similar paddle tug built in Scotland in 1931, currently lying at Chatham awaiting funds for restoration, having been sunk in 1994 and then salvaged some years later.\n\"Reliant\" was dismantled by the National Maritime Museum and sectioned for display in pride of place in the Museum's Neptune Hall, where it remained on display until 2005. The tug was then controversially removed and scrapped as a cost reduction exercise, with only a single engine and a sectioned representation of one paddle wheel remaining on display (as had been originally intended back in 1969).

When done for students, it is also known as school trip in the UK and New Zealand, school tour in the Philippines, Ensoku ('Excursion') in Japan and Klassenfahrt in Germany.\n\nThe purpose of the trip is usually \"observation\" for education, non-experimental research or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide a common ground with more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to have some of the same cultural experiences in the arts.\n\nField trips are most often done in 3 steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the student and the teacher. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities that happen on the field trips often include: lectures, tours, worksheets, videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions that occur in the classroom once the field trip is completed.\n\nIn Western culture people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a geological or geographical feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the natural sciences was of this form. Charles Darwin is an important example of someone who has contributed to science through the use of field trips.\n\nPopular field trip sites include zoos, nature centers, community agencies such as fire stations and hospitals, government agencies, local businesses, amusement parks, science museums, and factories. Not only do field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children, they can also benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also provide students the opportunity to take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive displays that allow children to touch plants or animals.\n\nToday, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the country report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the Field Museum in Chicago at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the American Association of School Administrators found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010–11.\n\nA variation on the field trip is the \"site-based program\" or \"site-school\" model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site. The approach was first developed at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and \"Zoo School\" was inaugurated in 1994. The Calgary Board of Education then approached the Glenbow Museum and Archives to create a \"Museum School\" in 1995 followed by the Calgary Science Centre (1996), the University of Calgary (1996), Canada Olympic Park (1997), the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (1998), Calgary City Hall (2000), Cross Conservation Area (2000), the Calgary Stampede (2002), the Calgary Aero-Space Museum (2005), and the Fire Training Academy (2008). The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and to the United States. Global coordination of the model is through the \"Beyond the Classroom Network\".\n\nA somewhat similar model in France called \"classe de mer\" (sea class), \"classe de neige\" (snow class), or \"classe verte\" (green class) involving outdoor education trips that last several days, however these may not involve support from museum or zoo staff as in the Canadian model.\n\n"}

File archivers may employ lossless data compression in their archive formats to reduce the size of the archive.\n\nBasic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives. The archive files need to store metadata, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible. More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the original timestamps, file attributes or access control lists.\n\nThe process of making an archive file is called \"archiving\" or \"packing\". Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed \"unarchiving\", \"unpacking\" or \"extracting\".\n\nAn early archiver was the Multics command \"archive\", descended from the CTSS command of the same name, which was a basic archiver and performed no compression. Multics also had a \"tape_archiver\" command, abbreviated \"ta\", which was perhaps the forerunner of unix' \"tar\".\n\nThe Unix tools \"ar\", \"tar\", \"cpio\" act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as gzip, bzip2, or xz, to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. The filename extensions are successively added at each step of this process. For example, archiving a collection of files with \"tar\" and then compressing the resulting archive file with \"gzip\" results a file with codice_1 extension.\n\nThis approach has two goals:\n\nThis approach, however, has disadvantages too:\n\nThe built-in archiver of Microsoft Windows as well as third-party archiving software, such as WinRAR and 7-zip, often use a graphical user interface. They also offer an optional command-line interface, while Windows itself does not. Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression. Solid compression may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.\n\n"}

Murray\n\nHarold James Ruthven Murray (24 June 1868 – 16 May 1955) was an English educationalist, inspector of schools, and prominent chess historian. His book, \"A History of Chess\", is widely regarded as the most authoritative and most comprehensive history of the game.\n\nMurray, the eldest of eleven children, was born near Peckham Rye in Peckham, London. The son of Sir James Murray, the first editor of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", he attended school at Mill Hill and during his spare time helped his father produce the first edition of the OED. By the time Harold had finished school and was preparing to leave for university, he had been responsible for over 27,000 quotations that later appeared in the OED.\n\nHe won a place at Balliol College, Oxford where in 1890 he graduated with a first class degree in Mathematics. He became an assistant master at Queen's College, Taunton where he learned to play chess. Later he was assistant master at Carlisle Grammar School and in 1896 he became headmaster of Ormskirk Grammar School in Lancashire. On 4 January 1897 he married Miss Kate Maitland Crosthwaite. In 1901, he was appointed a school inspector and in 1928 he became a member of the board of education.\n\nMurray was a champion of the left-handed, defending children against the attempts of schools to make them conform by using their right hand.\n\nIn 1897 he was encouraged by Baron von der Lasa (who had just completed his book on the history of European chess) to research into the further past of chess. Murray gained access to the largest chess library in the world, that of John G. White of Cleveland, Ohio, and also used the collection of J. W. Rimington Wilson in England. The White collection contained some Arabic manuscripts, so Murray learnt Arabic (in addition to his native English and German) and examined many historical chess documents. The research took him 13 years, and he contributed articles on aspects of chess history to the \"British Chess Magazine\" and the \"Deutsches Wochenschach\" in this time. In 1913 he published his most significant work, \"A History of Chess\", proposing the theory that chess originated in India. This remains the most widely accepted theory today. (See Origins of chess.)\n\nIn 1952 Murray published \"A History of Board Games other than Chess\". Although \"A History of Chess\" was recognised as the standard reference on the subject, its scholarly approach and great length (900 pages) made it inaccessible to most chess players. Murray began a shorter work on chess history written in a more popular style. Although begun many years earlier this work was unfinished at his death. It was completed by B. Goulding Brown and Harry Golombek and published in 1963 as \"A Short History of Chess\".\n\nMurray was the father of the archaeologist Kenneth Murray.\n\n\nMost of his unpublished works are now held in the library of Oxford University.\n\n\n"}

It is famous for the forensic use of mathematics by Benjamin Peirce as an expert witness.\n\nSylvia Ann Howland died in 1865, leaving roughly half her fortune of some 2 million dollars () to various legatees, with the residue to be held in trust for the benefit of Robinson, Howland's niece. The remaining principal was to be distributed to various beneficiaries on Robinson's death.\n\nRobinson produced an earlier will, leaving her the whole estate outright. To the will was attached a second and separate page, putatively seeking to invalidate any subsequent wills. Howland's executor, Thomas Mandell, rejected Robinson's claim, insisting that the second page was a forgery, and Robinson sued.\n\nIn the ensuing case of \"Robinson v. Mandell\", Charles Sanders Peirce testified that he had made pairwise comparisons of 42 examples of Howland's signature, overlaying them and counting the number of downstrokes that overlapped. Each signature featured 30 downstrokes and he concluded that, on average, 6 of the 30 overlapped, 1 in 5. Benjamin Peirce showed that the number of overlapping downstrokes between two signatures also closely followed the binomial distribution, the expected distribution if each downstroke was an independent event. When the admittedly genuine signature on the first page of the contested will was compared with that on the second, all 30 downstrokes coincided, suggesting that the second signature was a tracing of the first.\n\nBenjamin Peirce, Charles' father, then took the stand and asserted that, given the independence of each downstroke, the probability that all 30 downstrokes should coincide in two genuine signatures was formula_1. He went on to observe\n\nSo vast improbability is practically an impossibility. Such evanescent shadows of probability cannot belong to actual life. They are unimaginably less than those least things which the law cares not for. ... The coincidence which has occurred here must have had its origin in an intention to produce it. It is utterly repugnant to sound reason to attribute this coincidence to any cause but design.\n\nThe court ruled that Robinson's testimony in support of Howland's signature was inadmissible as she was a party to the will (see conflict of interest). The statistical evidence was not called upon in judgment.\n\nThe case is one of a series of attempts to introduce mathematical reasoning into the courts. \"People v. Collins\" is a more recent example.\n\n"}
{"id": "4666465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4666465", "title": "IBM Redbooks", "text": "IBM Redbooks\n\nIBM Redbooks are technical content developed and published by IBM's International Technical Support Organization (ITSO).\n\nIBM Redbooks are ITSO's core product. They typically provide positioning and value guidance, installation and implementation experiences, typical solution scenarios, and step-by-step \"how-to\" guides. They often include sample code and other support materials that are also available as downloads. Among the media options available are hard copy books, in IBM Redbooks CD-ROM collections, and on the Internet. IBM says that Redbooks publications are downloaded and viewed approximately 1.75M per quarter, on average\n\nRedbooks are created through the ITSO residency process and are generally published 60–90 days after residency completion.\n\nDraft Redbooks are Redbooks under development. The objective of making the draft versions available is to speed up access to books that are not yet published. Usually they are technically complete but are less polished and have not undergone the formal review that takes place for completed IBM Redbooks.\n\nRedpapers are shorter technical documents that are only Web-published. They can be the result of ITSO residencies and may also be contributed from other sources. They reflect working experiences on the specific topic.\n\nWhen IBM initially moved into the Data Processing world, each computer was a stand-alone machine with limited stored program capability with little interaction with other devices or software. The only support documentation was a manual of operation outlining the basic capabilities of the computer. The technical specifications were restricted in their distribution and rarely available to users. With the advent of System/360 in 1964 with their connectability to various I/O components and their associated software, their installation and their very usage rapidly became a challenge. Hands-on training was no longer just for the installation and maintenance professionals (Customer Engineers) but a necessity for the IBM System Engineers who ran and coded the systems. While the system engineers in the US Company had some access to the technical skills available in the Poughkeepsie Plant where the systems were built, the World Trade Division (the 131 countries outside of the US where IBM did business) had no such fall-back capability. \n\nTo provide hands-on training in the usage of these systems, a center was established in Poughkeepsie NY – the World Trade System Center (WTSC, later changed to the International Technical Support Center – ITSO) where a few SE's from around the world could come for a short period to work on various computer systems that were “borrowed” from the assembly line for short periods before being shipped to their designated customers. In the early 1970s, as the IBM product line both expanded and specialized, under a new manager (M.Turin) the WTSC hands-on training concept was cloned, with WTSCs being set up in Endicott (mid-range systems), San Jose (storage systems), Boca Raton (System 3), Stuttgart (small systems), Raleigh (communication systems), Rochester (printers) and Palo Alto (database systems). While extremely successful, this hands-on training concept was still limited in the number of System Engineers that could be cycled through any of these locations. \n\nIn 1974, the manager of the San Jose center (G. Radmall) came up with a major improvement to the concept. Instead of merely encouraging the various countries to send individuals to the centers for a week or two at Country expense for ad hoc training by WTSC personnel, the WTSC would propose specific training projects related to newly announced systems and software and accept assignees for a 3-month “residency” period at WTSC expense. In return for absorbing the associated costs, before returning to their home country at the conclusion of their training, the WTSC required these residents to document their training and experience for publication and distribution throughout WTC (and almost immediately throughout all of IBM).. The first of these document to be written was sent back to the Poughkeepsie Center to be printed. It happened that in the Center storeroom was a pallet of red oak tag that had been previously ordered to be made into various posters to hang around the center. Without much thought, this heavier red paper was stapled on as a protective cover to the document, printed with the WTSC logo (a series of circles representing the world that one of the SE's had sketched out) and the first of the IBM Redbooks was born. \n\nAll the WTSCs used the red oak tag as covers, although sometime later when IBM-US also began producing such documents, they used a different cover color. Another distinguishing factor was that from the get-go, the WTSC, to acknowledge their contribution, printed the authoring SE's names and Home Country inside the Redbooks where they remain to this day. Shortly after the Redbooks became available, IBM-US informed the WTSC that it violated US policy to identify the author by name in any IBM publications. The WTSC responded by suspending distribution of their Redbooks in the US and the policy was rapidly changed. The value of the Redbooks was immediately apparent throughout both IBM and the customer world. Printing and distribution of the Redbooks grew exponentially and within a few months it became necessary to turn over this activity to the formal IBM printing and distribution facility in Mechanicsburg.\n\n"}

In Exodus, Moses' father-in-law is initially referred to as \"Reuel\" (Exodus 2:18) but then as \"Jethro\" (Exodus 3:1). He was the father of Hobab in the Book of Numbers 10:29. He is also revered as the spiritual founder and chief prophet in his own right in the Druze religion, and considered an ancestor of all Druze.\n\nJethro is called a priest of Midian and became father-in-law of Moses after he gave his daughter, Zipporah, in marriage to Moses. He is introduced in .\n\nJethro is recorded as living in Midian, a territory stretching along the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aqaba, northwestern Arabia. Some believe Midian is within the Sinai Peninsula. Biblical maps from antiquity show Midian on both locations.\n\nJethro's daughter, Zipporah (Rohaya), became Moses's wife after Moses had fled Egypt, having killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave. Having fled to Midian, Moses intervened in a water-access dispute between Jethro's seven daughters and the local shepherds; Jethro consequently invited Moses into his home and offered him hospitality. However, Moses remained conscious that he was a stranger in exile, naming his first son (Jethro's grandson) \"Gershom\", meaning \"stranger there\".\n\nMoses is said to have worked as a shepherd for Jethro for 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Hebrews to Canaan, the \"promised land\". After the Battle at Rephidim against the Amalekites, word reached Jethro that under Moses' leadership the Israelites had been delivered out of Egypt, so he set out to meet with Moses. They met in the wilderness at the \"Mountain of God\"; Moses recounted to Jethro all that had taken place, and then, according to Exodus 18:9–12a:\n\nFollowing this event, it was Jethro who encouraged Moses to appoint others to share in the burden of ministry to the nation Israel by allowing others to help in the judgment of smaller matters coming before him.\n\nThese events take place in the Torah portion Yitro (Exodus 18:1–20:23).\n\nThere is some disagreement over the name(s) of Moses' father-in-law. In the KJV translation of , a man named Hobab appears as Moses' father-in-law, while makes him \"the son of Raguel [Reuel] the Midianite, Moses' father in law\". Reuel is noted , as \"a priest of Midian\" who had seven daughters. \"the girls returned to Reuel their father\". Reuel becomes Moses' father in law in \"Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.\"\n\nIn Numbers 10:29, the Hebrew for the name Raguel is the same as the Hebrew for Reuel. The reason for the difference is that the Hebrew character ע (ayin) in רעואל is sometimes used merely as a vowel and sometimes as \"g\", \"ng\", and \"gn\", because of the difficulty of its pronunciation by European speakers. Re-u-el, with the first syllable strong accented, is nearer to the true pronunciation. Some suppose he was father to Hobab, who was also called Jethro, a likely possibility.\n\nIt became, however, generally accepted that he had seven names: \"Reuel\", \"Jether\", \"Jethro\", \"Hobab\", \"Heber\", \"Keni\" (comp. Judges i. 16, iv. 11), and \"Putiel\"; Eleazar's father-in-law (Ex. vi. 25) being identified with Jethro by interpreting his name either as \"he who abandoned idolatry\" or as \"who fattened calves for the sake of sacrifices to the idol\".\n\nJethro, Moses' non-Hebrew father-in-law, is a central figure, particularly in the rites and pilgrimages, of the Druze religion. He is viewed as a Prophet in Druze belief. Nabi Shu'ayb is the site recognized by Druze as the tomb of Shuʿayb. It is located in Hittin in the Lower Galilee and is the holiest shrine and most important pilgrimage site for the Druze. Each year on April 25, the Druze gather at the site in a holiday known as Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb to discuss community affairs and commemorate the anniversary of Jethro's death with singing, dancing and feasting. Another Druze shrine in Ein Qiniyye is the supposed burial place of Jethro's sister, Sit Shahwana.\n\nJethro is revered as the chief prophet in the Druze religion. They believe he was a \"hidden\" and \"true prophet\" who communicated directly with God and then passed on that knowledge to Moses, whom they describe as a \"recognised\" and \"revealed prophet.\" According to Druze belief, Moses was allowed to wed Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, after helping save his daughters and their flock from competing herdsmen. He is also considered an ancestor of the Druze; as is expressed by such prominent Druze as Amal Nasereldeen, and according to Salman Tarif, who was a prominent Druze shaykh, this makes the Druze related to the Jews through marriage. This view has been used to represent an element of the special relationship between Israeli Jews and Druze. The Israeli Druze also have a folktale called \"Jethro's revenge on the [Sunni Muslim] inhabitants of the village of Hittin.\"\n\n\n"}

In August 1864 he was journeying in his wagon from Los Angeles to Tucson. After Apaches set his wagon on fire, Adams drove a dozen saved horses towards Sacaton, Arizona, with the hope to sell them. In Sacaton, Adams met a group of twenty one miners led by John Brewer traveling together in search of the gold fields. The party also accounted the Pima-Mexican guide who promised the prospectors to lead them to the valley of gold :“I know a place where canyon walls cry tears of [gold] every day! And those tears are larger than your coins!” Supposedly, In 1862, the young Pima-Mexican had gone on an expedition with the Apaches when those attacked Pueblo Indians in western New Mexico. While on the expedition he had seen gold nuggets that were larger than oak nuts. The young man had appreciation for works made out of silver and turquoise but had no knowledge of gold value. The miners made a bargain with the guide who only asked for a horse, a saddle, a weapon and some of the gold in exchange. The group was badly in need of horses, and when by fate Adams appeared in Sacaton with his twelve head, Brewer struck a deal with Adams on the terms that Adams would share leadership with him in exchange for donating his horses.\n\nTwenty-two men set out on August 20. Along with their guide the group followed White River and its east fork into the White Mountains and entered western New Mexico. The guide paused and pointed to two mountains that were shaped like sugar loaves. “The gold canyon lies at the foot of those peaks,” the guide said. According to Adams, from that mountain lookout the miners were able to observe San Francisco Mountains. Adams thought that this mountain range was located on Mt. Ord, or on one of the mountaintops nearby. The miners entered a canyon with a fantastic gold deposit through 'the Little Door', as Adams referred to it. He said that the passageway was so narrow that the riders had to enter it one by one. They descended a canyon via a Z-shaped trail. At the bottom of the canyon was a spring with a low falls above it.\n\nWithin a few days the group collected a fortune of gold nuggets that they hid in a corn-grinding basin left by ancient Indians. The young guide left the miners on the first night after the discovery and after being paid. Before leaving the guide issued a warning. He told the group not to stay long in the canyon that was a campsite for Apaches. Apache Chief Nana and 30 warriors appeared the second day. The chief told them not to go above the falls. Some of the men started construction of a cabin. A cache of the gold was hidden under the cabin's hearth stone. The miners continued to mine the gold until they ran out of supplies. The party decided to send Brewer and five others to buy more supplies at Old Fort Wingate, west of modern Grants.\n\nAfter Brewer's party left, some of the men began secretly searching above the falls. They returned to camp with large nuggets. Adams warned them against it but the nuggets were kept.\n\nNine days after the provisions party did not return, Adams became concerned about their safety. Along with another miner named Davidson, Adams climbed out of the canyon to discover five bodies on the trail, Brewer was not among them. They raced back towards camp, but it was too late. A large party of Indians had reached the camp and killed the remaining miners. The cabin had been set on fire, making the hearth stone too hot to move. Thirteen days later, Adams and Davidson were found by a military patrol out of Fort Apache, AZ.\n\nUpon recovery Adams settled in California and when the Apache Wars ended, he led several expeditions to find the canyon and the basin filled with gold. Adams must have had a terrible sense of direction, after so many years of searching his quest proved hopeless. But in his search he inspired others to joint the hunt.\n\nIn July 1949, 83-year-old Robert W. \"Bob\" Lewis, who said he had known Adams when he had been a cowpuncher and law officer in Socorro County, New Mexico, stated that he and Adams searched for the gold together in 1889 twenty five years after the massacre in 1864. But it was not until 1918, that he claimed to have single-handedly found the skeletons and Adam's cabin at the mouth of a canyon 35 miles northwest of Magdalena, New Mexico. Lewis said that everything was there just as Adams had described except for the gold. He said he later found out the missing gold had been found by a Magdelena Sheepherder who received $20,000 for it with which he bought a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nFor decades the Zuni Mountains were considered the most plausible location of the diggings. Thousands of prospectors, ranch-hands, and men-of-fortune searched this area and the rest of southwestern New Mexico prior to World War II, as the Adams diggings became the most sought-for gold in the country. Only Frank Dobie's 1939 book \"Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver\" adequately describes how renowned the Adams legend had become. The combination of the depression and the deregulation of the gold market prompted the most unlikely people to search for the diggings. Between 1895 and 1930 several large logging communities flourished in the Zuni Mountains, several with schools and post offices; wide-gauge railroads crisscrossed the mountains. The loggers were well aware of the Adams legend, as it had become a nationally known story. Between running logs nothing was more common than prospecting except for drinking. Rumors of gold in the Zunis had become so common that the U.S. government ordered several geological expeditions in the years between World War I and World War II to verify whether this claim could be supported. The geologists found nothing. In the 1950s the area was thoroughly re-explored for uranium during the uranium boom around Grants, New Mexico. Eventually the obsession with the Zuni Mountains as a host for the Adams diggings faded. It was also around the mid-century that the popularity of the Adams legend began to diminish and the Lost Dutchman Mine became America's most sought-for lost gold mine. The Adams diggings were beginning to seem a hoax or a mine unlikely to ever be found.\n\nGeologically, the Adams diggings could only be in the southwestern quadrant of the state. Adams himself spent most of the remainder of his life searching the areas in and around Reserve, New Mexico. This area was the largest gold producing area in the state, and hosted several small mining booms, including the rich strikes at Silver City and Pinos Altos. The areas that could conceivably host the diggings in this region (containing several large mountain ranges that remain sparsely inhabited) are numerous, as minerals and evidence of previous mining can be found throughout the area. Local folklore will tell you that the gold is at the headwaters of either the Black River, the Gila River, or the Prieto River. Spanish Lore will tell you to look to the Blue Mountains. Dozens of mining camps in this region of New Mexico were thought to be the Adams diggings for brief periods, until each proved itself to be less rich than at first indicated: egregious hopes followed by rapid disappointment. That seems to be the story of gold in the desert southwest.\n\nThe Datils and Gallinas Mountains and the basins to the north of these mountains were considered possible locations for the diggings that increased in popularity as the other locations lost appeal. Dick French, in his book \"Four Days from Fort Wingate\", places the diggings in this area. It has become known as \"Dick French’s area,\" although his location was known to have been found by others in the 1950s, if not earlier. A follow-on work by Dick French, \"Return to the Lost Adams Diggings: The Paul A. Hale Story\" published in 2014 uses historical, artifactual, geographical, and geological data to demonstrate the viability of the location in the new book as the locality of the Lost Adams Diggings. The new book demonstrates the presence of significant gold mineralization, adds a wrinkle to the story by presenting evidence of colonial Spanish activity in the area dated to the 1600s, and identifies and locates every critical landmark. The new book contains maps, pictures of artifacts, assay reports, and is written in a conversational format with Dick interviewing the re-discoverers Paul Hale and Ronald Schade.\n\nA similar but geographically less plausible location was found in eastern Arizona by Don Fingado near Clifton. The site contains features described by Adams much like the area favored by Dick French; however, the gold remained undiscovered.\n\nIn some minds the gold was to be found on either the Zuni or Navajo reservations, but the laws preventing the acquisition of mineral rights in these regions have discouraged searching.\n\nThere are other sites, but the leading candidates in the popular imagination are mentioned above. If it really exists, its traditional location remains within \"Apacheria\" or the southwest quadrant of New Mexico and bordering areas in Arizona. The complexity of the story is detailed in Jack Purcell's definitive book on the subject, \"The Lost Adams Diggings: Myth, Mystery, and Madness.\" This work, unlike its predecessors, is a serious attempt to give historical perspective supported by cited research. Purcell believes that the gold exists and is perhaps somewhere in the mountains just south of Quemado, New Mexico. Perhaps gold will be found someday, but in the minds of most, the legend is fading away among the other items in the forgotten annals of American lore.\n\nThe many stories arising or deriving from the lost diggings have inspired many to search for lost Apache gold ever since. Its legend has supplied many folk tales, stories and books with ample fuel for fantasies of lost treasures, hidden canyons, Apache secrets and gold \"somewhere out there\" in the wilds. Another supposed Indian name for the mine was \"Sno-Ta-Hay,\" which supposedly means \"there it lies\" i.e. the gold is on the ground and can be picked up or panned as a placer mine. Chief Nana supposedly called it that when he first warned the Adams party before the attack. As previously mentioned, J. Frank Dobie devoted half of his book \"Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver\" (now in its ninth printing) to the story of the Lost Adams Diggings and considered it to be the greatest \"lost mine\" story of US history. The amount of mail being sent to western New Mexico during the 1930s prompted the government to create a new post office in the area affectionately named \"Lost Adams Diggings, NM;\" the post office has since closed.\n\nThe 1963 novel \"MacKenna's Gold\" by Heck Allen is loosely based on the Adams legend. The novel was made into a film in 1969 with the title \"Mackenna's Gold.\" Numerous other books about, or based on, the diggings have been written.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5249121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5249121", "title": "National Museum of Serbia", "text": "National Museum of Serbia\n\nThe National Museum of Serbia (, ) is the largest and oldest museum in Serbia and former Yugoslavia. It is located in the central zone of Belgrade on a square plot between the Republic Square, formerly Theatre Square, and three streets: Čika Ljubina, Vasina and Laze Pačua. Its main facade is on the Republic Square and the official address ia 1a Republic Square.\n\nThe museum was established on 10 May 1844. It moved into the present building in 1950, with the grand opening of the venue on 23 May 1952. Since its founding, the museum's collection has grown to over 400,000 objects, including many foreign masterpieces.\n\nThe National Museum of Serbia building was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1979.\n\nBefore erection of the building of the National Museum on this place was famous tavern called \"Dardanelles\", meeting point of cultural and artistic elite of the time. Demolition of the old tavern signified the beginning of the transformation of The Republic Square. The building which housed the most important museum of Republic of Serbia today, originally was built from 1902 to 1903, for the purpose of Fund Mortgage Bank, one of the oldest banking institution of Belgrade. Building has constructed according to design of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović after a competition on which they received the first prize. It was one of the first building in which was used some form of reinforced concrete for the foundation. Actually during the digging foundation trenches, the various pits, wells and basements were encountered because of the proximity of the former Stambol Gate. Newly built two-storeyed building was a real palace of its time. Its volume conception designed in the form of a long solid block with domes over the central and lateral rizalites and academic façade shape were based on the principles of neo-Renaissance style with neo-baroque elements on the domes. The greatest attention was given to the monumental staircase and the hall with bank windows which as the basic premises of a bank was given a secondary importance. Almost three decades later, an increased development of Mortgage Bank, influenced a need for a reconstruction of the building. The extension was made without competition by architect Vojin Petrović, who designed the added wing and atrium facing the street Laze Paču. The new part of the building contained the same elements of interior as the old part, and in the final image the building got two monumental staircases and two halls with bank windows while only the upper floors form the continuous line of offices. During World War II Mortgage Bank building was bombed and the central part with the dome was destroyed. After the war, the building got a completely new purpose when one of the most important national cultural institution moved in.\nSince its establishing during the Constitutionalist, until the end of the Second World War the National Museum changed location for several times. At a beginning, it was placed in Captain Miša’s building (1863) and soon after it was moved into two adjacent buildings which were destroyed during World War I. At the same time the museum art collections were seized and looted by the invaders. During the interwar period the Museum didn’t get its own building. The museum was located in a rented private house at 58 Kneza Miloša street. In 1935 the New Royal Palacе became the residence of the museum and named the Royal Museum. Subsequently, it was renamed into the Museum of Prince Paul which consisted of Historical Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art (founded in 1929), which merged in 1935. In 1948 the New Palace was restored and became administrative seat of the Republic. For that purpose the Museum was transferred into a building of the former Stock Exchange on the Student Square, and partly to Palace of Princess Ljubica.\n\nThe first architectural competition for the proper National Museum building, planned to be on Tašmajdan was announced the following year.\n\nThe author of the design was an architect Miladin Prljevic but the Cominiform disapproved this idea. Then the museum was transferred into the building of Mortgage Bank. After the World War II, the first renovation of bank building was done by architect Dobroslav Pavlovic in 1950 but the overall reconstruction of the building was made 1965-1966 by architects Alexander Deroko, Petar Anagnosti and Zoran Petrović. The central dome was restored and the central tract with offices and workspaces was lifted. After an adaptation the original hall with bank windows was converted into a library. The originally main and monumental three-way staircase entrance from the Republic Square received an internal character while the other entrance from Vasina street became the main entrance to the Museum, which is connected directly to the other hall with bank windows was. In a functional arrangement, the building underwent upgrading doubling space and communications, while in terms of design, maintained the characteristic elements of 1902 and in terms of art as an integral unity. Interior renovation from the sixties of the 20th century was done in such manner that it is not visible from the outside and it doesn’t disturb the communications inside the museum.\n\nIn 2003, the permanent exhibition was dismantled and the building was closed for the impending reconstruction, but the process dragged on for years, including the gaps when nothing have been done at all, and by January 2018 the museum was still not open.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, after ten years of the National Museum in Belgrade being closed to the public, Vladimir Bogdanović of the leading Serbian newspaper/website \"Press\" wrote an article called \"A decade of cultural genocide against the Serbs\", commenting on the need and importance of a working national museum. He also criticised the preservation of the art in the museum. The façade was finished in 2015 and had to be reconstructed to its original look as the building is under the state protection. In the mid-2016 the works on the interiors began. The entrance into the museum from the \"Vasina\" Street will remain the main entry point, while the exit doors that lead to the Square of the Republic, with its architectural staircase, will be adapted to be the exit point.\n\nThe new permanent exhibit will represent the cultural development in this part of Europe from prehistory to the 20th century, with an emphasis on the Serbian cultural heritage. The 18th and 19th centuries art will be exhibited on the first floor, so as the 20th century Yugoslav art. In the atrium of the building there are vaults, left from the period when the venue served as a bank, which will be adapted into the exhibition depots. The look of the vault will be preserved and will serve for the presentation of the museum numismatic collection, from the beginning of the coin minting to the 20th century. In addition, a collection of the medallion art will be exhibited here, too.\nThe construction works should be finished by March 2018, when the preparation and setting of the collections should start.\n\nOn 18 June 2018, 10 days before the scheduled opening, reporters from the daily Politika visited the museum. They reported that the venue doesn’t look like something to be open in several days, and the employees confirmed that it would take at least six more months to complete everything, but that the museum will be open as scheduled. The reporters were not allowed to photograph everything. Even though the reconstruction projects, by architects Milan Rakočević and Vladimir Lojanica, envisioned several major changes (including the reconstruction of the glass roof and a dome destroyed during the heavy 1944 Allied Easter bombing of Belgrade), nothing was actually changed so after 15 years the building wasn’t thoroughly reconstructed as announced, but only refurbished. This way the capacity of the exhibition space wasn’t enlarged, so the permanent exhibition will have 3,000 pieces, out of 400,000.\n\nThe large mural by Mladen Josić, painted in the 1930s and located on the wall of the mezzanine, was preserved. Josić painted another mural, close to the former dome, but was destroyed in the 1944 bombing. One of the remnants of the 1966 reconstruction, when museum was managed by Lazar Trifunović, is a window decorated with the wrought iron. The window was originally facing outside until 1933 when the annex was added to the building.\n\nThe National Museum was officially re-opened on 28 June 2018. The grand re-opening ceremony included projections on the buildings facade, as well as a promotional video featuring famous Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin.\n\nThe National Museum of Serbia is a representative public building, monumental in size and volume, as well as its external shape and style. That is especially visible in the entrance area with twin columns and magnificent dome. All the facades characterized with polychrome ornaments neo-Renaissance origin. Monumentality is also reflected in the interior with rich decoration done by famous artists of the time: Andrea Domenico (also known as a painter of decorative wall painting that is in the interior of the building of the Old Palace), Franz Valdman and Bora Kovacevic.\n\nBecause of its architectural and cultural, urban and historical value building of the National Museum of Serbia is established for the cultural heritage monument of great importance for the Republic of Serbia.\n\nThe Museum has 34 archeological, numismatic, artistic and historical collections today.\n\nThe main collection consists of sculptures from Vinca (6th–5th millennium BC) such as Lady of Vinča and Lepenski Vir (7th millennium BC).\nThere are also numerous sculptures, weapons, helmets and other items from ancient Rome, 1005 items from ancient Greece and various items of Celtic origin. The most valuable pieces from that period are \"Dupljaja Chariot\" (16th-13th century BC), golden masks from Trebenište (6th century BC), household sets from Jabučje (1st century AD), the Belgrade Cameo (4th century) and a \"Silver belt with swastika (5th century BC)\".\nThere is also a collection from ancient Egypt. The most famous piece is a rare gold sarcophagus and mummy of the Egyptian priest Nesmin.\nThe Numismatic Collection has more than 300,000 items (coins, medals, rings, seals). The collection is divided into ten smaller assemblies from 6th–5th century BC, and includes a collection of coins issued by Philip II of Macedonian (359–336 BC) and Alexander the Great (336–323 BC). The collection also contains unique items: a golden medallion of Emperor Valentinian I, minted 364 AD, silver Dinars from the reign of King Stefan Radoslav of Serbia, and others.\n\nThe museum also holds a large collection of medieval artifacts, mostly from Europe and Asia. The most important is the illustrated 362 page manuscript of the Miroslav Gospels written in 1186 in Kingdom of Serbia (medieval). The manuscript was entered into UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value.\nThe collection also includes the sarcophagus of Saint King Stefan Decanski from the 14th century, rings belonging to the Serbian Queen Theodora (before 1322) and King Stephen Radoslav of Serbia (1219–20), King Milutin's mantle from the 1300s, the Eulogy to Prince Lazar - Euphemia's famous embroidery from 1402, about 120 icons from 1200 to 1500, including the Ohrid collection.\n\nThe Collection of Drawings and Prints of International Artists has 2,446 items and the Yugoslav Art Collection has more than 6,000 items, including 1,700 paintings of Serbian authors from 18th to 19th century and 3,000 paintings from the 20th century. This does not include the Serbian Medieval Art Collection.\nThe museum includes Serbian medieval, French, Dutch, Flemish, Italian, Russian, German, Japanese, Chinese (from 1644-1978), English, Spanish, Hungarian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Yugoslav and miscellaneous art collections. In total the collection numbers some 16,000 paintings, graphics, drawings, icons and prints, plus over 900 sculptures.\n\nThe French masters collection is the National Museum's most significant holding. It comprises extremely rare pieces from Matisse, Picasso, Renoir, Rouault, Degas, Cézanne and others. Most of these paintings were collected and donated by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. Erih Šlomović, a young Belgrader born at the turn of the 20th century, became in his youth the protégé of the world's biggest art merchant, Ambroise Vollard. The connection led him to develop his own collection, comprising a total of 600 pieces by 1941. The Slomovic Collection is the largest and richest collection of French art in the Balkans, as well as one of the most beautiful in the world.\n\nThe Italian Art Collection, consisting of more than 230 works of art, is famous for containing creative works from individual masters and artistic workshops from the 14th to the 20th century. They include works by Domenico Veneziano, Giovanni di Paolo, Raphael, Titian, Tintoretto, Domenico Robusti, Vittore Carpaccio, Lorenzo di Credi, Guido Reni, Spinello Aretino, Francesco Bassano the Younger, Leandro Bassano, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Giulio Carpioni, Andrea Celesti, Biagio Faggioni etc. The graphic and etching collection includes work by Botticelli, Annibale Carracci, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Paolo Veronese, Amedeo Modigliani, Luigi Ontani, Guglielmo Achille Cavellini, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio, and others.\n\nHighlights in the museum include:\n\nThe Dutch and Flemish collection consists of more than 500 works (210 paintings of art and 220 graphics and engravings, and over 80 drawings).

They operate in northern Paraguay, with most incidents occurring in Concepción Department, as well as the neighboring departments of Canindeyú and San Pedro. The EPP are believed to number 50-80 members.\n\nAs of March 2012, the group was suspected of carrying out 27 separate operations, with more than half of them occurring after January 2011. These incidents resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people — 9 civilians and 7 police officers. By December 2013, the insurgency resulted in killing of at least 33 civilians and police officers, with an unknown number of killed EPP operatives. By mid 2016, fatalities from the insurgency had surpassed 60, most of them civilians and police.\n\nThe EPP began as an offshoot of another radical fringe group, the Free Homeland Party (Partido Patria Libre – PPL). After the PPL was taken apart by police in 2005, several members decided to form a new group with which to continue the armed struggle.\n\nBy December 2013, the insurgency resulted in killing of at least 33 civilians and police officers, with an unknown number of killed EPP operatives. Two EPP operatives were killed in early April 2014, including the third in command in EPP; one Paraguayan soldier was also killed.\n\nOn August 27, 2016, the insurgents ambushed a mobile patrol of the Paraguayan army with a roadside bomb and automatic weapons, killing one officer and eight non-commissioned officers. The guerrillas stole their M-4 carbines and a light machine gun, along with 1,500 round of ammunitions. The incident took place near the village of Arroyito, east of Concepción.\n\nThe EPP criticized the government of Fernando Lugo, saying that he ignored the country's social problems and would not implement real land reform. In 2012, the EPP declared war on Federico Franco's cabinet, describing the Impeachment of Fernando Lugo as a \"white collar theft\". The Paraguayan state describes the group as a terrorist organization.\n\nIt is known that at least one key FARC leader, Orley Jurado Palomino, has gone to Paraguay to provide training, advice and operational leadership to the insurgent group.

Undefeated in a career spanning more than 52 years, he is considered one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.\n\nGhulam Mohammad Baksh was born in the city of Amritsar village Jabbowal into an ethnic Kashmiri Muslim family of wrestlers in the Punjab region of British India. He came from a wrestling family which was known to produce world-class wrestlers. Gama had two wives: one in Pakistan and the other in Baroda, Gujarat, India.\n\nAfter the death of his father Muhammad Aziz Baksh when he was six, Gama was put under the care of his maternal grandfather Nun Pahalwan. Following his death, Gama was taken care of by his uncle Ida, another wrestler, who also began training Gama in wrestling. He was first noticed at the age of ten, in 1888, when he entered a strongman competition held in Jodhpur, which included many gruelling exercises such as squats. The contest was attended by more than four hundred wrestlers and Gama was among the last fifteen, and was named winner by the Maharaja of Jodhpur due to his young age. Gama was subsequently taken into training by the Maharaja of Datia.\n\nGama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the court (Akhada). He used to do minimum five thousand Baithaks (Hindu Squats) and three thousand Dands (Hindu Pushups) in a day and even sometime more within 30 to 45 minutes each by wearing a doughnut-shaped wrestling apparatus called Hasli of 200 pounds. Gama's daily diet was \n\nFame came to Gama in 1895, at the age of 17 when he challenged then-Indian Wrestling Champion, middle-aged Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, another ethnic Kashmiri wrestler from Gujranwala, now in Punjab, Pakistan. At about 7 feet tall, with a very impressive win-loss record, Raheem was expected to easily defeat the 5'7\" Gama. Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career. The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw. The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career. After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the \"Indian Wrestling Championship\". In the first bout Gama remained defensive, but in the second bout, Gama went on the offensive. Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal out a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh.\n\nBy 1910, Gama had defeated all the prominent Indian wrestlers who faced him except the champion, Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala. At this time, he focused his attention on the rest of the world. Accompanied by his younger brother Imam Bakhsh, Gama sailed to England to compete with the Western wrestlers but could not gain instant entry, because of his lower height.\n\nIn London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers in thirty minutes of any weight class. This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R. B. Benjamin. For a long time no one came forward to accept the challenge. To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers. He challenged Stanislaus Zbyszko and Frank Gotch, either he would beat them or pay them the prize money and go home. The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American Benjamin Roller. In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other. On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to official tournament.\n\nHe was pitted against world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko and the date of bout was set as 10 September 1910. Zbyszko was now regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London. The match was £250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama’s greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko’s lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. \nThe two men were set to face each other again but Zbyszko didn't show up and Gama was announced victor. At forty-eight years old he was now known as the \"Great wrestler\" of India.\n\nAfter defeating Zbyszko, Gama beat Jesse Petersen in February 1929. The bout lasted only one and a half minutes. This was the last bout that Gama fought during his career. In the 1940s he was invited by the Nizam of Hyderabad and defeated all his fighters. The Nizam then sent him to face the wrestler Balram Heeraman Singh Yadav, who was never defeated in his life. The fight was very long. Gama was unable to defeat Heeraman and eventually neither wrestler won. Heeraman was one of the toughest wrestlers for Gama to face.\n\nAfter the independence and partition of India in 1947, Gama moved to Pakistan. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out at the time of partition, the Muslim Gama saved hundreds of Hindus from mobs in Lahore. Although Gama did not retire until 1952, he failed to find any other opponents. After his retirement, he trained his nephew Bholu Pahalwan, who held the Pakistani wrestling championship for almost 20 years.\n\nThe Great Gama died in Lahore, Pakistan on 23 May 1960 after a period of illness. He was given land by the government but he still struggled to pay for treatment for his heart and asthma. Therefore, G. D. Birla, an Indian industrialist and wrestling fan, donated Rs. 2,000 and a monthly pension of Rs. 300, and the Government of Pakistan also increased the pension to Gama and supported his medical expenses until his death.\n\nToday, a doughnut-shaped exercise disc called Hasli weighing 95 kg, used by him for squats, is housed at the National Institute of Sports (NIS) Museum at Patiala, India.\n\nBruce Lee was an avid follower of Gama's training routine. Lee read articles about Gama and how he employed his exercises to build his legendary strength for wrestling, and Lee quickly incorporated them into his own routine. The training routines Lee used included \"the cat stretch\", \"the squat\" (known as \"baithak\"), and also known as the \"deep-knee bend.\"\n\n\n"}

It pioneered the use of wine-specific cartography to give wine a sense of place, and has since the first edition published in 1971 sold 4 million copies in 14 languages. Considered among the most significant wine publications to date, and it remains one of the most popular books on wine, with the most recent seventh edition published in October 2013.\n\nPrior to its publication in 1971, no work of wine literature contained high quality, wine-specific cartography. Some single-subject wine literature contained simple line-drawn maps, but not detailed, colour cartography with precise boundaries, and no book attempting to cover the world of wine had maps for every country. It was therefore not possible to open a bottle, open a book, and see precisely where the wine came from. This sense of place for wine is taken for granted today, but in 1971 it was revolutionary, and Johnson’s timing was impeccable.\n\nUntil the World War II, wine was the preserve of the upper classes in western Europe, and virtually non-existent in the U.S. due to Prohibition, but servicemen returning home from the European theatre brought with them the newly acquired habit of wine drinking. With the emergence of mass tourism in the 1950s and the greater spending power of the 1960s, a whole new generation visited France, Italy and Spain, bringing back the continental culture of wine.\n\nAmerica's taste for wine also began to develop in the early 1960s. The majority of these new wine drinkers were young, well-traveled, and relatively affluent and, as the Baby Boom generation came of age, so the ranks of wine drinkers increased. Never before, and never since, have there been so many new wine consumers without any knowledge of the wines they were encountering, and in 1971 \"The World Atlas of Wine\" was uniquely placed to satisfy that demand. With mass tourism on the increase throughout the 1970s, the demand for \"The World Atlas of Wine\" continued to grow, as there was no real competition until 1988, when \"The Sotheby's World Wine Encyclopedia\" (now \"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\") was published.\n\nThe Institut National des Appellations d'Origine, a French governmental organisation that avoids comment on commercial ventures, was moved to describe \"The World Atlas of Wine\" upon publication as \"a major landmark in the literature of wine\".\n\nThe distinctive maps for the First Edition of the Atlas were drawn by Fairey Surveys Ltd Cartographic office in Maidenhead, UK. Although many maps have been added in later editions many of the original maps of the classic wine areas are still used in the current edition.\n\nThe seventh edition was simultaneously released as hardcover print book and ebook for the iPad using Apple's iBooks Author format (referred to as 'Made for iBooks' in iBooks). In December 2013 it was announced that the ebook was a finalist for a Digital Book Award. The ebook was also featured in the Best of 2013 promotion in iBooks.\n\n\n\n"}
