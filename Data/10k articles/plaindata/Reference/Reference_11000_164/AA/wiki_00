{"id": "5116754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5116754", "title": "Airline codes", "text": "Airline codes\n\nThis is a list of airline codes. The table lists IATA's two-character airline designators, ICAO's three-character airline designators and the airline call signs (telephony designator). Historical assignments are also included.\n\nIATA airline designators, sometimes called IATA reservation codes, are two-character codes assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to the world's airlines. The standard is described in IATA's \"Standard Schedules Information Manual\" and the codes themselves are described in IATA's \"Airline Coding Directory\". (Both are published twice-annually.) \n\nThe IATA codes originally based on the ICAO designators which were issued in 1947 as two-letter airline identification codes (see the section below). IATA expanded the 2-letter-system with codes consisting of a letter and a digit (or vice versa) after ICAO had introduced its current 3-letter-system in 1982. Until then only combinations of letters were used. \n\nAirline designator codes follow the format xx(a), i.e., two alphanumeric characters (letters or digits) followed by an optional letter. Although the IATA standard provides for three-character airline designators, IATA has not used the optional third character in any assigned code. This is because some legacy computer systems, especially the \"central reservations systems\", have failed to comply with the standard, notwithstanding the fact that it has been in place for 20 years. The codes issued to date comply with IATA Resolution 762, which provides for only two characters. These codes thus comply with the current airline designator standard, but use only a limited subset of its possible range.\n\nThere are three types of designator: unique, numeric/alpha and controlled duplicate.\n\nIATA airline designators are used to identify an airline for commercial purposes in reservations, timetables, tickets, tariffs, air waybills and in telecommunications.\n\nA flight designator is the concatenation of the airline designator, xx(a), and the numeric flight number, n(n)(n)(n), plus an optional one-letter \"operational suffix\" (a). Therefore, the full format of a flight designator is xx(a)n(n)(n)(n)(a).\n\nAfter an airline is delisted, IATA can make the code available for reuse after six months and can issue \"controlled duplicates\". Controlled duplicates are issued to regional airlines whose destinations are not likely to overlap, so that the same code is shared by two airlines. The controlled duplicate is denoted here, and in IATA literature, with an asterisk (*). An example of this is the code \"7Y\", which refers to both Mid Airlines, a charter airline in Sudan, and Med Airways, a charter airline in Lebanon.\n\nIATA also issues an accounting or prefix code. This number is used on tickets as the first three characters of the ticket number.\n\nThe ICAO airline designator is a code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to aircraft operating agencies, aeronautical authorities, and services related to international aviation, each of whom is allocated both a \"three-letter designator\" and a \"telephony designator\". These codes are unique by airline, unlike the IATA airline designator codes (see section above). The designators are listed in ICAO Document 8585: \"Designators for Aircraft Operating Agencies, Aeronautical Authorities and Services\". \n\nICAO codes have been issued since 1947. The ICAO codes were originally based on a two-letter-system and were identical to the airline codes used by IATA. After an airline joined IATA its existing ICAO-two-letter-code was taken over as IATA code. Because both organizations used the same code system, the current terms ICAO code and IATA code did not exist until the 1980s. They were commonly called two-letter-airline-designators. At this time it was impossible to find out whether an airline was an IATA member or not just by looking at its code. In the 1970s the abbreviation \"BA\" was the ICAO code and the IATA code of British Airways while non-IATA-members like Court Line used their 2-letter-abbreviation as ICAO code only. In 1982 ICAO introduced the current three-letter-system due to the increasing number of airlines. After a transitional period of five years it became the official new ICAO standard system in November 1987 while IATA kept the older 2-letter-system that was introduced by ICAO in 1947.\n\nCertain combinations of letters, for example SOS, are not allocated to avoid confusion with other systems. Other designators, particularly those starting with Y and Z, are reserved for government organizations.\nThe designator YYY is used for operators that do not have a code allocated.\n\nAn example is:\n\nA timeline of the airline designators used by American Airlines:\nMost airlines employ a call sign that is normally spoken during airband radio transmissions. As by ICAO Annex 10 chapter 5.2.1.7.2.1 a call sign shall be one of the following types:\n\n\nThe one most widely used within commercial aviation is type C. The flight identification is very often the same as the flight number, though this is not always the case. In case of call sign confusion a different flight identification can be chosen, but the flight number will remain the same. Call sign confusion happens when two or more flights with similar flight numbers fly close to each other, e.g., KLM 645 and KLM 649 or Speedbird 446 and Speedbird 664.\n\nThe flight number is published in an airline's public timetable and appears on the arrivals and departure screens in the airport terminals. In cases of emergency, the airline name and flight number, rather than the call sign, are normally mentioned by the main news media.\n\nSome call signs are less obviously associated with a particular airline than others. This might be for historic reasons (South African Airways uses the callsign \"Springbok\", hearkening back to the airline's old livery which featured a springbok), or possibly to avoid confusion with a call sign used by an established airline. \n\nCompanies' assigned names may change as a result of mergers, acquisitions, or change in company name or status; British Airways uses BOAC's old callsign (\"Speedbird\"), as British Airways was formed by a merger of BOAC and British European Airways. Country names can also change over time and new call signs may be agreed in substitution for traditional ones. The country shown alongside an airline's call sign is that wherein most of its aircraft are believed to be registered, which may not always be the same as the country in which the firm is officially incorporated or registered. There are many other airlines in business whose radio call signs are more obviously derived from the trading name.\n\nThe callsign should ideally resemble the operator's name or function and not be confused with callsigns used by other operators. The callsign should be easily and phonetically pronounceable in at least English, the international language of aviation. For example, Air France's callsign is \"Airfrans\"; 'frans' is the phonetic spelling of 'France'.\n\nThe airline accounting code, or prefix code, is a 3-digit number, referenced by IATA and unique among all the airlines, used to identify the airline in various accounting activities such as ticketing. For instance, Lufthansa (LH/DLH) has been assigned 220 as accounting code, and all the flight tickets issued by that airline start with \"220-\".\nThe IATA code search page references the accounting code for every airline having one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3058870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3058870", "title": "Akhbari", "text": "Akhbari\n\nThe Akhbaris () are Twelver Shia Muslims who reject the use of reasoning in deriving verdicts, and believe Quran and Hadith.\n\nThe term Akhbari (from \"khabara\", news or report) is usually used in contrast to Usuli (from \"Uṣūl al-fiqh\", principles of Islamic jurisprudence). Unlike Usulis, Akhbaris do not follow or do Taqleed of a Mujtahid the \"marja‘\"s (models for imitation) who practice modern form of ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) consequently they do not accept Usul al-fiqh. Akhbaris perform Taqleed of Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi the Twelfth Imam of Shias who is in the Occultation. They say Taqleed is permissible when it is performed of an infallible Hujja, whereas they consider Taqleed to be forbidden when it is performed of a Non Infallible. Contrary to Usulis, Akhbaris believe in the perpetuity of Sharia from only the infalibles, so on, the right to interpretate the Quran is only to 14 inflalibles who have complete in-depth gnostic knowledge (Rasekhuna fil ilm,) whereas the former believes in the development of jurisprudence with time 'Uṣūl al-fiqh', due to this reason Akhbaris seek religious rulings or Islamic jurisprudence Fiqh e Jafaria from a dead or living Muhaddith, who has narrated or narrates the rulings hadith of The Fourteen Infallibles without interpreting it. \nFurther Akhbaris say that The Fourteen Infallibles or Shia Imāms never permitted Ijtehad.\n\nAlthough Usulis and Akhbaris use the same Hadiths, they difer in many aspects as the later one only use the sacred scriptures as sole sources. Akhbaris believe the most important aspect of the religion is to gain spiritual knowledge about the mystical light and divinity of Muhammad and Ali (Ma'rifat Nooraniya), while Usulis believe it is just a verbal meaning, as well as Akhbaris believe salvation is only through deep love and affection for Imam Ali and through gaining knowledge of his divinity and not by external practices. Most of Akhbaris believe no one can give religious rules until the return of the Mahdi as the saviour of humanity.\n\nAkhbari nowadays form a minority within Shia Islam, with Usulis making up the majority. Akhbarism \"crystalized\" as a distinct movement with the writings of Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late Safavid and early post-Safavid era. However, shortly thereafter Muhammad Baqir Behbahani (d. 1792), along with other Usuli mujtahids, crushed the Akhbari movement. Today it is found primarily in the Basra area of southern Iraq (where they form the majority in many districts) although no longer in the city. They are also found in the island nation of Bahrain, Hyderabad, India and different cities of Pakistan Karachi, Sehwan, Hyderabad, Lahore, Faisalabad(Lylpur), Chakwaal, Gojar Khan\n\nAkhbaris consider themselves to be bounded by the Hadith of the two weighty things, where the Prophet Muhammad instructed his followers to follow the Quran and Ahl al-Bayt. Therefore, even for new events occurring during the Major Occultation, Akhbaris continue to follow traditions of Ahlul Bayt, as per the saying of Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi where he said \"As for the new events, which will occur (during my occultation) turn to the narrators of our traditions, because they are my proof to you, while I am the proof of Allah to them\" Akhbari reject fatāwa based on \"ijtihad\", they also reject the permissibility of writing exegesis of the Qur'an without quoting the narrations of the infallible \"Ahlu l-Bayt\". Akhbari quote the \"Hadith ath-Thaqalayn\" and several authentic traditions of the Twelve Imāms to prohibit the practice of exegesis. Akhbaris do not believe in generalization of Hadith, they say Hadith is either right or wrong; further they believe that Hadiths compiled in The Four Books of Shias are reliable.\nIt is reported that Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi acknowledged Kitab al-Kafi (which is among The Four Books of Shias) and said \"al-Kafi is sufficient for our Shia (followers)\".\nWhere Usulis doubt the credibility of this saying as author of Kitab al-Kafi never quoted the same.\nIn short, the gist of Akhbārī ideology is that nothing but the aḥadīth of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. Akhbārīs also differ from Usūlīs in their rejection of the \"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists\", arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics, clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam.\n\nUsūlism evolved on the basis of Usul al-fiqh (the hypothetical concepts and perceptions of some scholars) centuries after the major occultation. Among the earliest Shī‘a \"ulamā\"' such as Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni and Ibn Babawaiyya, the most important activity was transmission of a ḥadīth.\n\nAt this time, the Shī‘a distinguished themselves from the Sunni in the category of law, which employed such methods as qiyas \"analogical reasoning\" and exegesis\". However, the Shī‘a developed law directly from the traditions of the Imāms.\n\nInitially during the Buyid period, the Twelver ulamā' considered that since the Imām had gone into Occultation and his \"Nā'ib al-Khass\" was no longer present, all the functions invested in the Imām had lapsed. The principal functions of the Imām had been:\n\nHowever, it soon became apparent that the situation caused by the lapse of functions of the Hidden Imām was extremely impractical and left the Twelver Shī‘a community at a great disadvantage, with no leadership, no organization and no financial structure.\n\nAkhbaris contend that, over the course of the history of Twelver Shi'ism since the Occultation, Usuli ulama have progressively usurped more and more of the functions of the Hidden Imam. They distinguish five stages in this usurpation.\n\nAs early as the 5th century A.H. / 11th century CE, more than 150 years after the Occultation of the 12th Imām, Shaykhu t-Ta'ifa reinterpreted the doctrine to allow delegation of the Imām's judicial authority to those who had studied \"fiqh\". Although he implies in his writings that this function should only be undertaken by the ulama if there is no one else to do it.\n\nShaykhu t-Taifa considered the ulamā' the best agents of the donor to distribute religious taxes since they knew to whom it should be distributed. Nevertheless, individuals were free to do this themselves if they wished. He allowed \"fuqahā\"' to organize Friday prayers in absence of the Imām or his special representative.\n\nThe prominent Shī‘a scholars who rejected this thesis were:\n\nIt is to be noted that `Alam al-Huda was from among the Shaykhu t-Taifa's group.\n\nBy the 13th century, Muhaqqiq al-Hilli was able to advance these concepts very considerably. He extended the judicial role of the ulama to \"iqamat al-hudud\" the imposition of penalties by ulama themselves. In his writings it is possible to see the evolution in his thinking whereby the fuqahā' develop from the deputies of the donor for the distribution of religious taxes in his early writings to being the deputies of the Hidden Imām for collection and distribution of the taxes in his later works. In effect, transgressing the limits set by Shaykhu t-Taifa (two centuries earlier) in his first transgression.\n\nMuhaqqiq al-Karkhi (About 300 years after the second transgression) was the first to suggest, arguing from the hadith of ‘Umar ibn Hanzala, that the ulama were the \"Nā'ib al-'Amm\" (general representative) of the Hidden Imām. But he restricted his application of this argument to the assumption of the duty of leading Friday prayers.\n\nIt was Shahīd ath-Thānī who took the concept of Nā'ib al-'Amm to its logical conclusion in the religious sphere and applied it to all of the religious functions and prerogatives of the Hidden Imām. Thus the judicial authority of the ulamā' now became a direct reflection of the authority of the Imām himself. It was now obligatory to pay the religious taxes directly to the ulamā' as the trustees of the Imām for distribution and the donor who distributed these himself was considered to obtain no reward. This is in direct contradiction to limits set by prior transgressions.\n\nFurthermore, Shahīd ath-Thānī extended the range of those eligible to receive money from \"zakāt\" to include religious students and the ulamā' themselves, who thus became the recipients of the money as trustees of students. Even in the field of defensive \"jihād\", Shahīd ath-Thānī identified a role for the ulamā'. Only in the field of offensive jihād did he allow that the role of Hidden Imām had lapsed pending his return.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned scholars were not \"mujtahids\" in their full capacity, they introduced innovative concepts into Shī‘a theology which later formed the basis of the exegetical school. Their innovations were sharply criticized by prominent Shī‘a scholars of their time and thus, remained mostly theoretical.\n\nThe traditional Shī‘a doctrine was, by its nature, fatal to leadership of any regime except that of Imām al-Mahdi since they believed that an Islamic state can be established only under the leadership of an infallible Imām. Thus, the Shī‘a had little role to play in supporting the decisions of the state, in contrast with the Sunni tendency of offering their full support to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThis caused a great deal of paranoia to the states where the Shī‘a were in majority. By the end of Safavid era the situation had become intense due to the rise of imperialism on a global scale. It was necessary to develop an alternate ideology for the survival of Iranian state. This is when a group of ulamā' were encouraged to squeeze out the possibility of extending the state's control over the shia majority; by whatever means necessary.\n\nThe revival of Akhbārism, or \"neo-Akhbārism\" as it became known, was under the dean of Karbala scholarship, Yusuf Al Bahrani (1695–1772), who led an intellectual assault on Usuli thought in the mid-18th century. An Akhbārī critique of Usulism had emerged in Bahrain at the beginning of the 18th century, partly spurred by the weaknesses of the Usuli sponsoring Safavid empire. By succeeding to the role of dean of Karbala as one of the pre-eminent scholars of the age, al-Bahrani's extended this Bahrain-based debate to the rest of the Shī‘a world. \n\nUnder al-Bahrani, Usuli scholarship was considered impure but Bahrani was not politically influential, although his student, the famous Sheikh Al-Hurr al-Aamili in his book \"Amal al-amil\" writes \"He was a mountain and ocean of knowledge, No one from among the previous scholars preceded his knowledge or reached his status\". {Edit: This seems completely incorrect. The Al-Bahrani referred to in this quote is referring to Sayyid Hashim Al-Bahrani. However this article is relating it to another scholar; the previously mentioned Yusuf Bahraini, who died nearly a century after Sheikh Al-Hurr Aamili} It was Muhammad Baqir ibn Muhammad Akmal al-Wahid Bihbahani who challenged and defeated the Akhbaris and eventually became the most politically influential cleric in Karbala in 1772. Bihbahani's theology was not welcomed by the Akhbaris. Although this controversy had begun as a minor disagreement on a few points, it eventually grew into a bitter, vituperative dispute culminating in Bihbahani's declaration that the Akhbārīs were infidels(Kuffar). However, the dispute remained purely intellectual.\n\nAt first there was a large population of Akhbārī activists at the shrine cities of Iraq but it was Bihbahani who, at the end of the 18th century, reversed this and completely routed the Akhbārīs at Karbala and Najaf. South Iraq, Bahrain and a few cities in Iran such as Kirman remained Akhbārī strongholds for a few more decades but eventually the Usuli triumph was complete and only a handful of Shī‘a ulamā' remained Akhbārī to the present day.\n\nAfter the theological coup brought about by al-Wahid Bihbahani by military methods, the Usuli school became instrumental to the Iranian regime.\n\nDuring the first Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), Fath Ali Shah's son and heir, Abbas Mirza, who was conducting the campaign, turned to the new ulama and obtained from Shaykh Ja'far Kashif al-Ghita' and other eminent clerics in Najaf and Isfahan a declaration of jihad against the Russians, thus implicitly recognizing their authority to issue such a declaration – one of the functions of the Hidden Imām. Kashif al-Ghita used the opportunity to extract from the state acknowledgment of the ulama's right to collect the religious taxes of Khums.\"\n\nThis followed the pattern of other transgressions by overthrowing the limits of its prior (fourth) transgression.\n\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution, the Usūlī school has gained popularity among previously Akhbārī communities. Usuli clerical power reached its natural conclusion with control and domination of the state as promulgated through \"Vilayat al-Faqih\" under the authority of the Supreme Leader.\n\nAkhbārīs reject and even curse mujtahids. They practice this based on the last letter Imām Mahdi wrote to ‘Alī ibn Muhammad, fourth trusted follower of the Lesser Occultation. In the letter, Imām Zaman said:\n\nAkhbārīs claim that only the Imāms may be described as \"āyat Allah\"s (Ayatollahs, \"signs of God\") based on the \"Hadith-e-Tariq\", and that no one else has the right to ascribe this divine title to themselves. For example, the \"Hadith-i Tariq\" says: \nHistorically it was only in the early 19th century that ordinary \"mujtahids\" began to describe themselves as 'Ayatollahs.'\n\n\nAkhbārīs claim to follow Hadith directly, without the need for generalisation, or of finding the reason for the decision. This, according to Usulis, is a logical impossibility. Hadith takes the form of case law, that is to say the narration of decisions taken in a concrete situation. To \"follow\" such a decision one must know which features of the situation are or are not relevant to the decision, as exactly the same set of facts will never occur twice. Therefore, some degree of generalisation is unavoidable, even on the most literal view: the choice is simply between mechanical generalisation and intelligent generalisation.\n\nRegarding Islamic laws, there are various issues faced by Muslims in their daily lives. e.g. doubts in \"namāz\" and their corrections, conditions which invalidate a fast and the relevant compensations, rulings vis à vis correctness or incorrectness of various social and business practices e.g. Investing in Mutual Funds, Use of alcohol based perfumes and medicines, etc. Yet, Akhbaris say that the Imams mentioned general-rules that we may use to know the ruling of modern issues.\n\n\n\n"}

The work was first published in Italian at Florence in 1645 and 1646 in three folio volumes.\n\nAmong other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a navy in five rates (sizes) which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition.\n\nThe six-part work covered navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy, with 130 maps in two volumes (nos. 2 and 6) . Unlike the vast majority of his contemporaries, Dudley's maps are all his own and were not copied from other mapmakers. They have an instantly recognisable style, closer to the pre-17th-century manuscript portolan charts than the richly decorated maps of Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu.\n\nThe distinctive Baroque style of Dudley's charts is in part attributable to the elegant engraving of Antonio Francesco Lucini.\n\nLater map-makers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it remains unique in the annals of cartography. The engraving by Antonio Francesco Lucini, who stated that he spent 12 years and used 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates, is of exceptional quality, as is the calligraphy.\n\n\"Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza\" is a very large sea chart of southwest Africa from Cape Fria to Cape of Good Hope, including Tristan da Cunha.\n\n\"Carta Quarta Generale di Europa\", 1646 is one of the larger scale, generalised (Carta Generale) maps and shows the West coast of France, southward from La Rochelle, and the Northern coast of Spain. This is the least ornate of the styles adopted by Dudley with no adornment other than the cartouche and a compass rose and fairly plain calligraphy.\n\nFour additional maps represent the majority of the smaller scale, more specific (\"Carta Particolare\") maps and include sailing ships, notes on prevailing winds and currents and more stylised calligraphy.\n\n\"Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia\", 1646. According to Tooley, this map is the first separately printed map of Australia and is consequently of great value. It shows, in addition to the west side of the Cape York peninsula, much of the island of New Guinea. By labelling the Torres Strait \"Golfo Incognito\" Dudley leaves open the question of whether New Guinea is connected to the Southern continent.\n\n\"Carta Particolare della Rio d' Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan\" of 1646 shows the mouth of the Amazon River.\n\n\"Carta particolare che comincia con l' Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome...Clara e finisce con Il c. d' Aldeas\". This map of the shoreline of the African Congo includes an elegant cartouche, and islands off the coastline.\n\n\"Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco\" reveals a strip of the southern Brazil coastline and includes São Paulo and the area later to become Rio de Janeiro. Noted for some of the most peculiar representations of mountains near the coastline found on any Dudley map.\n\nFrench Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil.\n\nThe seventh map is one of only two in the atlas which have no title but instead dedications to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and, in this case, the Grand Duchess, Dudley's patrons. This is another double page map and probably comes from the 1646 edition. These two maps are probably different because they are the only ones where Dudley was able to use his own observations as they cover the North East coast of South America, the area he visited in 1594. This map shows the coasts of French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Considerably more elaborate than the others, this map includes soundings and numerous illustrations, namely: two ships, a canoe, two magnificent sea monsters, a (?) cougar and two natives. It also has a legend stating that Monoa – more often known as El Dorado is only 12 days journey up-river from the coast.\n\n\n"}

However, it is missing some topics, such as geocoding, and has significant granularity issues: large, mature subfields such as surveying, GPS, and remote sensing are covered in small sections, while the relatively immature field of geocomputation is granted an entire knowledge area. There is also opposition to the document as a whole, especially from the critical GIS community, on the grounds that the discipline is too diverse and too subjective to be so easily encapsulated. The editors have acknowledged these shortcomings, and have expressed hope that wider input on future editions will solve some of these issues.\n\nThe \"GISTBoK\" is intended to be used in a variety of applications, including curriculum design, educational assessment, educational program accreditation, professional certification, hiring practices, and project RFP's. All of these activities are elements of the current trend toward regulation and standardization of the geospatial professions, and much of the opposition to the \"Body of Knowledge\" comes from those opposed to this trend, especially in academia, who feel that GIS&T is too diverse, interdisciplinary, and subjective to be regulated. One counterargument to this opposition is that the body of knowledge approach enables a flexible form of regulation that accommodates a diversity of skills and viewpoints.\n\nThe \"GISTBoK\" is patterned after the Computing Curricula project of the Association for Computing Machinery, and other model curriculum projects. It is essentially a hierarchical outline, composed of Knowledge Areas, broken down into Units, further divided into Topics.

{"id": "4163345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4163345", "title": "Government House, Sydney", "text": "Government House, Sydney\n\nThe Government House is the vice-regal residence of the Governor of New South Wales, Australia, located on Conservatorium Road in the Sydney central business district adjacent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, overlooking Sydney Harbour, just south of the Sydney Opera House. Constructed between 1837 and 1843, the property has been the vice-regal residence of the Governor since Sir George Gipps, except for two brief periods; the first between 1901 and 1914, when the property was leased to the Commonwealth of Australia as the residence of the Governor-General of Australia, and the second from 1996 to 2011.\n\nThe property was returned as the Governor's residence in October 2011 and was managed by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales from March 1996 to December 2013. Completed in 1847 and constructed in the Gothic revival style, the building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.\n\nIn 1835 the British Government agreed that a new Government House in Sydney had become a necessity, and the royal architect, Edward Blore, was instructed to draw up plans. Construction commenced in 1837 and was supervised by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis and Colonel Barney of the Royal Engineers. Stone, cedar, and marble for the construction were obtained from various areas of New South Wales. A ball in honour of the birthday of Queen Victoria was held in the new building in 1843, although construction was not complete. The first resident, Governor George Gipps, did not move in until 1845.\n\nGovernment House, with its setting on Sydney Harbour, has a garden area of and is located south of the Sydney Opera House, overlooking Farm Cove. It was designed in a romantic Gothic revival stylecastellated, crenellated, turreted and is decorated with oil portraits and the coats of arms of its successive occupants. Additions have included a front portico in 1873, an eastern verandah in 1879 and extensions to the ballroom and governor's study in 1900–01. From 1845 until 1901, the building served as the Governor's residence, office and official reception space.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1914, the building was used to house the new role of Governor-General, created by the Federation of Australia. During this period, three Governors of New South Wales occupied \"Cranbrook\", namely Harry Rawson, Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford and Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland.\n\nIn 1913, the decision was taken to establish a residence for the Governor-General at Admiralty House.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1996, the building again served as the residence, office and official reception space for the Governor of New South Wales.\n\nHowever, in 1996, at the direction of the then Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the property ceased to be used as a residence, and the Governor's day office was relocated to the historic Chief Secretary's building nearby, at 121 Macquarie Street. On 16 January 1996 Carr announced that the next Governor, Gordon Samuels, would not live or work at Government House. On these changes, Carr said \"The Office of the Governor should be less associated with pomp and ceremony, less encumbered by anachronistic protocol, more in tune with the character of the people\". Carr later quipped that his decision had been \"for Jack Lang\", referring to the Premier of a former state Labor Government that was dismissed by a Governor, Philip Game, in 1932 during a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe state's longest-serving Governor, Sir Roden Cutler, was also reported as saying: \nThis move generated further controversy, as the proclaimed cost savings of over $2 million never materialised. The Auditor-General found it cost $600,000 more to maintain the building without a resident Governor; and public attendance decreased (resident Governors had maintained public access during their tenures). This led the group Australians for Constitutional Monarchy to organise a protest, resulting in one of the largest marches in Sydney history: a crowd of 15,000 protested outside Parliament House, blocking Macquarie Street. On the day before Gordon Samuels' swearing-in, a petition bearing 55,000 signatures was handed in, calling on the Premier to reconsider. During the hiatus of resident governor, Government House was consistently used for vice-regal purposes and remained the official reception space of the state, including as a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007 in September 2007, at which time the political leaders of the 21 member states of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation met.\n\nIn October 2011, the then Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that the then Governor, Marie Bashir, had agreed with O'Farrell's offer to move back into Government House: \"A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That's what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas\". However, because Government House has not been a residence for fifteen years, O'Farrell also announced that the Governor will initially move into a smaller adjacent building, called the chalet, while refurbishments of the main wing occur, with a proposed move into the main house \"before Christmas\". From December 2013, management of Government House was returned to the Office of the Governor from the managers since 1996, the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.\n\nMuch of the 19th century character of the grounds remains. The grounds include private gardens as well as formal open areas. Near the house (on its south-east side) is a giant Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), planted soon after the house's construction was completed. This tree is the surviving one of a former pair which stood either side of the terrace. The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shurbs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial & Victorian heritage.\n\nThe garden maintains a distinctly 19th century character, drawing on Regency and Italianate styles, and featuring a collection of native and exotic species. Most changes to the garden were at the initiative of past governors and their wives, including Denison's five acre vegetable garden and Lady Game's much-loved project, the \"Spring Walk\". Some areas of the garden are true to their 19th century design, while others are more modern. Thoutsands of visitors enjoy the garden every year, both as public visitors and guests at functions ranging from garden parties for Royal visits, open days, award ceremonies and charity events. The garden is a crucial part of Government House - chef Christine Ware regularly sources honey (the current governor keeps bees), herbs and flowers for food servced at functions. Florist Marjan Medhat has also been known to use flowers and natural ephemera from the grounds in her floral displays, alongside potted plants grown in the greenhouse.\n\nThe first private garden - the Western Terrace - sits around a rocky outcrop and knoll and features an extensive sandstone wall and plantings of olive trees.\n\nLies inside the entrance gates to the left of the drive. This is the oldest part of the garden, established when the house was being built (1836-45)to provide screening and privacy for the house. The evergreen trees planted here - many of them native species - were chosen to block out \"disagreeable scenery\", but the large two-level terrace also functioned as a pleasure garden. The original sandstone walls, some of the gravel paths and plantings of olive trees and hedges survive. An evergreen or southern magnolia or bull bay (M. grandiflora) dating from the 1859s is at the northern end of the terrace. The terrace was restored in 2000 by Sydney Living Museums (fmr. Historic Houses Trust of NSW).\n\nThe eastern terrace's design was laid out in 1869 and remains the main feature of the garden. From the house's arcade (colonnade) you can view across bisecting pathways lined with flowerbeds to a view of Sydney Harbour. Through Cook's pines (Araucaria columnaris) and other trees you can see Fort Denison, Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Garden Island and beyond. Originally the view was wider to the east including towards the heads of the harbour). The Eastern Terrace has a central sandstone pond with its original stone fountain. Various garden schemes have been installed in the eastern terrace's formal garden borders flanking the central path.\n\nNorth of the Eastern Terrace is the palm grove, established in the 1870s for the Countess of Belmore, wife of the 13th governor. Here native and exotic palms including the Lord Howe Island's Kentia (Howea fosteriana) and curly (H.belmoreana)(named for the governor) can be found.\n\nGovernor and Lady Game were both keen gardeners and Lady Game \"set out to produce an outstanding array of trees, shrubs and planters\". She established the Spring Walk on the southern end of the Eastern Terrace, where she supplemented surviving 19th century Camellia japonica cv's with new plantings of modern varieties. Surviving very old camellias include C.j.'Cleopatra Rosea' (pink) and \"Wellbankiana\" (white), some of which are over 100 years old. Wife of Governor Game's private secretary, writer Ethel Anderson, had this to say about Lady Game's garden:\n'under the grey green olives, late daffodils still star the grass. Watsonias, double cheeries, magnolias, spieas, purple eupatoriums and primulas, set in a spring border among standard white wisterias form, like a sea... Lady Game's border - so lovely with pomegranites, bougainvilleas, cistus and Madonna lilies - keeps its date with beauty.' The entrance stones to the Spring Walk are said to be convict-made blocks from the first Government House built for Arthur Philip, now the site of the Museum of Sydney. Like many houses of the time, Government House was self sufficient with kitchen gardens, orchards and farm animals. The kitchen garden is now part of the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\nTo the west of the driveway is a large paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendra) and peppermint (Eucalyptus nicholli) planted by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1954 during the first visit of a reigning monarch to Australia. Many of the garden's trees are ceremonial plnatings. Among the roses on the Eastern Terrace the \"Dame Marie Bashir Rose\" can be found (bred in that Governor's honour), as well as the \"Governor Macquarie\" rose Dame Dr Bashir planted in 2009 as patron of the Rose Society of New South Wales. Dame Marie Bashir was just one of the many governors past and present wiht a passion for plants and their pollinators.\n\nOne of two Gothic style buildings to have survived around Government House. It is a copy of a gurad house at Windsor Castle.\n\nBrick gatehouse replacing an earlier timber one.\n\nDesigned by Colonial Architect W. L. Vernon, the chalet breaks with the Gothic style of Government House. However, it has Tudor Gothic elements such as half timbered gables and broad brick chimneys.\n\nGovernment House is a Gothic Revival two storey building with crenellated battlements, turrets, detailed interiors, extensive cellars and a porte cochere at the entrance. An open cloister on the east elevation forms a verandah room which is supported by Gothic arches and forms an open balcony above. The ground floor contains twelve rooms and the first floor contains thirteen bedrooms. It is built of stone with a slate roof, timber floors, unpainted cedar joinery and a stone flagged verandah. There are extensive staff offices and quarters.\n\nA collection of moveable heritage noted in theHistoric Houses Collection inventory as being of high and exceptional significance are also included in the State Heritage Listing. Item of exceptional significnace are those deemed to be rare or oustanding and of major cultural or historic significance to NSW and Australia. Such items have a documented provenance to NSW Governors, their families and entourages from 1845 to the early 20th Century or with the first five Governors-General of Australia between 1901 and 1915. Items of high significance are objects considered to be rare or unusual and to have a cultural or historic significance to NSW. These objects date from 1845 through to the present and may contribute to the understanding of the house occupant s and use or through their connection to artists, architects, craftsmen or suppliers associated with the construction and decoration of Government House.\n\nAs at 27 August 2014, the physical condition is excellent; and the archaeological potential is good. The whole assembly is relatively intact within its 1915-17 boundaries - including house, garden, gatehouse, Chalet, courtyards, garages, greenhouses etc - and can show the development of the site and the management and workings of Government House.\n\n\nAs at 28 March 2013, Government House built in the early 1840s as the home of the monarch's representative and as the seat of power, symbolised British authority in the colony. Like the Governors themselves, the house is a powerful symbol of state.\n\nFrom the time of its completion, the house and its occupants were seen as the \"pinnacle\" of society, and the Governor and family as social exemplars, ideas that continued well into the twentieth century. Home to twenty four governors of New South Wales and their families, and the first five Governors-General, all chosen for their various pre-eminent positions, it reflects the many changes that have taken place in public and private life. Guests and visitors ranged from citizens paying their respects or receiving awards, to the reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, other members of the Royal family and other heads of states.\n\nThe finest example of a castellated Gothic house in Australia, the house with its landscaped gardens reflected its English ties and was the model that inspired others. It is a grand ensemble of buildings, gardens and contents whose history and use are richly documented. Developments to the place over 150 years demonstrate changing tastes and social attitudes, and showcase the talents of leading architects, artists and craftsmen.\n\nLocated in Governor Phillip's domain, it provides a tangible link with the earliest years of the colony, and is associated with the development of significant public places such as the Conservatorium (formerly its stables), Royal Botanic Gardens (formerly its grounds), and the Opera House.\n\nGovernment House in Sydney is significant as one of the two original official residences selected for the Governor-General following the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. Rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria led the Commonwealth Government to designate Government House in Sydney and Melbourne Government House as official residences of equal status for the Governor-General. The Sydney Government House served as the governor-general's Sydney Residence until 1912 when the NSW government sparked a major controversy by effectively evicting the governor-general. The place is significant for its association with the first five occupants of the high office of Governor-General from the time of federation until 1912.\n\nA rare example of a great harbourside landscape estate virtually intact. A typical 19th century 3-part estate landscape of park, parterre and pleasure grounds. The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shrubs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial and Victorian heritage\n\nIt is perhaps the last of the great harbourside estates to have survived relatively intact and to still be carrying on its original function; a combination of private residence, office complex and official function venue. The garden is one of the oldest continually maintained gardens in Australia. Whilst it has been altered to some extent over the years, it nevertheless provides an appropriately grand setting for the house.\n\nThe heritage significance of Government House at a State level is enhanced by the extraordinarily rich and diverse collection of moveable heritage ranging from furniture, paintings, ceramics, glassware textiles and sculpture to garden ornaments and kitchenalia dating back to the 1820s. It is a rare and intact collection of items with a ongoing and continuous association with the vice regal function and clearly demonstrates 150 years of changing style and taste. The collection is inherently linked to the house (and specific locations in the house). The comprehensive collection of portraits of NSW governors contains one of the earliest official portraits to be commissioned in NSW and Australia, that of Governor Thomas Brisbane by Augustus Earle. The collection of colonial furniture is significant and contains the most extensive collection of furniture by noted craftsman Andrew Lenham between 1845 and 1860 as well as furniture and other objects associated with colonial and international exhibitions and demonstrate excellence in local design, manufacturing and materials.\n\nGovernment House, Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 December 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThis site replaced the original government house in 1845 as the seat of power and the symbol of the Crown and British authority in the colonial period. It was the seat of executive power under the constitution of New South Wales from 1856-1901 and 1915-1996. It can demonstrate its changing role as the seat of executive power, the residence of the Governors of New South Wales, and as an important place of State ceremony.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nThe site has close associations with the many Governors and Governors General who have resided there as well as the many international heads of state who have visited and stayed there. As the seat of British authority in NSW and Australia, Government House is significant for its important association with the British royalty, especially those who have been accommodated at the house including Prince Albert (who after being shot was treated and nursed back to health in the Drawing Room of Government House), the Queen Mother, the Prince of Wales, Charles and his late wife Diana, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and most importantly, the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions. The historic significance of Government House is also enhanced through its association with those involved in its design and construction: Edward Blore, an eminent British architect who completed the original design of the house; Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis who adapted these plans to suit Australian conditions; James Barney who designed and supervised significant repairs and alterations to the house; and Walter Liberty Vernon who was also responsible for significant additions and repairs.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe quality of Edward Blore's design and detailing, and the degree to which his intent was realised in the finished house, resulted in a unique building for the colony. It remains the finest example of a castellated Gothic House in Australia. The Gothic style of the house and the character of its landscaped gardens were perceived to be quintessentially English and calculated to maintain the emotional ties between a distant colony and the motherland. It served as an inspiration for other Gothic buildings in Sydney including harbourside villas, and was also a model for the unrealisd Government House in Hobart. Furthermore, it was an impetus for the Gothic revival in Australia. The construction of such a large and sophisticated building was a major technical acievement for the time. It had a seminal influence in raising the standards of building and craftsmanship in the colony. The additions to the house by James Barnet and Walter. L.Vernon between 1870 and 1902, were notable examples of the later Victorian Gothic revival style. The Chalet is a fine example of an Arts and Crafts inspired style of domestic architecture and a forerunner of the Australian Federation style of the early 20th century.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe house was seen as a pinnacle of society and the roll of Governor as social \"exemplar\", ideas that continued well into the 20th century. The place can demonstrate the changing emphasis in the selection of Governor; from military, to career administrators, to aristocrats. By the end of the 19th century the role was perceived to be more social than political, and post-war Australian Governors were installed into this esteemed position. At each stage in its history, Government House was a place of work for personnel involved in the business of the Governor, in domestic service, in securing the site, or in the keeping of the grounds, most being resident on the site. The role of domestic servants, and later domestic staff, continued until the mid 1990s, well after such service had become anachronistic in most other great houses in Australia.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nGovernment House demonstrates at a high level the design, layout, construction techniques and finishes of a colonial grand house in the Gothic style as well as that of an early colonial harbour-side estate charged with the carriage of viceregal functions including symbolic functions of authority in polity and society. The ensemble of House, outbuildings and gardens can demonstrate the development of the site and its functions from the colonial period to today. The Government house interiors as they have evolved from the 1840s reflect the development of taste and style over 170 years. The Government House garden has the archaeological potential to provide information on early roads and drives and terrace arrangements. The important interiors (such as the Lyon and Cottier wall Drawing Room ceilings and hand painted cloth panels) and the extensive moveable heritage collection (including the collection of Colonial Australian furniture, portraits of Governors, and some of the more recent furnishings and fittings) demonstrate 150 years of changing style and taste.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nIt is a rare surviving example where the original and early planning remains relatively intact and demonstrates the prevailing social order and domestic arrangements of the \"place\".\n\n\n"}

His adoptive father was of Greek descent. He started taking dance, acrobatics and gymnastics classes at 18 months, after witnessing his sister's classes and attempting to join in. By the age of three, he was practicing daily and was competing and giving public performances. For the next few years, he regularly competed, and performed at various places including nursing homes and the local naval base. As a child, he was diagnosed with asthma and allergies, so to help with the conditions, he was encouraged to continue the dance and gymnastics classes. He also took up trampolining, and at the age of nine began diving lessons after the family got a swimming pool. He attended Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California, Valhalla High School in El Cajon, California, as well as Mission Viejo High School, in Mission Viejo. In 1978, he joined the University of Miami where he studied theater. In 1981, he transferred to the University of California, Irvine, where in 1983 he graduated with a major in drama and a minor in dance.\n\nAs a Junior Olympic competitor, Louganis caught the eye of Sammy Lee, two-time Olympic champion, who began coaching him. At sixteen Louganis took part in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where he placed second in the tower event, behind Italian sport legend Klaus Dibiasi. Two years later, with Dibiasi retired, Louganis won his first world title in the same event with the help of coach Ron O'Brien.\n\nLouganis was a favorite for two golds in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, but an American boycott of the games prevented him from participating. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal years later. Louganis won two titles at the world championships in 1982, where he became the first diver in a major international meeting to get a perfect score of 10 from all seven judges. At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, with record scores and leads over his opponents, Louganis won gold medals in both the springboard and tower diving events.\n\nHe won two more world championship titles in 1986.\n\nAt the 1988 Seoul Olympics, his head struck the springboard during the preliminary rounds, leading to a concussion. He completed the preliminaries despite his injury. He then earned the highest single score of the qualifying round for his next dive and repeated the dive during the finals, earning the gold medal by a margin of 25 points. In the 10m finals, he won the gold medal, performing a 3.4 difficulty dive in his last attempt, earning 86.70 points for a total of 638.61, surpassing silver medalist Xiong Ni by only 1.14 points. His comeback earned him the title of ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" \"Athlete of the Year\" for 1988.\n\nLouganis had been a theatre major in college, and in the late 1980s and 1990s, Louganis acted in several movies, including \"Touch Me\" in 1997.\n\nIn 1993, he played the role of Darius in an Off-Broadway production of the play \"Jeffrey\". In 1995, he starred for six weeks in the Off-Broadway production of Dan Butler's one man-show about gay life, \"The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me\", taking over from Butler himself. In the play he portrayed 14 different characters.\n\nIn 2008 he appeared in the film \"Watercolors,\" in the role of Coach Brown, a swimming instructor in a high school.\n\nIn 2012, he appeared in the penultimate episode of the second season of IFC's comedy \"Portlandia\", playing himself.\n\nAfter retiring from diving, Louganis began to compete in dog agility competitions; he has said that being around the dogs gave him \"a sense of security, company and unconditional love\". His dogs have included Dr. Schivago; Captain Woof Blitzer; Nipper and son, Dobby, both champion Jack Russell terriers; Gryff (Gryffindor), a border collie; and Hedwig, a Hungarian Puli. Nipper was named for the RCA dog, while Gryff, Dobby and Hedwig were named for Harry Potter characters, as Louganis is a self-described \"huge Harry Potter fan.\"\n\nSince November 2010, Louganis has been coaching divers of a wide range of ages and abilities in the SoCal Divers Club in Fullerton, California. He was a mentor to the US diving team at the London 2012 Olympics and the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1989, Louganis was in a romantic relationship with his manager, R. James \"Jim\" Babbitt. Louganis has described the relationship as abusive, saying that at one point in 1983, Babbitt raped him at knifepoint. Louganis also accused Babbitt of taking 80% of Louganis's earnings.\n\nSix months before the 1988 Olympics, Louganis was diagnosed with HIV; he had contracted the disease from Babbitt. His doctor placed him on the antiretroviral drug AZT, which he took every four hours round-the-clock.\n\nIn 1989, Louganis obtained a restraining order against Babbitt. Babbitt died of AIDS in 1990.\n\nFor his 33rd birthday in 1993, Louganis held a \"final birthday party\" for family and friends, as a way to say goodbye; he was in failing health and thought he would die of AIDS soon.\n\nLouganis publicly came out as gay in a pre-taped announcement shown at the opening ceremony of the 1994 Gay Games, having been persuaded to do so by Gay Games organizers. Even before then, he led what has been described as \"an openly gay life\".\n\nIn 1995 he announced that he was HIV-positive, around the time of the release of his memoir, \"Breaking the Surface\". In a 1995 interview with Barbara Walters, Louganis spoke publicly for the first time about being gay and HIV-positive.\n\nLouganis announced his engagement to his partner, paralegal Johnny Chaillot, in \"People\" magazine, in June 2013. The two were married on October 12, 2013.\n\nAfter his announcement, people in and out of the international diving community began to question Louganis's decision not to disclose his HIV status at the time of his head injury during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, given that he bled into a pool that others then dove into. Louganis has stated that, during the ordeal, he was \"paralyzed with fear\" that he would infect another competitor, or the doctor who treated him. Ultimately, no one was infected.\n\nExperts maintain that the incident posed no risk to others. The blood was diluted by thousands of gallons of water, and \"chlorine kills HIV\", said John Ward, chief of HIV-AIDS surveillance at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also, skin is a very effective barrier to HIV. Only a diver with an open wound would face any risk. \"If the virus just touches the skin, it is unheard of for it to cause infection: the skin has no receptors to bind HIV,\" explained Anthony Fauci.\n\nLouganis is a gay rights activist, as well as an HIV awareness advocate. He has worked frequently with the Human Rights Campaign to defend the civil liberties of the LGBT community and people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn the October/November 2010 issue of \"ABILITY\" Magazine, Louganis stated that the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy was \"absurd,\" \"unconstitutional,\" and a \"witch-hunt.\" He added that \"gay men and women have been serving this country for years … [it's] basically encouraging people who are serving our country to lie to each other.\"\n\nLouganis recounted his story in 1996 in a best-selling autobiography, \"Breaking the Surface\", co-written with Eric Marcus. In the book, Louganis detailed a relationship of domestic abuse and rape as well as teenage depression, and how he began smoking and drinking at a young age. The book spent five weeks at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nIn 1999, Louganis also co-wrote the book \"For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health\" with Betty Sicora Siino.\n\nLouganis also produced a video diary called \"Looking to the Light\", which picked up where \"Breaking the Surface\" left off.\n\nIn September 2000, he appeared on \"Hollywood Squares\" as a member of famous Olympic gold medalists \"Dream Team,\" competing in a special week of the nationally syndicated game show series, broadcast as a tribute to the 2000 Summer Games. The episodes marked the first time that all these champions came together for this kind of television competition.\nLouganis was Dive Master in the ABC Celebrity TV Diving show \"Splash\", and the Judge on \"Celebrity Splash!\" which aired on Channel 7 in Australia.\n\nLouganis's 1984 and 1988 Olympic victories were covered in Bud Greenspan's documentaries about the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics, both titled \"16 Days of Glory\".\n\nLouganis's memoir \"Breaking the Surface\" was adapted as the 1997 USA Network TV movie \"\" with Mario Lopez playing the lead and Louganis narrating.\n\nActor Michael Fassbender took Louganis's gait and mannerisms as inspiration for his portrayal of an advanced humanoid robot in the 2012 film \"Prometheus\", stating that \"Louganis was my first inspiration. I figured that I'd sort of base my physicality roughly around him, and then it kind of went from there.\"\n\nIn the first episode of season 3 of the popular TV series Castle, the medical examiner describes a victim who had fallen from a window as having done \"a Greg Louganis out that window up there\".\n\nLouganis was the subject of the documentary \"Back on Board\" which aired on HBO on Tuesday, August 4, 2015.\n\nHe was the subject of a short documentary, \"Thicker than Water\", which appeared on the ESPN.com website as part of their \"30 for 30 Shorts\" series on December 1, 2015. The documentary covered Louganis's ordeal, and ultimate triumph, at the 1988 Olympics.\n\nIn 1984, Louganis received the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States.\n\nIn June 2013, Louganis was inducted into the California Sports Hall of Fame. He was among the first class of inductees into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame on August 2, 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Louganis was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for his contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.\n\nHe was a 2015 World Games Special Olympics torch bearer in Los Angeles (July 2015). In 2016, he was selected as a Grand Marshal of the 2017 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.\n\nLouganis got few endorsement deals after his 1984 and 1988 Olympic victories, his one major deal being Speedo, a partnership which lasted until 2007. Some of his fellow athletes blamed homophobia for his lack of deals, since he had been rumored to be gay even before he came out. Louganis has stated that he suspects that his sexuality played a part, although he feels that in part he was simply overshadowed in the public imagination by other American Olympians, most notably Mary Lou Retton.\n\nIn 2016, Louganis was pictured on boxes of Wheaties cereal, where prominent American athletes are famously featured, as part of a special \"Legends\" series that also included 1980s Olympians Janet Evans and Edwin Moses. This occurred approximately a year after a change.org petition was launched that requested that he be featured, although General Mills denied any influence from the petition.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Guggenheim Foundation identifies and works with artists, curators and educators from South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invites one curator from the chosen region to the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum in New York City for a two-year curatorial residency, where he or she works with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organize international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities. The Foundation acquires these artworks for its permanent collection and includes them as the focus of exhibitions that open at the museum in New York and subsequently travel to two other cultural institutions or other venues around the world. The Foundation supplements the exhibitions with a series of public and online programs, and supports cross-cultural exchange and collaboration between staff members of the institutions hosting the exhibitions. UBS is reportedly contributing more than $40 million to the project to pay for its activities and the art acquisitions. Foundation director Richard Armstrong commented: \"We are hoping to challenge our Western-centric view of art history.\"\n\nThe first exhibition, \"No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia\" is curated by June Yap. Yap has worked for six years in the curatorial departments of modern and contemporary art museums, including the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum.

The initial idea of recreating \"Endeavour\" for use as a museum ship was generated during the establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum in the 1980s; the vessel would be funded by the Bond Corporation, and gifted to the nation on completion. A specialist shipyard, complete with viewing platform and guided tours for the public, was set up, and construction of the vessel commenced in 1988. Two years later, work stopped because the Bond Corporation hit financial trouble; a Japanese company, the Yoshiya Corporation, stepped in, but was also forced to withdraw support because of financial problems.\n\nVolunteers maintained the incomplete vessel until the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation was established as a charitable trust in 1991. The \"Endeavour\" replica was launched at the end of 1993, and completed in 1994. After sea trials, the replica sailed from Fremantle to Sydney, where she arrived at the end of 1994. During 1995, the ship recreated Cook's voyage along eastern Australia, then visited New Zealand at the end of the year. In late 1996, the \"Endeavour\" replica set out on a circumnavigation of the world, visiting ports in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and North America, before returning to New Zealand in late 1999. The vessel returned to Sydney in mid-2000. In 2001, the replica was used for filming of the BBC documentary \"The Ship\", then sailed to England in 2002. She spent the next two years visiting ports in the United Kingdom and Europe, before sailing back to Sydney in 2005, completing a second round-the-world voyage. On arrival in Australia, the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation transferred ownership of the vessel to the Australian National Maritime Museum.\n\nDuring 2011 and 2012, the replica circumnavigated Australia.\n\nThe idea of building a replica of \"Endeavour\" was first mooted by the trustees of the under-construction Australian National Maritime Museum. The vessel would serve as the centrepiece of the museum ship fleet. Funding for construction was provided by the Bond Corporation, with the completed replica to be presented as the company's gift to Australia for the nation's bicentenary. Construction was organised through a subsidiary company, Endeavour Replica Pty Ltd. A specialist shipyard was established at Fremantle Fishing Boat Harbour; a viewing gallery allowed visitors to observe the replica's construction, and volunteer guides ran tours through the shipyard. Recreation of the vessel was not problematic, as the original \"Endeavour\" had been surveyed multiple times by the Royal Navy, particularly during her conversion from a cargo collier to a ship of exploration, and these records had been retained by the British National Maritime Museum.\n\nConstruction of the vessel started in January 1988, with the keel laid in October. In 1990, Bond Corporation was forced to stop work on the project because of financial difficulties. The Japanese Yoshiya Corporation joined the project, but withdrew six months later, again, because of financial problems. The volunteer complement were able to keep the shipyard ticking over for another eight months. In order to complete and operate the vessel, the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation was set up as a charitable trust in August 1991, with the Bond and Yoshiya Corporations donating their equity in the project. A combination of funding from the Australian government, loans, and donations allowed work on the ship to continue. The \"Endeavour\" replica was launched on 9 December 1993, and completed on 16 April 1994.\nThe \"Endeavour\" replica was assembled using traditional shipbuilding methods and materials where possible, although some changes were made to meet modern safety standards and enhance the longevity of the replica. The vessel's hull is built from jarrah, with Oregon pine also used above the waterline: although oak and elm were used in the original ship, the decision was made not to use these as they were more susceptible to rotting. Although some of the wood was fresh-cut, much of it was salvaged from demolished buildings and bridges, or taken from trees felled during construction work or storms. The \"Endeavour\" replica is square-rigged with 25 sails made from duradon, giving a sail area of between , including of studding sails. The ship is long from bowsprit to stern, has a beam of , a draught of , and a mainmast height of . Auxiliary propulsion is provided by two Caterpillar 3046 B diesel engines, which provide . Most of the \"20th century\" equipment, including the diesel engines, a powered galley, and navigational equipment, is sited in what was the hold on the original \"Endeavour\", keeping the upper decks in their 18th century condition.\n\nThe \"Endeavour\" replica spent six months undergoing sea trials and operating around Fremantle before sailing around southern Australia to Sydney. Departing in October, the ship made numerous port visits along the southern and eastern coasts before arriving in December. She was placed on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum.\n\nFrom April until September 1995, the replica recreated the original \"Endeavour\"s voyage up the east coast of Australia, then made a three-month visit to New Zealand from November 1995 to January 1996. After this, the ship returned to Fremantle via ports in Victoria and South Australia. In October 1996, the replica sailed for England via South Africa, arriving in March 1997. After spending the rest of the year visiting British ports, the ship arrived in Florida in March 1998, and visited 31 ports along both the east and west coasts of North America during 1998 and 1999. The \"Endeavour\" replica sailed from Vancouver to New Zealand via Hawaii, and reached Wellington in late December 1999, having circumnavigated the globe. The ship spent five months in New Zealand waters before sailing to Sydney in May 2000.\nDuring 2001, \"Endeavour\" embarked a BBC film crew and recreated Cook's voyage between Cairns and Jakarta for filming of the documentary series \"The Ship\". After a major refit in Fremantle during late 2001 and early 2002, the replica sailed in February for a second round-the-world voyage. The ship sailed to Whitby via Cape Horn; wave footage shot while rounding the cape was later used for digitally composited scenes in the 2003 film \"\". She spent most of the next two years on display, either in Whitby, or during visits to ports in the United Kingdom and Europe.\n\nThe replica left England in 2004, and returned to Australia via the Caribbean, Panama Canal, Galapagos, Tahiti, and New Zealand. She reached Sydney at sunset on 17 April 2005, after having run aground a few hours earlier in Botany Bay. On arrival, ownership of the vessel was transferred from the HM Bark Endeavour Foundation to the Australian National Maritime Museum.\n\nIn mid-April 2011, \"Endeavour\" sailed from Sydney on her first circumnavigation of Australia. The counter-clockwise voyage around the continent ended in May 2012, with fifteen ports visited and sailed.\n\nIn October 2013 \"Endeavour\" participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its subject coverage includes astronomy, electronics, communications, computers and computing, computer science, control engineering, electrical engineering, information technology, physics, manufacturing, production and mechanical engineering. Now, due to emerging concept of technology for business, Inspec also includes information technology for business in its portfolio. Inspec indexed few journals publishing high quality research by integrating technology into management, economics and social sciences domains. The sample journals include Annual Review of Financial Economics, Aslib Journal of Information Management, Australian Journal of Management and, International Journal of Management, Economics and Social Sciences.\n\nInspec was started in 1967 as an outgrowth of the \"Science Abstracts\" service. The electronic records were distributed on magnetic tape. In the 1980s, it was available in the U.S. through the Knowledge Index, a low-priced dial-up version of the Dialog service for individual users, which made it popular. For nearly 50 years, the IET has employed scientists to manually review items to be included in Inspec, hand-indexing the literature using their own expertise of the subject area and make a judgement call about which terms and classification codes should be applied. Thanks to this work, a significant thesaurus has been developed which enables content to be indexed far more accurately and in context, which in turn helps end-users discover relevant literature that may otherwise have remained hidden from typical search queries, making Inspec an essential tool for prior art, patentability searches and patent drafting. \nAccess to Inspec is currently by the Internet through \"Inspec Direct\" and various resellers.\n\nInspec has several print counterparts:\n\n\nComputer and Control Abstracts ( Frequency: 12 per year) covers computers and computing, and information technology.\n\nElectrical and Electronics Abstracts ( Frequency: 12 per year) covers all topics in telecommunications, electronics, radio, electrical power and optoelectronics. Printed indexes by subject, author and other indexes, and a subject guide are produced twice per year.\n\nPhysics Abstracts ( Frequency: 24 per year) is an abstracting and indexing service first published by the Institution of Electrical Engineers. It was first circulated as \"Science Abstracts\", volume 1 through volume 5 from 1898 to 1902. From 1903 to 1971 the database had different titles. These closely related names were \"Science Abstracts. Section A, Physics\" and \"Science Abstracts. Section A, Physics Abstracts\" from volume 6 to volume 74.\n\nBy 1972 other societies were associated as authors of this service such as the American Institute of Physics. In 1975 or 1976 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers also became an author. By 1980 this database was also issued as INSPEC-Physics on various formats. It was also available as part of INSPEC database. Presently it is part of \"Inspec, Section A - Physics\" database. At the same time, the \"Physics Abstracts\" title was employed throughout the 1990s.\n\nThe science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, with a B.S. degree (physics and mathematics honors) (King's college), was an assistant editor for \"Physics Abstracts\" from 1949–1951. This position allowed Clarke to access to \"all of the world’s leading scientific journals.\"\n\nThe first issue of \"Science Abstracts\" was published in January 1898. During that first year, a total of 1,423 abstracts were published at monthly intervals, and at the end of the year an author and subject index were added. The first issue contained 110 abstracts and was divided into 10 sections:\n\n\n\"Science Abstracts\" was the result of a joint collaboration between the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) and The Physical Society of London. The publication was (at that time) provided without charge to all members of both societies. The cost of the publication was mainly borne by the IEE and The Physical Society. Financial contributions were also received from the Institution of Civil Engineers, The Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science\n\nBy 1902, the annual number of abstracts published had increased to 2,362. By May 1903 it was decided to split the publication into two parts: A (Physics) and B (Electrical Engineering). This decision allowed the subject's scope to widen, particularly in physics. As a result, this allowed a larger quantity of material to be covered.\n\nSince 1967, electronic access to \"Science Abstracts\" has been provided by INSPEC.\n\n"}

One map was included for each of the 734 items that were studied.\n\nLANE was the first component of the Linguistic Atlas of the United States (LAUS). LAUS was first proposed in 1928 by a committee of the Modern Language Association, and collaborative meetings with the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) began in 1929 to discuss the feasibility of the proposed linguistic atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1930, the LSA Council requested a trial run in a limited area, so that a method could be established and budget estimates could be taken for further work in other regions. In 1931, the LSA Council granted approval for the study of New England speech.\n\nOver the following years, preparations for LANE were made. The staff of the project was appointed, including Hans Kurath as director and Miles L. Haney as associate director. Additional staff members were hired with the help of fellowships from Brown University and the University of Vermont. Yale University provided headquarters for the project. Staff were trained over six weeks in the summer of 1931 before beginning fieldwork. Linguists who had experience mapping the dialects of Switzerland and Italy, Jakob Jud and Paul Schauermeier, assisted in the training process.\n\nThe first component of the research took into account the historical background of New England's settlement and population.This provided a basis for which communities would be selected for study in LANE. After this initial historical investigation by Marcus L. Hansen (University of Illinois), data collection commenced. This phase spanned 25 months, and finished in September 1933.\n\n416 informants were interviewed across 213 New England communities. Though there were 431 towns and cities investigated altogether, neighboring towns were sometimes grouped together. Historical backgrounds for each town and details about each informant are given in the accompanying Handbook. Two informants of different social strata were selected from each county whenever possible. Kurath specified that one of the informants must be elderly, old-fashioned, and uneducated and the other must be middle-class and have some education. Field workers characterized informants, based on education levels and age, into Type I (little formal education), Type II (moderate formal education), or Type III (high education level), and Type A (old-fashioned) or Type B (younger, more modern).\n\nField workers used modified IPA phonetic transcription. Some additional notations were used to indicate more information, such as \"c.\" indicating the target form was spoken in natural conversation, \"r.\" indicating repetition at the field worker's request, \"s.\" indicating that the informant agreed the form was natural after hearing it suggested by the field worker, and \"f.\" indicating that the response was forced due to the field worker's insistence.\n\nThough most of the data were only transcribed, aluminum field recordings were made between 1933-1939 and some of the surviving records are digitized at the Library of Congress.\n\nThe Handbook of the Linguistic Geography of New England (1939), by Hans Kurath and Miles L. Hanley was published in conjunction with LANE. This handbook discusses the dialect areas of New England, Kurath's methodology, the history of New England's settlement, the phonetic notation and worksheets used in data collection, and the communities and informants that were involved.\n\nThe questionnaire consisted of 734 items that each informant answered. These 734 items were split across LANE's three volumes, in the following distribution:\n\nVolume 1 had lexical categories focusing on basic words and agricultural society.\n\nVolume 2 included topics of food, familial relationships, and descriptions of people.\n\nVolume 3 included topics of societal institutions as well as several verb forms and other parts of speech.\n\nA main dialect boundary was found between Eastern New England and Western New England. Unique variations in vocabulary and pronunciation also were found in the Boston area, the Plymouth area, the Narragansett Bay area, New Hampshire Bay and the Merrimack Valley, Maine, the New London area, Worcester County and the upper Connecticut valley, the Lower Connecticut valley, the Long Island Sound, and the Hudson Valley.\n"}

At the height of its fervor, it brought the entire economy of France to a virtual halt. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution; the national government itself momentarily ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled France for a few hours. The protests spurred an artistic movement, with songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans.\n\n\"May 68\" affected French society for decades afterward. It is considered to this day as a cultural, social and moral turning point in the history of the country. As Alain Geismar—one of the leaders of the time—later pointed out, the movement succeeded \"as a social revolution, not as a political one\".\n\nThe unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism and traditional institutions, values and order. It then spread to factories with strikes involving 11 million workers, more than 22% of the total population of France at the time, for two continuous weeks. The movement was characterized by its spontaneous and de-centralized wildcat disposition; this created contrast and sometimes even conflict between itself and the establishment, trade unions and workers' parties. It was the largest general strike ever attempted in France, and the first nationwide wildcat general strike.\n\nThe student occupations and wildcat general strikes initiated across France were met with forceful confrontation by university administrators and police. The de Gaulle administration's attempts to quell those strikes by police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the Latin Quarter, Paris, followed by the spread of general strikes and occupations throughout France. De Gaulle fled to a French military base in Germany, and after returning dissolved the National Assembly, and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968. Violence evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, and when the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.\n\nIn February 1968, the French Communists and French Socialists formed an electoral alliance. Communists had long supported Socialist candidates in elections, but in the \"February Declaration\" the two parties agreed to attempt to form a joint government to replace President Charles de Gaulle and his Gaullist Party.\n\nOn 22 March far-left groups, a small number of prominent poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied an administration building at Paris University at Nanterre and held a meeting in the university council room dealing with class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university's funding. The university's administration called the police, who surrounded the university. After the publication of their wishes, the students left the building without any trouble. After this first record some leaders of what was named the \"Movement of 22 March\" were called together by the disciplinary committee of the university.\n\nFollowing months of conflicts between students and authorities at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris (now Paris Nanterre University), the administration shut down the university on 2 May 1968. Students at the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris (today Sorbonne University) in Paris met on 3 May to protest against the closure and the threatened expulsion of several students at Nanterre. On Monday, 6 May, the national student union, the Union Nationale des Étudiants de France (UNEF)—still the largest student union in France today—and the union of university teachers called a march to protest against the police invasion of Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers and supporters marched towards the Sorbonne, still sealed off by the police, who charged, wielding their batons, as soon as the marchers approached. While the crowd dispersed, some began to create barricades out of whatever was at hand, while others threw paving stones, forcing the police to retreat for a time. The police then responded with tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds more students were arrested.\n\nHigh school student unions spoke in support of the riots on 6 May. The next day, they joined the students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers who gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that:\n\nNegotiations broke down, and students returned to their campuses after a false report that the government had agreed to reopen them, only to discover the police still occupying the schools. This led to a near revolutionary fervor among the students.\n\nOn Friday, 10 May, another huge crowd congregated on the Rive Gauche. When the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité again blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again threw up barricades, which the police then attacked at 2:15 in the morning after negotiations once again floundered. The confrontation, which produced hundreds of arrests and injuries, lasted until dawn of the following day. The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. Allegations were made that the police had participated in the riots, through \"agents provocateurs\", by burning cars and throwing Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe government's heavy-handed reaction brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Many of the nation's more mainstream singers and poets joined after the police brutality came to light. American artists also began voicing support of the strikers. The major left union federations, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) and the Force Ouvrière (CGT-FO), called a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May.\n\nWell over a million people marched through Paris on that day; the police stayed largely out of sight. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne. However, the surge of strikes did not recede. Instead, the protesters became even more active.\n\nWhen the Sorbonne reopened, students occupied it and declared it an autonomous \"people's university\". Public opinion at first supported the students, but quickly turned against them after their leaders, invited to appear on national television, \"behaved like irresponsible utopianists who wanted to destroy the 'consumer society.'\" Nonetheless, in the weeks that followed, approximately 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and elsewhere to take up grievances against the government and French society, including the Sorbonne Occupation Committee.\n\nIn the following days, workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plant near the city of Nantes on 14 May, then another strike at a Renault parts plant near Rouen, which spread to the Renault manufacturing complexes at Flins in the Seine Valley and the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt. Workers had occupied roughly fifty factories by 16 May, and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day and then ten million, or roughly two-thirds of the French workforce, on strike the following week.\n\nThese strikes were not led by the union movement; on the contrary, the CGT tried to contain this spontaneous outbreak of militancy by channeling it into a struggle for higher wages and other economic demands. Workers put forward a broader, more political and more radical agenda, demanding the ousting of the government and President de Gaulle and attempting, in some cases, to run their factories. When the trade union leadership negotiated a 35% increase in the minimum wage, a 7% wage increase for other workers, and half normal pay for the time on strike with the major employers' associations, the workers occupying their factories refused to return to work and jeered their union leaders. In fact, in the May '68 movement there was a lot of \"anti-unionist euphoria,\" against the mainstream unions, the CGT, FO and CFDT, that were more willing to compromise with the powers that be than enact the will of the base.\n\nOn 24 May two people died at the hands of the out of control rioters, in Lyon Police Inspector Rene Lacroix died when he crushed by a driverless truck sent careering into police lines by rioters and in Paris Phillipe Metherion, 26, was stabbed to death during an argument among demonstrators.\n\nOn 25 May and 26 May, the Grenelle agreements were conducted at the Ministry of Social Affairs. They provided for an increase of the minimum wage by 25% and of average salaries by 10%. These offers were rejected, and the strike went on. The working class and top intellectuals were joining in solidarity for a major change in workers' rights.\n\nOn 27 May, the meeting of the UNEF, the most outstanding of the events of May 1968, proceeded and gathered 30,000 to 50,000 people in the Stade Sebastien Charlety. The meeting was extremely militant with speakers demanding the government be overthrown and elections held.\n\nThe Socialists saw an opportunity to act as a compromise between de Gaulle and the Communists. On 28 May, François Mitterrand of the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left declared that \"there is no more state\" and stated that he was ready to form a new government. He had received a surprisingly high 45% of the vote in the 1965 presidential election. On 29 May, Pierre Mendès France also stated that he was ready to form a new government; unlike Mitterrand he was willing to include the Communists. Although the Socialists did not have the Communists' ability to form large street demonstrations, they had more than 20% of the country's support.\n\nOn the morning of 29 May, de Gaulle postponed the meeting of the Council of Ministers scheduled for that day and secretly removed his personal papers from Élysée Palace. He told his son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, \"I do not want to give them a chance to attack the Élysée. It would be regrettable if blood were shed in my personal defense. I have decided to leave: nobody attacks an empty palace.\" De Gaulle refused Pompidou's request that he dissolve the National Assembly as he believed that their party, the Gaullists, would lose the resulting election. At 11:00 a.m., he told Pompidou, \"I am the past; you are the future; I embrace you.\"\n\nThe government announced that de Gaulle was going to his country home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises before returning the next day, and rumors spread that he would prepare his resignation speech there. The presidential helicopter did not arrive in Colombey, however, and de Gaulle had told no one in the government where he was going. For more than six hours the world did not know where the French president was. The canceling of the ministerial meeting, and the president's mysterious disappearance, stunned the French, including Pompidou, who shouted, \"He has fled the country!\"\n\nThe national government had effectively ceased to function. Édouard Balladur later wrote that as prime minister, Pompidou \"by himself was the whole government\" as most officials were \"an incoherent group of confabulators\" who believed that revolution would soon occur. A friend of the prime minister offered him a weapon, saying, \"You will need it\"; Pompidou advised him to go home. One official reportedly began burning documents, while another asked an aide how far they could flee by automobile should revolutionaries seize fuel supplies. Withdrawing money from banks became difficult, gasoline for private automobiles was unavailable, and some people tried to obtain private planes or fake national identity cards.\n\nPompidou unsuccessfully requested that military radar be used to follow de Gaulle's two helicopters, but soon learned that he had gone to the headquarters of the French military in Germany, in Baden-Baden, to meet General Jacques Massu. Massu persuaded the discouraged de Gaulle to return to France; now knowing that he had the military's support, de Gaulle rescheduled the meeting of the Council of Ministers for the next day, 30 May, and returned to Colombey by 6:00 p.m. His wife Yvonne gave the family jewels to their son and daughter-in-law—who stayed in Baden for a few more days—for safekeeping, however, indicating that the de Gaulles still considered Germany a possible refuge. Massu kept as a state secret de Gaulle's loss of confidence until others disclosed it in 1982; until then most observers believed that his disappearance was intended to remind the French people of what they might lose. Although the disappearance was real and not intended as motivation, it indeed had such an effect on France.\n\nOn 30 May, 400,000 to 500,000 protesters (many more than the 50,000 the police were expecting) led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting: \"Adieu, de Gaulle!\" (\"Farewell, de Gaulle!\"). Maurice Grimaud, head of the Paris police, played a key role in avoiding revolution by both speaking to and spying on the revolutionaries, and by carefully avoiding the use of force. While Communist leaders later denied that they had planned an armed uprising, and extreme militants only comprised 2% of the populace, they had overestimated de Gaulle's strength as shown by his escape to Germany. (One scholar, otherwise skeptical of the French Communists' willingness to maintain democracy after forming a government, has claimed that the \"moderate, nonviolent and essentially antirevolutionary\" Communists opposed revolution because they sincerely believed that the party must come to power through legal elections, not armed conflict that might provoke harsh repression from political opponents.)\n\nThe movement was largely centered around the Paris metropolitan area, and not elsewhere. Had the rebellion occupied key public buildings in Paris, the government would have had to use force to retake them. The resulting casualties could have incited a revolution, with the military moving from the provinces to retake Paris as in 1871. Minister of Defence Pierre Messmer and Chief of the Defence Staff Michel Fourquet prepared for such an action, and Pompidou had ordered tanks to Issy-les-Moulineaux. While the military was free of revolutionary sentiment, using an army mostly of conscripts the same age as the revolutionaries would have been very dangerous for the government. A survey taken immediately after the crisis found that 20% of Frenchmen would have supported a revolution, 23% would have opposed it, and 57% would have avoided physical participation in the conflict. 33% would have fought a military intervention, while only 5% would have supported it and a majority of the country would have avoided any action.\n\nAt 2:30 p.m. on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded de Gaulle to dissolve the National Assembly and call a new election by threatening to resign. At 4:30 p.m., de Gaulle broadcast his own refusal to resign. He announced an election, scheduled for 23 June, and ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The government had leaked to the media that the army was outside Paris. Immediately after the speech, about 800,000 supporters marched through the Champs-Élysées waving the national flag; the Gaullists had planned the rally for several days, which attracted a crowd of diverse ages, occupations, and politics. The Communists agreed to the election, and the threat of revolution was over.\n\nFrom that point, the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of leftist organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. Contrary to de Gaulle's fears, his party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history in the legislative election held in June, taking 353 of 486 seats versus the Communists' 34 and the Socialists' 57. The February Declaration and its promise to include Communists in government likely hurt the Socialists in the election. Their opponents cited the example of the Czechoslovak National Front government of 1945, which led to a Communist takeover of the country in 1948. Socialist voters were divided; in a February 1968 survey a majority had favored allying with the Communists, but 44% believed that Communists would attempt to seize power once in government. (30% of Communist voters agreed.)\n\nOn Bastille Day, there were resurgent street demonstrations in the Latin Quarter, led by socialist students, leftists and communists wearing red arm-bands and anarchists wearing black arm-bands. The Paris police and the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité harshly responded starting around 10 pm and continuing through the night, on the streets, in police vans, at police stations, and in hospitals where many wounded were taken. There was, as a result, much bloodshed among students and tourists there for the evening's festivities. No charges were filed against police or demonstrators, but the governments of Britain and West Germany filed formal protests, including for the indecent assault of two English schoolgirls by police in a police station.\n\nDespite the size of de Gaulle's triumph, it was not a personal one. The post-crisis survey showed that a majority of the country saw de Gaulle as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too anti-American. As the April 1969 referendum would show, the country was ready for \"Gaullism without de Gaulle\".\n\nA few examples:\n\nMay 1968 is an important reference point in French politics, representing for some the possibility of liberation and for others the dangers of anarchy. For some, May 1968 meant the end of traditional collective action and the beginning of a new era to be dominated mainly by the so-called new social movements. \n\nSomeone who took part in or supported this period of unrest is referred to as - a term, derived from the French for \"68\", which has also entered the English language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1658, Digby held a discourse on the sympathetic powder before the University of Montpellier.\n\nThe powder is said to have consisted of green vitriol, first dissolved in water and afterward recrystallized or calcined in the sun. The Duke of Buckingham testified that Digby had healed his secretary of a gangrenous wound by simply soaking the bloody bandage in a solution of the powder (possibly due to the oligodynamic effect). Digby claimed to have got the secret remedy from a Carmelite monk in Florence, and attributed its potency to the fact that the sun's rays extracted the spirits of the blood and the vitriol, while, at the same time, the heat of the wound caused the healing principle thus produced to be attracted to it by means of a current of air — a sort of wireless therapy.\n\nThe powder was also applied to solve the longitude problem in the suggestion of an anonymous pamphlet of 1687 entitled \"Curious Enquiries.\" The pamphlet theorised that a wounded dog could be put aboard a ship, with the animal's discarded bandage left in the trust of a timekeeper on shore, who would then dip the bandage into the powder at a predetermined time and cause the creature to yelp, thus giving the captain of the ship an accurate knowledge of the time.\n\nA weapon-salve (Latin unguentum armarium, Greek hoplocrisma) was a salve which was supposed to cure the wound, being applied to the weapon that made it. The salve consisted of the patient's blood and human fat, the wound itself being wrapped in wet lint. This doctrine was supported by Wilhelm Fabry, Robert Fludd, and Jan Baptist van Helmont, who attributed the cure to animal magnetism. The clergy held that the weapon cure was wrought by magic and the devil, and their view was set forth by William Foster in \"Hoplocrisma Spongus, or a Sponge to Wipe away the Weapon-Salve\" (1631).\n"}

Each branch of the Armed Forces has historically had different policies regarding racial segregation. Although Executive Order 9981 officially ended segregation in the Armed Forces in 1948, following World War II, some forms of racial segregation continued until after the Korean War.\n\nBefore the American Revolution, some blacks had already served in local militias in the French and Indian Wars, and a black man, Crispus Attucks, was one of the first felled at the outset of the American Revolution. Both free and enslaved black men fought at the battle of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Bunker Hill. However, at the beginning of the Revolutionary War, many whites in power were reluctant to allow blacks to carry arms, because of fears of an armed slave insurrection. One of George Washington's first acts as commander in chief was to sign an order forbidding the recruitment of all blacks. The British took advantage of this and recruited thousands of black men to the Loyalist side. Because of a shortage in manpower George Washington quickly relented and allowed black soldiers to serve in the Continental Army. One state, Rhode Island, had an all black unit, and enslaved black soldiers in the unit were freed at the end of the war. In the rest of the military units, blacks served side by side with whites. One historian commented that the military during this time was more integrated than it would be until the Korean War. Many of these black soldiers, however, fought as slaves and continued as slaves after the war.\n\nAfter the creation of the Federal Militia Acts of 1792, the Army excluded black men, and, with very few exceptions, the prohibition remained in effect until the second year of the Civil War.\n\nBecause of exclusion from the U.S. Army, most blacks either served in the U.S. Navy or defected to the British Navy to gain their freedom.\n\nThe history of African Americans in the Civil War is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 enlisted) African-American men, comprising 163 units, who served in the Union Army. Additional African Americans served in the Union Navy. Both free African Americans and fugitive slaves joined the fight. On the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used for labor, but the issue of whether to arm them, and under what terms, became a major source of debate among Southerners. At the start of the war, a Louisiana Confederate militia unit composed of free blacks from the extensive New Orleans Creoles of color was raised, but never accepted into Confederate service. On March 13, 1865 the Confederate Congress enacted a statute to allow the enlistment of African Americans but fewer than fifty were recruited.\n\nAsian, Pacific Islander and Hispanic troops also served with African-Americans in the United States Colored Troops, and a few served with white troops.\n\nNative Americans, such as General Stand Watie's Confederate Cherokee Battalion, fought in their own tribal regiments or battalions on both sides of the Civil War.\n\nThe Buffalo soldiers were established by Congress in 1866 as the first peacetime all-black regiments in the regular U.S. Army.\n\nThe American military was entirely segregated for African Americans during World War I. Although the military training of black Americans was opposed by white supremacist politicians such as Sen. James K. Vardaman (D-Mississippi) and Sen. Benjamin Tillman (D-South Carolina), the decision was made to include African-Americans in the 1917 draft. A total of 290,527 black Americans were ultimately registered for the draft.\n\nDraft board officials were instructed to tear off the lower left corner of the Selective Service forms filled out by black registrants to mark these for segregated units. The August 1917 Houston Riot of armed African-American soldiers spurred by racist behavior by some Houston police officials additionally shaped the War Department's decision-making, and the great majority of black soldiers were assigned jobs like the building of roads, unloading of shipping, and other forms of common labor. Two combat units of African-Americans were established — the 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions. Including volunteers, 350,000 African-Americans served in the American Expeditionary Force on the western front. One combat unit, the 369th Infantry \"Hell Fighters from Harlem\" were awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French allies for their bravery and competence in combat.\n\nThe 65th Infantry Regiment, created during World War I, was the U.S. Military's last segregated unit composed primarily of Hispanic soldiers, mostly of Puerto Rican descent, as well as immigrants from Latin America and Spain.\n\nAsian-Americans fought in integrated units during World War I, and non-citizens were offered citizenship after the war as a result of their service.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States Army established several new segregated units, and maintained several historic segregated units.\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War II, Jim Crow segregation had permeated every aspect of American society. When black men volunteered for duty or were drafted, they were assigned to segregated divisions and often given combat support roles, such as cook, quartermaster and grave-digging duty. According to British personnel in the BEF, meals in the US Army were served with the white servicemen being served in one line and the black servicemen and officers in another. Because of black protests against the Army's treatment of its black soldiers, military leadership began to attempt to address the issue beginning in 1943, but segregation in the armed forces remained official policy until 1948.\nWith the exception of 18 female African-American nurses who had served in World War I, the Army Nurse Corps, established in 1901, remained white until 1941, when pressure from the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, and Eleanor Roosevelt, caused the Army to admit black nurses. A quota of 48 nurses was set, and the women were segregated from white nurses and white soldiers for much of the war. Eventually more black nurses enlisted. They were assigned to care for black soldiers, and served in the China-Burma-India theater, Australia, New Guinea, Liberia, England and the Philippines. African American women were in all fields of service for WW2. They stayed on the home front, went to war, and became military photographers.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, men of Japanese birth and descent were classified as enemy aliens and excluded from the United States draft. In addition, on the US mainland, the federal government forced most ethnic Japanese Americans to relocate from Pacific coastal areas to internment camps located inland of the Pacific and controlled by armed guards. It was not until 1944 that a fighting unit of Japanese-American Nisei (American-born) men were recruited and trained for military service. Japanese Americans were allowed to join only the Army, not the Navy, Marines or Air Corps. The 442nd Infantry Regiment, consisting primarily of Japanese Americans, fought in Europe.\n\nJapanese Americans already in training at the start of the war had been removed from active duty shortly after Pearl Harbor, and the Army stopped accepting new \"Nisei\" recruits in early 1942. However, Japanese American leaders like Mike Masaoka and War Department officials like John J. McCloy soon began to push the Roosevelt administration to allow \"Nisei\" to serve in combat. A military board was convened in June 1942 to address the issue, but their final report opposed forming a \"Nisei\" unit, citing \"the universal distrust in which they [Japanese Americans] are held.\" Despite resistance from military and War Relocation Authority leaders, the President eventually sided with the War Department, and on February 1, 1943, Roosevelt announced the creation of a segregated battalion composed of \"Nisei\" soldiers and commanded by white officers.\n\nUnlike the Japanese Americans, 75% of Chinese American soldiers served in non-segregated units. An estimated 13,000 Chinese-Americans served in World War II, with two units consisting of only Chinese-Americans, the 407th Air Service Squadron, and the 987th Signal Company, based in the China, Burma and India Theater.\n\nWhen the United States Army Air Service, the precursor to the Air Force, was formed in 1918, only whites were allowed.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were the first African-American military aviators in the United States armed forces. During World War II, African Americans in southern states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws. The American military was racially segregated, as was much of the federal government. The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to racial discrimination, both within and outside the army. Despite these adversities, they trained and flew with distinction. All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Tuskegee, including five Haitians.\n\nAlthough the 477th Bombardment Group \"worked up\" on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, they never served in combat. The Tuskegee 332nd Fighter Group was the only operational unit, first sent overseas as part of Operation Torch, then seeing action in Sicily and Italy. They were deployed as bomber escorts in Europe, where they were very successful.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, official U.S. policy forbade the recruitment of black sailors. However, a shortage of manpower forced the Navy to accept any able-bodied man. Modern estimates place the number of black sailors serving in the War of 1812 at 15-20 % of naval manpower. On some privateers, non-military ships which harassed British merchant vessels, more than half of the crew was black. Life in the cramped quarters of the ships created a more egalitarian camaraderie, as well as mutual respect based on performance. However, many enslaved American blacks defected to the British Navy after the British promised them freedom in return for their service. In a letter to Commodore Perry, who had complained about being given black crew members, Commodore Chauncy wrote that he had fifty black sailors on his ship, called them \"excellent seamen\" and said, \"I have yet to learn that the color of skin, or the cut and trimmings of the coat, can affect a man's qualifications and usefulness.\" Just before the Battle of Bladensburg Commodore Joshua Barney, on being asked by President James Madison \"...if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?\" replied: “No Sir…they don't know how to run; they will die by their guns first.\" The Commodore was correct, the men did not run, one such man was young sailor Harry Jones a free black. Jones was wounded in the final action at the Battle of Bladensburg when Commodore Barney's Naval and Marine contingent were overrun. He remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington DC for nearly two months. African Americans like Charles Ball and Harry Jones, despite prejudice and segregation played a significant role in the Battle of Bladensburg and the American war effort. Michael Shiner, 1805 -1880 a black man who worked in the Washington DC Navy yard in the early to mid 19th century, chronicled the War of 1812 as well as the racial tension of the era in his diary.\n\nUnlike the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy was integrated during the Civil War. During the 1840s, federal regulations limited black sailors to 5 percent of the enlisted force, but during the American Civil War black participation grew to 20 per cent of the Union navy's total enlisted force, nearly double the percentage that served in the Army. Almost eighteen thousand men of African descent, and eleven women, served in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War. The ranking and status of black crew members depended on whether they had come on board as free or formerly enslaved, with the latter classified as \"Boys\" and given lower pay and rating.\n\nOn Navy ships, black sailors frequently worked as mess attendants, firemen, or coal passers, who hauled massive quantities of coal to fuel the ships. They were also promoted to petty officers. Navy ships continued to be integrated.\n\nIn June 1940 the Navy had 4,007 African-American personnel, representing 2.3 percent of its total strength of nearly 170,000. All of these African Americans were enlisted men, and with the exception of six regular-rated seamen, all were steward's mates. They were characterized by the black press as \"seagoing bellhops.\" Within a month after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the number of African Americans in the Navy had increased to 5,026; however, they were still restricted to working as steward's mates.\n\nThe destroyer-escort USS Mason was the only Navy vessel in World War II with an entirely black crew who were not cooks or waiters. In 1995, 11 surviving crew members were all given belated recognition and letters of commendation from Navy Secretary John Dalton for having braved harsh weather and quickly welding the cracks in their ship so they could continue escorting support ships to England.\n\nThe Navy did not allow women of color until January 25, 1945. The first African-American woman sworn into the Navy was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a nurse and Columbia University student from New York. She was the first of only four African American women to serve in the navy during WW2.\n\nPublicity surrounding the Port Chicago disaster on July 17, 1944 and the ensuing mutiny convictions of 50 black sailors spotlighted racism in the Navy and was a major impetus for Circular Order 48-46, published on February 27, 1946, which desegregated the Navy.\n\nPrior to World War II, the U.S. Navy had recruited Chinese Americans but they had been restricted to serve only as stewards; This continued until May 1942, when restrictions ceased and they were allowed to serve in other ratings. The Korean-American Susan Ahn Cuddy was the first Asian-American woman to join the Navy in 1942 and the first female to operate flexible-mount or turret-mounted machine guns on an aircraft in the Navy. The Navy refused to accept Japanese-American recruits throughout World War II.\n\nIn 1776 and 1777, a dozen Black American Marines served in the American Revolutionary War, but from 1798 to 1942, the USMC followed a racially discriminatory policy of denying African Americans the opportunity to serve as Marines. For more than 140 years, the Marines recruited primarily European Americans and white Hispanics, along with a few Asian Americans.\n\nThe USMC opened its doors to blacks in June 1942, with the acceptance of African Americans as recruits in segregated all-black units. Other races were accepted somewhat more easily, joining white Marine units. For the next few decades, the incorporation of black troops was not widely accepted within the Corps, nor was desegregation smoothly or quickly achieved. Spurred by executive orders in 1941 and 1948, the integration of non-white USMC personnel proceeded in stages from segregated battalions in 1942, to unified training in 1949, and finally full integration in 1960.\n\nBy 2006, approximately 20% of the USMC was Black American and 15–18% Hispanic; more than the 30 to 31% of the U.S. ratio of minorities in the general population.\n\nThe first black American to fight in a Marine role was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig USS \"Reprisal\". Martin served with the Marine platoon on the \"Reprisal\" for a year and a half, involved in hard ship-to-ship fighting, but was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777.\n\nAt least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776–1777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the Marine Corps was officially re-instituted, Secretary of War James McHenry specified in its rules: \"No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted\". Marine Commandant William Ward Burrows instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, \"You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them.\" This policy was in line with long-standing British naval practice which set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines so that they would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies.\n\nThe Marine Corps, being a combat arm of the Navy, did not recruit any black soldiers. Instead, the USMC was serviced by US Navy supply personnel including black laborers. Unlike the US Army which had separate regiments that a soldier could remain in for his entire military career, Marines were individually transferred to various ship's detachments and naval bases. After World War I, the number of blacks in both the Navy and the Army was reduced to about 1.5% of the total number of active servicemen, a proportion much lower than the number of blacks in the general population.\n\nDuring the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the growing political power of African Americans was increasingly felt in Washington, DC. Civil rights groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the National Urban League, and the National Negro Congress called for greater equality between the races. In 1938, the Committee on Participation of Negroes in the National Defense Program was formed by the \"Pittsburgh Courier\", a newspaper with a large black readership. Further calls to increase the proportion of blacks in the military were published in 1939.\n\nAfter wars broke out in the late 1930s in Africa, China and Europe, black community leaders determined to use the black workforce's loyalty as leverage to gain greater racial equality at home. In June 1940, the NAACP's magazine, \"The Crisis\", published a declaration that the fighting around the world was certainly bad, \"but the hysterical cries of the preachers of democracy for Europe leave us cold. We want democracy in Alabama, Arkansas, in Mississippi and Michigan, in the District of Columbia, in the Senate of the United States.\" During the 1940 presidential election, both parties courted the black vote. Incumbent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was re-elected, partly because substantial numbers of black voters crossed previous party lines and voted for the Democratic Party candidate.\n\nIn April 1941 the US Navy convened its General Board to discuss expansion of the USMC. Major General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the Marines, who lived in Delaware and Washington, DC in his early years and attended private schools, said that African Americans had no right to serve as Marines. He said, \"If it were a question of having a Marine Corps of 5,000 whites or 250,000 Negroes, I would rather have the whites.\"\n\nIn 1941, civil rights activists Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph, and A. J. Muste pushed Roosevelt to order fair employment for blacks in the federal government. The activists threatened to march on Washington, DC, in July 1941, and Roosevelt intended to prevent such a public relations disaster for his presidency. On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802; the elimination of racial discrimination from federal departments, agencies, the military, and from private defense contractors. The black activists cancelled their planned march.\n\nDirected by Roosevelt and US Navy Secretary Frank Knox to accept black recruits, Holcomb proposed a separate battalion of African Americans, a seacoast defense battalion armed with anti-aircraft and anti-shipping artillery. To make this battalion self-supporting, Holcomb determined that it would contain a rifle company, special weapons platoons, and a light tank platoon—all manned by black Marines.\n\nIn early 1942, Philip Johnston, a U.S. Army veteran of World War I, suggested to the USMC that they follow the example of the Army and recruit native speakers of the Navajo language to pass important tactical messages by radio, to serve as code talkers on the battlefield. On May 5, 1942, the first group of 29 Navajo recruits was accepted at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. From 1942 to 1945, some 375 to 420 Navajo trained as code talkers, part of about 540 Marines who were native Navajo speakers during World War II. All of these soldiers served in desegregated units alongside Marines of various races. A total of 874 Native Americans of various tribes served in the USMC in World War II.\n\nThe USMC did not form battalions of Asian Americans. Rather, it integrated Asian-American recruits with European-American soldiers. The first Chinese American USMC officer, Wilbur Carl Sze, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in December 1943. In contemporary times, proportionately fewer Asian Americans join the U.S. military than appear in the U.S. general population.\n\nOn June 1, 1942, the initial group of black USMC recruits was admitted, but they were not immediately trained because separate, segregated facilities had not been completed. Black volunteers began their basic training in August at Montford Point in North Carolina, a satellite base to Marine Barracks, New River, later called Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. The first black recruit to arrive in camp was Howard P. Perry on August 26, followed that day by 12 others. These and subsequent recruits were organized into the 51st Composite Defense Battalion, a static artillery unit intended to hold land against attack.\n\nBy October 29, only 647 of a planned 1,200 recruits had passed entrance examinations—to avoid forming segregated training units to teach typing, truck driving and other specialist skills necessary to run the battalion, Holcomb required more than half of the recruits to demonstrate proficiency in these skills prior to acceptance. This requirement was dropped in view of the delay it caused in bringing the battalion up to strength. Recruits were taught specialist skills by white USMC instructors brought into Montford Point, or they were sent to nearby Army classes.\n\nThe black recruits were not allowed in Camp Lejeune unless accompanied by a white Marine, and their service papers were stamped \"Colored\". Although the U.S. was by this time fully engaged in war, the recruits were assigned to inactive duty in the Marine Corps Reserve. Their units were segregated—all the enlisted servicemen were black, with white officers and drill instructors. The commander of the black Marines at Montford Point was Samuel A. Woods Jr who worked to enforce segregation, protecting his troops from being detained by local authorities while they were visiting town. By early 1943, the white drill instructors were leaving for war and were being replaced by black sergeants and corporals.\nAfter accepting more black recruits, the USMC formed the 52nd Defense Battalion. Both the 51st and 52nd shipped out to fight in the Pacific War, but as defense units holding land far behind the front lines they did not see much action. In total, 19,168 African Americans joined the Marines, about 4% of the USMC's strength; some 75% of them performed their duties overseas. About 8,000 black USMC stevedores and ammunition handlers served under enemy fire during offensive operations in the Pacific. Following the June 1944 Battle of Saipan, USMC General Alexander Vandegrift said of the steadfast performance of the all-black 3d Marine Ammunition Company: \"The Negro Marines are no longer on trial. They are Marines, period.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the USMC reduced in size; the number of African-American Marines dropped to 2,000 men, which was one-tenth of wartime levels. In 1947, the Marine Corps forced African-American men to choose between leaving the service or becoming a steward (a food service position). A few non-white Marines advanced in grade, such as Kurt Chew-Een Lee, a Chinese-American soldier who was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1946. Lee earned the Navy Cross under fire in Korea in September 1950, serving in the 1st Battalion 7th Marines; at the time this was a primarily Euro-American unit.\n\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9981 establishing equality of treatment and opportunity in the U.S. military regardless of race. He appointed the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, two of whose five members were African American. In January 1949, the Fahy Committee (nicknamed after its chairman) met to hear concerns by armed forces' leaders about the new executive order, and both the Army and the Marine Corps leadership defended their practices of segregation. The Navy and the newly formed United States Air Force announced their intentions to follow the order. The USMC said that it had only one black officer among 8,200 white ones.\n\nIn late 1949, all-black USMC units persisted, but the Marines had black and white recruits beginning to train together. The few black USMC officers were assigned exclusively to black units; they were not asked to lead white Marines into combat. In 1952 after two years of the Korean War, the Marines cautiously integrated blacks into combat units. In the late 1950s, black Marines were not rewarded with preferred or high-visibility assignments, such as embassy guard duty and guard duty in the nation's capital. By 1960, full integration of the races had been completed by the USMC, but racial tensions flared up through the next decade, a period of civil rights activism in the larger society.\n\n\n"}

The system is designed to reflect an underlying hierarchy whereby consumers and businesses go to a city of a certain size for a certain function; some functions are widely available and others are only available in the largest cities.\n\nThe system was developed for Rand McNally by geographer Richard L. Forstall and released in 1964. The city rankings are updated periodically in the \"Rand McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide\", an annual two-volume set, which is available in many libraries. Among the criteria for categorization are retail sales, newspaper circulation, and the presence of universities and hospitals and corporate headquarters. The size of the city's tributary area is critical to determining whether it will be rated a 2, 3, or 4. As of 2006, there are 1492 cities rated.\n\nThe system consists of a number and a letter. The number reflects a city's importance in the national hierarchy. Nationally important business centers are ranked 1. Regional business centers are ranked 2. Significant local business centers are ranked 3 and business centers whose importance is purely local are ranked 4. the letter reflects its importance in its own area. Doubled letters serve to distinguish centers within a class. The most important center in a market (trading area) is given some kind of A. Other business centers in the same market area will be given B or C depending on their importance. For example, Dallas is rated 1-AA (a nationally important business center) and Fort Worth is rated 2-BB. B cities constitute basic trading centers, while C cities do not.\n\nRand McNally divides the country into basic trading areas (487 as of 2008), each of which has exactly one A-rated city. The basic trading areas are aggregated into major trading areas, of which there are 51. The Federal Communications Commission uses these areas for determining wireless territory boundaries.\n\nNew York City has always been given the unique rating 1-AAAA due to its preeminent status in the national hierarchy. Chicago was originally the only other city rated 1-AAA as having influence over a large area of the country. In 1988, Los Angeles was similarly given a 1-AAA rating. Thirteen cities are given the rating 1-AA as major national business centers: Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C..\n\nNotes: The B and C cities are secondary because they are in the same market area as a city rated A.\n\nWhile those are only abstract examples of the ratings, consider how the system works in practice with the example of Ohio. Rand McNally conceives of Ohio as consisting of nineteen markets (trading areas) with some peripheral counties being contained in trading areas of other states. The table below shows the nineteen trading areas in order of hierarchy. Each has an A-rated city. Some also have other rated cities and suburbs.\n\nExample: Ohio\nThe system is applied by businesses seeking to serve a network of customers with the greatest efficiency. For example, a company that services elevators or a wholesaler of paper bags would want to locate its field representatives primarily in A rated cities. The Rural Health Research Center at the University of Minnesota has recently published a report on access to physicians in rural areas which uses the system to evaluate access to physicians in rural areas.\n\n\n"}

She served as the first Chief Librarian of the Frick Art Reference Library. \n\nSavord graduated from Sandusky High School and the school of Library Science at Case Western University in Cleveland. She was also enrolled at the University of Illinois, where she held a position in the Catalog Department of the university library.\n\nSavord began her career in approximately 1910, when she became an apprentice at the Sandusky Library. After her graduation from Case Western University, she worked in the Catalog Department of the Cleveland Public Library. During World War I, she relocated to New York City and worked for the Western Union Telegraph Company; after the war, she was employed by the Newark Public Library.\n\nSavord assisted Helen Clay Frick in organizing the Frick Art Reference Library, an institution dedicated to serving the art and art history research community that Miss Frick had founded in 1920 as a memorial to her father, the collector Henry Clay Frick. Savord had been recommended by a close friend, and Miss Frick was impressed by Savord's \"excellent mind,\" work ethic, and sense of humor. In the first entry in the library's diary, dated Monday, 8 November 1920, a note in longhand records that \"Ruth Savord began work as a librarian ... She and Miss Frick began cutting up a few things on hand and working out forms, etc.\" — a reference to the Library's early collection of study images, many of which were removed from pamphlets and catalogs. Early in 1921, Savord accompanied Miss Frick on a six-week research trip to London where they studied the famous photograph collection of the British art historian Sir Robert Witt in his library at 32 Portman Square. On their return, Savord developed a cataloging system for the Frick Art Reference Library's growing collection of study images, which involved the adaption of principles ordinarily applied to books, and launched two initiatives: the development of a book collection and a program to photograph works of art in private collections, objects that were little known to the scholarly community. Savord also assisted in developing the staff of the Library and acquiring rare sales catalogs, a collection that has become one of the largest of its kind in the United States.\n\nSavord left her position at the Frick Art Reference Library in 1924 to assist in the reorganization of the library of the General Education Board. After holding positions with the International Education Board as well as the advertising firm Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn, Savord extended her field into international relations and actively contributed to the organization of the library of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. She served as the institution's Librarian from 1932 to about 1962. Her work for the Council led to the compilation of a directory on international affairs, her first major publication. She also served as the President of the Special Libraries Association from 1934 to 1935.\n\nIn regard to her field, she noted that special librarianship \"offers an outlet ... for the one whose primary interest is in people, in new and interesting contacts, and in books as tools; for the one with the sleuthing instinct for the obscure or the not-yet-in-print information which is demanded today by our highly competitive world. It is not for the one seeking a quiet atmosphere of repose; nor for the one who is interested primarily in increasing the desire to read and in fostering the cultural side of life.\"\n\n"}

This occurs prior to the general launch of the top-level domain (TLD). In order to register, the group or individual must be able to prove their prior right to the name. The sunrise period serves as a test period, and is followed by the landrush period and/or General Availability.\n\nIn October 2013, the Trademark Clearinghouse announced new rules for Sunrise periods for new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) that were rolling out as part of the New gTLD Program. There are now two types of Sunrise Periods:\n\nIn this type of Sunrise, the Registry can announce the Sunrise as late as the day the Sunrise starts, but must run the Sunrise for 60 days or more. Trademark owners will have the duration of the Sunrise period to submit a claim for a domain. At the end of the period, all the claims are registered by the Registry and auctions are conducted if there is more than one claim for the same domain. This type of Sunrise has significant benefits for rights holders.\n\nIn this type of Sunrise, the Registry must give 30-days notice before commencing the Sunrise. Once the Sunrise starts, it must run for at least 30 days or more. Claims by trademark owners are processed on a first-come-first-served basis, so there is no need for auctions and domains are registered as claims are made during the Sunrise period. This type of Sunrise has so far been very rare among New gTLD strings, and has benefits for Registries while causing concerns for rights holders.\n\nTrademark Holders have first right to register their trademarked terms. Every new gTLD is required to organize a Sunrise Period of at least 30 days before domain names are offered to the general public. If a company/business or an individual is interested in protecting their brand in the New gTLD era, they should register as trademark holder or trademark agent with Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH). Upon a successful registration, they will be able to submit their trademark records and be eligible for trademark claims notification and/or sunrise services. A brand owner should aware about launch of new TLD's to educate himself on the different tactics i.e. defensive registrations, monitoring, blocking or creating a new strategy; registering a mark in the TMCH (Trademark Clearinghouse) is the first step.\n\nThe Trademark Claims service follows the Sunrise. It is a notification service mandated by ICANN for all new gTLDs to warn both domain name registrants as well as trademark holders of possible infringements. If multiple trademark-holders place a request for the same domain name, the registry may put the domain name to an auction, where the highest bidder will be allowed to register the name. A Sunrise registration request is essential to take part in the auction.\n\nWhen two trademark owners both have legitimate claim to a given domain, these domains then go to auction.\n"}

The twenty-four surviving manuscripts are a mix of Low German (ten), High German (nine) and Central German (five). The 98-line verse prologue is always in High German. The \"Weltchronik\" is the oldest historical work in German prose. Ludwig Weiland, who made a critical edition for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica in 1877, gave it the conventional title by which it is most commonly known. The first edition was prepared by Hans Ferdinand Massmann in 1857, but was based on only one manuscript. The manuscripts are classified into three recensions—A, B and C—and the oldest group (A) is entirely High German. Michael Menzel classifies a fifteenth-century manuscript from Wolfenbüttel as the \"Leittext\".\n\nIt was once thought that the \"Weltchronik\" might be the work of Eike of Repgow, the author of the \"Sachsenspiegel\" (a Low German work on law), but this hypothesis—which depended in part on the assumption that the original work was Low German—has been abandoned.

The series has spawned fan groups, gaming groups, costumed events (such as the Borderzone parties in Los Angeles), and was discussed in \"The Fence and the River: Culture and Politics at the US-Mexico Border\" by Claire F. Fox.\n\nBordertown is the name of the shared universe created by Terri Windling, and a fictional place within that universe. The premise of the \"Borderland\" books is, at some point in the near future, the \"Elflands\" - the realm of magic populated by post-Tolkien elves - will \"return\" to \"The World\", and its place in juxtaposition with \"The World\".\n\nThe region of this juxtaposition (which seems at times to be New York City and at other times to be geographically underspecified) is called the \"Borderland\" or \"Borderlands\". The dystopian metropolis that lies along the Border, which combines urban fantasy of various forms with a vaguely post-apocalyptic atmosphere, is \"Bordertown\" or \"B-Town\". In the liminal environment of Bordertown and its environs, neither magic nor technology functions \"normally\", and unpredictable combinations of the two may emerge.\n\nThe \"Borderlands\" series, created for teenage readers, focuses primarily but not exclusively on the disenfranchised youth culture of Bordertown, as manifest in gang violence, race relations, and miscegenation, impromptu forms of social organization, class conflict, generation gaps, and literary criticism. The music of the 1980s is a significant influence.\n\nIn 2011 Terri Windling and Endicott Studio released a new Bordertown anthology titled \"Welcome to Bordertown\".\n\n\n\n"}

In his preface, dated Oct. 1, 1788, he explains that his intended audience is (commanded) servants rather than aristocrats: \"I presume to offer the following Sheets to the Public, in hopes that they will find the Directions and Receipts more intelligible than in most Books of the Kind. I have bestowed every Pains to render them easily practicable, and adapted to the Capacities of those who may be ordered to use them.\" The historian Gilly Lehmann comments that in this preface, Briggs was stressing \"his simple style in terms reminiscent of Hannah Glasse\". The book was expensive, its price of 7 shillings placing it at \"the upper end of the market.\"\n\nThe book contains a high proportion of French recipes for its period, Elizabeth Raffald's \"The Experienced English Housekeeper\" in comparison having far fewer. French or partly French titles include \"Poulet a la Braize\", \"Soup a la Reine\" and \"Rump of Beef a la Doube\". Despite these elegant foreign dishes, Briggs felt able to include homely English foods such as toad in a hole, though it did include \"beaten ginger, and a little grated nutmeg\", and used a \"veiney piece of beef\" rather than sausages.\n\nThe book contains several examples of Anglo-Indian influence. In the Pickling chapter, there are \"Mock Ginger\", \"Melon Mangoes\", and \"Elder Shoots in Imitation of Bamboo\". Briggs gives recipes for curries of veal and of chicken, calling for the use of \"curric powder\".\n\nThe book is strictly organised into 38 chapters with clearly distinct themes.\nMany of the chapters have an introductory paragraph stating \"Proper rules to be observed in\" its theme.\n\nThe recipes are given as names of dishes, such as \"Oyster Sauce for Fish\", with a paragraph of instructions. There are no lists of ingredients. Quantities are given where needed, in whatever measure is convenient, as \"a pint of large oysters\", \"half a pound of butter\", \"a quarter of a lemon\", or \"a spoonful of anchovy liquor\". Cooking instructions rely on the observation of the cook, as \"boil it up gently till the butter is melted, and the sauce thick and smooth\".\n\nPage numbers apply to the first edition.\n\nThe book was illustrated with 12 copper-plate engravings of Bills of Fare for the 12 months of the year, each one being a table layout of oval or octagonal dishes. These plates preceded the first chapter.\n\nMany species of bird were eaten in eighteenth century England; Briggs describes how to roast \"Ruffs and Reeves\" from Lincolnshire and the Isle of Ely; Ortolan buntings; larks; plovers; wheatears from the South Downs, as well as wild ducks, woodcocks and snipes.\n\nThe book contains recipes for ketchups made with mushrooms or walnuts. It also describes how to make puff pastry, which Briggs used in both savoury and sweet dishes.\n\nThe book appeared in the following editions.\n\n\n\"The Monthly Review\" of 1789 \"confessed that there may be, and actually are, subjects, both above and below our reach; and we now acknowledge that cookery is one of them.\" It agreed with the proverb that the proof of the pudding was in the eating, but \"none of the corps [of reviewers] will venture to say how the pudding should \"be made\".\"\n\n\"The Critical Review, or Annals of Literature\" of 1790 more boldly asserted that the book \"appears to be a work of great merit\", but, stating that cooks were \"a numerous body, and we are not sufficient adepts to decide on their different pretensions\", confined itself to quoting Briggs's credentials from the title page, and confirming that he \"is now at the Temple Coffee-house, where we have tasted, with pleasure, several excellent dishes of his composition.\"\n\n"}

Working with her husband Frank, she wrote multiple acclaimed books and built a massive collection of toys that is now part of a significant museum.\n\nBorn on 6 June 1913, Caplan collaborated with her husband in authoring multiple books that studied the ways in which children played, whether alone or individually, and at different ages; for example, one of their books, \"The First Twelve Months of Life\", concentrated on infants but included observations of children two years old and comparisons with adult trade unions.\n\nDuring World War II, while living in northern Manhattan, New York City, the Caplans founded a workshop on 95th Street to manufacture and sell wooden toys for children. From its earliest years, Theresa was involved with her husband's company: when it was a single small store, she worked with customers while Frank completed their orders. War shortages increased their profits: wooden toys were rare during the war, so the high quality of toys that the couple manufactured was popularized by word of mouth, and their business grew significantly. In 1949, they named the business \"Creative Playthings\", which operated until its sale in 1966. As it expanded, the couple travelled around the world to find models for their crafts; by the 1980s, they had accumulated more than fifty thousand individual toys as models, and they gradually began to see themselves as collectors. Because their work and their collection were both international, they were able by themselves to produce a display that was featured at the United Nations Headquarters as part of the International Year of the Child in 1979.\n\nIn 1984, while living in Princeton, New Jersey, the Caplans chose to donate their collection to The Children's Museum of Indianapolis; the collection was so massive that the museum needed nine months to unpack the thirty-two crates used to transport it. After the donation was complete, Frank died in 1988 at the age of seventy-seven. After Frank's death, Theresa remembered herself as having been more active in collecting than her husband for a time, but noted that their collection truly began to grow in 1966, as the sale of the business permitted Frank to pay less attention to financial matters. Described as enthusiastic and extroverted, Caplan was a detailed record-keeper. She was careful to assign every object in the collection a unique identifier as well as recording the country of origin for every object, and she ensured that all boxes were separately identified. Written on twenty thousand index cards, her records filled twenty-eight shoe boxes by the time that the collection was donated to Indianapolis.\n\nTheresa died in Princeton on 13 April 2010 at the age of 96. She was survived by her son Richard, her daughter Judith Inglese, nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.\n"}

It was originally edited by Lü Shuxiang and Ding Shengshu as a reference work on modern Standard Chinese. Compilation started in 1958 and trial editions were issued in 1960 and 1965, with a number of copies printed in 1973 for internal circulation and comments, but due to the Cultural Revolution the final draft was not completed until the end of 1977, and the first formal edition was not published until December 1978. It was the first People's Republic of China dictionary to be arranged according to Hanyu Pinyin, the phonetic standard for Standard Chinese, with explanatory notes in simplified Chinese. The subsequent second through seventh editions were respectively published in 1983 (Reorganized Edition- now seen as the '2nd edition'), 1996 (Revised Edition- now seen as the '3rd edition'), 2002 (2002 Supplemental Edition- now seen as the '4th edition'), 2005 (5th edition), 2012 (6th edition) and 2016 (7th edition).\n\nIn 1994, \"A Dictionary of Current Chinese\" won China's First National Book Award. The seventh edition contains about 70,000 entries including characters, words and expressions, idiomatic phrases and idioms. The dictionary is also available in digital format on CD-ROMs and Traditional Chinese digital versions.\n\n\"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\" was consulted in the writing of \"The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms\".\n\nPublished in 2001 by the Commercial Press (Hong Kong). It contains about 60,000 entries, all entries labeled with Zhuyin alongside Hanyu Pinyin.\n\n\n\"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\" had given discriminatory explanations to certain words and phrases. An example was the word \"homosexuality\" (). From the first edition in the 1970's (the entry in that edition is \"tóngxìng liàn'ài\" - literally 'same-sex love') to the fifth edition in 2005 of \"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\", the definition of the term had been \"determined\" as \"\"a type of psychological perversion\". In the 2012 6th edition & 2016 7th edition, the term was redefined as \"sexual behaviour between persons of the same sex\"\", with no obvious discrimination in the content.\n\nIn the sixth edition, even though it contains a large number of new vocabulary, the word 同志 \"Tóngzhì\" (\"comrade\") which is an informal term for \"a homosexual person\", was not included in the dictionary. This could be because the term is often construed as a sarcastic reference to the Communist Party of China, according to Sociology Professor of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The original term is a common form of political address in China, e.g. \"Comrade Hu Jintao\", \"Comrade Wen Jiabao\".\n\nSome detractors complained that \"Entries starting with the Western alphabet\" section in the 6th edition allegedly violated the regulation - \"Chinese language publications shall comply with the norms and standards of the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese language\" in laws such as the \"\" and \"Publication Control Regulations\" of the State Council (State Council Act No. 594). The act of using English vocabulary in the main body of a Chinese dictionary, and using English to substitute for Chinese characters, according to these detractors, will cause the greatest damage to the Chinese characters since the romanization of Chinese, and will have a long-term negative impact on the language.\n\nThe publisher, the Commercial Press, replied that the section is meant just for easy references when looking up the dictionary. The Commercial Press says that according to a rule stated in a 2010 document by the State Council Office Secretariat, alphabetical entries recorded in Chinese dictionaries written by state authorities did not have corresponding Chinese translations. Hence, it is absolutely fine to include them in dictionaries.\n\n\n"}
