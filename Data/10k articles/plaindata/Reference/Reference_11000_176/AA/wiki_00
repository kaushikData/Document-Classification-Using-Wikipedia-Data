The Boeremag were accused of planning to overthrow the ruling African National Congress government and to reinstate a new Boer-administered republic reminiscent of the era when Boers administered independent republics during the 19th century following the Great Trek.\n\nSouth African law-enforcement officials charge the Boeremag for being responsible for the 2002 Soweto bombings and arrested twenty-six men, alleged to be members of the Boeremag, in November and December 2002, reportedly seizing over 1,000 kilograms of explosives in the process. Further arrests followed in March 2003.\n\nIt has since been alleged that the Boeremag case was orchestrated by the Crime Intelligence Department of the South African ANC government as exposed by ex-crime intelligence captain Deon Loots in his affidavit to the High Court which was published in various media articles.\n\nIt has also been revealed that the South African government provides an annual slush fund of R600,000,000 for its crime intelligence department to source any anti-government movement, which does not require accounting for.\nThe first trial of Boeremag suspects began under tight security in Pretoria during May 2003. Twenty-two men were charged with forty-two counts of treason, murder, and illegal weapons possession. Six pleaded not guilty, two have not entered pleas, one refuses to plead, and thirteen are challenging the court's jurisdiction, alleging that the post-apartheid constitution and government of South Africa are illegitimate.\n\nDuring the trial plans to blow up South African actor Casper de Vries together with eight other individuals were revealed. The group is quoted as saying that the reason for this plan was because De Vries \"was not on the right path\".\n\nIn October 2004 the Pretoria High Court heard testimony from a witness, Deon Crous, who stated under oath that he had assisted two of the accused, Kobus Pretorius and Jacques Jordaan, to manufacture 1500 kg of explosives. Crous testified that five amounts of 300 kg were reserved for five separate bombs. One of the planned bomb attacks was cancelled as there was too high a risk of white civilians being injured. The bombs were to be detonated on December 13, 2002, with various attacks planned to follow the bombings.\n\nIn early May 2006 Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the leading members being tried, were reported to have escaped. The two men were recaptured on 20 January 2007 and were set to appear in court to face charges of escape and the illegal possession of firearms.\n\nIn late October 2013, Mike du Toit, the ringleader of a plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela and expel Black people out of South Africa, was convicted of treason and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Twenty other members of Boeremag were also sentenced to prison terms of between five and 35 years. They included Herman van Rooyen and Rudi Gouws, two of the co-conspirators of Du Toit who were given longer sentences for their role in planting bombs in their attempt to assassinate Nelson Mandela.\n\nThese men have been imprisoned since 2002. The trial lasted 11 years.\n\n\n"}

It was probably composed by Juan de Soria, the Bishop of Osma and chancellor of Ferdinand III, between 1217 and 1239. The majority of the text deals with the reigns of Alfonso VIII (1158–1214) and Ferdinand III (1217–1252). It was designed with two purposes: for use at the royal court as a \"speculum principis\" and to defend the interests of Castile against those of the Kingdom of León. \n\nThe \"Chronica\" originally ended in 1230 with the death of Alfonso IX of León, who was succeeded by Ferdinand III. Modern historians disagree whether the continuation down to the capture of Córdoba six years later was written by Juan de Soria or by another author. One has even suggested a composition in three stages between 1223 and 1237 by the same author, Juan de Soria. The sources of the \"Chronica\" were the documents of the royal archives, to which its author had access, although he also records events from memory. He makes little use of other narrative histories, which were the main sources of the contemporary chronicles called \"Chronicon mundi\" and \"De rebus Hispaniae\". Juan also includes contemporaneous events from the Maghrib, the Byzantine Empire, and the Kingdom of France in order to place Castilian history in context, something neither the \"Chronicon\" nor the \"De rebus\" do, although the later histories composed at the request of Alfonso X, the \"Grande e general estoria\" and the \"Estoria de España\" do. \n\nThe \"Chronica\" is preserved in only one late fifteenth-century manuscript, MS G-1 or 9/450, in the library of the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid. It is a copy of the original and is found on folios 89 through 122. The structure found in most printed editions, of four sections subdivided into chapters, was added by its first editor, Georges Cirot. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "80128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80128", "title": "Daniel Ellsberg", "text": "Daniel Ellsberg\n\nDaniel Ellsberg (born April 7, 1931) is an American activist and former United States military analyst who, while employed by the RAND Corporation, precipitated a national political controversy in 1971 when he released the \"Pentagon Papers\", a top-secret Pentagon study of the U.S. government decision-making in relation to the Vietnam War, to \"The New York Times\" and other newspapers.\n\nOn January 3, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years. Due to governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering, and the defense by Leonard Boudin and Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson, Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. dismissed all charges against Ellsberg on May 11, 1973.\n\nEllsberg was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 2006. He is also known for having formulated an important example in decision theory, the Ellsberg paradox, and for having voiced support for WikiLeaks, Chelsea Manning, and Edward Snowden.\n\nEllsberg was born in Chicago, Illinois on April 7, 1931, the son of Harry and Adele (Charsky) Ellsberg. His parents were Ashkenazi Jews who had converted to Christian Science, and he was raised as a Christian Scientist. He grew up in Detroit and attended the Cranbrook School in nearby Bloomfield Hills. His mother wanted him to be a concert pianist, but he stopped playing in July 1946, after both his mother and sister were killed when his father fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the family car into a culvert wall.\n\nEllsberg entered Harvard College on a scholarship, graduating \"summa cum laude\" with an A.B. in economics in 1952. He studied at the University of Cambridge for a year on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, then returned to Harvard for graduate school. In 1954, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and earned a commission. He served as a platoon leader and company commander in the 2nd Marine Division, and was discharged in 1957 as a first lieutenant. Ellsberg returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows for two years.\n\nEllsberg began working as a strategic analyst at the RAND Corporation for the summer of 1958 and then permanently in 1958. He concentrated on nuclear strategy and the command and control of nuclear weapons.\n\nEllsberg completed a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1962. His dissertation on decision theory was based on a set of thought experiments that showed that decisions under conditions of uncertainty or ambiguity generally may not be consistent with well defined subjective probabilities. Now known as the Ellsberg paradox, this formed the basis of a large literature that has developed since the 1980s, including approaches such as Choquet expected utility and info-gap decision theory.\n\nEllsberg worked in the Pentagon from August 1964 under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara as special assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs John McNaughton. He then went to South Vietnam for two years, working for General Edward Lansdale as a member of the State Department.\n\nOn his return from South Vietnam, Ellsberg resumed working at RAND. In 1967, he contributed to a top-secret study of classified documents on the conduct of the Vietnam War that had been commissioned by Defense Secretary McNamara. These documents, completed in 1968, later became known collectively as the Pentagon Papers.\n\nThrough study of this body of US government records, Ellsberg came to understand about the Vietnam War that:\nIt was no more a \"civil war\" after 1955 or 1960 than it had been during the U.S.-supported French attempt at colonial reconquest. A war in which one side was \"entirely\" equipped and paid by a foreign power – which dictated the nature of the local regime in its own interest – was not a civil war. To say that we had \"interfered\" in what is \"really a civil war,\" as most American academic writers and even liberal critics of the war do to this day, simply screened a more painful reality and was as much a myth as the earlier official one of \"aggression from the North.\" In terms of the UN Charter and of our own avowed ideals, it was a war of foreign aggression, American aggression.\nBy 1969 Ellsberg began attending anti-war events while still remaining in his position at RAND. He experienced an epiphany attending a War Resisters League conference at Haverford College in August 1969, listening to a speech given by a draft resister named Randy Kehler, who said he was \"very excited\" that he would soon be able to join his friends in prison.\nEllsberg described his reaction:\n\nDecades later, reflecting on Kehler's decision, Ellsberg said:\n\nAfter leaving Rand, Ellsberg went to work for MIT as a senior research fellow.\n\nIn late 1969, with the assistance of his former RAND Corporation colleague Anthony Russo, Ellsberg secretly made several sets of photocopies of the classified documents to which he had access; these later became known as the \"Pentagon Papers\". They revealed that, early on, the government had knowledge that the war as then resourced could most likely not be won. Further, as an editor of \"The New York Times\" was to write much later, these documents \"demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration had systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress, about a subject of transcendent national interest and significance\".\n\nShortly after Ellsberg copied the documents, he resolved to meet some of the people who had influenced both his change of heart on the war and his decision to act. One of them was Randy Kehler. Another was the poet Gary Snyder, whom he had met in Kyoto in 1960, and with whom he had argued about U.S. foreign policy; Ellsberg was finally prepared to concede that Gary Snyder had been right, about both the situation and the need for action against it.\n\nThroughout 1970, Ellsberg covertly attempted to persuade a few sympathetic U.S. Senators—among them J. William Fulbright, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and George McGovern, a leading opponent of the war—to release the papers on the Senate floor, because a Senator could not be prosecuted for anything he said on the record before the Senate.\n\nEllsberg allowed some copies of the documents to circulate privately, including among scholars at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). Ellsberg also shared the documents with \"The New York Times\" correspondent Neil Sheehan, who wrote a story based on what he had received both directly from Ellsberg and from contacts at IPS.\n\nOn Sunday, June 13, 1971, the \"Times\" published the first of nine excerpts from, and commentaries on, the 7,000 page collection. For 15 days, the \"Times\" was prevented from publishing its articles by court order requested by the Nixon administration. Meanwhile, while eluding an FBI manhunt for thirteen days, Ellsberg leaked the documents to \"The Washington Post\" and 17 other newspapers. On June 30, the US Supreme Court ordered free resumption of publication by the \"Times\" (\"New York Times Co. v. United States\"). Two days prior to the Supreme Court's decision, Ellsberg publicly admitted his role in releasing the Pentagon Papers to the press.\n\nOn June 29, 1971, U.S. Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska entered 4,100 pages of the Papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds—pages which he had received from Ellsberg via Ben Bagdikian, then an editor at the \"Washington Post\".\n\nThe release of these papers was politically embarrassing not only to those involved in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations but also to the incumbent Nixon administration. Nixon's Oval Office tape from June 14, 1971, shows H. R. Haldeman describing the situation to Nixon:\n\nJohn Mitchell, Nixon's Attorney General, almost immediately issued a telegram to the \"Times\" ordering that it halt publication. The \"Times\" refused, and the government brought suit against it.\n\nAlthough the \"Times\" eventually won the trial before the Supreme Court, prior to that, an appellate court ordered that the \"Times\" temporarily halt further publication. This was the first time the federal government was able to restrain the publication of a major newspaper since the presidency of Abraham Lincoln during the U.S. Civil War. Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers to seventeen other newspapers in rapid succession. The right of the press to publish the papers was upheld in \"New York Times Co. v. United States\". The Supreme Court ruling has been called one of the \"modern pillars\" of First Amendment rights with respect to freedom of the press.\n\nIn response to the leaks, Nixon White House staffers began a campaign against further leaks and against Ellsberg personally. Aides Egil Krogh and David Young, under the supervision of John Ehrlichman, created the \"White House Plumbers\", which would later lead to the Watergate burglaries.\n\nIn August 1971, Krogh and Young met with G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt in a basement office in the Old Executive Office Building. Hunt and Liddy recommended a \"covert operation\" to get a \"mother lode\" of information about Ellsberg's mental state in order to discredit him. Krogh and Young sent a memo to Ehrlichman seeking his approval for a \"covert operation [to] be undertaken to examine all of the medical files still held by Ellsberg's psychiatrist\", Lewis Fielding. Ehrlichman approved under the condition that it be \"done under your assurance that it is not traceable.\"\n\nOn September 3, 1971, the burglary of Fielding's office—titled \"Hunt/Liddy Special Project No. 1\" in Ehrlichman's notes—was carried out by White House Plumbers Hunt, Liddy, Eugenio Martínez, Felipe de Diego and Bernard Barker (the latter three were, or had been, recruited CIA agents). The Plumbers found Ellsberg's file, but it apparently did not contain the potentially embarrassing information they sought, as they left it discarded on the floor of Fielding's office. Hunt and Liddy subsequently planned to break into Fielding's home, but Ehrlichman did not approve the second burglary. The break-in was not known to Ellsberg or to the public until it came to light during Ellsberg and Russo's trial in April 1973.\n\nOn June 28, 1971, two days before a Supreme Court ruling saying that a federal judge had ruled incorrectly about the right of \"The New York Times\" to publish the Pentagon Papers, Ellsberg publicly surrendered to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts in Boston. In admitting to giving the documents to the press, Ellsberg said:\nHe and Russo faced charges under the Espionage Act of 1917 and other charges including theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years for Ellsberg, 35 years for Russo. Their trial commenced in Los Angeles on January 3, 1973, presided over by U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. Ellsberg tried to claim that the documents were \"illegally\" classified to keep them not from an enemy but from the American public. However, that argument was ruled \"irrelevant\". Ellsberg was silenced before he could begin. Ellsberg said, in 2014, that his \"lawyer, exasperated, said he 'had never heard of a case where a defendant was not permitted to tell the jury why he did what he did.' The judge responded: 'Well, you're hearing one now'. And so it has been with every subsequent whistleblower under indictment\".\n\nIn spite of being effectively denied a defense, Ellsberg began to see events turn in his favor when the break-in of Fielding's office was revealed to Judge Byrne in a memo on April 26; Byrne ordered it to be shared with the defense.\n\nOn May 9, further evidence of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg was revealed in court. The FBI had recorded numerous conversations between Morton Halperin and Ellsberg without a court order, and furthermore the prosecution had failed to share this evidence with the defense. During the trial, Byrne also revealed that he personally met twice with John Ehrlichman, who offered him directorship of the FBI. Byrne said he refused to consider the offer while the Ellsberg case was pending, though he was criticized for even agreeing to meet with Ehrlichman during the case.\n\nDue to the gross governmental misconduct and illegal evidence gathering, and the defense by Leonard Boudin and Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson, Judge Byrne dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973 after the government claimed it had lost records of wiretapping against Ellsberg. Byrne ruled: \"The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case.\"\n\nAs a result of the revelations involving the Watergate scandal, John Ehrlichman, H. R. Haldeman, Richard Kleindienst, and John Dean were forced out of office on April 30, and all would later be convicted of crimes related to Watergate. Egil Krogh later pleaded guilty to conspiracy, and White House counsel Charles Colson pleaded no contest for obstruction of justice in the burglary.\n\nIt was also revealed in 1973, during Ellsberg's trial, that the telephone calls of Mort Halperin, a member of the U.S. National Security Council staff suspected of leaking information about the secret bombing of Cambodia to \"The New York Times\", were being recorded by the FBI at the request of Henry Kissinger to J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nHalperin and his family sued several federal officials, claiming the wiretap violated their Fourth Amendment rights and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The court agreed that Richard Nixon, John Mitchell, and H. R. Haldeman had violated the Halperins' Fourth Amendment rights and awarded them $1 in nominal damages.\n\nEllsberg later claimed that after his trial ended, Watergate prosecutor William H. Merrill informed him of an aborted plot by Liddy and the \"Plumbers\" to have 12 Cuban Americans who had previously worked for the CIA \"totally incapacitate\" Ellsberg when he appeared at a public rally. It is unclear whether they were meant to assassinate Ellsberg or merely to hospitalize him. In his autobiography, Liddy describes an \"Ellsberg neutralization proposal\" originating from Howard Hunt, which involved drugging Ellsberg with LSD, by dissolving it in his soup, at a fund-raising dinner in Washington in order to \"have Ellsberg incoherent by the time he was to speak\" and thus \"make him appear a near burnt-out drug case\" and \"discredit him.\" The plot involved waiters from the Miami Cuban community. According to Liddy, when the plan was finally approved, \"there was no longer enough lead time to get the Cuban waiters up from their Miami hotels and into place in the Washington Hotel where the dinner was to take place\" and the plan was \"put into abeyance pending another opportunity.\"\n\nSince the end of the Vietnam War, Ellsberg has continued his political activism, giving lecture tours and speaking out about current events. Reflecting on his time in government, Ellsberg has said the following, based on his extensive access to classified material:\n\nIn an interview with \"Democracy Now\" on May 18, 2018, Ellsberg has been critical of U.S. intervention overseas especially in the Middle East, stating, \"I think, in Iraq, America has never faced up to the number of people who have died because of our invasion, our aggression against Iraq, and Afghanistan over the last 30 years, since we first inspired a CIA-sponsored jihad against the Soviets there, and led to the invasion by the Soviets. What we’ve done to the Middle East has been hell.\"\n\nDuring the runup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq he warned of a possible \"Tonkin Gulf scenario\" that could be used to justify going to war, and called on government \"insiders\" to go public with information to counter the Bush administration's pro-war propaganda campaign, praising Scott Ritter for his efforts in that regard. He later supported the whistleblowing efforts of British GCHQ translator Katharine Gun and called on others to leak any papers that reveal government deception about the invasion. Ellsberg also testified at the 2004 conscientious objector hearing of Camilo Mejia at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n\nEllsberg was arrested, in November 2005, for violating a county ordinance for trespassing while protesting against George W. Bush's conduct of the Iraq War.\n\nHe is a member of Campaign for Peace and Democracy.\n\nIn September 2006, Ellsberg wrote in \"Harper's Magazine\" that he hoped someone would leak information about a potential U.S. invasion of Iran before the invasion happened, to stop the war. Ellsberg called for further leaks following the release of information on the acceleration of U.S.-sponsored anti-government activity in Iran that was leaked to journalist Seymour Hersh. In November 2007, Ellsberg was interviewed by Brad Friedman on his blog in regard to former FBI translator turned whistle blower Sibel Edmonds. \"I'd say what she has is far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers\", Ellsberg told Friedman.\n\nIn a speech on March 30, 2008 in San Francisco's Unitarian Universalist church, Ellsberg observed that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doesn't really have the authority to declare impeachment \"off the table\". The oath of office taken by members of congress requires them to \"defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic\". He also argued that under the U.S. Constitution, treaties, including the United Nations Charter, become the supreme law of the land that neither the states, the president, nor the congress have the power to break. For example, if the Congress votes to authorize an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation, that authorization wouldn't make the attack legal. A president citing the authorization as just cause could be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court for war crimes.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, Ellsberg appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" where he commented that the existence of WikiLeaks helps to build a better government.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, Ellsberg, along with 35 other demonstrators, was arrested during a demonstration outside the Marine Corps Base Quantico, in protest of Manning's current detention at Marine Corps Brig, Quantico.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, Ellsberg published an editorial in \"The Guardian\" newspaper praising the actions of former Booz Allen worker Edward Snowden in revealing top-secret surveillance programs of the NSA. Ellsberg believes that the United States has fallen into an \"abyss\" of total tyranny, but said that because of Snowden's revelations, \"I see the unexpected possibility of a way up and out of the abyss.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Ellsberg and numerous celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning.\n\nOn June 17, 2010, Ellsberg was interviewed regarding the parallels between his actions in releasing the Pentagon Papers and those of Private First Class Chelsea Manning, who was arrested by the U.S. military in Iraq after allegedly providing to WikiLeaks a classified video showing U.S. military helicopter gunships strafing and killing Iraqis alleged to be civilians, including two Reuters journalists. Manning claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with secret videos of additional massacres of alleged civilians in Afghanistan, as well as 260,000 classified State Department cables. Ellsberg said that he fears for Manning and for Julian Assange, as he feared for himself after the initial publication of the Pentagon Papers. WikiLeaks initially said it had not received the cables, but did plan to post the video of an attack that killed 86 to 145 Afghan civilians in the village of Garani. Ellsberg expressed hope that either Assange or President Obama would post the video, and expressed his strong support for Assange and Manning, whom he called \"two new heroes of mine\".\n\n\"Democracy Now!\" devoted a substantial portion of its program July 4, 2013, to \"How the Pentagon Papers Came to be Published By the Beacon Press Told by Daniel Ellsberg & Others.\" Ellsberg said there are hundreds of public officials right now who know that the public is being lied to about Iran. They all took an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States, not the commander-in-chief, not superior officers. If they follow orders, they may become complicit in starting an unnecessary war. If they are faithful to their oath, they could prevent that war. Exposing official lies could however carry a heavy personal cost as they could be imprisoned for unlawful disclosure of classified information.\n\nIn 2012, Ellsberg became one of the co-founders of the Freedom of the Press Foundation.\n\nEllsberg is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.\nIn September 2015 Ellsberg and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture.\n\nIn December 2015, Ellsberg publicly supported the Tor anonymity network, referencing its utility for whistle blowing in general for the maintenance of democracy via the First Amendment.\n\nOn November 16, 2011 Ellsberg camped on the UC Berkeley Sproul Plaza as part of an effort to support the Occupy Cal movement.\n\nIn December 2017, Ellsberg published \"The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner,\" a book with his recollections and analysis of a second cache of secret documents related to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The book stated that US governments documents revealed that President Eisenhower empowered a few top military officers to be able to use nuclear weapons without presidential authorization in case there was incapacitation or no way to contact the president. Ellsberg believes that similar procedures remain in place today – in sharp contrast to what the American public is told about how the \"nuclear football\" works. In the book, Ellsberg revealed that he had made copies of sensitive U.S. nuclear planning materials and memos he had reviewed during his time at the RAND Corporation, and intended to leak them to the public shortly after the Pentagon Papers were published. However, during the time of Ellsberg's trial, these nuclear planning materials were hidden in a briefcase buried in a landfill, and were lost when an unexpected tropical storm descended on the region.\n\nEllsberg is the recipient of the Inaugural Ron Ridenhour Courage Prize, a prize established by The Nation Institute and The Fertel Foundation. In 1978 he accepted the Gandhi Peace Award from Promoting Enduring Peace. On September 28, 2006 he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award. He received the Dresden Peace Prize in 2016.\n\nEllsberg has been married twice. His first marriage was to Carol Cummings, a graduate of Radcliffe (now Harvard College) whose father was a Marine Corps brigadier general. It lasted 13 years before ending in divorce (at her request, as he stated in his memoir \"Secrets\"). They have two children, Robert Ellsberg and Mary Ellsberg. In 1970, he married Patricia Marx, daughter of toy maker Louis Marx. They are the parents of a son, Michael Ellsberg, who is an author and journalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "309191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309191", "title": "Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand", "text": "Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand\n\nThe Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand (), signed by a number of Māori chiefs in 1835, proclaimed the sovereign independence of New Zealand prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.\n\nIn 1834, James Busby, the official British Resident in New Zealand, drafted a document known as the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand, which he and 34 northern Māori chiefs—including Tāmati Wāka Nene, Tītore and Bay of Islands brothers; Te Wharerahi, Rewa, and Moka Te Kainga-mataa—signed at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. By 1839, 52 chiefs had signed.\n\nIn the process of signing, the chiefs established themselves as representing a confederation under the title of the \"United Tribes of New Zealand\". Missionaries Henry Williams and George Clarke translated the Declaration and signed as witnesses; merchants James Clendon and Gilbert Mair also signed as witnesses.\n\nThe Declaration arose in response to concerns over the lawlessness of British subjects in New Zealand, and in response to a fear that France would declare sovereignty over the islands. At this time a Frenchman, Charles de Thierry—who titled himself 'Charles, Baron de Tierry, Sovereign Chief of New Zealand and King of Nuku Hiva' (in the Marquesas Islands)—was seeking to establish a colony on a plot of land he claimed to have purchased in the Hokianga. The document also arose from movements in Māori society. From 1816 onwards, a number of Northern Māori chiefs had made visits to the colonies in New South Wales and Norfolk Island, as well as to England, leading to discussions about unifying the tribes and the formation of a Māori government. Māori had become involved in international trade and owned trading ships. In 1834, the chiefs had selected a flag for use on ships originating from New Zealand.\n\nThe need for a flag of New Zealand first became clear when the merchant ship the \"Sir George Murray\", built in the Hokianga, was seized by customs officials in the port of Sydney. The ship had been sailing without a flag—a violation of British navigation laws. New Zealand was not a colony at the time and had no flag. The ship's detainment reportedly aroused indignation among the Māori population. Unless a flag was selected, ships would continue to be seized. The flag, amended slightly when officially gazetted, became the first distinctively New Zealand flag. As late as 1900 it was still being used to depict New Zealand, and it appeared on the South African War Medal which was issued to New Zealand soldiers of the Boer War and was inscribed with the phrase \"Success to New Zealand Contingent 1899–1900\". The unamended version of the flag, with eight-pointed stars and black fimbriation, is still widely used by Māori groups.\n\nThe hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes of the northern parts of New Zealand declared the constitution of an independent state. They agreed to meet in Waitangi each year to frame laws, and invited the southern tribes of New Zealand to \"lay aside their private animosities\" and join them.\n\nThe Māori text of the Declaration was made by the \"tino rangatira\" (hereditary chiefs) of the northern part of New Zealand and uses the term \"Rangatiratanga\" to mean independence, declaring the country a \"whenua Rangatira\" (independent state) to be known as The United Tribes of New Zealand (Te Wakaminenga o nga Hapu o Nu Tireni).\n\nThe translation of the second paragraph is \"that all sovereign power and authority in the land\" (\"Ko te Kingitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua\") should \"reside entirely and exclusively in the hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes in their collective capacity\", expressed as the United Tribes of New Zealand.\n\nThe terms \"Kingitanga\" and \"man\"a were used in claiming sovereignty of the state to the assembly of the hereditary chiefs, and it was also declared that no government (\"kawanatanga\") would exist except by persons appointed by the assembly of hereditary chiefs.\n\nThe signatories sent a copy of the document to King William IV (who reigned from 1830 to 1837), asking him to act as the protector of the new state. The King had previously acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and now recognised the Declaration in a letter from Lord Glenelg (British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies) dated 25 May 1836. \n\nIt read, in part:\n\nThe Declaration was not well received by the Colonial Office, and it was decided that a new policy for New Zealand was needed as a corrective.\n\nIt is notable that the Treaty of Waitangi was made between the British Crown and \"the chiefs of the United Tribes of New Zealand\" in recognition of their independent sovereignty.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the Declaration had any legal effect in New Zealand. Most legal commentators argue that the claim to independence lasted only until the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. In 2010 the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) in Northland requested that the Waitangi Tribunal rule on whether the tribe had in fact relinquished sovereignty in 1840 when they signed the Treaty. Historian Paul Moon has stated that the tribe is unlikely to be able to take the claim much further because \"the tribe has misunderstood how treaties work.\"\n\nArticle 2 of the Treaty of Waitangi guarantees to the chiefs their continued chieftainship, and ownership of their lands and treasures (\"taonga\"). It also specifies that Māori could sell land only to the Crown. Most New Zealanders consider the Treaty of Waitangi to be the nation's founding document, with formal sovereignty vested in the British Crown (the Crown in Right of New Zealand from 1947), but the existence of different versions of the Treaty, in both Māori and English, and its brevity, leave this subject to arguments over the preferred interpretation.\n\nBut \"de facto\", the federation of independent tribes became subsumed into a new political body after 1840, regardless of the legality or legitimacy of this process. Thus, the Treaty of Waitangi voided the Declaration for all practical purposes; it is the Treaty, rather than the Declaration, that provides the legal foundation of claims for the redress of historical wrongs. For this reason, constitutional lawyers regard the Declaration as a historical document that no longer has legal force.\n\nIn 2010 the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing Ngāpuhi's claim that sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in their \"Te Paparahi o te Raki\" inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of the Declaration and the Treaty. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the Māori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.\n\nMany of the arguments used are outlined in Paul Moon's book \"Te Ara Ki Te Tiriti: The Path to the Treaty of Waitangi\" (2003), which argued that not only did the Māori signatories have no intention of transferring sovereignty, but that at the time the British government and James Busby did not wish to acquire it and that the developments and justifications leading to the present state were later developments. It is estimated that the hearings will last between 4 and 6 years, and may stand as a precedent for all iwi if the Tribunal recognises Ngāpuhi sovereignty. A common Ngāpuhi interpretation of the Declaration of the United Tribes is that the British government was simply recognising Māori independence and putting the world on notice, merely re-asserting sovereignty that had existed \"from time immemorial\".\n\nThe first stage of the report was released in November 2014, and found that Māori chiefs never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report's release to the Ngapuhi claimants:\n\nThe second stage of the report will be written up after final submissions are received in May 2018.\n\n\n"}

This is often accomplished by archivists, librarians, scientists, historians, and scholars. Enterprises are starting to use digital curation to improve the quality of information and data within their operational and strategic processes. Successful digital curation will mitigate digital obsolescence, keeping the information accessible to users indefinitely.\n\nThe term \"curation\" in the past commonly referred to museum and library professionals. It has since been applied to interaction with social media including compiling digital images, web links and movie files.\n\nThe term “digital curation” was first used in the e-science and biological science fields as a means of differentiating the additional suite of activities ordinarily employed by library and museum curators to add value to their collections and enable its reuse from the smaller subtask of simply preserving the data, a significantly more concise archival task. Additionally, the historical understanding of the term “curator” demands more than simple care of the collection. A curator is expected to command academic mastery of the subject matter as a requisite part of appraisal and selection of assets and any subsequent adding of value to the collection through application of metadata.\n\nThere are five commonly accepted principles that govern the occupation of digital curation:\n\nThe Digital Curation Center offers the following step-by-step life cycle procedures for putting the above principles into practice:\n\nThe term \"digital curation\" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms such as \"digital preservation\" and \"digital archiving\". While digital preservation does focus a significant degree of energy on optimizing reusability, preservation remains a subtask to the concept of digital archiving, which is in turn a subtask of digital curation. For example, archiving is a part of curation, but so are subsequent tasks such as themed collection-building, which is not considered an archival task. Similarly, preservation is a part of archiving, but so are the important tasks of selection and appraisal that are not necessarily part of preservation.\n\nData curation is another term that is often used interchangeably with digital curation, however common usage of the two terms differs. While “data” is a more all-encompassing term that can be used generally to indicate anything recorded in binary form, the term “data curation” is most common in scientific parlance and usually refers to accumulating and managing information relative to the process of research. So, while documents and other discrete digital assets are technically a subset of the broader concept of data, in the context of scientific vernacular digital curation represents a broader purview of responsibilities than data curation due to its interest in preserving and adding value to digital assets of any kind.\n\nThe ever lowering cost, and increasing prevalence of entirely new categories of technology has led to a quickly growing flow of new data sets. These come from well established sources such as business and government, but the trend is also driven by new styles of sensors becoming embedded in more areas of modern life. This is particularly true of consumers, whose production of digital assets is no longer relegated strictly to work. Consumers now create wider ranges of digital assets, including videos, photos, location data, purchases, and fitness tracking data, just to name a few, and share them in wider ranges of social platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the advance of technology has introduced new ways of working with data. Some examples of this are international partnerships that leverage astronomical data to create “virtual observatories”, and similar partnerships have also leveraged data resulting from research at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and the database of protein structures at the Protein Data Bank.\n\nBy comparison, archiving of analog assets is notably passive in nature, often limited to simply ensuring a suitable storage environment. Digital preservation requires a more proactive approach. Today’s artifacts of cultural significance are notably transient in nature and prone to obsolescence when social trends or dependent technologies change. This rapid progression of technology occasionally makes it necessary to migrate digital asset holdings from one file format to another in order to mitigate the dangers of hardware and software obsolescence which would render the asset unusable.\n\nModern tools for program planning often underestimate the amount of human labor costs required for adequate digital curation of large collections. As a result cost-benefit assessments often paint an inaccurate picture of both the amount of work involved, and the true cost to the institution for both successful outcomes and failures.\n\nAn absence of coordination across different sectors of society and industry in areas such as the standardization of semantic and ontological definitions, and in forming partnerships for proper stewardship of assets has resulted in a lack of interoperability between institutions, and a partial breakdown in digital curation practice from the standpoint of the ordinary user.\n\nThe curation of digital objects is not limited to strictly born-digital assets. Many institutions have engaged in monumental efforts to digitize analog holdings in an effort to increase access to their collections. Examples of these materials are books, photographs, maps, audio recordings, and more. The process of converting printed resources into digital collections has been epitomized to some degree by librarians and related specialists. For example, The Digital Curation Centre is claimed to be a \"world leading centre of expertise in digital information curation\" that assists higher education research institutions in such conversions.\n\nFor some topics, knowledge is embodied in forms that have not been conducive to print, such as how choreography of dance or of the motion of skilled workers or artisans is difficult to encode. New digital approaches such as 3D holograms and other computer-programmed expressions are developing.\n\nFor mathematics, it seems possible for a new common language to be developed that would express mathematical ideas in ways that can be digitally stored, linked, and made accessible. The Global Digital Mathematics Library is a project to define and develop such a language.\n\nThe ability of the intended user community to access the repository’s holdings is of equal importance to all the preceding curatorial tasks. This must take into account not only the user community’s format and communication preferences, but also a consideration of communities that should not have access for various legal or privacy reasons.\n\n\nMany approaches to digital curation exist, and have evolved over time in response to the changing technological landscape. Two examples of this are sheer curation and channelization.\n\n\"Sheer curation\" is an approach to digital curation where curation activities are quietly integrated into the normal work flow of those creating and managing data and other digital assets. The word sheer is used to emphasize the lightweight and virtually transparent nature of these curation activities. The term \"sheer curation\" was coined by Alistair Miles in the ImageStore project, and the UK Digital Curation Centre's SCARP project. The approach depends on curators having close contact or 'immersion' in data creators' working practices. An example is the case study of a neuroimaging research group by Whyte et al., which explored ways of building its digital curation capacity around the apprenticeship style of learning of neuroimaging researchers, through which they share access to datasets and re-use experimental procedures.\n\nSheer curation depends on the hypothesis that good data and digital asset management at the point of creation and primary use is also good practice in preparation for sharing, publication and/or long-term preservation of these assets. Therefore, sheer curation attempts to identify and promote tools and good practices in local data and digital asset management in specific domains, where those tools and practices add immediate value to the creators and primary users of those assets. Curation can best be supported by identifying existing practices of sharing, stewardship and re-use that add value, and augmenting them in ways that both have short-term benefits, and in the longer term reduce risks to digital assets or provide new opportunities to sustain their long-term accessibility and re-use value.\n\nThe aim of sheer curation is to establish a solid foundation for other curation activities which may not directly benefit the creators and primary users of digital assets, especially those required to ensure long-term preservation. By providing this foundation, further curation activities may be carried out by specialists at appropriate institutional and organisation levels, whilst causing the minimum of interference to others.\n\nA similar idea is \"curation at source\" used in the context of Laboratory Information Management Systems LIMS. This refers more specifically to automatic recording of metadata or information about data at the point of capture, and has been developed to apply semantic web techniques to integrate laboratory instrumentation and documentation systems. Sheer curation and curation-at-source can be contrasted with post hoc digital preservation, where a project is initiated to preserve a collection of digital assets that have already been created and are beyond the period of their primary use.\n\n\"Channelization\" is curation of digital assets on the web, often by brands and media companies, into continuous flows of content, turning the user experience from a lean-forward interactive medium, to a lean-back passive medium. The curation of content can be done by an independent third party, that selects media from any number of on-demand outlets from across the globe and adds them to a playlist to offer a digital \"channel\" dedicated to certain subjects, themes, or interests so that the end user would see and/or hear a continuous stream of content.\n\n\n"}

Files are typically displayed in a hierarchical tree structure.\n\nA filename is a string used to uniquely identify a file stored on the file system of a computer. Before the advent of 32-bit operating systems, file names were typically limited to short names (6 to 14 characters in size). Modern operating systems now typically allow much longer filenames (more than 250 characters per pathname element).\n\nIn DOS, Windows, and OS/2, the root directory is \"\"drive\":\\\", for example, the root directory is usually \"C:\\\". The directory separator is usually a \"\\\", but the operating system also internally recognizes a \"/\". Physical and virtual drives are named by a drive letter, as opposed to being combined as one. This means that there is no \"formal\" root directory, but rather that there are independent root directories on each drive. However, it is possible to combine two drives into one virtual drive letter, by setting a hard drive into a RAID setting of 0.\n\nThe following folders may appear in the root of a boot partition.\n\nUnix and Unix-like operating systems use the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard as the common form for their directory structures.

It is part of a World Heritage Site, the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal.\n\nThe cathedral was commissioned by Andrew the Pious in his capital, Vladimir, and dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), whom he promoted as the patron saint of his lands. Originally erected in 1158 to 1160, the cathedral, with six pillars and five domes, was expanded in 1185 to 1189 to reflect the augmented prestige of Vladimir. At of 1178 m², it remained the largest of Russian churches for the next 300 or 400 years.\n\nAndrew the Pious, Vsevolod the Big Nest and other rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal were interred in the crypt of this church.

The interior was painted in the 12th century and then repainted by Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chernyi in 1408. The Dormition Cathedral served as a model for Aristotele Fioravanti, when he designed the eponymous cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin in 1475 to 1479.

Druden were said to participate in the Wild Hunt and were considered a particular class of demon in Alfonso de Spina's hierarchy. The word also came to be used as a generic term for \"witch\" in the 16th century (Hans Sachs).\n\nThe word is attested as Middle High German \"trute\", \nIn early modern lexicography and down to the 19th century, it was popularly associated with the word \"druid\", without any etymological justification. \nIts actual origin is unknown. Grimm suggests derivation from a euphemistic \"trût\" (modern \"traut\") \"dear, beloved; intimate\", but cites as an alternative suggestion a relation to the valkyrie's name Þrúðr.

The word has been in use since at least the 17th century, recorded by Justus Georg Schottelius (as \"drutenfusz\", glossed \"omnis incolumitatis signum \"). Its apotropaic use is well recorded for 18th- to 19th-century folk belief in Bavaria and Tyrol.\n\n\"Drudenfuss\" is also the German name of the pentagram used as a heraldic device (alternatively \"Drudenkreuz\" \"drude's cross\" and \"Alpfuß, Alfenfuß\" \"elf-foot\" or \"Alpkreuz\" \"elf-cross\") besides the more descriptive \"Pentalpha\" or \"Fünfstern\".\nA \"Drudenstein\" is a pebble with a naturally formed hole in the center.

Osler was a founder and benefactor of the Royal Ontario Museum\n\nOsler was born at Bond Head, Upper Canada near Tecumseh Township, Simcoe County, Canada West in 1845. He was the fourth son of Featherstone Lake Osler, a former lieutenant in the Royal Navy turned Anglican Reverend, and Ellen Free Pickton. Osler attended grammar school in Dundas, Upper Canada. Unlike his elder brothers he did not attend university.\n\nIn the late 1850s, Osler began his career as a clerk at the Bank of Upper Canada. The bank failed in 1866. Osler became business partners with his colleague Henry Pellat and together they launched their own firm specializing in stockbroking, investment, and insurance services. Osler often served as a financier in numerous business ventures. Throughout the 1880s to 1890s, Osler greatly increased his financial influence through a combination of investments, westward railway expansions, and western land grants. Osler was an early shareholder of the Dominion Bank and gained a directorship with the bank in 1881. He would become the bank’s president in 1901.\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, Osler began working in the transportation industry through railways. Osler was the founder and managing director of the Ontario and Qu'Appelle Land Company Limited. His business expertise and connections led to his presidency of the Ontario and Quebec Railway followed by a directorship with the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1896, Osler became the president of the Board of Trade. Osler was also the president of the Toronto Ferry Company.\n\nDue to his financial success, many believed that Osler should enter politics. Osler began his political career in the 1892 mayoralty race. He lost to R.J. Fleming despite having the support of the Toronto establishment. Osler ran in the 1896 federal election and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative representative of West Toronto. He served as a MP until 1917. Osler was knighted in 1912.\n\nAfter his political retirement, Osler continued to have an active involvement in Canadian business. By 1921, Osler concurrently held directorships in eight companies, presidencies in another three, and vice-presidency in one. Osler died in 1924 at the age of 78. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at nearly $4 million. In the years prior to his death, Osler had promised money to his friends to support various funds and causes which were posthumously covered by his estate.\n\nBeginning in the 1870s Osler became involved with philanthropy. His expertise as a successful businessman helped fund and support important causes related to arts, cultures, and health in the city of Toronto. Osler became a trustee for the Hospital for Sick Children in 1878. He also helped fund the new Toronto General Hospital. Osler lived in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale at his estate Craigleigh. The Osler family donated the estate to the City of Toronto after Osler's death; today the site of Craigleigh Gardens.\n\nOsler was a founder and generous benefactor to the Royal Ontario Museum. Together with George Agnew Reid, Byron Edmund Walker and others, Osler participated in the campaign to found an art museum in Toronto in the early 1900s. Osler began his involvement on a trip to Egypt from 1906 to 1907 where he met Charles T. Currelly, archaeologist and future director of the Royal Ontario Museum. In 1909 Osler personally pledged $50 000 over five years to assist with the collection of artefacts for the future museum. Osler would further contribute in 1912 by donating a large collection of paintings by Paul Kane to the cause. Through Osler’s and others influence, the Crown passed the Royal Ontario Museum Act in 1912 which led to the opening of the Royal Ontario Museum in 1914. Osler's descendants, the Matthews family, continue to support the museum to the present day. The museum’s Sir Edmund Osler Gate to the wing of the Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture is named after him.\n\nOsler was born at Tecumseh Township, Simcoe County, Canada West and grew up in the area of present-day Hamilton, Ontario. His brothers were Britton Bath Osler (founder of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt), and doctor Sir William Osler. Osler was married twice. He married his first wife, Isabella Lammond Smith, in 1868. Smith and Osler had two children who died in infancy and Smith died in 1871. In 1873, Osler married Annie Farquarson (1848 – 1910). The couple had six children; three daughters and three sons. Osler’s grandson, Edmund Boyd Osler (1919-1987), was a Liberal member of the Canadian House of Commons for Winnipeg South Centre.\n\nOsler descended from a British family with a long naval tradition. Edmund's great grandfather, Edward Osler, was variously described as either a merchant seaman or a pirate. One of Edmund's uncles served as a medical officer in the Navy and wrote the \"Life of Lord Exmouth\" and the poem \"The Voyage\". Osler’s father was Featherstone Lake Osler (1805–1895). Featherstone was the son of a ship owner from Falmouth, Cornwall. Featherstone formerly served in the Royal Navy as a Lieutenant on the H.M.S. Victory. In 1831 Featherstone Osler was invited to serve on H.M.S. Beagle as the science officer on Charles Darwin's historic voyage to the Galápagos Islands, but turned it down as his father was dying. Featherstone retired from the navy in 1837 and emigrated to Canada. Featherstone married Ellen Free Pickton and they had four sons, Edmund was their youngest. In Canada, Featherstone became an Anglican Reverend.\n\n"}

As the religion has spread around the world, the name of this Orisha has varied in different locations, but the beliefs remain similar.\n\nEshu partially serves as an alternate name for Eleggua, the messenger for all Orishas, and that there are 256 paths to Eleggua—each one of which is an Eshu. It is believed that Eshu is an Orisha similar to Elugga, but there are only 101 paths to Eshu according to ocha, rather than the 256 paths to Eleggua according to Ifá. Eshu is known as the \"Father who gave birth to Ogboni\", and is also thought to be agile and always willing to rise to a challenge.\n\nBoth ocha and Ifá share some paths, however. Eshu Ayé is said to work closely with Orisha Olokun and is thought to walk on the shore of the beach. Eshu Bi is a stern and forceful avatar, appearing as both an old man and young boy, who walked with Shangó and Oyá (the initial two Ibeyi), and Eshu Bi protects both of these, as well as all other small children. Eshu Laroye is an avatar believed to be the companion of Oshún and believed to be one of the most important Eshus, and the avatar of Eshu Laroye is thought to be talkative and small.\n\nThe name of Eshu vary around the world: in Yorùbáland, Eshu is \"Èṣù-Elegba\"; \"Exu de Candomblé\" in Candomblé; \"Echú\" in Santería and Latin America; \"Legba\" in Haitian Vodou; \"Leba\" in Winti; \"Exu de Quimbanda\" in Quimbanda; \"Lubaniba\" in Palo Mayombe; and \"Exu\" in Latin America.\n\nExu is known by various forms and names in Afro-Brazilian religions. They include Akessan; Alafiá; Alaketo; Bará, or Ibará; Elegbá, or Elegbará, Inan; Lalu, or Jelu; Laroiê; Lon Bií; Lonã; Odara; Olodé; Tamentau, or Etamitá; Tlriri; and Vira, a feminine manifestation of Exu. The most common forms or praise-names of Exu are Exu-Agbo, the protector and guardian of houses and terreiros; Exu-Elepô, the god of palm oil; Exu lnã, the god of fire; Exu Ojixé, a messenger god.\n\nA shrine dedicated to Exu is located outside of the main terreiro of a Candomblé temple, usually near the entrance gate. It is, in general, made of rough clay or a simple mound of red clay. They are similar to those found in Nigeria.\n\nRitual foods offered to Exu include palm oil; beans; corn, either in the form of cornmeal or popcorn; farofa, a manioc flour. Four-legged male birds and other animals are offered as sacrifice to Exu.

With over 100,000 film titles, 2,000,000 photographs and stills, 25,000 cinema programmes, 10,000 film posters, 30,000 books, and an extensive collection of apparatus, documents and costumes, it is the largest such organisation in Austria.\n\nResearch is always in progress on particular topics in order to enlarge the film content, covering all genres from advertising footage to experimental projects to light entertainment films. Of all the existing Austrian productions in the world from before 1945, over 95% are kept in the Filmarchiv Austria.\n\nThe Filmarchiv Austria is a member of FIAF (the International Federation of Film Archives).\n\nThe present Filmarchiv Austria was founded on 17 October 1955, as the Österreichische Filmarchiv (ÖFA) (\"Austrian Film Archive\").\n\nThe first reconstruction of film material by the ÖFA, in 1961, was the 1926 film version of \"Der Rosenkavalier\". Other major reconstruction projects have included the first Austrian feature film productions, those of Saturn-Film; the oldest extant Austrian drama film, \"Der Müller und sein Kind\" of 1911; and the classics \"Orlacs Hände\" (\"The Hands of Orlac\") and \"Die Sklavenkönigin\" (\"The Slave Queen\" or \"The Moon of Israel\"), which without this work would have remained inaccessible to the viewing public.\n\nThe Filmarchiv Austria, together with \"Der Standard\", is also responsible for the selection and production of \"Der österreichische Film\", an authoritative DVD series of significant Austrian films, consisting so far of 50 parts. \n\nIn 1965 a systematic programme began of conversion of film prints on the highly unstable cellulose nitrate base, which remained in commercial use into the 1950s, to security film. \n\nIn 1968 new premises were found in the Rauhensteingasse in central Vienna, while new storage and exhibition facilities were established in the \"Altes Schloss\" (\"Old Castle\"), Laxenburg. In 1997 the \"Österreichische Filmarchiv\" changed its name to Filmarchiv Austria, and established new central facilities at the \"Audiovisuelles Zentrum Wien-Augarten\".\n\nIn 2001 the \"Filmarchiv-Studienzentrum\" was opened in the Augarten premises, incorporating the \"Filmdokumentationszentrum\", formerly the largest private collection of film-related material in Austria, founded in 1965 by Herbert Holba and the film historian Peter Spiegel, on the basis of an earlier collection begin in 1945.\n\nThe collections of the Filmarchiv Austria comprehensively document Austrian cultural and social history. The oldest titles preserved are the sequences of Vienna taken by the Lumière Brothers in 1896. The oldest preserved native Austrian film is the documentary \"Der Kaiserbesuch in Braunau/Inn\" (\"Visit of the Kaiser to Braunau am Inn\") from 1903, shot by Johann Bläser, proprietor of a travelling film show, while the earliest extant Austrian feature films are the erotic productions of Saturn-Film from 1906 onwards.\n\nSome of the more important collections include:\n\n\n"}

She also curates ThistleRadio, a 24/7 web-based music channel devoted to new and classic music from Celtic roots and is co-author of the \"New York Times\" Best Seller \"Wayfaring Strangers\".\n\nThe radio program has won numerous awards since its inception in 1981, offering a fusion of traditional and contemporary Celtic sounds, interwoven with interviews, in-studio performances and Ritchie's own trademark commentary in her \"soft Scots\" dialect.\n\nRitchie was born and raised in Scotland, where she went to the University of Stirling for her undergraduate education. While there, she was invited to spend one semester in North Carolina in the United States, and that was when she first heard NPR. After graduating in Scotland she returned to North Carolina and, although initially pursuing post-graduate research, was hired by WFAE FM, the NPR station in Charlotte, to oversee fundraising and promotion efforts. In her early years, Ritchie guest hosted live radio shows featuring everything from Big Band to Classical music, also producing and presenting many live concerts.\n\nWFAE was a new station open to new ideas and in 1981 Ritchie began a weekly hour of Celtic music for its local audience. \"The Thistle & Shamrock\" was picked up for national broadcast less than two years after this debut. The program's national following grew quickly and it was soon established as one of NPR's most widely heard and best-loved music offerings. During her years based in North Carolina, Ritchie visited radio stations coast-to-coast across the US, presenting live broadcasts and events, and in 1989 and 1990, travelled to 22 US cities with The Thistle & Shamrock Concert Tour.\n\nFiona Ritchie has come full circle to re-settle and create her radio programs at home in Scotland. On numerous return trips to the United States, she has visited and raised funds for NPR member stations everywhere from Louisiana to Alaska, and hosted festival concerts from Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts to Chicago's Grant Park. Along the way she has forged a strong association with the United States, and made a unique contribution to the American airwaves.\n\nIn the UK, Fiona Ritchie has presented numerous programs for BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio 2, launching the Radio Scotland world music series \"Celtic Connections\" in 1993. She has produced and presented many live concert performances and broadcasts, including a musical event for HRH Prince Charles in 2001 at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, and has acted in an advisory capacity for arts organisations in the US and UK, including serving on the Scottish advisory committee for the British Council.\n\nIn 2006 Ritchie launched Thistlepod, a free podcast from NPR, which ran until her radio programs became available to stream via NPR Music and Ritchie's Thistleradio website. Her partnership with NPR Music gave rise to ThistleRadio in 2012, a 24/7 web-based music channel devoted to new and classic music from Celtic roots, now hosted by SomaFM internet radio. Ritchie has also produced several CD compilations and authored a 2005 volume on Celtic music for the NPR Curious Listener's Guide book series.\n\nIn 2014, \"Wayfaring Strangers: The Musical Voyage from Scotland and Ulster to Appalachia\", her major book, with CD, which was named after The Wayfaring Stranger folk song, was published by UNC Press. The book was co-authored by Doug Orr with a Foreword by Dolly Parton. \"Wayfaring Strangers\" appeared on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list in two different categories.\n\nRitchie's awards include six World Medals from the New York Festivals International Competition for Radio Programming, and a Flora Macdonald Award from St. Andrews University (North Carolina), which also conferred upon her the degree of honorary doctorate. Hundreds of \"Thistle & Shamrock\" tapes and vinyl albums, along with concert recordings, playlists, newsletters, and related materials are now part of a working archive in the Scottish Heritage Center at St. Andrews University (North Carolina). The archive is open to anyone interested in studying the rich heritage of Celtic music. Ritchie also serves on the Advisory Board of the Swannanoa Gathering folk arts workshops at Warren Wilson College in North Carolina.\n\nIn 2003 the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage honoured her for \"creating an on-air community, serving as a musical ambassador, and connecting listeners with the best of traditional and contemporary artistry.”\n\nRitchie was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting and traditional Scottish music. In 2016 she received the Hamish Henderson Award for Services to Traditional Music, named for the influential folklorist, poet, songwriter and scholar who died in 2002. The award is presented annually to an individual who has made a substantial difference to the Scottish traditional music world. Upon receiving this honour, Ritchie was also inducted into Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame.\n\nRitchie's ThistleRadio music channel on SomaFM was awarded Best Music Show: Country/Folk/Blues in the 2017 Online Radio Awards presented by the British streaming service Mixcloud. In 2018, Folk Alliance International inducted Ritchie into their Folk DJ Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

She was married to king Gjúki, of Burgundy. She had three sons, Gunnarr, Hǫgni and Guttormr, and a daughter, Gudrun. She was the sorceress who gave Sigurðr a magic potion that made him forget that he ever married his wife Brynhildr, so that he would marry Gudrun, her daughter. But she did not stop there. She wanted her son Gunnar to marry Brynhildr, but she refused to marry him, and she would only marry the man who could cross the ring of flames she put up around herself. So Grímhildr talked Sigurðr into helping Gunnarr marry Brynhildr. Since Sigurðr was the only one who could cross the flames he and Gunnarr switched bodies, so Gunnar's body could cross the flames. Brynhildr then married Gunnar, because she made a promise. When Brynhildr learned that Sigurðr had betrayed her with another woman (Gudrun), not knowing he had been bewitched into doing so by Grímhild, she was out to get revenge. She ended up killing Sigurð and herself by the end of the saga. Grímhildr then made Gudrun marry Brynhild's brother Atli. Gudrun did not want to marry him because she knew he would end up killing her brothers. This is the last that we hear of Grímhild in the \"Völsunga saga\"; it is probable that the ring's curse also brings misfortune and even death upon Grímhild herself. \n\nThe name was also given to another beautiful, evil sorceress woman who married king Áli of Alfheim (modern Bohuslän) in \"Illuga saga Gríðarfóstra\". She had seven daughters who too became terrible witches, while King Áli had a daughter before he married Grímhild, named Signý. Signý had a daughter with a king she had married but he died in battle, so she returned home to her father, with her daughter. Grímhildr poisoned the king to have a younger man, and then had ruled the kingdom in such an evil manner that it was laid waste. She then banned Signý and Hild, her daughter, from the kingdom and put a curse on them, that Signy would turn into a troll woman named Grid and they would have to live in a cave. Every man that came would fall in love with Hild, and then Signý/Grid would have to kill them, until one man is not afraid. In turn, Hildr put a counter-curse on Grímhild, that she would stand over a fire between her legs, burning her from below while her upper parts would freeze, and into this fire Grímhild would drop once their own curse was broken. Grímhild attempted to reason with Hild, as she would rather that neither of their curses hold, but to no avail as Hildr desired revenge. Eleven years and sixteen men later, a young Dane named Illugi broke Grímhild's curse by defeating and burning all of her daughters, thus also causing her to die at last.\n\nIn \"Gríms saga loðinkinna\", Grímhild was an evil wife of the North Norwegian lord, who had put a curse on her stepdaughter Lofthaena to turn her into an ugly troll. Lofthaena was rescued by a man who loved her, the saga's hero Grím, who than had Grímhild punished by being stoned to death.\n\n"}

{"id": "42559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42559", "title": "Kama Sutra", "text": "Kama Sutra\n\nThe Kama Sutra (; , , ) is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfillment in life. Attributed to Vātsyāyana, the \"Kama Sutra\" is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on intercourse positions, but written as a guide to the \"art-of-living\" well, the nature of love, finding a life partner, maintaining one's love life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties of human life. \n\n\"Kamasutra\" is the oldest surviving Hindu text on erotic love. It is a \"sutra\"-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different \"bhasya\" (exposition and commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and anustubh-meter poetry verses. The text acknowledges the Hindu concept of Purusharthas, and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. Its chapters discuss methods for courtship, finding a partner, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics. The majority of the book is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.\n\nThe text is one of many Indian texts on \"Kama Shastra\". It is a much-translated work in Indian and non-Indian languages. The \"Kamasutra\" has influenced many secondary texts that followed after the 4th-century CE, as well as the Indian arts as exemplified by the pervasive presence Kama-related reliefs and sculpture in old Hindu temples. Of these, the Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh is a UNESCO world heritage site. Among the surviving temples in north India, one in Rajasthan sculpts all the major chapters and sexual positions to illustrate the \"Kamasutra\". According to Wendy Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" became \"one of the most pirated books in English language\" soon after it was published in 1883 by Richard Burton. This first European edition by Burton does not faithfully reflect much in the \"Kamasutra\" because he revised the collaborative translation by Bhagavanlal Indrajit and Shivaram Parashuram Bhide with Forster Arbuthnot to suit 19th-century Victorian tastes.\n\nThe original composition date or century for the \"Kamasutra\" is unknown. Historians have variously placed it between 400 BCE and 300 CE. According to John Keay, the \"Kama Sutra\" is a compendium that was collected into its present form in the 2nd century CE. In contrast, the Indologist Wendy Doniger who has co-translated \"Kama sutra\" and published many papers on related Hindu texts, the surviving version of the \"Kamasutra\" must have been revised or composed after 225 CE because it mentions the Abhiras and the Andhras dynasties that did not co-rule major regions of ancient India before that year. The text makes no mention of the Gupta Empire which ruled over major urban areas of ancient India, reshaping ancient Indian arts, Hindu culture and economy from the 4th-century through the 6th-century. For these reasons, she dates the \"Kama sutra\" to the second half of the 3rd-century CE.\n\nThe place of its composition is also unclear. The likely candidates are urban centers of north or northwest ancient India, alternatively in the eastern urban Pataliputra (now Patna). \n\nVatsyayana Mallanaga is its widely accepted author because his name is embedded in the colophon verse, but little is known about him. Vatsyayana states that he wrote the text after much meditation. In the preface, Vatsyayana acknowledges that he is distilling many ancient texts, but these have not survived. He cites the work of others he calls \"teachers\" and \"scholars\", and the longer texts by Auddalaki, Babhravya, Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana, and Kuchumara. Vatsyayana's Kamasutra is mentioned and some verses quoted in the \"Brihatsamhita\" of Varahamihira, as well as the poems of Kalidasa. This suggests he lived before the 5th-century CE.\n\nThe Hindu tradition has the concept of the \"Purusharthas\" which outlines \"four main goals of life\". It holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life:\n\nEach of these pursuits became a subject of study and led to prolific Sanskrit and some Prakrit languages literature in ancient India. Along with Dharmasastras, Arthasastras and Mokshasastras, the Kamasastras genre have been preserved in palm leaf manuscripts. The \"Kamasutra\" belongs to the Kamasastra genre of texts. Other examples of Hindu Sanskrit texts on sexuality and emotions include the \"Ratirahasya\" (called \"Kokashastra\" in some Indian scripts), the \"Anangaranga\", the \"Nagarasarvasva\" and the \"Panchasayaka\". Vatsyayana predominantly discusses Kama along with its relationship with Dharma and Artha. He makes a passing mention of the fourth aim of life in some verses.\n\nThe earliest foundations of the \"kamasutra\" are found in the Vedic era literature of Hinduism. Vatsyayana acknowledges this heritage in verse 1.1.9 of the text where he names Shvetaketu Auddalaki as the \"first human author of the \"kamasutra\"\". Auddalaki is an early Upanishadic rishi (scholar-poet, sage), whose ideas are found in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" such as in section 6.2, and the \"Chandogya Upanishad\" such as over the verses 5.3 through 5.10. These Hindu scriptures are variously dated between 900 BCE and 700 BCE, according to the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar Patrick Olivelle. Among with other ideas such as Atman (self, soul) and the ontological concept of Brahman, these early Upanishads discuss human life, activities and the nature of existence as a form of internalized worship, where sexuality and sex is mapped into a form of religious \"yajna\" ritual (sacrificial fire, Agni) and suffused in spiritual terms:\n<poem>\nA fire – that is what a woman is, Gautama.\nHer firewood is the vulva,\nher smoke is the pubic hair,\nher flame is the vagina,\nwhen one penetrates her, that is her embers,\nand her sparks are the climax.\nIn that very fire the gods offer semen,\nand from that offering springs a man.\n</poem>\n– \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 6.2.13\", ~700 BCE, Transl: Patrick Olivelle\nAccording to the Indologist De, a view with which Doniger agrees, this is one of the many evidences that the \"kamasutra\" began in the religious literature of the Vedic era, ideas that were ultimately refined and distilled into a \"sutra\"-genre text by Vatsyayana. According to Doniger, this paradigm of celebrating pleasures, enjoyment and sexuality as a \"dharmic\" act began in the \"earthy, vibrant text known as the \"Rigveda\"\" of the Hindus. The \"Kamasutra\" and celebration of sex, eroticism and pleasure is an integral part of the religious milieu in Hinduism and quite prevalent in its temples.\n\nHuman relationships, sex and emotional fulfillment are a significant part of the post-Vedic Sanskrit literature such as the major Hindu epics: the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Ramayana\". The ancient Indian view has been, states Johann Meyer, that love and sex are a delightful necessity. Though she is reserved and selective, \"a woman stands in very great need of \"surata\" (amorous or sexual pleasure)\", and \"the woman has a far stronger erotic disposition, her delight is the sexual act is greater than a man's\".\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" manuscripts have survived in many versions across the Indian subcontinent. While attempting to get a translation of the Sanskrit kama-sastra text \"Anangaranga\" that had already been in widely translated by the Hindus in regional languages such as Marathi, associates of the British Orientalist Richard Burton stumbled into portions of the \"Kamasutra\" manuscript. They commissioned the Sanskrit scholar Bhagvanlal Indraji to locate a complete \"Kamasutra\" manuscript and translate it. Indraji collected variant manuscripts in libraries and temples of Varanasi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Burton published an edited English translation of these manuscripts, but not a critical edition of the \"Kamasutra\" in Sanskrit.\n\nAccording to S.C. Upadhyaya, known for his 1961 scholarly study and a more accurate translation of the \"Kamasutra\", there are issues with the manuscripts that have survived and the text likely underwent revisions over time. This is confirmed by other 1st-millennium CE Hindu texts on \"kama\" that mention and cite the \"Kamasutra\", but some of these quotations credited to the \"Kamasutra\" by these historic authors \"are not to be found in the text of the Kamasutra\" that have survived.\n\nVatsyayana's \"Kama Sutra\" states it has 1250 verses, distributed over 36 chapters in 64 sections, organised into 7 books. This statement is included in the opening chapter of the text, a common practice in ancient Hindu texts likely included to prevent major and unauthorized expansions of a popular text. The text that has survived into the modern era has 67 sections, and this list is enumerated in Book 7 and in Yashodhara's Sanskrit commentary (\"bhasya\") on the text.\n\nThe contents of the treatise explicitly aim to be comprehensive, including everything \"good or bad\" in Vatsyayana's view. The text does not censor a view or lifestyle, but Vatsyayana does include his own comments on what he approves and disapproves of. He also, states Doniger, remarks that \"reflective people should accept only the good\".\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" uses a mixture of prose and poetry, and the narration has the form of a dramatic fiction where two characters are called the \"nayaka\" (man) and \"nayika\" (woman), aided by the characters called \"pitamarda\" (libertine), \"vita\" (pander) and \"vidushaka\" (jester). This format follows the teachings found in the Sanskrit classic named the \"Natyasastra\". The teachings and discussions found in the \"Kamasutra\" extensively incorporate ancient Hindu mythology and legends.\n\nAcross human cultures, states Michel Foucault, \"the truth of sex\" has been produced and shared by two processes. One method has been \"ars erotica\" texts, while the other has been the \"scientia sexualis\" literature. The first are typically of the hidden variety and shared by one person to another, between friends or from a master to a student, focusing on the emotions and experience, sans physiology. These bury many of the truths about sex and human sexual nature. The second are empirical studies of the type found in biology, physiology and medical texts, focusing on the physiology and objective observations, sans emotions. The \"Kamasutra\" belongs to both camps, states Wendy Doniger. It discusses, in its distilled form, the physiology, the emotions and the experience while citing and quoting prior Sanskrit scholarship on the nature of \"kama\".\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" is a \"sutra\"-genre text consisting of intensely condensed, aphoristic verses. Doniger describes them as a \"kind of atomic string (thread) of meanings\", which are so cryptic that any translation is more like deciphering and filling in the text. Condensing a text into a sutra-genre religious text form makes it easier to remember and transmit, but it also introduces ambiguity and the need to understand the context of each chapter, its philological roots, as well as the prior literature, states Doniger. However, this method of knowledge preservation and transmission has its foundation in the Vedas, which themselves are cryptic and require a commentator and teacher-guide to comprehend the details and the inter-relationship of the ideas. The \"Kamasutra\" too has attracted commentaries, of which the most well known are those of 12th-century or 13th-century Yaśodhara's \"Jayamaṅgalā\" in the Sanskrit language, and of Devadatta Shastri who commented on the original text as well as its commentaries in the Hindi language. There are many other Sanskrit commentaries on the \"Kamasutra\", such as the \"Sutra Vritti\" by Narsingha Sastri. These commentaries on the \"Kamasutra\" cite and quote text from other Hindu texts such as the \"Upanishads\", the \"Arthashastra\", the \"Natyashastra\", the \"Manusmriti\", the \"Nyayasutra\", the \"Markandeya Purana\", the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Nitishastra\" and others to provide the context, per the norms of its literary traditions. The extant translations of the \"Kamasutra\" typically incorporate these commentaries, states Daniélou.\n\nIn the colonial era marked by sexual censorship, the \"Kamasutra\" became famous as a pirated and underground text for its explicit description of sex positions. The stereotypical image of the text is one where erotic pursuit with sexual intercourse include improbable contortionist forms. In reality, according to Doniger, the \"real Kamasutra\" is much more and is a book about \"the art of living\", about understanding one's body and a partner's body, finding a partner and emotional connection, marriage, the power equation over time in intimate relationships, the nature of adultery and drugs (aphrodisiacs) along with many simple to complex variations in sex positions to explore. It is also a psychological treatise that presents the effect of desire and pleasure on human behavior.\n\nFor each aspect of \"Kama\", the \"Kamasutra\" presents a diverse spectrum of options and regional practices. According to Shastri, as quoted by Doniger, the text analyses \"the inclinations of men, good and bad\", thereafter it presents Vatsyayana's recommendation and arguments of what one must avoid as well as what to not miss in experiencing and enjoying, with \"acting only on the good\". For example, the text discusses adultery but recommends a faithful spousal relationship. The approach of \"Kamasutra\" is not to ignore nor deny the psychology and complexity of human behavior for pleasure and sex. The text, according to Doniger, clearly states \"that a treatise demands the inclusion of everything, good or bad\", but after being informed with in depth knowledge, one must \"reflect and accept only the good\". The approach found in the text is one where goals of science and religion should not be to repress, but to encyclopedically know and understand, thereafter let the individual make the choice.\n\nThe 3rd-century text includes a number of themes, including subjects such as flirting that resonate in the modern era context, states a \"New York Times\" review. For example, it suggests that a young man seeking to attract a woman, should hold a party, and invite the guests to recite poetry. In the party, a poem should be read with parts missing, and the guests should compete to provide the complete the verse. As another example, the \"Kamasutra\" suggests that the boy and the girl should go play together such as swim in a river. The boy should dive into the water away from the girl he is interested in, then swim underwater to get close to her, emerge out of the water and surprise her, touch her slightly and then dive again, away from her.\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\", states the Indologist and Sanskrit literature scholar Ludo Rocher, discourages adultery but then devotes \"not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (\"karana\") for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman\". Vatsyayana mentions different types of \"nayikas\" (urban girls) such as unmarried virgins, those married and abandoned by husband, widow seeking remarriage and courtesans, then discusses their kama/sexual education, rights and mores. In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, a person should learn how to make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass, one should concentrate on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth.\n\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, as a strategic means to work against his enemies and to facilitate his successes. It also explains the signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery. The \"Kamasutra\" teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both \"dharma\" and \"artha\".\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" has been one of the unique sources of sociological information and cultural milieu of ancient India. It shows a \"near total disregard of class (varna) and caste (jati)\", states Doniger. Human relationships, including the sexual type, are neither segregated nor repressed by gender or caste, rather linked to individual's wealth (success in \"artha\"). In the pages of the \"Kamasutra\", lovers are \"not upper-class\" but they \"must be rich\" enough to dress well, pursue social leisure activities, buy gifts and surprise the lover. In the rare mention of caste found in the text, it is about a man finding his legal wife and the advice that humorous stories to seduce a woman should be about \"other virgins of same \"jati\" (caste)\". In general, the text describes sexual activity between men and women across class and caste, both in urban and rural settings.\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" includes verses describing homosexual relations such as oral sex between two men, as well as between two women. Lesbian relations are extensively covered in Chapters 5 and 8 in Book 2 of the text.\n\nAccording to Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" discusses same-sex relationships through the notion of the \"tritiya prakriti\", literally, \"third sexuality\" or \"third nature\". In \"Redeeming the Kamasutra,\" Doniger states that \"the Kamasutra departs from the dharmic view of homosexuality in significant ways\", where the term \"kliba\" appears. In contemporary translations, this has been inaccurately rendered as \"eunuch\" – or, a castrated man in a harem, a practice that started in India after the arrival of Turkish Sultans. The Sanskrit word \"Kliba\" found in older Indian texts refers to a \"man who does not act like a man\", typically in a pejorative sense. The \"Kamasutra\" does not use the pejorative term \"kliba\" at all, but speaks instead of a \"third nature\" or, in the sexual behavior context as the \"third sexuality\". \n\nThe text states that there are two sorts of \"third nature\", one where a man behaves like a woman, and in the other, a woman behaves like a man. In one of the longest consecutive sets of verses describing a sexual act, the \"Kamasutra\" describes fellatio technique between a man dressed like a woman performing fellatio on another man. The text also mentions same-sex behavior between two women, such as a girl losing her virginity with a girlfriend as they use their fingers, as well as oral sex and the use of sex toys between women. \"Svairini\", a term Danielou translates as a lesbian, is described in the text as a woman who lives a conjugal life with another woman or by herself fending for herself, not interested in a husband. Additionally, the text has some fleeting remarks on bisexual relationships.\n\nThe historical records suggest that the \"Kamasutra\" was a well-known and popular text in Indian history, states Wendy Doniger. This popularity through the Mughal Empire era is confirmed by its regional translations. The Mughals, states Doniger, had \"commissioned lavishly illustrated Persian and Sanskrit \"Kamasutra\" manuscripts\".\n\nThe first English translation of the \"Kama Sutra\" was privately printed in 1883 by the Orientalist Sir Richard Francis Burton. He did not translate it, but did edit it to suit the Victorian British attitudes. The unedited translation was produced by the Indian scholar Bhagwan Lal Indraji with the assistance of a student Shivaram Parshuram Bhide, under the guidance of Burton's friend, the Indian civil servant Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot. According to Wendy Doniger, the Burton version is a \"flawed English translation\" but influential as modern translators and abridged versions of \"Kamasutra\" even in the Indian languages such as Hindi are re-translations of the Burton version, rather than the original Sanskrit manuscript. \n\nThe Burton version of the \"Kamasutra\" was produced in an environment where Victorian mindset and Protestant proselytizers were busy finding faults and attacking Hinduism and its culture, rejecting as \"filthy paganism\" anything sensuous and sexual in Hindu arts and literature. The \"Hindus were cowering under their scorn\", states Doniger, and the open discussion of sex in the \"Kamasutra\" scandalized the 19th-century Europeans. The Burton edition of the \"Kamasutra\" was illegal to publish in England and the United States till 1962. Yet, states Doniger, it became soon after its publication in 1883, \"one of the most pirated books in the English language\", widely copied, reprinted and republished sometimes without Richard Burton's name.\n\nBurton made two important contributions to the \"Kamasutra\". First, he had the courage to publish it in the colonial era against the political and cultural mores of the British elite. He creatively found a way to subvert the then prevalent censorship laws of Britain under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857. Burton created a fake publishing house named \"The Kama Shastra Society of London and Benares\" (Benares = Varanasi), with the declaration that it is \"for private circulation only\". The second major contribution was to edit it in a major way, by changing words and rewriting sections to make it more acceptable to the general British public. For example, the original Sanskrit \"Kamasutra\" does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms. Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\" Though Burton used the terms lingam and yoni for human sexual organs, terms that actually mean a lot more in Sanskrit texts and its meaning depends on the context. However, Burton's \"Kamasutra\" gave a unique, specific meaning to these words in the western imagination. \n\nThe problems with Burton mistranslation are many, states Doniger. First, the text \"simply does not say what Burton says it says\". Second, it \"robs women of their voices, turning direct quotes into indirect quotes, thus losing the force of the dialogue that animates the work and erasing the vivid presence of the many women who speak in the Kamasutra\". Third, it changes the force of words in the original text. For example, when a woman says \"Stop!\" or \"Let me go!\" in the original text of Vatsyayana, Burton changed it to \"She continually utters words expressive of prohibition, sufficiency, or desire of liberation\", states Doniger, and thus misconstrues the context and intent of the original text. Similarly, while the original \"Kamasutra\" acknowledges that \"women have strong privileges\", Burton erased these passages and thus eroded women's agency in ancient India in the typical Orientialist manner that dehumanized the Indian culture. David Shulman, a professor of Indian Studies and Comparative Religion, agrees with Doniger that the Burton translation is misguided and flawed. The Burton version was written with a different mindset, one that treated \"sexual matters with Victorian squeamishness and a pornographic delight in the indirect\", according to Shulman. It has led to a misunderstanding of the text and created the wrong impression of it being ancient \"Hindu pornography\".\n\nIn 1961, S. C. Upadhyaya published his translation as the \"Kamasutra of Vatsyayana: Complete Translation from the Original\". According to Jyoti Puri, it is considered among the best-known scholarly English-language translations of the \"Kamasutra\" in post-independent India.\n\nOther translations include those by Alain Daniélou (\"The Complete Kama Sutra\" in 1994) This translation, originally into French, and thence into English, featured the original text attributed to Vatsyayana, along with a medieval and a modern commentary. Unlike the 1883 version, Daniélou's new translation preserves the numbered verse divisions of the original, and does not incorporate notes in the text. He includes English translations of two important commentaries, one by Jayamangala commentary, and a more modern commentary by Devadatta Shastri, as endnotes. Wendy Doniger questions the accuracy of Daniélou's translation, stating that he has freely reinterpreted the \"Kamasutra\" while disregarding the gender that is implicit in the Sanskrit words. He, at times, reverses the object and subject, making the woman the subject and man the object when the \"Kamasutra\" is explicitly stating the reverse. According to Doniger, \"even this cryptic text [\"Kamasutra\"] is not infinitely elastic\" and such creative reinterpretations do not reflect the text.\n\nA translation by Indra Sinha was published in 1980. In the early 1990s, its chapter on sexual positions began circulating on the internet as an independent text and today is often assumed to be the whole of the \"Kama Sutra\".\n\nWendy Doniger and Sudhir Kakar published another translation in 2002. Along with the translation, Doniger has published numerous articles and book chapters relating to the \"Kamasutra\". The Doniger translation and \"Kamasutra\"-related literature has both been praised and criticized. According to David Shulman, the Doniger translation \"will change peoples' understanding of this book and of ancient India. Previous translations are hopelessly outdated, inadequate and misguided\". Narasingha Sil calls the Doniger's work as \"another signature work of translation and exegesis of the much misunderstood and abused Hindu erotology\". Her translation has the folksy, \"twinkle prose\", engaging style, and an original translation of the Sanskrit text. However, adds Sil, Doniger's work mixes her postmodern translation and interpretation of the text with her own \"political and polemical\" views. She makes sweeping generalizations and flippant insertions that are neither supported by the original text nor the weight of evidence in other related ancient and later Indian literature such as from the Bengal Renaissance movement – one of the scholarly specialty of Narasingha Sil. Doniger's presentation style titillates, yet some details misinform and parts of her interpretations are dubious, states Sil.\n\nIndira Kapoor, a director of the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, states that the \"Kamasutra\" is a treatise on human sexual behavior and an ancient attempt to seriously study sexuality among other things. According to Kapoor, quotes Jyoti Puri, the attitude of contemporary Indians is markedly different, with misconceptions and expressions of embarrassment, rather than curiosity and pride, when faced with texts such as \"Kamasutra\" and amorous and erotic arts found in Hindu temples. \"Kamasutra\", states Kapoor, must be viewed as a means to discover and improve the \"self-confidence and understanding of their bodies and feelings\".\n\nThe \"Kamasutra\" has been a popular reference to erotic ancient literature. In the Western media, such as in the American women's magazine \"Redbook\", the Kamasutra is described as \"Although it was written centuries ago, there's still no better sex handbook, which details hundreds of positions, each offering a subtle variation in pleasure to men and women.\"\n\nJyoti Puri, who has published a review and feminist critique of the text, states that the \"\"Kamasutra\" is frequently appropriated as indisputable evidence of a non-Western and tolerant, indeed celebratory, view of sexuality\" and for \"the belief that the \"Kamasutra\" provides a transparent glimpse into the positive, even exalted, view of sexuality\". However, according to Puri, this is a colonial and anticolonial modernist interpretation of the text. These narratives neither resonate with nor provide the \"politics of gender, race, nationality and class\" in ancient India published by other historians and that may have been prevalent then.\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the \"Kamasutra\" is a \"great cultural masterpiece\", one which can inspire contemporary Indians to overcome \"self-doubts and rejoice\" in their ancient heritage.\n\n\n\nOriginal and translations\n"}

It was built by Joseph Guyon on his farmstead in Oakwood, Staten Island in the United States. Most of its original interior woodwork, including both Georgian and Federal styles of paneling remains intact. Based on the style and proportions of the house, it would be considered a middle-to-upper-class dwelling. The Lake family owned several slaves, who may have been housed in the rooms above the kitchen. The building was acquired by Historic Richmond Town, a living history museum, in 1962, and transported from Oakwood during July 9–12, 1962. The building was restored before it was opened to the public on October, 1963. Full restoration was completed in the 1970s.\n\nThe main portion of the house was built circa 1740, while the kitchen addition was rebuilt circa 1820.\nThe building was constructed from a wood frame, using the bent system. It is one and a half stories tall. There is a cellar under the two main rooms and front hall.\nThe cellar walls are made with rubble stone, while the first floor rooms and front hallways are mud and straw filled with a flaster coat. The flooring, panelling, mouldings, and doors are all pine.\n\nThe Lake–Tysen House originally sat on a plot of 115 acres of land. The original location was 750 feet south of Hylan Boulevard, 100 feet West of Tysens Lane, in Oakwood, Staten Island.\nThis area is significant as it was a large, fertile farm plot which spread from the shore line to road which allowed for two point of transport and trade.\n\nPrior to the Lake–Tysen House at this location, the land was originally patented to Hanse Laurense circa 1677. By 1723, the land was owned by James Hanse Dye. Any structure had been destroyed, but there was evidence found of its existence nearby the kitchen area.\n\nThe building features several rooms, furnished for interpretation of different time periods that range from the mid-18th century to the late 19th century.

{"id": "630244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630244", "title": "Life in Hell", "text": "Life in Hell\n\nLife in Hell is a comic strip by Matt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons,\" \"Disenchantment\" and \"Futurama\", which was published weekly from 1977 to 2012. The strip features anthropomorphic rabbits and a gay couple. The comic covers a wide range of subjects, such as love, sex, work, and death, and explores themes of angst, social alienation, self-loathing, and fear of inevitable doom.\n\n\"Life in Hell\" started in 1977 as a self-published comic book Groening used to describe life in Los Angeles to his friends. It was inspired by his move to the city that year; in an interview with \"Playboy\", Groening commented on his arrival: \"I got [to Los Angeles] on a Friday night in August; it was about a hundred and two degrees; my car broke down in the fast lane of the Hollywood Freeway while I was listening to a drunken DJ who was giving his last program on a local rock station and bitterly denouncing the station's management. And then I had a series of lousy jobs.\" In the comic book, Groening attacked what many young adults found repellent: school, work, and love. He described it as \"every ex-campus protester's, every Boomer idealist's, conception of what adult existence in the '80s had turned out to be.\"\n\nGroening photocopied and distributed the magazines to friends, and also sold them for two dollars a copy at the punk corner of the record store in which he worked, Licorice Pizza on Sunset Boulevard. These magazines contained comic strips, comedy sketches, letters, and photo collages. The magazine covers were humorous as well: the first issue saw Binky standing in a cloud of smog and declaring, “What you see is what you breathe.” Groening also worked real photos into the covers, such as drawings from Jules Verne’s books or a picture of his family’s living room.\n\nAn editor from Wet (magazine) bought one of the zines and liked it, and offered Matt Groening a spot in the magazine, soon after \"Life in Hell\" debuted as a comic strip in the avant-garde \"Wet\" magazine in 1978, to which Groening made his first professional cartoon sale. The first strip, entitled \"Forbidden Words\", appeared in the September/October issue. Popular in the underground, \"Life in Hell\" was picked up by the \"Los Angeles Reader\" (an alternative weekly newspaper where Groening also worked as a typesetter, editor, paste-up artist and music critic) in 1980, where it began appearing weekly. Then-publisher of the \"Reader\" Jane Levine said Groening arrived at editor-in-chief James Vowell's office one day, showing him his \"silly cartoons with the rabbit with one ear.\" After Groening left, Vowell came out of his office saying, \"This guy is gonna be famous someday.\"\n\nThe character designs for Akbar and Jeff were in fact failed attempts by Groening to draw Charlie Brown from \"Peanuts\", which is why the two characters wear Charlie Brown T-shirts. In a 1999 interview, Groening said that he added Akbar and Jeff as characters to the comic to appease his girlfriend. Early in the comic, he used Binky and his wife to mirror the arguments he had with her, and she grew irritated with Groening because she felt he was portraying her as worse than himself. The addition of the twin-like Akbar and Jeff was meant to act as a mask of anonymity to hide who was who in the arguments. According to Groening, however, she still told him, “You think you’re Akbar, but you’re really Jeff.”\n\nIn a 1991 interview about \"The Simpsons\", Groening said that \"Life in Hell\" was done entirely by himself (“Matt Groening pure and simple”) and that the strips were often weird or entirely different every week because of however he was feeling at the time of the comic. \n\nThe strip was frequently a serial, discussing various topics such as \"Love is Hell\", a 1984 \"13-chapter miniseries\" pontificating on love and relationships. In November of that year, Groening's then-girlfriend (and co-worker at the \"Reader\") Deborah Caplan offered to publish \"Love is Hell\" in book form. The book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left the \"Reader\" and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled syndication and merchandising for Groening’s projects.\n\n\"Life in Hell\" reached the attention of Hollywood producer James L. Brooks, who received one strip—\"The Los Angeles Way of Death\" from 1982—as a gift from fellow producer Polly Platt. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of developing a series of short animated skits, called \"bumpers\", for \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Originally, Brooks had wanted Groening to adapt his \"Life in Hell\" characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights to his characters, Groening instead created an entirely new batch of characters; the Simpsons.\n\nAs television began to place more demands on his time, however, Groening came to almost exclusively feature single-panel strips or 16-panel grids in which Akbar and Jeff exchange terse jabs. This later period also saw the increase of autobiographical strips, perhaps because Groening was influenced by this burgeoning trend in alternative comics.\n\nTelevision has also made the strip \"safe enough for a number of newspapers to print\", according to Groening, who claims that he has not \"toned the strip down at all, other than no longer using profanity\" as a concession to daily papers that carry the strip.\n\nOn December 7, 1998 Groening registered the domain mattgroening.com to publish \"Life in Hell\" online; however, the website has remained in its \"under construction\" state since then, although Groening insists he'll \"get around to it ... [when he's] ready to wade in on a regular basis.\" As of May 3, 2013, the domain has expired.\n\nGroening decided in 2007, in the wake of the 2006 U.S. election results, to write \"Life Is Swell\" above the comic instead of \"Life in Hell\". Though Groening had previously stated that he would never give up the comic strip, in 2009 he indicated that due to troubling times for print newspapers and constant involvement with \"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\", he would likely one day drop the strip. Three years later, Groening announced the strip's conclusion and the final new strip ran on June 16, 2012. The final strip shows Akbar or Jeff dancing naked, while the other tells him to stop. At the end of the strip he gives up and dances along with him, saying \"Well, I tried.\" \n\nThe strip has been published in his home town Portland since 1986. They have skipped some strips due to political jokes that the paper didn't like.\n\nThe strip was published in a perfect square, unlike most Sunday strips which are published in rectangles. He had different types of format. He would make 4 rows of boxes, each row with 4 in it, when Akbar and Jeff were discussing love. He did 3 boxes by 3, very rarely did he use 4 boxes. Single boxes were often quick and comedic, and 4 x 4 boxes often had a story line. This is based on the way Lynda Barry made comics when they were in college, and the way it was published originally in the \"Reader.\" Atop each strip, he quickly writes out \"Life in Hell\" and Copyright Matt Groening and the year it was made. Sometimes though, he changed the way he wrote the title on top. Instead of being quickly written, sometimes it would be in balloons, or bubble letters, or fireworks, old English handwriting, etc., he also wrote \"This is your\" above the \"Life in Hell.\" He also sometimes changed the way he wrote his name and date but not very often. In one strip \"Why men growl\" from 1982, he wrote his name as Matt Grrrrroening. In another strip, \"Are you Easily Provoked?\" He misspelled his name 3 times until getting it right and writing \"godamnit\" underneath. If he gets help from another cartoonist, he writes their names underneath his. Sometimes a message such as \"My back feels better, thank you.\" He sometimes put where he was when he was making the strip, he'd write Chicago or Portland underneath his name.\n\n\n\nAfter the success of \"Love Is Hell\", more book collections followed, including \"Work Is Hell\" and \"Childhood Is Hell\". To date, 15 books have been released.\n\nIn addition to the books, the comic also spawned T-shirts, greeting cards, posters, coffee mugs, and a short-lived newsletter called the \"Life in Hell Times\". There is also an annual calendar.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Groening drew several print advertisements for Apple Computer in the form of \"Life in Hell\" comic strips.\n\nAt the 2005 Comic-Con in San Diego, a series of deluxe \"Life in Hell\" vinyl figurines manufactured by CritterBox Toys was announced.\n\nBinky and Bongo appear as background non-interactive characters in the Simpsons arcade video game (coin-op).\n\n\n"}

Beginning in the 1500s, the Chappell of the Cathedral became the main musical organization, next to the single parishes and churches of the Domenican order and of San Filippo, the latter attended by nobility. Starting in the 1600s, the Rospigliosi family was central to the music scene in Pistoia, together with Melani and Pasquini. With their donations they succeeded in ensuring that the Chappell always continued to excel. In this period, the dynasties of composers Gherardeschi and Brunetti, who dominated the music in Pistoia even in the 1700s, were affirmed. The entire activity of the Chappell and the works of its masters, made up of compositions from scratch such as the performance and collection of the works of other composers, has been merged, and is today available for consult, in the preserved documents of the \"Biliotheca Musicalis\" of the Archive of the Chapter and at the Forteguerriana Library (Biblioteca Forteguerriana), while the materials produced by the single parishes are today found in the State Archive (Archivio di Stato), in the Leoniana Library at the Vescovile Seminary, the Old Library of Canonici (today at the Archive of the Chapter), and at the Domenican Library. \n\nBeginning in the 1600s, the large nobile families also began to patron the production of lyric opera, especially in the academic scene (The Accademia dei Risvegliati constructed its theater in 1677). Melani made their descendents acquire musical skills: Jacopo, Alessandro and Atto became esteemed composers and musicians in Italy and in France. However, the Rospigliosi family is still the family that left the greatest trace and documentation of operatic activities in Pistoia in the 1600s and on: the Rospigliosi Collection (today divided between the Archive of the Chapter and the Forteguerriana Library) attests to the great musical vitality of the citizens with a collection of music of the most influential composers in the world, performed in Pistoia until the end of the 1800s, which was the century in which the Rospigliosi salon, where many celebrities gathered, was one of the major cultural centers at the local level.. Parallel to the secular production, we cannot forget the production of sacred music (as is attested by the Music Collection of the Seminary, the Collection of the Parish of the Madonna dell'Umiltà (Mary of Umility), and the musical documents of the Fabroniana Library, rich in theoretical and historical texts that were especially pertinent to the 1700s). A composer of the 1800s, Teodulo Mabellini, for example, wrote both lyric operas and sacred music, and some of his compositions are today preserved as autographs in the Forteguerriana Library and in the Archive of the Chapter (see the Sources of Mabellini). In the 1800s, the Borgognoni Philharmonic and the School of Music and Dance were founded (later named Mabellini). The Philharmonic conducted an intense production of music and diffusion of sophisticated music, thanks to the many band arrangements, today preserved in their archive. The School is still functioning today. Beginning in the 1900s, the Philharmonic also accompanied the \"caffé concerto\" (the music produced for this performances are now at the Globo Cinema) and are still active today (the archive of the director Giuseppe Da Prato have documented the production of the band since 1973). In the 1900s, the musical possessions of Pistoia were enriched by the donations of many private citizens, who entrusted their books regarding music to the Forteguerriana Library (Chiappelli Collectioni, Martini Collection, Bellini Collection), to the Leoniana Library at the Seminary (Mazzei Collection and the Collection of Aldo Pacini, a collectionist, who possessed some autographs and antique printed editions). An exceptional testimony of music of the 1900s is at the Mabellini School of Music and Dance: the autographed arrangements by Carlo Savina for two concerts in Pistoia of the music of Nino Rota performed with the Orchestra of Rome of RAI in 1981.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22117076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22117076", "title": "NEC Engineering and Construction Contract", "text": "NEC Engineering and Construction Contract\n\nThe New Engineering Contract (NEC), or NEC Engineering and Construction Contract, is a formalised system created by the Institution of Civil Engineers that guides the drafting of documents on civil engineering and construction projects for the purpose of obtaining tenders, awarding and administering contracts. As such they legally define the responsibilities and duties of Employers (who commission work) and Contractors (who carry out work) in the Works Information. The contract consists of two key parts the Contract Data part one (Data provided by the Employer) and Contract Data part two (Data provided by the Contractor). Several approaches are included making it a family of options. It is used in the UK and internationally in countries including New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa.\n\nThere have been four editions, the first in 1993, the second in 1995, the third in 2005 and the most recent in 2017. The NEC3 was launched in 2005 and it was amended in April 2013.\n\nNEC4 was announced in March 2017 and has been available since June 2017. This new edition reflects procurement and project management developments and emerging best practice, with improvements in flexibility, clarity and the ease of administration. It also introduces two new contracts: NEC4 Design, Build and Operate (DBO) and NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC).\n\nThe NEC is a family of standard contracts, each of which has these characteristics:\n\n\nThe NEC3 complies fully with the Achieving Excellence in Construction (AEC) principles. The Efficiency & Reform Group of The UK Cabinet Office recommends the use of NEC3 by public sector construction procurers on their construction projects.\n\nThe NEC contracts now form a suite of contracts, with NEC being the brand name for the \"umbrella\" of contracts. When it was first launched in 1993, it was simply the \"New Engineering Contract\". This specific contract has been renamed the \"Engineering and Construction Contract\" which is the main contract used for any construction based project. It now sits alongside a number of other contracts that together should mean that the NEC suite is suitable for what ever stage of a lifecycle the project is at and for any party within a project. The contracts available within the suite are:\n\nEngineering and Construction Contract (ECC):\nSuitable for any construction based contract between an Employer and a Contractor. It is intended to be suitable for any sector of the industry, including civil, building, nuclear, oil & gas, etc. \nWithin the ECC contract there are six family level options of which the Employer will choose what she/he deems to be the most suitable and give her/him the best option/value for money on that project:\n\n\nThese options offer a framework for tender and contract clauses that differ primarily in regard to the mechanisms by which the contractor is paid and how risk is allocated/motivated to control costs.\n\nThe core clauses (of the main option listed above) are used in conjunction with the secondary options and the additional conditions of contract. The Efficiency and Reform group of The Cabinet Office in the UK (formerly the OGC) has published generic public sector Z-clauses for the use with NEC3 contracts.\n\nThe clauses of these options have been be adapted for simpler less risky work (short contracts), for use as subcontracts, and for professional services such as design as below.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Subcontract Contract (ECS)\n\nVery similar in detail and complexity of contractual requirements to the ECC contract above, but allows the contractor to sub-let the project to a subcontractor imposing most of the clauses that she/he has within her/his headline contract. There is very little difference between the ECC and the ECS, other than the names of the parties are changed (contractor and subcontractor)and some of the timescales for contractual responses are altered to take into account the timescales required in the ECC contract.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Short Contract (ECSC)\n\nThis is an abbreviated version of the ECC contract and most suitable when the contract is considered \"low risk\" (not necessarily low value) on a project with little change expected. This contract is still between the employer and contractor but does not use all of the processes of the ECC making it simpler and easier to manage and administer.\n\nThe Engineering and Construction Short Subcontract (ECSS)\n\nAllows the contractor to sub-let a simpler lower risk contract down the line to a subcontractor. It is back-to-back with the ECSC but is frequently used as subcontract when the main contract is under the ECS.\n\nThe Professional Services Contract (PSC)\n\nThis contract is for anyone providing a service, rather than doing any physical construction works. Designers are the most obvious party that fit into this category. Whilst they are producing a design for an employer or contractor, they would sign up and follow the clauses within the PSC. Most of the clauses within this contract are the same or similar to those in the main ECC contract, so that all contractors, designers and subcontractors have pretty much the same obligations and processes to follow as each other.\n\nThe Professional Services Short Contract (PSSC)\n\nThis was added to the family in April 2013 and was co-developed with the Association for Project Management. It is for simpler less complex assignments than the PSC, such as the appointment of small team for managing an ECC contract on the Employer's behalf. E.g. the Project Manager and Supervisor. It is frequently used as a subcontract to the PSC for design work.\n\nFramework Contract (FC)\n\nParties enter into a \"framework\" of which work packages will then be let during the life of that framework. Any individual projects will then be awarded using one of the other contracts within the suite, meaning that the parties follow the headline clauses within the framework contract (which is a fairly slim contract) and then the individual clauses within the chosen contract for that package. Different work packages can be let using different contracts during the life of the framework.\n\nTerm Service Contract (TSC)\n\nFor parties on a project that is operational or maintenance based, e.g. maintaining highway signage, where the contract is to ensure that a certain standard is maintained. This contract is not generally used for constructing new works, but can include some amount of betterment. There is also a \"Term Service Short Contract\" where the project is a relatively low risk project and/or the work is primarily re-active. It is an abbreviated version of the main TSC.\n\nSupply Contract/Short Supply Contract (SC/SSC)\n\nThese contracts were launched in 2010. This is for a supplier of supplies or goods to a project, and puts extra contractual requirements on them during their procurement/manufacture period. The Supply Contract is for big bespoke items i.e. designed and manufactured specifically for that contract, with the Short Supply Contract potentially being for more run of the mill / commoditised items on a project. Neither of these contracts cover working on a Site. I.e. as written they are not 'supply and install' contracts.\n\nDispute Resolution Services Contract (DRSC) - previously Adjudicator's Contract\n\nIf there is a dispute between the parties on a project then the Adjudicator will follow the clauses within this contract in order to come to a decision.\n\nDesign Build and Operate (DBO)\n\nThe NEC4 Design, Build and Operate Contract (DBO) allows the procurement of a more integrated whole-life delivery solution. It combines responsibility for design, construction, operation and/or maintenance, procured from a single supplier.\n\nIt can include a range of different services to be provided before, during and after engineering and construction works are completed.\n\nAlliance Contract (ALC)\nThe NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC) will be published initially in a consultation form. It was created to support Clients who wish to take a step forward by fully integrating the delivery team for large complex projects.\n\nThe ALC should be used to engage in a single collaborative contract with a number of participants in order to deliver a project or programme of work. The basis of the contract will be that all parties work together in achieving Client objectives, and share in the risks and benefits of doing so. \n\nGuidance Notes and Flowcharts\n\nFor each of the different contracts listed above each comes with its own set of guidance notes and flowcharts which should aid understanding of the intent of the drafted clauses. The guidance notes expand on each clause to give extra substance and intent of the original drafters as to how a clause should be understood and interpreted. The flowcharts then map out each of the main processes within each contract and demonstrate how it should operate and what to do next if a party has or has not carried out the next contractual action.\n\nOriginally contracts in the civil engineering and construction industries were bespoke and drafted by Chancery pleaders using their knowledge of leases rather than building processes. In 1879, Royal Institute of British Architects for construction projects created RIBA forms which lead to the Joint Contracts Tribunal, JCT forms. For civil engineering the need for a formalized approach to contracts led the Institution of Civil Engineers to produce the ICE formalized set of conditions of contract. In 1986, the ICE commissioned the development of a new form of contract as it was felt that there was a need for a form that had clearer language, clearer allocation of responsibilities and reduced opportunities for contractual “gamesmanship”. In 1991, this resulted in a consultative form of the New Engineering Contract form of contract. The first edition was published in 1993. Wider use of the NEC was recommended by the Latham Report in 1994.\n\nNEC's history started in 1986 when Martin Barnes was commissioned to start drafting a contract to stimulated good project management.\n\nThe first edition of NEC was launched in 1993. NEC2 arrived two years later, in 1995. NEC2 was used to build the High Speed 1 railway, between London and the Channel Tunnel.\n\nThe NEC3 suite was launched in 2005 and it was fully revised in 2013 - NEC's 20th anniversary. This suite was used in projects such as Crossrail, London 2012 Olympics, Halley VI, and the Tin Shui Wai Hospital in Hong Kong.\n\nNEC3 was endorsed by The Construction Clients' Board (formerly Public Sector Construction Clients' Forum), Crown Commercial Services, The Facilities Management Board of the Cabinet Office UK, The South African Construction Industry Development Board, The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), The Association for Project Management (APM) and The British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM).\n\nThe Hong Kong government decided to use NEC3 contracts generally for all government projects tendered in 2015/16. After a series of successful NEC3 projects in the region, the Hong Kong government announced in November 2016 that the NEC contract suite will be used for all future public works projects as far as practicable.\n\nThe following demonstrates the differing approaches to drafting in the NEC and ICE forms of contract using the illustration of circumstances when the contractor is entitled to additional time and cost for physical conditions.\n\nThe Contractor encounters physical conditions which\n\n\nIf during the execution of the Works the Contractor shall encounter physical conditions (other than weather conditions or conditions due to weather conditions) or artificial obstructions which conditions or obstructions could not in her/his opinion reasonably have been foreseen by an experienced contractor the Contractor shall as early as practicable give written notice thereof to the Engineer. \n\nGuidance Notes and Flow Charts are published by the ICE. These notes are supplemented by the Frequently Asked Questions sections of the NEC website. Prospective users of the NEC3 contract are encouraged to study the FAQ's in order to avoid unintended contract provisions. The often unintended Option C scenario where a Contractor is paid monies in excess of the Target Cost plus maximum share provisions is specifically not addressed in the guidance notes / Frequently Asked Questions. Other common misinterpretations are minutes of meetings as communications, deleted work and paying for correcting defects. Employers often use the additional conditions of contract (Z-clauses) to amend or delete contract provisions relating to these items.\n\n"}

{"id": "768788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768788", "title": "Newspaper of record", "text": "Newspaper of record\n\nA newspaper of record is a major newspaper that has a large circulation and whose editorial and news-gathering functions are considered professional and typically authoritative. A newspaper of record may also be a publicly available newspaper that has been authorised or maintained by a government to publish public or legal notices, and therefore serves as a \"newspaper of public record\".\n\nA \"newspaper of public record\", sometimes referred to as an \"official newspaper\", refers to a publicly available newspaper that has been authorised by a government to publish public or legal notices. It is often established by statute or official action and publication of notices within it, whether by the government or a private party, is usually considered sufficient to comply with legal requirements for public notice.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, privately owned newspapers may register with the public authorities to publish public and legal notices, or be otherwise eligible to publish said notices (terms used may include \"newspaper of general circulation\" among others). Likewise, a private newspaper may be designated by the courts for publication of legal notices, such as notices of fictitious business names. These are sometimes referred to as \"legally adjudicated newspapers\".\n\nA variation of newspapers of public record are those newspapers controlled by governments or political parties that serve as official newspapers reflecting the positions of their controlling bodies. State organs such as the Soviet-era \"Izvestia\" (the name of which translates to \"delivered messages\", derived from the verb \"izveshchat\" which means \"to inform\", \"to notify\") and the \"People's Daily\" in China are examples of this type.\n\nThe second type of \"newspaper of record\" (also known as a \"journal of record\", or by the French term \"\") is not defined by any formal criteria and its characteristics can be variable. The category typically consists of those newspapers that are considered to meet higher standards of journalism than most print media, including editorial independence and attention to accuracy, and are usually renowned internationally. Despite changes in society, such newspapers have historically tended to maintain a similar tone, coverage, style, and traditions.\n\nThe term is believed to have originated among librarians, who began referring to \"The New York Times\" as the \"newspaper of record\" when, in 1913, it became the first U.S. newspaper to publish an index of the subjects covered in its pages. In recognition of the usage, the \"Times\" held an essay contest in 1927 in which entrants had to demonstrate \"The Value of \"The New York Times\" Index and Files as a Newspaper of Record\". The \"Times\", and other newspapers of its type, then sought to be chroniclers of events, acting as a record of the day's announcements, schedules, directories, proceedings, transcripts and appointments. The \"Times\" no longer considers itself a newspaper of record in the original, literal sense.\n\nOver time, historians began to rely on \"The New York Times\" and similar titles as a reliable archival record of significant past events and a gauge of societal opinions at the time of printing. The term \"newspaper of record\" thus evolved from its original literal sense to its currently understood meaning.\n"}
{"id": "28020667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28020667", "title": "Newspaper theft", "text": "Newspaper theft\n\nNewspaper theft is a form of censorship in which a large portion of the print run of a newspaper or other publication is stolen or destroyed, with the intention of preventing others from reading it. It may be carried out by individuals, organized groups, or governmental entities.\n\nThe motivation for newspaper theft is usually to suppress circulation of a story, item, or advertisement that is viewed as unfavorable or offensive by an individual or group. In some cases, the action is motivated by a generalized animus toward the editorial slant of the publication. The actors involved in newspaper thefts vary; they include political groups, fraternities and sororities, college athletic teams, as well as politicians or public officials, who may order police or other government agents to remove copies of the publication.\n\nThe Student Press Law Center has tracked college newspaper thefts since 2000. In 2012, 27 newspaper thefts were reported by college papers.\n\nThe unpaid taking of newspapers which are for sale constitutes theft, as does unauthorized taking of newspapers that have been delivered to subscribers or have yet to be distributed. However, removal of multiple copies of free newspapers and publications is not a crime in most jurisdictions. In response to high-profile incidents, laws specifically against newspaper theft, including the theft of large numbers of free newspapers, have been passed in the states of Maryland and Colorado, and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley, California. The Maryland law makes it a misdemeanor offense when \"A person ... knowingly or willfully obtain[s] or exert[s] control that is unauthorized over newspapers with the intent to prevent another from reading the newspapers.\"\n\nA related and less common phenomenon is the clandestine purchase of a large portion of the print run of a newspaper. While this does not normally violate any law, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in the 2004 case \"Rossignol v. Voorhaar\" that public officials who purchase a large portion of the print run of a newspaper with the intention of keeping a story out of the view of the public are acting in violation of the First Amendment and are liable for civil damages. This decision was later upheld by Supreme Court without hearing.\n\nIn the film \"Absence of Malice\", the character Teresa Perrone attempts unsuccessfully to destroy a run of newspapers that has a story exposing her abortion, before she commits suicide. In an episode of\" King of the Hill\", Hank removes an embarrassing photograph from all his neighbor's local newspapers before they woke up that morning.\n\n"}

It is related to the separate desktop stationery items that have one or more of the same functions, such as appointment calendars, rolodexes, notebooks, and almanacs.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, paper-and-binder personal organizers started to be replaced by electronic devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal information manager software, and online organizers.

{"id": "272590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272590", "title": "Pro Football Hall of Fame", "text": "Pro Football Hall of Fame\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame is the hall of fame for professional American football, located in Canton, Ohio. Opened in 1963, the Hall of Fame enshrines exceptional figures in the sport of professional football, including players, coaches, franchise owners, and front-office personnel, almost all of whom made their primary contributions to the game in the National Football League (NFL); the Hall inducts between four and eight new enshrinees each year. The Hall of Fame's Mission is to \"Honor the Heroes of the Game, Preserve its History, Promote its Values & Celebrate Excellence EVERYWHERE.\" \n\nWith the election of the Class of 2018 – Bobby Beathard, Robert Brazile, Brian Dawkins, Jerry Kramer, Ray Lewis, Randy Moss, Terrell Owens and Brian Urlacher – there are a total of 318 members of the Hall of Fame.\n\nThe community of Canton, Ohio successfully lobbied the NFL to have the Hall of Fame built in their city for two reasons: first, the NFL was founded in Canton in 1920 (at that time it was known as the American Professional Football Association); second, the now-defunct Canton Bulldogs were a successful NFL team based in Canton during the first few years of the league. Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962. The original building contained just two rooms, and of interior space.\n\nIn April 1970, ground was broken for the first of many expansions. This first expansion cost $620,000, and was completed in May 1971. The size was increased to by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the American Football League and its success in the final two AFL-NFL World Championship games.\nIn November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing US$1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now , more than 2.5 times the original size.\n\nThe building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing US$9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed in October 1995. The building's size was increased to . The most notable addition was the \"GameDay Stadium\", which shows an NFL Films production on a by Cinemascope screen.\n\nIn 2013, the Hall of Fame completed its largest expansion and renovation today. Currently, the Hall of Fame consists of 118,000 square feet.\n\nAn $800 million expansion project, Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village, is underway and will be completed to coincide with the NFL's Centennial in 2020.\n\n\nThrough 2018, all inductees except one, played some part of their professional career in the NFL (the lone exception is Buffalo Bills guard Billy Shaw, who played his entire career in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the 1970 AFL–NFL merger). Though several Hall of Famers have had AFL, Canadian Football League, World Football League, United States Football League, Arena Football League and/or Indoor Football League experience, and there is a division of the Hall devoted to alternative leagues such as this, to this point no players have made the Hall without having made significant contributions to either the NFL, AFL or All-America Football Conference. For CFL stars, there is a parallel Canadian Football Hall of Fame; only one player (Warren Moon) and one coach (Bud Grant) are in both halls.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have the most Hall of Famers among the league's franchises with either 34 or 28 enshrinees depending on whether you count players that only played a small portion of their careers with the team .\n\nEnshrinees are selected by a 48-person committee, largely made up of media members, officially known as the Selection Committee.\n\nEach city that has a current NFL team sends one representative from the local media to the committee. A city with more than one franchise sends a representative for each franchise. \n\nThere are also 15 at-large delegates including one representative from the Pro Football Writers Association. Except for the PFWA representative, who is appointed to a two-year term, all other appointments are open-ended and terminated only by death, incapacitation, retirement, or resignation.\n\nTo be eligible for the nominating process, a player or coach must have been retired for at least five years. Any other contributor such as a team owner or executive can be voted in at any time.\n\nFans may nominate any player, coach or contributor by simply writing to the Pro Football Hall of Fame via letter or email. The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail to eventually narrow the list to 25 semifinalists: once in March, once in September, and once in October. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting. A Seniors and Contributors Committee, subcommittees of the overall Selection Committee, nominate Seniors (those players who completed their careers more than 25 years ago) and Contributors (individuals who made contributions to the game in areas other than playing or coaching). The Seniors Committee and Contributors Committee add two or one finalist(s) on alternating years which makes a final ballot of 18 finalists under consideration by the full committee each year. Committee members are instructed to only consider a candidate's professional football contributions and to disregard all other factors.\n\nThe Selection Committee then meets on \"Selection Saturday,\" the day before each Super Bowl game to elect a new class. To be elected, a finalist must receive at least 80 percent support from the Board, with at least four, but no more than eight, candidates being elected annually. Once a contributor is inducted into the Hall, they cannot be banished and remain an inductee forever.\n\nThe enshrinement ceremony is usually held during the first full weekend in August. An enshrinement celebration is held throughout the week in Canton surrounding the enshrinement ceremony.\n\nEnshrinees do not go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of a certain team. Rather, all of an enshrinee's affiliations are listed equally. While the Baseball Hall of Fame plaques generally depict each of their inductees wearing a particular club's cap (with a few exceptions, such as Catfish Hunter and Greg Maddux), the bust sculptures of each Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee make no reference to any specific team. In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at new inductee ceremonies.\n\nPrevious induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999–2005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building. Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium), where it was held from 1963 to 1965. Since 2007, the enshrinement ceremony has been held on the Saturday night.\n\nThe Hall of Fame Game, the annual NFL preseason opener, is played in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. In 2017, the Hall of Fame Game was held for the first time on Thursday night. The preseason classic kicks off Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls and officially kicks off the NFL preseason.\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame uses only media representatives to select inductees. This, along with its policy of inducting only a maximum of seven players a year (six in certain years past), with a current maximum of two \"senior\" candidates and five \"non-seniors,\" has been criticized by sports columnists, former players, and football fans. Such critics would like to see solutions such as expanding the number of selectors, rotating panel members on and off the selection committee, and allowing former players to participate in the voting. The small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, with defensive players in general and defensive backs and outside linebackers in particular, special teams players, wide receivers, deserving players who primarily played on bad teams, and those from the \"seniors\" category, being slighted. This has included a 2009 \"New York Times\" article which criticized the Hall for not including punter Ray Guy on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position. (At least two inductees, Sammy Baugh and Yale Lary, punted in addition to playing other positions.) Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame. There has also been criticism that certain players get overlooked because their team underproduced during their careers.\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that officials have generally been excluded from the Hall; only one, 1966 inductee Hugh \"Shorty\" Ray, has been enshrined. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Hockey Hall of Fame have each inducted game officials as members. In part to rectify the lack of officials and other off-field contributors, the Hall of Fame added a “Contributors” committee beginning with the class of 2015, which will nominate officials, general managers, owners and other positions that have historically been overlooked by the committee at large.\n\nAnother prominent absence from the Hall is sports-journalist Howard Cosell, who has yet to be awarded the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award despite his well-known association with \"Monday Night Football\". An August 2010 \"Sports Illustrated\" article hints that Cosell may have even been \"blacklisted\" by the NFL.\n\nAs the late 2010s approached, a number of controversial and polarizing figures began to reach eligibility for the Hall. Terrell Owens's exclusion from the Hall in his first two years of eligibility despite his strong individual statistics was a subject of public debate. Owens was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018 but refused to attend the enshrinement ceremony. \n\n"}

It was redeveloped during the late 1990s to a design by Foster and Partners, from a 1970s design by Colin St John Wilson. The court was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.\n\nThe court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold and executed by Waagner-Biro, covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4,878 unique steel members connected at 1,566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6,100m of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof.\n\nControversially, some of the stone in the court is from France, rather than being Portland Stone from southern England as agreed in the original contract with the masons.\n\nWithin the Great Court, there are shops and a café. The court acts as a central linking point for the museum, somewhat like I. M.

At that time the entire courtyard was filled with bookshelves, three stories high (the 'Bookstacks'). To get from one side of the museum to the other visitors had to go round.\n\nOnce the Library had moved out, the bookstacks were cleared and the Great Court constructed in this central courtyard. A new 'ground' level was created, a storey higher than the original courtyard, with the space below used to accommodate the Clore Education Centre and the African galleries (which had been housed at the Museum of Mankind since 1970).\n\nThe South Portico was largely rebuilt, with two new lifts incorporated for disabled access to the upper levels of the museum.\n\nA new gridshell glass roof was provided over the entire courtyard to create a covered space at the centre of the museum.\n\nThe British Library Reading Room at the centre of the courtyard was retained and refurbished for use as the Museum library and information centre. As the Reading room had no outer wall - the bookstacks coming right up to the back of the reading room shelves - a new outer wall was created to protect the Reading room, to support the new roof and the conceal the ventilation ducts serving the spaces below.\n\nNorth of the Reading Room there is a block with a museum shop at ground level, a gallery for temporary exhibitions above and a restaurant above that, just below the glass roof.\n\nThe Clore Education Centre is housed in the lower level of the Great Court.

{"id": "483260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=483260", "title": "Religious discrimination", "text": "Religious discrimination\n\nReligious discrimination is treating a person or group differently because of the beliefs they hold about a religion. This includes when adherents of different religions, denominations or non-religions are treated unequally due to these beliefs, either before the law or in institutional settings, such as employment or housing.\n\nReligious discrimination is related to religious persecution, the most extreme forms of which would include instances in which people have been executed for beliefs perceived to be heretic. Laws which only carry light punishments are described as \"mild forms of religious persecution\" or as \"religious discrimination\".\n\nEven in societies where freedom of religion is a constitutional right, adherents of religious minorities sometimes voice concerns about religious discrimination against them. Insofar as legal policies are concerned, cases that are perceived as religious discrimination might be the result of an interference of the religious sphere with other spheres of the public that are regulated by law (and not aimed specifically against a religious minority).\n\nIn a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States Commission on Civil Rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for Freedom of Religion (in the United States secured by the First Amendment), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied \"the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom\".\n\nHowever, cases of religious discrimination might also be the result of an interference of the religious sphere with other spheres of the public that are regulated by law. Although e.g. in the United States the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", in \"Reynolds v. United States\" the U.S. supreme court decided that religious duty was not a suitable defense to a criminal indictment. In this specific case a law against bigamy was not considered to be discriminating against Mormons, who stopped practicing Polygamy in 1890.\n\nIn Canada, during 1995-1998, Newfoundland had only Christian schools (four of them, Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and inter-denominational (Anglican, Salvation Army and United Church)). The right to organize publicly supported religious schools was only given to certain Christian denominations, thus tax money used to support a selected group of Christian denominations. The denominational schools could also refuse admission of a student or the hiring of a qualified teacher on purely religious grounds. Quebec has used two school systems, one Protestant and the other Roman Catholic, but it seems this system will be replaced with two secular school systems: one French and the other English.\n\nOntario had two school systems going back before Confederation. The British North America Act (1867) gave the Provinces jurisdiction over education. Section 93 of the BNA Act offered constitutional protection for denominational schools as they existed in law at the time of Confederation. Like \"Public schools\", Catholic schools are fully funded from kindergarten to grade 12. However, profound demographic changes of the past few decades have made the province of Ontario a multicultural, multi-racial, and multi-religious society. The thought that one religious group is privileged to have schools funded from the public purse is becoming unacceptable in a pluralistic, multicultural, secular society. \n\nCanadian faith-based university, Trinity Western University is currently facing a challenge from members of the legal and LGBT community to its freedom to educate students in a private university context while holding certain \"religious values\", such as the freedom to discriminate against other people, including requiring students to sign a chastity oath, and denying LGBT students the same rights as straight students. TWU faced a similar battle in 2001 (Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers) where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that TWU was capable to teach professional disciplines.\n\nScientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so-called \"sect filters\" to expose a prospective business partner's or employee's association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised concerns over discriminatory practices directed at individual Scientologists.\n\nIn Greece since the independence from the Muslim Ottomans rule in the 19th century, the Greek Orthodox Church has been given privileged status and only the Greek Orthodox church, Roman Catholic, some Protestant churches, Judaism and Islam are recognized religions. The Muslim minority alleges that Greece persistently and systematically discriminates against Muslims.\n\nRecently, professor Nick Drydakis (Anglia Ruskin University) examined religious affiliation and employment bias in Athens, by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) were assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah's Witnesses). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah's Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah's Witnesses than male employers.\n\nAccording to a \"Human Rights Practices\" report by the \"U.S. State department\" on Mexico note that \"some local officials infringe on religious freedom, especially in the south\". There is conflict between Catholic/Mayan syncretists and Protestant evangelicals in the Chiapas region.\n\nAssyrian Christians have suffered from discrimination since Saddam Hussein's Arabization policies in the 1980s, with the latest instance of discrimination being the ISIS invasion of the Nineveh plains and Mosul, where tens of thousands have been forced to flee, and multiple Christian sites have been destroyed. The number of Christians in Iraq overall since the 2003 invasion has dropped by around 60%, from 800,000 to 300,000, and in 1987, that number was around 1.4 million. The 2014 invasion by ISIS has likely degraded that number further.\n\nSunni Muslims have also fallen victim to persecution from the majority Shia population of Iraq, which may have led to the ISIS invasion. \n\nHistorically, religious discrimination in Turkey has been a serious issue, with the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Genocides all occurring there. Discrimination has continued during the Syrian Civil War. In one instance, Turkey allowed members of Al Nusra, a radical Islamic terror group that controls land in Syria, to enter through its border, and then into the majority Armenian Christian town of Kessab, which is right on the Turkish–Syrian border. Al Nusra raided the town, capturing those who didn't flee. They proceeded to take their captives to the Turkish city of Iskenderun.\n\nReligious discrimination in Pakistan is a serious issue. Several incidents of discrimination have been recorded with some finding support by the state itself. In a case of constitutionally sanctioned religious discrimination, non-Muslims in Pakistan cannot become Prime Minister or President, even if they are Pakistani citizens. Pakistan's Blasphemy Law, according to critics, \"is overwhelmingly being used to persecute religious minorities and settle personal vendettas\". Ahmadiyya Muslims have been subject to significant persecution and are sometimes declared 'non-Muslims'.\n\n\n"}

The park includes a fleet of historic vessels, a visitor center, a maritime museum, and a library/research facility. The park used to be referred to as the San Francisco Maritime Museum, however the former 1951 name changed in 1978 when the collections were acquired by the National Park Service. Today's San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park was authorized in 1988; the maritime museum is among the park's many cultural resources. The park also incorporates the Aquatic Park Historic District, bounded by Van Ness Avenue, Polk Street, and Hyde Street.\n\nThe historic fleet of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park is moored at the park's Hyde Street Pier. The fleet consists of the following major vessels:\n\n\nThe fleet also includes over one hundred small craft.\n\nThe Visitor Center is housed in the park's 1909 waterfront warehouse, located at the corner of Hyde and Jefferson Streets. The City of San Francisco declared the four-story brick structure a historic landmark in 1974, and the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Inside, exhibits (including a first order Fresnel lighthouse lens and a shipwrecked boat) tell the story of San Francisco's colorful and diverse maritime heritage. The visitor center also contains a theater and a ranger-staffed information desk.\n\nThe maritime museum was until recently housed in a Streamline Moderne (late Art Deco) building that is the centerpiece of the Aquatic Park Historic District, a National Historic Landmark at the foot of Polk Street and a minute's walk from the visitor center and Hyde Street Pier. The building was originally built (starting in 1936) by the WPA as a public bathhouse, and its interior is decorated with fantastic and colorful murals, created primarily by artist and color theoretician Hilaire Hiler. The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III.\n\nThe Maritime Research Center is the premier resource for San Francisco and Pacific Coast maritime history. Originating in 1939, the collections have become the largest maritime collection on the West Coast and the largest museum and research collection in the National Park Service.\n\nThe collections include more than:\n\nThe park is supported by several cooperating associations. One of these is the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association.\n\nThe Visitors Center, Hyde Street Pier and Maritime Museum are all situated adjacent to the foot of Hyde Street and at the western end of the Fisherman's Wharf district. The park headquarters and Maritime Research Center are located in Fort Mason, some 10 minutes walk to the west of the other sites. The Beach and Hyde Street terminal of the San Francisco cable car system adjoins the main site, while the Jones Street terminal of the F Market historic streetcar line is some 5 minutes walk to the east.\n\nOpening times and fees for the various sites can be found on the park's website, see 'External links' below.\n\nAquatic Park is a popular place for open water swimming, both for recreation and training. The South End Rowing Club and Dolphin Club are located in Aquatic Park.

{"id": "34794371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34794371", "title": "Thomas Cook European Timetable", "text": "Thomas Cook European Timetable\n\nThe European Rail Timetable, more commonly known by its former names, the Thomas Cook European Timetable, the Thomas Cook Continental Timetable or simply Cook's Timetable, is an international timetable of selected passenger rail schedules for every country in Europe, along with a small amount of such content from areas outside Europe. It also includes regularly scheduled passenger shipping services and a few intercity bus (coach) services on routes where rail services are not operated. Except during World War II, it has been in continuous publication since 1873. Until 2013 it was published by Thomas Cook Publishing, in the United Kingdom, and since 1883 has been issued monthly. The longstanding inclusion of \"Continental\" in the title reflected the fact that coverage was, for many years, mostly limited to continental Europe. Information on rail services in Great Britain was limited to only about 30 pages (out of about 400-plus pages) until 1954 and then omitted entirely until 1970. June 2011 marked the 1500th edition.\n\nAlthough minor changes to the publication's title have been made over the years, every version included \"Continental\", rather than \"European\", from 1873 through 1987 — except for a brief period (1977–1980) when the coverage was expanded to worldwide and the name became the \"Thomas Cook International Timetable\". From 1981, most non-European content was moved into a new publication named the \"Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable\". \"Rail\" was added to the title only relatively recently, in 2005, making it the Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable, but its coverage continued to include some non-rail content, such as passenger shipping and ferry timetables. The \"Timetable\" has been recommended by several editors of travel guide books for Europe, one of whom described it as \"the most revered and accurate railway reference in existence\".\n\nOn 1 July 2013, Thomas Cook announced that it would cease publishing the \"Timetable\" and all of its other publications, in accordance with a decision to close the company's publishing business altogether. The final Thomas Cook edition of the \"Timetable\" was published in August 2013. However, at the end of October it was announced that publication would resume, independent of Thomas Cook Group, in February 2014 as a result of agreements that had been reached allowing the formation of a new company for that purpose, European Rail Timetable Limited. The new company is owned by John Potter, who was a member of the former editorial staff. The new version does not include Thomas Cook in its title. The first issue compiled by the new company was published in March 2014, with the publication title now being European Rail Timetable.\n\nThe idea that Thomas Cook & Son should publish a compendium of railway and steamship timetables for continental Europe was proposed by Cook employee John Bredall and approved by John Mason Cook, son of company founder Thomas Cook. The first issue was published in March 1873, under the title \"Cook's Continental Time Tables & Tourist's Handbook\". The first editor, part-time only, was John Bredall. The title was later altered to \"Cook's Continental Time Tables, Tourist's Handbook and Steamship Tables\". Publication was quarterly until the beginning of 1883, and monthly thereafter. Except for a break during World War II, publication has continued to be monthly ever since 1883. The \"Timetable\" has only had six editors-in-chief in its history. John Bredall was followed in 1914 by C. H. Davies. Later editors were H. V. Francis (1946–52), John H. Price (1952–85, then Managing Editor until 1988), Brendan H. Fox (1985–2013), and John Potter (since 2014). So as to remain sufficiently compact that it can be easily carried by a railway traveller, the \"Timetable\" does not show every scheduled train and every line for each country, but shows all major lines and most minor lines. It has always been a softcover book.\n\nWorld War I did not interrupt publication, but emphasis during the war was shifted more to shipping services, the result of disruption of rail service in several countries. During World War II, however, the timetable's publication was suspended, the last prewar issue being that of August 1939. Publication resumed in 1946.\n\nCook's chief competitor, \"Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide\", also ceased publication in 1939, but did not resume after the war (A Bradshaw Guide covering just the United Kingdom survived until 1961). This improved the potential for significant increase in sales of the \"Cook's Timetable\" in the postwar period, and Thomas Cook began to offer it in the form of a monthly subscription, in addition to selling individual copies.\n\nFrom January 1919, the title was altered slightly, to \"Cook's Continental Time-Table\". The apostrophe was dropped in 1956, and \"time-table\" also became one word. Subsequent name changes were made as follows:\n\nThe \"International\" name was short-lived, as the non-European content that had prompted the adoption of that name was moved into a new publication at the beginning of 1981, the \"Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable\" ().\n\nThe \"Continental Timetable\" became the \"European Timetable\" in January 1988. Although \"Rail\" was added to the title in 2005, the \"Timetable\" continues to include principal passenger shipping services and a few coach (intercity bus) services, as before, and its ISSN did not change in 2005.\n\nCoverage of Great Britain/the United Kingdom was originally very limited, and in the period 1954–70 it was excluded altogether. \"Bradshaw's Railway Guide\" had been publishing railway timetables for Britain since 1839, and continued to do so until 1961. British Rail was publishing its own timetable book, so even after \"Bradshaw's\" ceased publication, \"Cook's Timetable\" continued to cover only the continent. However, by the end of that decade Thomas Cook Publishing had decided it would be worthwhile to include in its \"Timetable\" a section covering the principal British services, and 64 pages of tables were added for this purpose in 1970.\n\nFollowing the example of some of the national railway companies on the continent (starting with Italy in 1898), the use of a 24-hour clock for train arrival and departure times was adopted by \"Cook's Timetable\" in December 1919. It was the first timetable book in Britain to adopt this practice.\n\nAlthough railway timetables have always been its predominant content, the \"Cook's Timetable\" included a substantial amount of other information during the first decades of the 20th century. The August 1939 edition, for example, devoted 48 of its 520 pages to general travel information, and regularly scheduled passenger shipping routes took 130 pages. In later decades, content other than railway timetables has continued to be included, but on a smaller scale. Shipping services consumed only about 30–35 pages in 1963 and general travel information consumed about 15–20 pages after the post-war resumption of publication.\nA longstanding regular inclusion was a section giving passport and visa requirements for each European country, as applicable to travellers from different countries, taking about 4–8 pages. Other longtime regular features included a summary of baggage and customs regulations for each country, information on foreign currencies and a table giving the annual rainfall and average monthly high and low temperatures for each of about 150–200 European cities. Some of these features, although included in the \"Timetable\" for more than a century, were scaled-back in the 1990s or 2000s, after such information became available in greater detail on the Internet, or because of the simplification of border control and currencies under the European Union. Added in about 1990 was a brief, five-language glossary of words often used by railway travellers. A one-page list of scenic rail routes is another regular inclusion. Included since at least 1949 is a multi-page section with small maps of several cities that have more than one station, showing the locations of the principal rail lines and stations — and also showing metro or tram lines connecting stations, where available, to help travellers who need to go between stations to continue their journeys. The number of cities covered by this section has varied over time, between about 30 and 60.\n\nAmong the changes implemented in the immediate post-war period was that timetables were numbered, by route. Previously, tables had been simply headed by the names of the major cities served by the route. Numbering of timetables is a common practice now. Initially, the maps for each country or region remained unaltered, not showing the timetable numbers. This changed with the issue of 23 May 1954, which introduced a set of 15 new \"index maps\" – in place of 10 maps previously included – all drawn in a new style, showing only the railway lines covered by the \"Timetable\" and with individual timetable numbers marked for each line on the maps.\n\nSections in which timetables for certain types of long-distance services are grouped are another longtime regular feature, with a section on \"car–sleeper trains\" and one covering major named international trains. After the launch of the Trans-Europe Express (TEE) network, a section covering just TEE trains was added, designated Table 10, and this table was changed to a EuroCity table when ECs replaced most of the then-remaining TEE services at the start of the railways' summer timetable period on 31 May 1987.\n\nThe February through May editions include a section, at the back of the issue, giving planned schedules for the forthcoming summer timetable period on main international routes, for the benefit of persons doing advance planning of a summer travel itinerary, subject to the railway companies of the various countries providing the information sufficiently far enough ahead of time for this \"supplement\". Similarly, the October and November editions include a supplement showing the planned winter schedules on major routes, for the railway operators' winter timetable period. This practice of including advance summer and winter supplements in \"Cook's Timetable\" in the 2–3 months before those seasonal changes took effect started in 1958.\n\nAround 1970, listings began to use local place-name spellings instead of anglicised versions for some – but not yet all – cities for which an English spelling existed. For example, the Hague became , and Munich became . This change was made in steps, not all at once. It was applied to all Italian cities, such as and , with effect from the 26 May 1974 edition. By mid-1975 the transition to local place-name spellings throughout the book had been completed. Distances between stations, shown in each route's timetable, were expressed in miles until the 1970s, but were changed to kilometres in 1976.\n\nThe \"Timetable\"'s page size from 1873–1939 was , but was increased to with the post-war resumption, and there have been only small changes to this subsequently. The \"Timetable\" currently measures . The number of pages per issue varies from issue to issue, mainly seasonally, and has varied over time. From the 1930s to the early 1990s the size of one issue usually varied between about 400 and 520 pages, while since the mid-1990s it has varied between about 560 and 600 pages.\n\nFor more than 136 years the cover of the \"Cooks Continental\" (or \"European\") \"Timetable\" was orange (or red-orange) in colour, but with effect from the October 2009 issue it was changed to blue, matching the colour used for Thomas Cook's \"Overseas Timetable\", in publication since 1981. When publication was taken over by a new publisher in 2014, what is now the \"European Rail Timetable\" returned to using red-orange for the cover colour.\n\nIn some years, a portion of the cover space was sold for an advertisement, including from the 1940s through 1975 and from 1998 through 2004. Since 2005, the cover does not carry advertising and, in the final years of publication by Thomas Cook, instead featured a monochrome photograph – changed with each issue – of a train of one of the railways of Europe.\n\nIn 2013, the \"European Timetable\" started to include a \"Route of the Month\" article in each monthly edition; it features narrative travel writing describing a particular European rail journey, usually with cross-reference to particular table numbers in the timetable section of the book. The legacy publication, independently published since March 2014 and now titled \"European Rail Timetable,\" continues to carry a \"Route of the Month\" in every issue. From early 2015, the Route of the Month was complemented by a second piece of narrative writing in every issue; this additional feature gives tips of travel planning and ticketing and runs under the title \"Tip of the Month\".\n\nAlthough coverage was mainly limited to continental Europe, by at least the 1960s a few pages were devoted to major routes in other areas, mostly adjacent to Europe. For example, in the February 1967 issue, 16 of its total of 440 pages were given to railway timetables for \"the USSR and Far East\", Turkey, and all countries in the Middle East and North Africa that had any scheduled train service. Non-European coverage was expanded in the 1970s. Schedules for Amtrak, in the United States, were added in 1972, after Amtrak hired Thomas Cook & Son Ltd. as a sales agent and paid to have its schedules included in the \"Timetable\". By 1974, Canadian National's service had also been added. However, altogether, the US and Canadian section still took up only 10 pages in a 520-page book.\n\nA more substantial change was implemented early in 1977, when coverage was expanded to world-wide, and the title was changed from the \"Thomas Cook Continental Timetable\" to the \"Thomas Cook International Timetable\". The new information for non-European countries was much more condensed than that for Europe, but the change still added 80 pages to the publication. The monthly print run exceeded 20,000 in summer 1977.\n\nIn January 1981, the non-European content was taken back out, to be included instead in a new bi-monthly publication entitled the \"Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable\" (), which averaged about 420 pages and included much more intercity bus (coach) services, in countries where intercity rail service was very limited or non-existent. With this change, the main timetable book reverted to the name \"Thomas Cook Continental Timetable\". The \"Overseas Timetable\" was published for 30 years, but ceased publication at the end of 2010.\n\nStarting in the early 1990s, quarterly editions of the \"European Timetable\" have also been published, sub-titled the \"Independent Traveller's Editions\" and containing 32 additional pages of travel information. The frequency of these was later reduced to twice per year, for the Summer and Winter periods only. These editions are intended mainly for sale at book shops and each one is given a distinct ISBN, in addition to the ISSN of the series title. They have a full-colour photograph on the cover, as compared to the monochrome photo on the cover of the regular \"European Timetable\".\n\nIn August 2011, about eight months after the \"Overseas Timetable\" ceased publication, a new section called \"Beyond Europe\" was added to the \"European Timetable\". This section appears in every issue but rotates among six different regions of the world outside Europe, with each area being included only twice per year, six months apart.\n\nA Japanese edition of the \"European Timetable\" was introduced in 1985, published twice a year (named the Spring and Summer editions) and printed by a different company, under a licensing agreement with Thomas Cook Publishing. The frequency later increased to quarterly but then reverted to bi-annually. The tables of train times are essentially unmodified, but the general-information sections and the introductory paragraphs at the start of each section are translated into Japanese. From 2000 to 2009, a monthly German-language edition was published, and this was produced directly by Thomas Cook Publishing – under an agreement with (German Railways) and titled . Unlike the Japanese version, this edition differed only slightly from the regular (English) \"Thomas Cook European Timetable\", with a brief German introduction and a different cover design.\n\nUsers and buyers of the \"Timetable\" have included independent travellers (both tourist and business travellers), travel agents, book shops, libraries and railway enthusiasts. The \"Timetable\" has been suggested as a useful reference by travel writers in various media, such as \"The New York Times\", and by many noted travel-guide writers. Fodor's has recommended \"Cook's Timetable\" for travellers to Europe who \"want to be really knowledgeable about train times in Europe\", while Let's Go Travel Guides has called it \"the ultimate reference\" for rail travellers on the continent. In \"Europe Through the Back Door 2005\", Rick Steves wrote that the \"Thomas Cook European Timetable\" is worth considering by any rail travellers who prefer a book format over Internet sources, when planning or taking a trip. Guide-book editor Stephen Birnbaum described the \"Timetable\" in 1991 as \"a weighty and detailed compendium of European national and international rail services that constitutes the most revered and accurate railway reference in existence.\" It has also been recommended by the travel website, The Man in Seat Sixty-One. A writer in a different genre, British novelist Malcolm Pryce, listed the \"Thomas Cook European Timetable\" as one of his favourite travel-related \"reads\" and suggested that it would appeal to those who are nostalgic for the romance of railway travel.\n\n"}

It was once known as the \"big green books\" and \"Thomas Registry\", and was a multi-volume directory of industrial product information covering 650,000 distributors, manufacturers and service companies within 67,000-plus industrial categories that is now published on ThomasNet.\n\nThe books were first published in 1898 by Harvey Mark Thomas as \"Hardware and Kindred Trades. \"In their heyday, Thomas Register of American Manufacturers was a 34-volume, 3 section buying guide offering sourcing information on industrial products and services, along with comprehensive specifications and detailed product information from thousands of manufacturers. The Thomas Regional Directory Company began as a division of Thomas Publishing in 1976. Thomas Regional Regional Industrial Buying Guides provided information in print and on CD-ROM, on local OEMs, distributors, MRO services and other custom manufacturing services in 19 regional editions covering much of the United States. Thomas Register and Thomas Regional were available online from the mid 1990s. The company stopped publishing its print products in 2006.\n\nThomas has moved its database online as ThomasNet, published and maintained by Thomas Industrial Network, one of Thomas’ five business units. ThomasNet has expanded to provide not only product and company information, but also online catalogs, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, news, press releases and blogs.\n\nThomas Publishing Company, LLC of New York City has been privately held since its inception. It used independent representatives to sell advertising space around its listings in print products like the Thomas Register and the Thomas Industrial Regional Directories, and these representatives continue to sell Internet related products to manufacturers, distributors, and other companies.\n\nThomasNet is an information and technology company based in New York City. In April 2006 the New York Public Library named ThomasNet.com as one of its 25 Best of Reference sources for the reference librarian, and is currently listed in their Best of the Web list for Industry Information.\n\nSince November 2010, ThomasNet has been a founding partner of GlobalTrade.net, a marketplace for international trade service providers.\n\nThomasNet News is a product of Thomas Publishing Company, LLC. ThomasNet News was introduced with “the mission of delivering timely, new industrial product information covering the whole range of products …” It manually reviews press releases submitted through the website and publishes with a small description in one of 51 different categories.\n\nIn 2000, ThomasNet News released Industry Market Trends (IMT), its first Journal. In the IMT, editors published editorials, interviews, and long form journalism on issues ranging from career skills, developments in the industry, and discussions with leading experts. Soon after, IMT Green & Clean was launched in response to the growing interest in green technology and its impact on the world. In 2011, the IMT Machining Journal was launched followed by the IMT Fluid & Gas Flow Journal, the IMT Career Journal, and the IMT Procurement Journal.\n\nStarting in 2010, ThomasNet began reaching out to its database of manufacturers to get a better understanding of where the community was, where their shortcomings were, and where they saw the landscape going in the future. This yearly survey is called the Industry Market Barometer.\n\n"}
{"id": "31896730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31896730", "title": "Ubaoner", "text": "Ubaoner\n\nUbaoner is the name of a fictitious ancient Egyptian magician appearing in the second chapter of a story told in the legendary \"Westcar Papyrus.\" He is said to have worked wonders during the reign of king (pharaoh) Nebka (3rd dynasty).\n\nUbaoner appears only in the second story of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" – there is no archeological or historical evidence that he existed. Nevertheless, he is an object of great interest for Egyptologists, since his magical trick is connected to later cultural perceptions of the personality of king Nebka. In the story, Ubaoner is described as a high lector priest.\n\nAccording to the \"Westcar Papyrus,\" Ubaoner is betrayed by his own wife several times. She secretly loves a commoner who resides at Memphis and sends him expensive clothes and other material. The commoner comes to visit Ubaoner's wife and says to her: “Isn't there a pavilion at the lake?” The wife says: “See, let's spend some time in there.” She calls for Ubaoner's caretaker and orders him: “Prepare the pavilion with all good things.” And so Ubaoner's wife and the commoner spend their time in the pavilion drinking together, until they were finished. Later that evening the commoner is picked up by his maidservant, who was waiting at the lake. Ubaoner's caretaker was waiting there, too and he says to himself: “I will go to Ubaoner.” Two days later the caretaker tells everything to Ubaoner and makes the comment: “See, it was your wife who spent a day in your pavilion; she was together with that commoner you know. It was adultery what he did, two times, at your lake.” Thereupon, Ubaoner says to the caretaker: “Bring me a pair of [...] made of ebony and dja'am. I will create [...] and send it as a harbinger.” He creates a small figurine of wax in the shape of a crocodile with a length of seven fingers. He bewitches the figurine and gives it to his caretaker with the words: “When he comes to purify himself in the lake, this commoner, then you may throw this crocodile made of wax after him.” The caretaker does as ordered and waits until the next day. The next morning Ubaoner's wife orders the caretaker: “Let the pavilion at the lake be prepared, for I will sit in it.” Thereupon she spends the whole day in the pavilion together with the commoner. Later that evening the commoner leaves the pavilion to take a bath in the lake. The caretaker quickly throws the wax figurine after the stranger and when the idol touches the water it becomes a real, living crocodile 3.70m in length. The animal devours the commoner and disappears in the depths of the lake for seven days. During these seven days Ubaoner is received by pharaoh Nebka for an important audience. After the audience Ubaoner invites Nebka to visit his house with the words: “May thy majesty proceed and see the wonder that has happened in the time of thy majesty [...] a commoner.”. Nebka and Ubaoner walk to the lake where Ubaoner orders the crocodile to come out of the water and to release the commoner. When king Nebka sees that he says: “This crocodile is dangerous!” But Ubaoner bends down and touches the crocodile and immediately it becomes a figurine of wax again. Then Ubaoner gives a report to Nebka about the affairs. Nebka tells the crocodile: “Take away what is yours!” and the animal grabs the commoner and then disappears. The wife of Ubaoner is brought to Nebka, too and the pharaoh sentence her to death. She is brought to a place east of the palace and burnt alive. Her ash is thrown into the Nile.\n\nAdolf Erman and Kurt Heinrich Sethe once considered the stories of \"Papyrus Westcar\" as mere folklore. They saw literary figures like Djadjaemankh and the other heroes of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" as a pure fiction, created only for entertainment, since there is no archeological evidence of them.\n\nModern Egyptologists like Verena Lepper and Miriam Lichtheim deny this view and argue, that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of such novels. They hold that the story of Ubaoner describes a classical case of adultery through the wife and a typical sort of punishment for that during the Old Kingdom (in this case it is the death penalty). Furthermore, it throws a positive light on the personality of king Nebka. The king is depicted as a strict but lawful judge: He punishes mischief and unethical behavior, in this case the betrayal of Ubaoner's wife. Additionally, Lepper and Lichtheim point to multiple similar but somewhat later ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks. According to the Egyptologists, their stories are obviously inspired by the tale of Ubaoner. And since they show the same manner of speaking and equal picking up of quaint phrases as the \"Westcar Papyrus\" does, Lepper and Lichtheim hold that Ubaoner (and the other wise men from the same papyrus) must have been known to Egyptian authors for a long time.\n\n"}
{"id": "46729435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46729435", "title": "Wednesday Martin", "text": "Wednesday Martin\n\nWendy \"Wednesday\" Martin is an American author and cultural critic who writes and serves as a commentator on topics like parenting, step-parenting, female sexuality, motherhood, and popular culture. She is the author of five books. She has also written for \"The New York Times\", \"The Atlantic\", \"Psychology Today\", \"The Huffington Post\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", and \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nMartin was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan and grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. She did her undergraduate work at the University of Michigan where she studied anthropology and received a doctorate in comparative literature and cultural studies from Yale University. Her doctoral work examined early psychoanalysis and anthropology.\n\nMartin has taught literature and cultural studies at Yale, The New School, and Baruch College.\n\nIn May 2009, Martin's memoir about her experience as a stepmother called \"Stepmonster: A New Look at Why Real Stepmothers Think, Feel and Act the Way We Do\" was published.\n\nAfter Martin moved to the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan with her family in 2004, she began researching and documenting her experiences there for her next book, \"Primates of Park Avenue\". Simon & Schuster released the book in June 2015. The memoir recounted Martin's experience living among the wealthy women, particularly stay-at-home mothers, of the Upper East Side and examined their behavior from a social researcher's perspective, inspired by the work of Jane Goodall. In June 2015, MGM studios purchased the film rights to \"Primates of Park Avenue\" from Martin. In May 2018, Lionsgate and Martin agreed to collaborate on a television show developed and co-written by Martin based upon the book. \"Primates\" has been translated into nine languages, as of 2018.\n\nIn her book \"Untrue\" (2018), Martin focused on female sexuality and addressing untruths about women and sex.\n\nMartin has also written for \"Psychology Today\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Huffington Post\", and \"The Atlantic\".\n\nMartin is the author of the following books and ebooks:\n\nIn May 2013, several articles were published about the practice of hiring disabled guides to avoid lines at Disney World, which Martin uncovered during her research for \"Primates of Park Avenue\". On May 16, 2015, \"The New York Times\" published an essay by Martin in the Sunday Review section, titled \"Poor Little Rich Women\", prior to the publication of her book \"Primates of Park Avenue\". The article received coverage from numerous media outlets, in particular the concept of financial rewards called \"wife bonuses\", which Martin reported some Upper East Side wives receive from their husbands for superior domestic performance. Following the essay, commentary appeared in the \"New York Post\" and \"Page Six\", arguing both for and against Martin's account of wife bonuses. \"The New York Times\" characterized Martin's description of wife bonuses as \"disputed\". It was one of the top 20 most-read articles in the \"New York Times\" that year.\n\n\"Primates of Park Avenue\" debuted at number one on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for Nonfiction E-Book, number two for Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction and number three for Nonfiction Hardcover. In \"The New York Times\" review of the book, Martin's writing was called \"confident\" and \"evocative\". The book received generally positive reviews from the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"The Economist\" and the \"Financial Times\".\n\nThe book and its reception were the subject of multiple articles in the months before and after its publication in \"The New York Times\", as well as covered by publications including \"Time\", \"Vanity Fair\", and \"NPR\".\n\nAn article published by the \"New York Post\" outlined alleged discrepancies between Martin's published account and public records. \"The Washington Post\" cast additional doubt on some of the book's assertions. The day following the \"New York Post\" article, Simon & Schuster issued a public statement that changing names, dates, and identifying details is common in the genre of memoir, and that a note stating some information had been altered would be included with the e-book and future printings of \"Primates of Park Avenue\". Martin said that she had changed details in the book for privacy concerns and told \"The Washington Post\" that “I stand by what I wrote, absolutely 100 percent”.\n\nKaren Heller of \"The Washington Post\" recapped the coverage in July 2015 and noted that \"the copious coverage and social media chatter about the book...could possibly fill another book.\"\n\nMartin is married to Joel Moser, a lawyer, financier, chief executive officer and adjunct professor at Columbia University, with whom she has two sons, one born in 2001 and the other in 2007. She has two step-daughters, children of Moser's first marriage.\n"}

Directory was a web directory which at one time rivaled DMOZ in size. The directory was Yahoo!'s first offering and started in 1994 under the name Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web.

Users could browse thousands of listings which were organized in 7 or more tiers. For example, if a user was looking for a site on chess they might follow a path such as: recreation -> games -> board games -> chess.\n\nThe directory originally offered two options for suggesting websites for possible listing: \"Standard\", which was free, and a paid submission process which offered expedited review. \"Standard\" was dropped, and a non-refundable review fee of $299 ($600 for adult sites) was required when suggesting any website.

In North America it is the only example of historic Chinese vernacular architecture. As such it provides an example of the type of dwelling an average family in China would have lived in. The Yin Yu Tang (Hall of Plentiful Shelter) was built in the late eighteenth century during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). \n\nA prosperous merchant surnamed Huang built a stately sixteen-bedroom house in China's southeastern Huizhou region, calling his home Yin Yu Tang House. This Chinese merchant commissioned the construction of the house in the province of his birth, Anhui, China. The five-bay, two-story residence was typical of its region, built of timber frame construction, with a tile roof and exterior masonry walls of sandstone and brick. The house is about 47 feet 6 inches by 52 feet 5-1/2 inches not including the kitchens. In addition to sixteen bedrooms there are also two reception areas, a storage room, and a courtyard in the center. There are also large intricately carved wooden panels that cover the inner windows on the first floor. \n\nThe house survived economic and political upheavals, and was home to eight generations of the Huang family. By the mid-1980s the house stood empty. Local and national authorities, with the endorsement of the original owner's descendants, gave permission for the house (and its contents) to be relocated to the Peabody Essex Museum (PEM) in Salem, Massachusetts. The house opened in June 2003 as a permanent exhibit at the PEM. \n\n\n"}
