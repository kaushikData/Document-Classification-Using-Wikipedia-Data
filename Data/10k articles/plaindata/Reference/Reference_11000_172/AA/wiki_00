{"id": "66870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66870", "title": "Annie Hall", "text": "Annie Hall\n\nAnnie Hall is a 1977 American romantic comedy film directed by Woody Allen from a screenplay he co-wrote with Marshall Brickman. Produced by Allen's manager, Charles H. Joffe, the film stars the director as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the film's eponymous female lead, played by Diane Keaton in a role written specifically for her.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island, and filming continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer Gordon Willis, as \"a major turning point\", in that unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of Jewish identity, and the elements of psychoanalysis and modernism.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival in March 1977, before its official release on April 20, 1977. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and along with winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, it received Oscars in three other categories: two for Allen (Best Director and, with Brickman, Best Original Screenplay), and Best Actress for Keaton. The film additionally won four BAFTA awards and a Golden Globe, the latter being awarded to Keaton. Its North American box office receipts of $38,251,425 are fourth-best of Allen's works when not adjusted for inflation.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest films of all-time, it ranks 31st on AFI's List of the greatest films in American cinema, 4th on their list of greatest comedy films and 28th on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". Film critic Roger Ebert called it \"just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie\". The film's screenplay was also named the funniest ever written by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the \"101 Funniest Screenplays\". In 1992, the United States' Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry that includes \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" films.\n\nThe comedian Alvy Singer is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in New York, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity.\n\nAnnie and Alvy, in a line for \"The Sorrow and the Pity,\" overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and Marshall McLuhan; McLuhan himself steps in at Alvy's invitation to criticize the man's comprehension. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whose ardor gave him no pleasure. His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports and was unable to reach orgasm.\n\nWith Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in \"mental subtitles\" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club (\"It Had to be You\"). He suggests they kiss first to get it out of the way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is \"a wreck\", while she relaxes with a joint.\n\nSoon Annie admits she loves him, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When she moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, he finds her arm in arm with one of her college professors and the two begin to argue whether this is the \"flexibility\" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the Evil Queen in \"Snow White\".\n\nAlvy returns to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis, bad sex, and finally an interruption from Annie, who insists he come over immediately. It turns out she needs him to kill a spider. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they fly out to Los Angeles, with Alvy's friend, Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing her to her record producer, Tony Lacey, he unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship but changes the ending: now she accepts.\n\nThe last meeting for them is a wistful coda on New York's Upper West Side, when they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy's voice returns with a summation: love is essential, especially if it is neurotic. Annie sings \"Seems Like Old Times\" and the credits roll.\n\nTruman Capote has a cameo as the Winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.\n\nSeveral actors who went on to more fame had small parts in the movie: John Glover as Annie's actor boyfriend, Jerry; Jeff Goldblum as a man who \"forgot [his] mantra\" at Tony Lacey's Christmas party; and Sigourney Weaver, in her film debut, in the closing sequence as Alvy's date at the movie theater.\n\nThe idea for what would become \"Annie Hall\" was developed as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project on alternative days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on a man in his forties, someone whose life consisted \"of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that \"advancing age\" and \"worries about death\" had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his \"commercial side\". Allen made the conscious decision to \"sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings\". He recognized that for the first time he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama \"8½\", created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.\n\nBrickman and Allen sent the screenplay back and forth until they were ready to ask United Artists for $4 million. Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot. According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film \"Face to Face\". Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: 1993's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\", also starring Diane Keaton. The draft that Allen presented to the film's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, concluded with the words, \"ending to be shot.\"\n\nAllen suggested \"Anhedonia\", a term for the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title, and Brickman suggested alternatives including \"It Had to Be Jew\", \"Rollercoaster Named Desire\" and \"Me and My Goy.\" An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as \"Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!\". However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including \"Anxiety\" and \"Annie and Alvy\", before settling on \"Annie Hall\".\n\nSeveral references in the film to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene; certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's; Allen went to New York University and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is \"Hall\" and \"Annie\" was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. \"The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not,\" Allen said. \"It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that \"Annie Hall\" was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't\". Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by Geraldine Page) in his next film, \"Interiors\". Despite this, Keaton has stated that the relationship between Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.\n\nThe role of Annie Hall was written specifically for Keaton, who had worked with Allen on \"Play It Again, Sam\" (1972), \"Sleeper\" (1973) and \"Love and Death\" (1975). She considered the character an \"affable version\" of herself—both were \"semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity\"—and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance. The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their previous project being \"Play It Again, Sam\".\n\nFederico Fellini was Allen's first choice to appear in the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion, but Allen chose cultural academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and Luis Buñuel declined the cameo. Some cast members, Baxter claims, were aggrieved at Allen's treatment of them. The director \"acted coldly\" towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and Mordecai Lawner, who played Alvy's father, claimed that Allen never spoke to him. However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with Stacey Nelkin, who appears in a single scene.\n\nPrincipal photography began on May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island with the scene in which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically for the next ten months, and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he \"saw this roller-coaster, and ... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this.\" Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.\n\nEditor Ralph Rosenblum's first assembly of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. \"I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions,\" Brickman recalled. \"It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled.\" Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as \"the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life and in the process satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of \"Take the Money and Run\"\". Brickman found it \"nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise.\" He suggested a more linear narrative.\n\nThe present-tense relationship between Alvy and Annie was not the narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film \"in the direction of that relationship.\" Rosenblum recalled that Allen \"had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes in order to establish Keaton more quickly.\" According to Allen, \"I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it.\"\n\nAs the film was budgeted for two weeks of post-production photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.\n\nThe credits call the film \"A Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe Production\"; the two men were Allen's managers and received this same credit on his films from 1969 to 1993. However, for this film Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the Academy Award for Best Picture. The title sequence features a black background with white text in the Windsor Light Condensed typeface, a design that Allen would use on his subsequent films. Stig Björkman sees some similarity to Ingmar Bergman's simple and consistent title design, although Allen says that his own choice is a cost-saving device.\n\nVery little background music is heard in the film, a departure for Allen influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Diane Keaton performs twice in the jazz club: \"It Had to be You\" and \"Seems Like Old Times\" (the latter reprises in voiceover on the closing scene). The other exceptions include a boy's choir \"Christmas Medley\" played while the characters drive through Los Angeles, the Molto allegro from Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (heard as Annie and Alvy drive through the countryside), Tommy Dorsey's performance of \"Sleepy Lagoon\", and the anodyne cover of the Savoy Brown song \"A Hard Way to Go\" playing at a party in the mansion of Paul Simon's character.\n\nTechnically, the film marked an advance for the director. He selected Gordon Willis as his cinematographer—for Allen \"a very important teacher\" and a \"technical wizard,\" saying, \"I really count \"Annie Hall\" as the first step toward maturity in some way in making films.\" At the time, it was considered an \"odd pairing\" by many, Keaton among them. The director was known for his comedies and farces, while Willis was known as \"the prince of darkness\" for work on dramatic films like \"The Godfather\". Despite this, the two became friends during filming and continued the collaboration on several later films, including \"Zelig\", which earned Willis his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.\n\nWillis described the production for the film as \"relatively easy.\" He shot in varying styles; \"hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for ... dream sequences,\" most of which were cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: \"Few viewers probably notice how much of \"Annie Hall\" consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be ... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship.\" He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of \"Annie Hall\" to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that \"Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained.\" Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.\n\nAlthough the film is not essentially experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line to see a movie with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to correct the man's errors personally. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, \"mental subtitles\" convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip \"Inside Woody Allen\"—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from \"Snow White\". Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the \"fourth wall\" is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable \"wish-fulfillment.\" Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\"\n\nSociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz consider Alvy and Annie's relationship to be a stereotype of gender differences in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as \"the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on.\" Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise of his relationship with Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that \"It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades,\" a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately \"irrational and crazy and absurd\", but a necessity of life. Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note.\n\nRichard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" notes the film's \"Eurocentric art-house self-awareness\" and Alvy Singer's \"psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions\".\n\nSinger is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that \"Alvy dines with the WASP-y Hall family and imagines that they must see him as a Hasidic Jew, complete with payess (ear locks) and a large black hat.\" Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie's grandmother \"hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she’s the one. Is she ever, I’m telling you.\", revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother's stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that \"no stigma attaches to the love of money in America\". Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen's joke, \"I would like to but we need the eggs\", to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.\n\nChristopher Knight points out that \"Annie Hall\" is framed through Alvy's experiences. \"Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor.\" He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with \"past and future protagonists as well as with the director himself\", it \"makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events\". Despite the narrative's framing, \"the joke is on Alvy.\"\nEmanuel Levy believes that Alvy Singer became synonymous with the public perception of Woody Allen in the United States. \"Annie Hall\" is viewed as the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" \"is as much a love song to New York City as it is to the character,\" reflecting Allen's adoration of the island of Manhattan. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like \"Manhattan\" (1979) and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986). Annie Hall's apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue is by Allen's own confession his favorite block in the city. Peter Cowie argues that the film shows \"a romanticized view\" of the borough, with the camera \"linger[ing] on the Upper East Side [... and where] the fear of crime does not trouble its characters.\" By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious \"invidious intellectual comparison\" between New York City and Los Angeles. While Manhattan's movie theaters show classic and foreign films, Los Angeles theaters run less-prestigious fare such as \"The House of Exorcism\" and \"Messiah of Evil\". Rob's demonstration of adding canned laughter to television demonstrates the \"cynical artifice of the medium\". New York serves as a symbol of Alvy's personality (\"gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy\") while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" has been cited as a film which uses both therapy and analysis for comic effect. Sam B. Girgus considers \"Annie Hall\" to be a story about memory and retrospection, which \"dramatizes a return via narrative desire to the repressed and the unconscious in a manner similar to psychoanalysis\". He argues that the film constitutes a self-conscious assertion of how narrative desire and humor interact in the film to reform ideas and perceptions and that Allen's deployment of Freudian concepts and humor forms a \"pattern of skepticism toward surface meaning that compels further interpretation\". Girgus believes that proof of the pervasiveness of Sigmund Freud in the film is demonstrated at the beginning through a reference to a joke in \"Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious\", and makes another joke about a psychiatrist and patient, which Girgus argues is also symbolic of the dynamic between humor and the unconscious in the film. Further Freudian concepts are later addressed in the film with Annie's recall of a dream to her psychoanalyst in which Frank Sinatra is smothering her with a pillow, which alludes to Freud's belief in dreams as \"visual representations of words or ideas\".\n\nPeter Bailey in his book \"The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen\", argues that Alvy displays a \"genial denigration of art\" which contains a \"significant equivocation\", in that in his self-deprecation he invites the audience to believe that he is leveling with them. Bailey argues that Allen's devices in the film, including the subtitles which reveal Annie's and Alvy's thoughts \"extend and reinforce \"Annie Hall\" 's winsome ethos of plain-dealing and ingenuousness\". He muses that the film is full of antimimetic emblems such as Mcluhan's magical appearance which provide quirky humor, and that the \"disparity between mental projections of reality and actuality\" drives the film. His view is that self-reflective cinematic devices intelligently dramatize the difference between surface and substance, with visual emblems \"incessantly distilling the distinction between the world mentally constructed and reality\".\n\nIn his discussion of the film's relation to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved \"examination of the process of human interaction and interpersonal communication\" and \"immediately establishes [a] self-referential stance\" that invites the spectator \"to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth\". For him, Alvy \"is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning – or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' – and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure.\" Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as a child (in a therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed existential crisis.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" was shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival in March 1977, before its official release on April 20, 1977. The film ultimately earned $38,251,425 ($143,228,400 in 2013 dollars) in the United States against a $4-million budget, making it the 11th highest-grossing picture of 1977. On raw figures, it currently ranks as Allen's fourth-highest-grossing film, after \"Manhattan\", \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" and \"Midnight in Paris\"; when adjusted for inflation, the gross figure makes it Allen's biggest box office hit. It was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012 alongside Allen's 1979 film \"Manhattan\". Both releases include the films' original theatrical trailers.\n\n\"Annie Hall\" was met with widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Tim Radford of \"The Guardian\" called the film \"Allen's most closely focused and daring film to date\". \"The New York Times\"' Vincent Canby preferred \"Annie Hall\" to Allen's second directorial effort, \"Take the Money and Run\", since the former is more \"humane\" while the latter is more a \"cartoon\". Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman's \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973), including Joseph McBride in \"Variety\", who found it Allen's \"most three-dimensional film to date\" with an ambition equal to Bergman's best even as the co-stars become the \"contemporary equivalent of ... Tracy-Hepburn.\"\n\nMore critically, Peter Cowie commented that the film \"suffers from its profusion of cultural references and asides\". Writing for New York Magazine, the hard-to-please critic John Simon called the film \"unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation,\" and wrote that Keaton's performance was \"in bad taste to watch and indecency to display,\" saying the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall. Simon's review of \"Annie Hall\" made a general assessment that didn't pan out: \"It is a film so shapeless, sprawling, repetitious, and aimless as to seem to beg for oblivion. At this, it is successful.\"\n\nAfter more than a quarter century, the film has continued to receive positive reviews. In his 2002 lookback, Roger Ebert noted with surprise that the film had \"an instant familiarity\" despite its age, and \"Slant\" writer Jaime N. Christley found the one-liners \"still gut-busting after 35 years\". A later \"Guardian\" critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that \"this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is a miracle of comic writing and inspired film-making\". John Marriott of the \"Radio Times\" believed that \"Annie Hall\" was the film where Allen \"found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection\", referring to the \"comic delight\" derived from the \"spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic\". \"Empire\" magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a \"classic\". In 2017, Claire Dederer wrote, \"\"Annie Hall\" is the greatest comic film of the twentieth century [...] because it acknowledges the irrepressible nihilism that lurks at the center of all comedy.\"\n\nAt Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, \"Annie Hall\" represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic\". Metacritic gave the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nAnnie Hall won four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards on April 3, 1978, and was nominated for five in total. Producer Charles H. Joffe received the statue for Best Picture, Allen for Best Director and, with Brickman, for Best Original Screenplay, and Keaton for Best Actress. Allen was also nominated for Best Actor. Many had expected \"Star Wars\" to win the major awards, including Brickman and Executive Producer Robert Greenhut.\n\nThe film was also honored four times at the BAFTA awards. Along with the top award for Best Film, Keaton won for Best Actress, Allen won for Best Direction and Best Original Screenplay alongside Brickman. The film received only one Golden Globe Award, for Best Film Actress in a Musical or Comedy (Diane Keaton), despite nominations for three other awards: Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Director, and Best Film Actor in a Musical or Comedy (Woody Allen).\n\nIn 1992, the United States' Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry that includes \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" films. The film is often mentioned among the greatest comedies of all time. The American Film Institute lists it 31st in American cinema history. In 2000, they named it second greatest romantic comedy in American cinema. Keaton's performance of \"Seems Like Old Times\" was ranked 90th on their list of greatest songs included in a film, and her line \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da.\" was named the 55th greatest movie quote. The screenplay was named the sixth greatest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America, West while IGN named it the seventh greatest comedy film of all time. In 2000, readers of \"Total Film\" magazine voted it the forty-second greatest comedy film of all time, and the seventh greatest romantic comedy film of all time. Several lists ranking Allen's best films have put \"Annie Hall\" among his greatest work.\n\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its 10 Top 10—the best ten films in ten classic American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community and \"Annie Hall\" was placed second in the romantic comedy genre. AFI also ranked \"Annie Hall\" on multiple other lists. In November 2008, \"Annie Hall\" was voted in at No. 68 on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". It is also ranked #2 on Rotten Tomatoes' 25 Best Romantic Comedies, second only to \"The Philadelphia Story\". In 2012, the film was listed as the 127th best film of all time by the \"Sight & Sound\" critics' poll. The film was also named the 132nd best film by the \"Sight & Sound\" directors' poll. \nIn October 2013, the film was voted by the \"Guardian\" readers as the second best film directed by Woody Allen. In November 2015, the film was named the funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of \"101 Funniest Screenplays\".\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nAlthough the film received critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, and said in an interview, \"When \"Annie Hall\" started out, that film was not supposed to be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind ... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about ... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie\". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that \"Sequelism has become an annoying thing. I don't think Francis Coppola should have done \"Godfather III\" because \"Godfather II\" was quite great. When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much\".\n\nDiane Keaton has stated that Annie Hall was her favorite role and that the film meant everything to her. When asked if being most associated with the role concerned her as an actress, she replied, \"I'm not haunted by Annie Hall. I'm happy to be Annie Hall. If somebody wants to see me that way, it's fine by me\". Costume designer Ruth Morley, working with Keaton, created a look which had an influence on the fashion world during the late-70s, with women adopting the style: layering oversized, mannish blazers over vests, billowy trousers or long skirts, a man's tie, and boots. The look was often referred to as the \"\"Annie Hall\" look\". Some sources suggest that Keaton herself was mainly responsible for the look, and Ralph Lauren has often claimed credit, but only one jacket and one tie were purchased from Ralph Lauren for use in the film. Allen recalled that Lauren and Keaton's dress style almost did not end up in the film. \"She came in,\" he recalled in 1992, \"and the costume lady on \"Annie Hall\" said, 'Tell her not to wear that. She can't wear that. It's so crazy.' And I said, 'Leave her. She's a genius. Let's just leave her alone, let her wear what she wants.'\"\n\nJames Bernardoni states that the film is \"one of the very few romantic comedy-dramas of the New Hollywood era and one that has rightly taken its place among the classics of that reverted genre\", likening the seriocomic meditation on the couple relationship to George Cukor's \"Adam's Rib\" (1949), starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Since its release, other romantic comedies have inspired comparison. \"When Harry Met Sally...\" (1989), \"Chasing Amy\" (1997), \"Burning Annie\" (2007), \"500 Days of Summer\" (2009) and Allen's 2003 film, \"Anything Else\", are among them, while film director Rian Johnson said in an interview for the book, \"The Film That Changed My Life\", that \"Annie Hall\" inspired him to become a film director. Karen Gillan stated that she watched \"Annie Hall\" as part of her research for her lead role in \"Not Another Happy Ending\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12602306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12602306", "title": "Bottlenose skate", "text": "Bottlenose skate\n\nThe bottlenose skate, spearnose skate, or white skate (\"Rostroraja alba\") is a species of skate in the family Rajidae. It is a benthic fish native to the coastal eastern Atlantic Ocean. Due to overfishing, it has been depleted or extirpated in many parts of its former range in the northeastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, and is now endangered.\n\nThe bottlenose skate is found along the coastlines of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the southern British Isles to South Africa, including the Mediterranean, and extending into the southwestern Indian Ocean to Mozambique. It is listed as occurring in the northwestern European seas, but no valid records exist for the northern areas of the northeast Atlantic. It is a benthic species of sandy and detrital bottoms, at depths of 40–400 m (exceptionally down to 500 m) from coastal regions to the upper continental slope. Du Buit (1974) reported that it is more prevalent in rocky habitats.\n\nMost bottlenose skates are 60–150 cm long, with maximum recorded lengths of 230 cm for males and 202 cm for females. The flattened, angular pectoral fin fisc is about 1.4–1.5 times as broad as long. The snout is broad-based, abruptly tapering to a protruding sharp point and covered with small, sharp thorns. There are 40–45 rows of teeth in the upper jaw. The juveniles have 1 thorn before and 0–1 thorns behind the eyes and three rows of large thorns on the tail, 10–16 on the midline and 7–17 on either side. The adults have about 6 thorns around the inner margin of the orbit and 16–30 mid-dorsal and 17–29 lateral thorns on the tail. The skin is rough in adults except for a smooth patch in the center of the disc; the underside is prickly except for smooth patches on the snout. The young are entirely smooth, except for on the snout. Large juveniles and adults are greyish or bluish with or without numerous small white spots above, white below with brown to black disc margins. Hatchlings are plain reddish-brown above, often with blue spots, and white below with broad dusky disc margins.\n\nThe bottlenose skate is a benthic predator of bony fishes, other elasmobranchs, fish offal, crabs, shrimps, mysids, octopus, and cuttlefish. Younger, smaller fish are usually found in shallower water. Like other skates, this species is oviparous, with females producing 55-156 ova per year after a gestation period of 15 months. The egg cases are oblong in shape, with stiff pointed horns at each corners and the larger horns flattened. They are deposited in sandy or muddy flats in the spring. The capsules measure 12.5-18.3 cm long and 10.0-13.9 cm wide. This species is estimated to mature at 130 cm for males and 120 cm for females.\n\nIn the 17th century, the bottlenose skate was prized by the French for food. Because of its large size and slow reproductive rate, the bottlenose skate is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. Anecdotal data suggests that there has been a substantial decline in the abundance and geographical range of this species in the north Atlantic and Mediterranean. In the north Atlantic, populations of bottlenose skates have declined severely or disappeared from the Bay of Biscay and the Irish Sea; there are no longer targeted fisheries in these regions due to localized population collapses in the 1960s. There are also no recent records of this species in the waters off the United Kingdom, where it historically occurred. The bottlenose ray still persists along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula, though the population data is uncertain due to confusion with the shagreen ray (\"Leucoraja fullonica\") and the sandy ray (\"L. circularis\").\n\nIn the Mediterranean, bottlenose skates of most size classes down to egg cases are taken as by-catch in multi-species trawling fisheries. Historically, it was caught frequently off the coasts of Tunisia and Morocco in the 1970s and was described as more or less frequent in the northwestern Mediterranean from the 1950s to the 1970s. The MEDITS trawl surveys, begun in 1985 and carried out six times a year in four geographic regions, indicates that the bottlenose skate is now very rare in the Mediterranean and that it has been reduced to a small fraction of its former range. The Italian National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation (GRUND) survey captured this species infrequently in the Adriatic Sea. The species is assessed globally as Endangered in the IUCN Red List, and Critically Endangered in the northeast Atlantic. However, its status will require re-evaluation once data from its African range is available. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the bottlenose skate to its Seafood Red List, which includes commonly marketed species that \"have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries\".\n"}

Episodic in character, it seems to have been composed from linking together the apodoses of omen literature, excerpts of the Weidner Chronicle and year-names. It begins with events from the late third-millennium reign of Sargon of Akkad and ends, where the tablet is broken away, with that of Agum III, c.a 1500 BC.\n\nA third Babylonian Chronicle Fragment B, Mesopotamian Chronicle 41 deals with related subject matter and may be a variant tradition of the same type of work.\n\nTablet A begins with a lengthy passage concerning the rise and eventual downfall of Sargon of Akkad, caused by his impious treatment of Babylon:\n\nThis seemingly anachronous reference to Babylon reproduces text from the Weidner Chronicle. Little is known of the city of Babylon in the third-millennium with the earliest reference to it coming from a year-name of Šar-kali-šarri, Sargon’s grandson. In contrast, the Chronicle devotes a mere six lines to his nephew, Naram-Sin, and two campaigns against Apišal, a city located in northern Syria, and Magan, thought to be in ancient Oman. That of Apišal appears as an apodosis to an omen in the Bārûtu, the compendium of sacrificial omens.\n\nŠulgi receives short shrift from Marduk, who wreaks a terrible revenge for his expropriation of the property of Marduk’s temple, the Ésagil, and Babylon, as he “caused (something or other) to consume his body and killed him” in a passage that, despite its perfect state of preservation, remains unintelligible. Erra-Imittī’s legendary tale of his demise and that of Enlil-bāni’s ascendency occupies the next passage, followed by a terse observation that “Ilu-šūma was king of Assyria in time of Su-abu”, who was once identified with Sumu-abum, the founder of the First Dynasty of Babylon until a consideration of the relative chronologies made this identification unlikely. The tablet concludes with the label or mark which may have been a scribal catalog reference or alternatively denote continuing disruption, as represents \"ippiru\", “strife, conflict.”\n\nTablet B opens with a duplication of the six lines telling of the demise of Erra-Imittī, followed by a section relating Ḫammu-rāpi’s expedition against Rim-Sin I, whom he brought to Babylon in a ki-is-kap (a \"ḫúppu\"), a large basket. Samsu-iluna’s handling of the revolt of Rim-Sin II occupies the next section, but here the text is poorly preserved and the events uncertain until it records the victory of Ilum-ma-ilī, the founder of the Sealand Dynasty, over Samsu-iluna’s army. Abī-Ešuḫ’s damming of the Tigris follows, which fails to contain the wiley Ilum-ma-ilī. The history of the First Babylonian dynasty concludes with the Hittite invasion during the reign of Samsu-ditāna.\n\nThe final two passages switch to events in the early Kassite Dynastic period, first with the last king of the Sealand Dynasty, Ea-gamil, fleeing ahead of the invasion of Ulam-Buriaš and then the second invasion led by Agum III.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11797804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11797804", "title": "Comparison (grammar)", "text": "Comparison (grammar)\n\nComparison is a feature in the morphology or syntax of some languages, whereby adjectives and adverbs are inflected or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The comparative expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the superlative is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.\n\nThe grammatical category associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the \"positive\", which simply denotes a property (as with the English words \"big\" and \"fully\"); the \"comparative\", which indicates \"greater degree (as \"bigger\" and \"more fully\"); and the \"superlative\", which indicates \"greatest degree (as \"biggest\" and \"most fully\"). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. \"beautiful\", \"less beautiful\", \"least beautiful\".\n\nThe comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the \"-er\" suffix or modifying word \"more\" or \"less\" (e.g., \"faster\", \"more intelligent\", \"less wasteful\"); it can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., \"more men than women\"). One preposition, \"near\", also has a superlative form, as in \"Find the restaurant nearest your house\".\n\nComparatives and superlatives may be formed morphologically, by inflection, as with the English and German \"-er\" and \"-(e)st\" forms, or syntactically, as with the English \"more...\" and \"most...\" and the French \"plus...\" and \"le plus...\" forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as \"better\" and \"best\" (from \"good\") and \"less\" and \"least\" (from \"little/few\") in English, and \"meilleur\" (from \"bon\") and \"mieux\" (from the adverb \"bien\") in French.\n\nMost if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.\n\nComparatives are often used with a conjunction or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with \"than\" in English, \"als\" in German, etc. In Russian and Greek (Ancient, Koine and Modern) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the genitive case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in \"the best swimmer out of all the girls\".\n\nLanguages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include \"as... as\" and \"less/least...\".\n\nА few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is Bulgarian, where expressions like \"по̀ човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)\" (literally \"more person\", \"most person\", \"less person\" but normally \"better kind of a person\", \"best kind of person\", \"not that good kind of a person\") and \"по̀ обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)\" (\"I like more\", \"I like the least\") are quite usual.\n\nIn many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, \"May the better man win\" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form \"May the best man win\" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.\n\nIn some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common rhetorical device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes considered ungrammatical.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnglish has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs \"more\" and \"most\".\n\nAs a general rule, words with one syllable require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require \"more\" or \"most\", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, \"e.g.\" 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.\n\nMorphological comparison uses the suffixes \"-er\" (the \"comparative\") and \"-est\" (the \"superlative\"). These inflections are of Germanic origin and are cognate with the Latin suffixes -\"ior\" and -\"issimus\" and Ancient Greek -\"īōn\" and -\"istos\". They are typically added to shorter words, words of Anglo-Saxon origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these inflections have fewer than three syllables.\n\nThis system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like \"good\", \"better\", and \"best\", contain suppletive forms. These irregular forms include:\n\nThe second system of comparison in English appends the grammatical particles \"more\" and \"most\", themselves the irregular comparatives of \"many\" and \"much\", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the diminutives \"less\" and \"least\".\n\nThis system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than \"-ly\" (e.g., \"beautiful\"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:\n\nSome adjectives, the absolute or ungradable adjectives do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either \"present\" or \"absent\", such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything \"very Cretaceous\", or to characterize something as \"more igneous\" than something else.\n\nSome grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as \"full\", \"complete\", \"unique\", or \"empty\", which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute. However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a figurative than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.\n\nMany prescriptive grammars and style guides include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as \"more perfect\", \"most unique\", and \"most parallel\" as illogical pleonasms: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be \"very unique\", or \"more unique\" than something else.\n\nOther style guides argue that terms like \"perfect\" and \"parallel\" never apply \"exactly\" to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean \"nearly perfect\", \"nearly parallel\", and so on; in this sense, \"more perfect\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and \"more parallel\" (\"i.e.\", more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.\n\nIn most Balto-Slavic languages (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.\n\nIn Bulgarian, comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics \"по-\" (\"more\") and \"най-\" (\"most\"):\n\nIn Czech, Polish, Slovak and Slovene, comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).\n\nIn Russian, comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:\n\nIn contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. \"the most beautiful\") and absolute (e.g. \"very beautiful\").\n\nFrench: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (\"mon\", \"ton\", \"son\", etc.), before \"plus\" or \"moins\" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: \"Elle est la plus belle femme\" → (she is the most beautiful woman); \"Cette ville est la moins chère de France\" → (this town is the least expensive in France); \"C'est sa plus belle robe\" → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix \"-issime\" but only with certain words, for example: \"C'est un homme richissime\" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.\n\nPortuguese and Italian distinguish comparative superlative \"(superlativo relativo)\" and absolute superlative \"(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).\nFor the comparative superlative they use the words \"mais\" and \"più\" between the article and the adjective, like \"most\" in English.\nFor the absolute superlative they either use \"muito\"/\"molto\" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding \"issimo\" (singular masculine), \"issima\" (singular feminine), \"íssimos\"/\"issimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íssimas\"/\"issime\" (plural feminine). For example:\nThere are some irregular forms for some words ending in \"-re\" and \"-le\" (deriving from Latin words ending in \"-er\" and \"-ilis\") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending \"-re\" and they gain the endings \"errimo\" (singular masculine), \"errima\" (singular feminine), \"érrimos\"/\"errimi\" (plural masculine), or \"érrimas\"/\"errime\" (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the \"-l\"/\"-le\" ending and gain \"ílimo\"/\"illimo\" (singular masculine), \"ílima\"/\"illima\" (singular feminine), \"ílimos\"/\"illimi\" (plural masculine), or \"íli\nRomanian, similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word \"mai\" before the adjective, which operates like \"more\" or \"-er\" in English. For example: \"luminos\" → bright, \"mai luminos\" → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word \"puțin\" (little) is added between \"mai\" and the adjective, for example \"mai puțin luminos\" → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant \"cel\" precedes \"mai,\" conjugated as \"cel / cei\" for male singular / plural and \"cea / cele\" for female singular / plural. For example: \"cea mai luminoasă stea\" → the brightest star; \"cele mai frumoase fete\" → the most beautiful girls; \"cel mai mic morcov\" → the smallest carrot.\n\nScottish Gaelic: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an \"e\" to the end and \"i\" before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by \"nas\" to say \"more,\" and \"as\" to say \"most.\" (The word \"na\" is used to mean \"than\".) Adjectives that begin with \"f\" are lenited. and \"as\" use different syntax constructions. For example:\nTha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.\" → I am taller than my sisters.\nIs mi as àirde.\" → I am the tallest.\n\nAs in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.\n\nIn other tenses, \"nas\" is replaced by \"na bu\" and \"as\" by \"a bu,\" both of which lenite the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an \"f\" followed by a vowel, the word \"bu\" is reduced to \"b\"'. For example:\n\n\nWelsh is similar to English in many respects. The ending \"-af\" is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English \"-est\", and with (most) long words \"mwyaf\" precedes it, as in the English \"most\". Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular. Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative \"must\" be used, e.g. of two people - \"John ydy'r talaf\" (John is the tallest).\n\nIn Akkadian cuneiform, (on a 12 paragraph clay tablet), from the time period of the 1350 BC Amarna letters (a roughly 20-year body of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral \"10,\" as well as \"7 and 7.\" The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.\n\nThe term \"7 and 7\" means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds \"more\" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, \"Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):\" \"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times\" more, \"...\". The word 'more' is Akkadian \"mila\", and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is \"...over and over again, overflowing,\" (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).\n\nThe numeral 10 is used for \"ten times greater\" in EA 19, \"Love and Gold\", one of King Tushratta's eleven letters to the Pharaoh-(Amenhotep IV-\"Akhenaton\"). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):\n\nThe actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, \"to light up, to rise\"), uses: -e-le-né-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: \"...may it be, flourish-our (relations).\"\n\nIn Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with \"kõige\" followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of \"sinine\" 'blue' is \"sinisem\" and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is \"kõige sinisem\". There is also a synthetic (\"short\") superlative form, which is formed by adding \"-m\" to the end of the plural partitive case. For \"sinine\" the plural partitive form is \"siniseid\" and so \"siniseim\" is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the \"kõige\"-form, has a lot of exceptions.\n\n"}

Thus, the EDP differs from certifications such as the CDIA+ from CompTIA in which the awardee has passed a formal exam. Rather, the EDP is more closely related to the older MIT and LIT designations from AIIM. Generally, the EDP does show that the awardee has been in the industry for at least 5 years, and has participated in at least 3 major projects showing competence in a number of 'bodies of knowledge'.\n\nThe EDP program is regulated by the EDP Commission of Xplor International, which is a body of senior professionals in the electronic document industry who set the standards and judge the qualifications of the applicants.\n\nThe first EDP 'class' (as the annual group of awardees is called) was in 1990, when 12 industry professionals were given the award. In 1991, the class was much smaller (only 6), but in 1992 and in all the years following, the number of awardees has generally been double digits, with as many as 25 at one time. The Dutch Chapter of Xplor International has particularly stressed the EDP designation as an essential part of being a professional in the electronic document industry, with the result that in some years, more than ten Dutch members alone were named EDPs, and there are more EDPs per capita in The Netherlands today than in any other country.\n\nIn 2009, Xplor relaunched its certification program, so that there is now a three-level certification process to help employers benchmark their staff.\n\nThe EDP and the Master-EDP awards are presented once a year at the annual international conference of Xplor. While the first EDPs were awarded at the 1990 conference in Nashville, Tennessee (USA), the first 'class' of Master-EDPs was awarded at the association's annual event in St. Petersburg, Florida (USA) in March, 2010. At that event, the following industry professionals received the association's highest certification:\n\nAt the association's next annual event in April, 2011, two more industry professionals will be named M-EDPs:\n\nOn the other hand, the new EDA designation is awarded at the point that the individual's application is accepted and verified, throughout the year. Currently (December 2010), there are 48 industry professionals who have received this designation, nearly all of whom received the designation as a result of attending courses certified by Xplor and taught by \"acadami\", two of whose principals are M-EDPs.\n\nThe EDA designation recognizes electronic document sales, development and support specialists who have shown significantly more knowledge of the industry than someone in another discipline.\nIt requires candidates to be in the industry for 2+ years and have successfully completed 5 days of Xplor Continuing Education Unit (CEU) certified courses, or the equivalent.\n\nEDPs have clearly shown enough working knowledge of the process to make significant decisions regarding technology or process deployment. For example, management should trust them to lead projects, or support teams.\nTo become certified as an EDP, a candidate must be in the industry for 5+ years, have successfully completed 10 days of Xplor CEU training (or the equivalent), and have shown their working knowledge and experience through 3 work examples.\n\nM-EDPs are the recognized experts on specific technologies, processes, or management skills. For example, an M-EDP may have co-developed a composition or print stream transform system. Another might be the expert on print costing, or statement design. By earning their M-EDP, they are clearly recognized as one of the ‘go to’ people in the industry.\n\nTo earn the M-EDP, a candidate must have been in the industry for at least 10 years, have been an EDP for at least 5 years, and be able to prove their area of expertise through published material.\n\nIn all, there are more than 500 industry professionals with the EDP designation, including:\n\n"}

Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea's Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load.

The ship's company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50 calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the \"Attack\"s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town's hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.\n\n\"Advance\" was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland in March 1967, launched on 16 August 1967, and commissioned on 24 January 1968.

In 1901 she graduated with a degree in classics from the University of Chicago.\nAfter an interval as a teacher, she returned to the same university to study art history, and received a master's degree in 1918. In 1920 she began lecturing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she would spend the rest of her career, with the exception of short appointments at UCLA and the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 1919, she became the head of the photograph and lantern-slides department at the Ryerson Library of the Art Institute of Chicago. The next year she started to teach an art history course at the School of the Art Institute. In 1922, she made the choice to resign her position at the library to spare more time for teaching. From the frustration of not being able to find a comprehensive textbook that had a broad enough coverage in art history, she resolved the problem by writing such book herself, which resulted in a popular art history textbook used for decades, \"Art Through the Ages\".\n\nHer major work, \"Art Through the Ages\" (1926), was the first single-volume textbook to cover the entire range of art history from a global perspective. Frequently revised, it remains a standard textbook at American schools and universities. In 1932 she also published \"Understanding the Arts\", an art appreciation text directed toward educators.

{"id": "30683298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30683298", "title": "ISDA Master Agreement", "text": "ISDA Master Agreement\n\nThe ISDA Master Agreement is the most commonly used master service agreement for OTC derivatives transactions internationally. It is part of a framework of documents, designed to enable OTC derivatives to be documented fully and flexibly. The framework consists of a master agreement, a schedule, confirmations, definition booklets, and credit support documentation. The ISDA master agreement is published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.\n\nThe master agreement is a document agreed between two parties that sets out standard terms that apply to all the transactions entered into between those parties. Each time that a transaction is entered into, the terms of the master agreement do not need to be re-negotiated and apply automatically.\n\nAlthough it is often viewed as a tool for banks and financial institutions, the Master Agreement is widely used by a wide variety of counterparties.\n\nThe master agreement is quite lengthy, and the negotiation process can be burdensome, but once a master agreement is signed, the documentation of future transactions between parties is reduced to a brief confirmation of the material terms of the transaction.\n\nThe master agreement also aids in reducing disputes by providing extensive resources defining its terms and explaining the intent of the contract, thereby preventing disputes from beginning as well as providing a neutral resource to interpret standard contractual terms. Finally, the master agreement greatly aids in risk and credit management for the parties.\n\nThe ISDA Master Agreement is a development of the Swaps Code, introduced by ISDA in 1985 and updated in 1986. In its earliest form, it consisted of standard definitions, representations and warranties, events of default, and remedies.\n\nIn 1987, ISDA produced three documents: (i) a standard form master agreement for U.S. dollar interest-rate swaps; (ii) a standard form master agreement for multi-currency interest-rate and currency swaps (collectively known as the \"1987 ISDA Master Agreement\"); and (iii) the interest rate and currency definitions.\n\nThe 1990s resulted in major document production by ISDA, including (i) a revised version of the Swaps Code, known as the 1991 ISDA Definitions, drafted and replaced later by the 2000 ISDA Definitions; (ii) a revision to the 1987 Master Agreement resulting in the 1992 Master Agreement; (iii) the User's Guide to the 1992 Master Agreement, drafted in 1993, explaining in detail each section of the 1992 Master Agreement; (iv) the Commodities Derivatives Definitions, drafted in 1993 and supplemented in 2000; and (v) the Annex, providing for collateral documentation, finalised in 1994, followed by its User's Guide in 1995.\n\nThe Master Agreement was updated again in 2002 (known as the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement). The move to update the 1992 Agreement had its origins in the succession of crises that affected the global financial markets in the late 1990s. These events, including the liquidation of Hong Kong broker-dealer Peregrine Investments Holdings and the 1998 Russian financial crisis, tested the ISDA documentation to a previously unseen degree. Although the ISDA documentation withstood that test, ISDA decided to establish a strategic review of its documentation to see what lessons could be learned from these events. This review led, in time, to the full-scale update of 1992 Agreement, which culminated in the 2002 Agreement.\n\nThe master agreement is the central document around which the rest of the ISDA documentation structure is built. The preprinted master agreement is never altered except to insert the names of the parties, but is customised through use of the schedule to the master agreement, a document containing elections, additions and amendments to the master agreement.\n\nTogether with the schedule, the master agreement sets forth all of the general terms and conditions necessary to properly allocate the risks of the transactions between the parties but does not contain any commercial terms specific to a particular transaction. Once the master agreement is executed, the parties can enter into numerous transactions by agreeing to the material commercial terms over the telephone as evidenced by a written confirmation without any need to revisit the underlying terms contained in the master agreement.\n\nThere are two versions of the Master Agreement, the local version for transactions between parties located in the same jurisdiction who are transacting in only one currency, and the multicurrency version for use when parties are located in different jurisdictions transacting in different currencies. The provisions included in the multicurrency version but not in the local currency version concern issues such as taxes, currency of payment, the use of multiple offices to enter into transactions, and the designation of an agent for service of process.\n\nSection 1(c) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement states that:\n\n\"All transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties ... and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.\"\n\nThis single agreement concept is integral to the structure and forms part of the netting based protection offered by the master agreement. The fact that all transactions are the one contract reinforces the ability to close out those transactions and come up with a single net amount payable if a default occurs.\n\nSection 5 of the ISDA Master Agreement contains the \"Events of Default\" and the \"Termination Events\". These are events which can lead to termination of transactions before their intended maturity.\nThe Events of Default can be described in summary as events for which a party is at fault, such as a failure to perform under a transaction, breach of a representation or undertaking, and insolvency.\n\nThe Termination Events are other events which, although no-one is at fault, warrant the early termination of the transactions, such as a change in tax law resulting in taxes being imposed on transactions, illegality, and a merger of a party resulting in a deterioration in its credit quality. Parties may also elect to specify Additional Termination Events in the Schedule, such as a decline in a corporate party's credit rating or a decline in a hedge fund's Net asset value.\n\nSection 6 of the ISDA Master Agreement contains the provisions which enable a party to terminate transactions early if an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs in respect of the other party and set out the procedure to calculate and net the termination values of those transactions to produce a single amount payable between the parties.\n\nThere are two elections that the parties make in the Schedule which affect the operation of these provisions:\n\nThe above only applies in relation to the 1992 Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement did away with First and Second method. In practice First Method was very rarely opted for because its use required the relevant financial institutions to report their gross, rather than net, exposure under the Master Agreement. The 2002 Master Agreement also replaced the distinction between Market Quotation and Loss with a single concept, \"Close-out Amount\". This is determined in respect of each Terminated Transaction and is, broadly, the profit or loss which would be made in incurred on entering into an equivalent Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. The aggregate of the Close-out Amounts and Unpaid Amounts is referred to as the \"Early Termination Amount\". This is the net amount payable by one party to the other in respect of the Terminated Transactions.\n\nSection 2(d) of the ISDA Master Agreement contains provisions setting out the consequences if a tax is imposed on a payment required to be made by a party under a transaction. Included is a gross-up obligation for certain \"Indemnifiable Taxes\". This interlocks with other provisions in the ISDA Master Agreement, such as the taxation representations contained in ss 3(e) and 3(f), undertakings in ss 4(a) and 4(d), and termination events in ss 5(b)(ii) and 5(b)(iii). These provisions are extremely complex and great care is usually taken by negotiators to ensure that the result is not the opposite of what was intended.\n\nThe range of taxation matters which can be relevant to particular derivative transactions include interest withholding tax, quasi-withholding tax, goods and services tax and stamp duty.\n\nSection 10 of the ISDA Master Agreement addresses issues that arise in connection with counterparties that enter into transactions through more than one office or branch and more than one jurisdiction.\n\nThe Schedule and Paragraph 13 are used to make all amendments to and customisations of the Master Agreement and Annex, including the elections of the various options presented to the parties in the Master Agreement and Annex and the addition of provisions not contained in the Master Agreement. It contains:\n\nThe printed form of the Master Agreement is never amended on the face of the document. In negotiations it is not even exchanged, on the presumption that the standard terms will always be used.\n\nThere are various standard forms of credit support documentation prepared by ISDA. The key distinctions between each include their governing law (English, New York and Japanese) and method of transfer of collateral (title transfer and security interest).\n\nThe main credit support documents governed by English law are the 1995 Credit Support Annex, the 1995 Credit Support Deed and the 2016 Credit Support Annex for Variation Margin. The English law Credit Support Annexes provide for title transfer collateral, whereas the English law Credit Support Deed provides for a security interest to be granted over transferred collateral. The 2016 Credit Support Annex for Variation Margin has been specifically introduced to allow parties to comply with their obligations to exchange Variation Margin in accordance with margin regimes around the world, including EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank in the United States of America. The English law Credit Support Annexes are Confirmations, and the transactions constituted by them are Transactions, under the Master Agreement and therefore form part of the single agreement together with the Master Agreement. The English law Credit Support Deed, on the other hand, is a separate agreement between the parties.\n\nThe use of one or more credit support documents is optional but is common in Master Agreements for OTC derivative transactions. Credit support documentation is added where parties wish to provide for the exchange of collateral if the exposure (under the derivative transactions covered by the credit support document) of one party to the other exceeds an agreed amount. The credit support documentation contains provisions concerning the posting and return of collateral, the types of collateral that may be used, and the treatment of collateral by the recipient.\n\nDerivatives transactions are usually entered into orally or electronically and the contract between the parties is formed at this time. The evidence of the terms of the transaction is contained in a confirmation (also known as a trading advice or contract note), usually a short letter, fax or email. The form of the confirmation is set out in the Master Agreement and a limited period of time is usually allowed for objections or amendments to the confirmation after its receipt. Confirmations are usually very short (except for complex transactions) and contain little more than dates, amounts, and rates. Confirmations are exchanged to minimise the possibility of a dispute as to the terms of a transaction occurring.\n\nISDA has produced a wide array of supporting materials for the Master Agreement, including definitions and user's guides. This documentation is designed to prevent disputes and to facilitate the consistent use and interpretation of the Master Agreement. These materials are produced by ISDA and are regularly updated to reflect the most recent regulatory or market changes.\n\nEach type of derivative transaction, such as credit derivative, currency derivatives, and equity derivatives have their own definitional booklet.\n\nThe Master Agreement allows parties to calculate their financial exposure under OTC transactions on a net basis, i.e. a party calculates the difference between what it owes to a counterparty under a Master Agreement and what the counterparty owes it under the same agreement.\n\nThese calculations are made on a mark-to-market basis to reflect the current position of each transaction.\n\nThe Master Agreement permits the netting of payments due under the same transaction so that only a single amount is exchanged between the parties, rather than numerous payments involving the same transactions. Most counterparties also agree to net all amounts due on a single day regardless of whether amounts are due under a single or multiple transactions.\n\nSet-off is used as a final settlement of accounts that extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new, net amount due. The parties are incentivized to pay in a timely manner by the imposition of interest on any amounts paid after the due date.\n\nIn support of this practice, the United States Bankruptcy Code exempts participants in OTC derivative transactions from the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and permits them to set-off obligations owed between the creditor and the bankrupt party even during the pendency of a bankruptcy stay order.\n\nThe principles for resolving the issue as to whether an individual has the authority to bind the company are not special to derivatives, they are derived from traditional agency law. In essence it is necessary to examine the relevant circumstances to determine whether the individual had the actual or apparent authority to bind the company to the transaction. It is common for parties to exchange authorised signatory lists of persons who have authority to execute confirmations and refer to this in the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. However, this does not mean that this is determinative of the authority issue, and a person not on one of these lists may have the authority to sign a confirmation. As a matter of market practice, this issue is dealt with on the understanding that institutions are responsible for their own internal authorisation matters and that any person who is held out as being able to enter into OTC derivative transactions has the apparent authority to do so.\n\nOne area in which a party to an OTC transaction can be attacked by its counterparty, if the transactions \"goes south\", is if the counterparty was relying on the party in relation to the transaction and the party owes either some kind of fiduciary relationship to the counterparty or has engaged in misleading conduct in inducing the counterparty to enter into the trade. In this regard the principles of equity, contract, and trade practices law apply to OTC derivatives in the same way as they apply to other contracts.\n\nParties try to limit this responsibility by including \"non-reliance\" representations in their agreements, to the effect that each is not relying on the other and they are making their own independent decisions. Whilst these representations are useful, they would not prevent an action under trade practices legislation nor other actions if the conduct of a party was inconsistent with this representation.\n\nWhile set-off provisions provides a creditor some relief from a counterparty's bankruptcy by permitting the set-off of obligations due and owing, it does not provide relief from the exposure to future positions that have not yet become due and owing. In recognition of this problem, the Master Agreement contains provisions permitting a creditor party to terminate and liquidate transactions upon a counterparty's bankruptcy or other default under the Master Agreement (acceleration).\n\nThe Master Agreement provides the parties two means by which the Master Agreement and all transactions thereunder may be terminated upon the occurrence of specified events. The first is the occurrence of an event of default, which permits a party to terminate the Master Agreement and liquidate all transactions if the other party is affected by an Event of Default. In contrast, Termination Events may affect both parties, are usually the result of the actions of third parties, and may provide the affected party a grace period to cure the Termination Event before the other party may terminate and liquidate the Master Agreement.\n\nIn the movie \"The Big Short\", which is based on Michael Lewis' book by the same name, ISDA Master Agreement is referred as the Hunting License, reserved only for the big boys. Originally devised with the banks and other institutional players in mind, the doors were opened to ultra-high networth individuals. The maximum licenses at any point peaked at 3000. \n\n\n"}

For example, two separate people who witness a traffic accident, first hand, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person witnessed the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be \"independent\", since one would \"depend\" on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are consulted and agree on a consistent story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).\n\nConsulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.\n\nThe American judge Learned Hand declared that \"Right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and will always be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.\"\n\nThe \"New York Times's\" minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.\n\nCircular reporting is a situation where multiple sources \"appear\" to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source. Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.\n\n"}

Sources of the material were the Ukrainian State Archives, Moldova National Archives, Ministry of Justice (ZAGS) in Ukraine and Moldova, Polish State Archives (AGAD in Warsaw), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (Warsaw-Srodmiescie), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. There are over 1,200 images in the book, of which there are 970 color photos of 190 towns, 121 black and white photos, 115 document examples, and 20 color maps.\n\nThe archives of Ukraine and Moldova were not accessible to the public for genealogical research purposes until the two countries gained independence in 1991. Once available, the ability to access even one birth record could take more than a week. Weiner made repeated visits to Ukraine and was aided by the former mayor of Otaci, Moldova, who served as a driver and translator. The book and the Routes to Roots Archive Database are the only known town-by-town inventories of archival documents (published in English) in that these lists were officially sanctioned by the directors of the both the State Archives and Ministry of Justice (includes local town hall archives) in Ukraine and\nMoldova.\n\n\"Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova\" took over seven years to complete. Weiner worked with two directors of the State Archives of Ukraine, Borys Ivanenko and Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, and collaborated with archivists throughout Ukraine to compile the information for the book. The Director of the Moldovan National Archives, Antonina A. Berzoy, contributed an article on the archives there, as did other regional scholars and experts.\n\n\"Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova\" was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Ukraine and Moldova that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. In the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, \"DOROT,\" their detailed review focused on the extensive scope of the materials presented in the book: over 1,200 images of almost 200 towns, and the inclusion of over 5,000 documents of almost 1,400 towns.\n\n\"Jewish Standard\" noted the fact that \"Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova\" presents a wide range of information that is both useful and interesting.\n\n\"The New York Times\" praised the book for being lavishly illustrated, voluminous encyclopedic guides that provide glimpses of life in Poland before World War II.\n\nAt the New York City book launch that was held at the Consulate of Ukraine in September 1999, Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, director of the Main Archival Administration of Ukraine, stressed the importance of the book not just from a genealogical perspective, but from a historical perspective.\n\n\nNote: \"Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova\" is out of print.

It is the first statue from classical antiquity known to use contrapposto; Kenneth Clark called it \"the first beautiful nude in art\" It is possible, even likely, that earlier Bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and Susan Woodford has speculated that the statue is a copy of a Bronze original. The Kritios Boy is thus named because it is attributed, on slender evidence, to Kritios who worked together with Nesiotes (sculptors of \"Harmodius and Aristogeiton\") or their school, from around 480 BC. As currently mounted, the statue is considerably smaller than life-size at c. 86 cm (3 ft 10 ins), including the supports that replace the missing feet.\n\nThe statue was excavated in 1866 on the Acropolis of Athens, among the \"Perserschutt\", the ceremonial dump in which the Athenians buried the debris of sacred artefacts destroyed by the in 480 BC. It is on display in the Acropolis Museum, Athens, near the site where it was excavated. The torso was found in 1865 while excavating the foundation of the old museum at the Athenian Acropolis. The head of this statue was found twenty-three years later between the museum and the Acropolis south wall, in the latest stage of the rubble of destruction undergone in the Persian Wars. This fact, in conjunction with the analysis of its style, is essential to the dating of the statue.\n\nWhether or not Kritios was the innovator, with the Kritios Boy (\"ephebos\") the Greek artist has mastered a complete understanding of how the different parts of the body act as a system. The statue moves away from the rigid and stiff pose of the Archaic style. Kritios Boy presents a more relaxed and naturalistic pose known as contrapposto. This stance forces a chain of anatomical events: as the pelvis is pushed diagonally upwards on the left side, the right buttock relaxes, the spine acquires an \"S\" curve, and the shoulder line dips on the left to counteract the action of the pelvis. Among classic Greek sculptures, the Kritios Boy expresses the \"Canon of Polyclitus\" and his pupils.\nIt set the rule for later sculptors like Praxiteles and Lysippos, whose contrapposto, or ponderation, is more emphasised than the \"subtle equilibrium of outline and axis which is to be the basis of classical art\" exhibited by the Kritios Boy's \"delicate balance of movement\"\n\nThe Kritios Boy exhibits a number of other critical innovations that distinguish it from the Archaic \"Kouroi\" from the seventh and sixth century BC that paved its way. The Archaic style relied more on geometrical shapes to define the contours of the human body. The muscular and skeletal structure of Kritios Boy are depicted with unforced lifelike accuracy of flesh and bone, with the rib cage naturally expanded as if in the act of breathing, with a relaxed attitude and hips which are distinctly narrower. Sculptors had begun to break away from the rules of the Archaic style and follow representation that was closer to nature. As a final forebear of the classical period, the \"smile\" of Archaic statues has been completely replaced by the accurate rendering of the lips and the austere expression that characterized the transitional Severe style. It was created in same era as the Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis and the group of the \"Tyrannicides\" Harmodius and Aristogeiton. A good example for comparison is the marble statue of an \"ephebos\" in the museum in Agrigento.\n\n"}

{"id": "17091424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17091424", "title": "Love magic", "text": "Love magic\n\nLove magic is celebrating one's love for the self, and being the love that is wanted form another. Romantic love requests an equal partner to enjoy sex. It can be implemented in a variety of ways, such as written spells, dolls, charms, amulets, potions, or different rituals.\n\nLove magic has been a branch of magical practice, and a topos in literature and art, for many centuries. It is attested on cuneiform tablets from the ancient Near East, in ancient Egyptian texts, in the Greco-Roman world, the Middle Ages, and up to the present day. It is used in the story of Heracles and Deianeira, also in Richard Wagner's opera \"Tristan and Isolde\", Donizetti's \"The Elixir of Love\" (\"L'Elisir d'amore\"), and Manuel de Falla's ballet \"El amor brujo\" (The magic of love).\n\nThe earliest attestations of love magic derive from the ancient Near East, dating to ca. 2200 BCE. Cuneiform tablets preserving rituals of erotic magic have been uncovered at Tell Inghara and Isin (present day Iraq). Similar rituals are attested in ancient Egypt, for instance on an ostracon dated to the twentieth dynasty (twelfth-eleventh centuries BCE).\n\nSpells of erotic attraction and compulsion are found within the syncretic magic tradition of Hellenistic Greece, which incorporated Egyptian and Hebraic elements, as documented in texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri and archaeologically on amulets and other artefacts dating from the 2nd century BC (and sometimes earlier) to the late 3rd century A.D. These magical practices continued to influence private ritual in Gaul among Celtic peoples, in Roman Britain, and among Germanic peoples. Erotic magic reflected gender roles in ancient Greece and dismissed modern misconceptions about gender roles and sexuality. Christopher Faraone, a University of Chicago classics professor specializing in texts and practices pertaining to magic, distinguishes between the magic of \"eros\", as practiced by men, and the magic of \"philia\", practiced by women.\n\nThe two types of spells can be connected directly to the gender roles of men and women in Ancient Greece. Women used philia spells because they were dependent on their husbands. Women were powerless and used any means necessary to keep their husbands around, since men were free to leave their wives whenever they wanted. Many women resorted to philia spells to maintain their beauty and keep a peace of mind.\n\nPhilia magic was used by women to keep their male companion at bay and faithful. Basic beliefs about sexual attitudes in Greece were dismissed by the findings in the philia love spells, potions, and rituals. The spells were not used by women to achieve sexual pleasure, but rather as a form of therapy or medicine. Women commonly used the philia spells in attempt to preserve their beauty and youth, which in effect would keep their beau faithful. Parallels can be drawn between philia spells and common medical practice by women. Getting a face lift serves the same purpose as the philia spell. A facelift will make a woman feel desirable and inject her with youth, at least in her mind. Many women in ancient Greece used the spells as a form of therapy. Regardless if the spells actually worked or not, they made the women feel more comfortable with their situation and feel as if they have some control over what is going on. In that sense, magic functions the same way religions do. Spells and prayer share many of the same characteristics; both are used to bring peace of mind and they both invoke something spiritual to control something that is ultimately out of their hands.\n\nEros spells were mainly practiced by men and prostitutes served a completely different function in Ancient Greece. Eros spells were used to instill lust and passion into women, leading them to fulfill the man who invoked the spells sexual desires. Without freedom, women could only hope to make their situation better, which is why they aimed at affection producing spells. Men, on the other hand, had the freedom to do what they want. Prostitutes lived lives that were far more similar to men than women. They were financially free, could live where they chose, and were not expected to serve just one man and home. These were the only noted women to use eros magic to fulfill their sexual needs.\n\nDuring the later medieval period (14th to 17th century), marriage developed into a central institution for public life. This is reflected in their love magic:while the immediate desire was the act of intercourse itself, it was most often practiced in an attempt for a permanent union such as marriage. Magic was expensive and could cause severe damage to the caster; therefore it was not taken lightly. Thus, spells were not just cast upon just anyone in the Renaissance, but on those unions that held special importance. Men and women of status and favor were more often the targets of love magic. Economic or social class restrictions would often inhibit a marriage, and love magic was seen as a way to break those barriers, leading to social advancement.\n\nWhile the spells were supposed to be kept secret, very rarely were they successful in this. However, if the victim realized that a spell was being cast upon them, believing in magic themselves, they would behave differently adding effectiveness to love magic. This communication of one's desire is essential within the concept of love magic as it enabled a timid person to approach the unapproachable.\n\nWith the dominance of Christianity and Catholicism in Europe during the Renaissance, elements of Christianity seeped its way into the magic rituals themselves. Often, clay dolls or written spell scrolls would be hidden in the altar at churches, or holy candles would be lit in the rituals. The Host from a Catholic Mass would sometimes be taken and used in rituals to gain the desired result. Thus, love magic within the Renaissance period was both Christian and pagan.\n\nIn literature and art, the motif of a genuine love spell is interwoven more often, and made the starting point of tragic setbacks and complications. One of the earliest manifestations of the theme in the Western world is the story of Heracles and Deianeira. A famous treatment of the subject is in Richard Wagner's opera \"Tristan and Isolde\", which in turn goes back to the same epic by Gottfried von Strassburg. Other examples of the use of love magic motif are Donizetti's \"The Elixir of Love\" (\"L'Elisir d'amore\") and Manuel de Falla's ballet \"El amor brujo\" (The magic of love).\n\nLove magic was seen as drawing “…heavily upon what was perceived as quintessentially feminine: fertility, birth, menstruation (seen as closely related to both fertility and birth), and a woman’s ‘nature’ or ‘shameful parts,’ that is, genitals”. This feminine attribute is reflected within the literature such as the Malleus Maleficarum, and in the trials of the Holy Office in which most of the cases brought before the council were women accused of bewitching men. This illustrates the common stereotype that men did not do magic. According to historians Guido Ruggiero and Christopher A. Faraone, love magic often was associated with prostitutes and courtesans. Women in these professions often held psychological power over their partners, sometimes leading to dramatic measures such as witchcraft accusations.\n\nThe view of women within the Renaissance can best be illustrated by the Malleus Maleficarum. In the opening section of this text it discusses the sexuality of women in relation to the devil. Heinrich Kramer wrote within his book that, \"All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which in women is insatiable.\" The Men of the Renaissance feared the sexual power of the opposing gender. They associated it with the devil, making witches out to be sexual partners with demons. Kramer makes the case that a witch received her powers by inviting the devil to enter into carnal relations. Through her sexuality she gains her power, and thus her sexuality is seen as evil and something to be feared. In many of the witchcraft accusations brought before the Holy Office in the Roman Inquisition, men accused women of binding their passions and sexuality by the use of their own sexuality.\n\nWhile within literature, females dominate the witch world, some scholars believe that reality was much different. Matthew W. Dickie, a prominent magic scholar, argues that men were the main casters of love magic. Demographically, they suggest that the largest age group that practiced love magic were younger men targeting young, unobtainable women. There are a variety of explanations for why the literary world contrasted reality in this area, but a common interpretation is that men were trying to subtract themselves from association. Magic was no place for a man, and thus in literature they portrayed themselves as such.\n\n"}

Much of modern-day scholarship related to the classical or pre-modern Korean martial arts, in particular those that predate the Mongol invasions of Korea (during which Korean palaces and libraries that would have contained many documents germane to the study of martial arts and combat self-defense were destroyed), relies on the study of the \"Samguk Sagi\" compiled by the scholar Kim Bu-sik and the \"Samguk Yusa\" compiled by the Buddhist monk Iryeon. Both works suggest that militant attitudes between and among the three major nations of the Korean Three Kingdoms Period (37 BCE - 660 AD) resulted in each nation developing an institution for training its warriors in martial arts and military sciences.\n\nThe end of vassaldom to the Mongol Yuan Dynasty in the mid-1300s did not bring peace to the Korean Peninsula. The withdrawal/retreat of Mongol hegemony roughly coincided with the collapse of the Kamakura Shogunate in Japan; the resultant instability and the relative lack of control exerted by the subsequent Ashikaga Shogunate led to an increase of incursions by coastal raiding forces, mostly from the Japanese islands. These pirate attacks, as well as raids from the uncontrolled regions in southern Manchuria, provided the Korean state (first as Goryeo and later as Joseon) with some rationale for rebuilding Korean military installations and units. However, as a whole, the ascendance of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea in 1392 and the installation of Neo-Confucianism as its guiding philosophy meant that academics, civil pursuits, and cultural arts were overwhelmingly emphasized at the expense of martial arts and military pursuits. As a result, many national and local defense structures, as well as the training and practice of armed combat, was limited and just sufficient to repel small-scale raids and tribal attacks.\n\nThe Japanese campaigns in Korea during 1592-8 found a militarily complacent Korea that was woefully unprepared to ward off a major, organized, large-scale military invasion such as the one ordered by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. While elements of the Korean court had attempted to update and otherwise revitalize lackluster Korean military resources, they were frequently opposed by rival factions and therefore unable to make substantive improvements in Korean national defenses on a wide scale until the Japanese invasion demonstrated the need for such an emphasis. In September 1593, after the initial Japanese invasion was stalled and pushed back thanks to Ming Chinese intervention, King Seonjo established a \"Royal Military Training Agency.\" Following the cessation of hostilities and the full retreat of Japanese forces in 1598, the Korean government sought to record all material that they had found useful. As a result, the \"Muye jebo\" - 무예제보 (literally “Martial Arts Illustrations”) was published in 1610. The work was compiled by a royal military officer, Han Kyo, and consisted of 6 weapon-based fighting systems. These included the \"gon bang\" (long stick), \"deung pae\" (shield), \"nang seon\" (multi-tipped spear), \"jang chang\" (long spear), \"dang pa\" (triple-tip spear), and the \"ssang su do\" (two-handed saber). Content related to unarmed combat was not included in this manual.\n\nDuring the reign of King Yeongjo (r. 1724-1776) the \"Muye jebo\" was revised and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by Crown Prince Sado who originated the term \"ship pal gi\" - 십팔기, 十八技 (“Eighteen Fighting Methods”). Though often confused with Chinese practices of the same name and later 20th century practices, the term coined by Prince Sado, a shortened form of \"bonjo muye ship pal ban\" - 본조무예십팔반, 文章武藝十八般 (\"18 Martial Arts Classes of the Yi Dynasty\"), identified this collection of 18 fighting systems. This manual contained the original 6 systems of the \"muye jebo\" but also included sections for \"juk chang\" (long bamboo spear), \"gi chang\" (flag spear), \"yeh do\" (short sword), \"wae geum\" (Japanese sword - presumably this was in reference to the katana), \"gyo jeon bo\" (illustrations of combat), \"jedok geum\" (admiral's sword), \"bon guk geum beop\" (literally \"native sword methods\"), \"ssang geum\" (literally \"twin swords,\" this referred to dual-wielding of swords in combat), \"wol do\" (literally \"moon sword,\" this referred to the Korean equivalent of the naginata, whose blade was crescent-shaped), \"hyeop do\" (spear sword - the better-known Japanese counterpart would be the yari), \"pyeon gon\" (flail), and \"gwon beop\" (unarmed combat).\n\nThe \"Muyesinbo\" was revised during the reign of King Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800). The 6 fighting skills that were added were essentially the dismounted methods for such weapons as the spear, sword and flail, which had been described in previous versions for execution from horseback. \"gwon beop\" material was also further modified with the addition of material performed between partners. The material was intended to reflect a combat format in deference to Neo-Confucian thought, by having partners use matched methods which would only produce a \"stalemate\" rather than a victory of one partner over another. Though ideologically satisfactory, the practice rapidly fell into disuse for its lack of practical combat effectiveness. This revised publication is the \"Muyedobotongji\" (“Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts”) and was published in 1795.\n\nWith the advent of firearms as the predominant method of armed conflict, the methods and techniques in the \"Muyedobotongji\" largely became relegated to reference material. Many copies were lost or destroyed, along with much knowledge and practice of Korean military science and martial arts, in the latter years of the Joseon Dynasty, much of this occurring during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nVolumes 1 through 3 focus primarily on polearms and swordsmanship. The fourth volume covers unarmed combat (gwonbeop \"boxing\"), blunt weapons (staff and flail) and equestrian skills.\n\nOriginal to the 1795 Muyedobotongji are six methods of mounted combat: Gichang (spear fighting on horseback), Masang Ssanggeom (twin swords on horseback), Masang Woldo (crescent sword on horseback), Masang Pyeongon (flail method on horseback), Gyeokgu (ball game on horseback), Masang Jae (horsemanship specialties, such as riding stunts commonly seen in circus acts).\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier sources can be traced to Chinese General Qi Jiguang's treatise on troops training, the Ji Xiao Xin Shu (Hangul: 기효신서, Hanja: 紀效新書, \"New Books of Effective Methods\"). Ji Xiao Xin Shu was written in 1561. The authors considered that although this type of training had little value for large-scale battle, it was nevertheless useful to train bodily flexibility, reflexes, hands speed, quick yet solid footwork and jumping capacity, all of which were very valuable for a warrior.\n\nAs a manual, the Muyedobotongji made several improvements over its Chinese sources since many practical comments on training and the value of the described techniques were added, and shows the influence of the neighboring Chinese martial traditions on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe book divides the techniques into stabbing, cutting and striking techniques, while earlier books divided them into long and short weapon skills. The old classification method had to be abandoned with the development of firearms. The long spear had lost its function as a long-range weapon by the time the book was written. Quite clearly, first bow and arrow, and later the advent of firearms, rendered the long spear obsolete in this role.\n\n\n\n"}

Also included in the collection are early sexology works, homophobic classics, and queer pulps from the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nSpecial collections include the Hudler Archives and the Burroughs Collection. The Hudler Archives is named after Richard Hudler, a local activist who served as president of the Homophile Association of London Ontario (HALO) from 1981 to 1995. The archives include the HALO community records, Hudler's personal papers, literary manuscripts, newspaper clippings, legal files, photographs documenting queer social history in London, and the catalogues of the Visual AIDS poster exhibition from 1988 through 1995. Exhibits of archival materials (Body Politic covers, HALO files, and Visual AIDS posters) can be viewed online at the library website. The William S. Burroughs Collection—Burroughs, celebrated for being both subversive and surreal, is the author of \"Naked Lunch\" (1959) and \"Queer\" (1985)—includes fictional works as well as autobiographies, essays, and interviews.\n\nThe Pride Library was founded by Professor James Miller in his office in the Tower of University College in 1997. In the summer of 2005 it was relocated on the main floor of the Weldon Library at the heart of the campus and officially reopened on February 14, 2006. Every aspect of the library was carefully designed and chosen to reflect its unique mandate and to welcome visitors into a distinctively queer space.\n\n\nMuch of the Library's success is due to generous support from volunteers and donors. Volunteers offer reference services to visitors and assist in maintaining and organizing the collection. Businesses, organizations, and individuals have all helped the collection grow through donations. Notable donors include:\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario has been supportive in a variety of ways. A donation of $50,000 from the university administration in the spring of 2006 covered the renovation of the new space and the conversion of the catalogued books into a circulating collection. The University has also donated the space where the library is located, and included Pride materials in its online public access catalogue. In this way, resources are made accessible to students and non-students alike.\n\nThe front of the D.B. Weldon Library's Pride Library at the University of Western Ontario is decorated with a beautiful stained-glass window. The window, designed and constructed by London, Ontario artist Lynette Richards, consists of the Pride Library logo amid a list of some of history's most influential homo-, bi-, and trans-sexual authors. The Pride Library logo contains a series of shelved books, coloured with the spectrum of the rainbow, supported by the logo of the now disbanded HALO (Homophile Association of London Ontario), which has made significant contributions to the Pride Library.\n\nThe Pride Library stained-glass window celebrates and commemorates 135 influential gay and lesbian authors.\nListed in chronological order, the names include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2411607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2411607", "title": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game", "text": "Pro Football Hall of Fame Game\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame Game is an annual National Football League (NFL) exhibition game that is held the weekend of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies. The game is played at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, which is located adjacent to the Hall of Fame building in Canton, Ohio. It is traditionally the first game played in the NFL preseason for any given year, marking the end of the NFL's six-month off-season.\n\nThe two teams that play in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game are typically selected by the league in advance of the remainder of the preseason schedule. The participants are usually announced around the time that the new Hall of Fame members are announced, which coincides with Super Bowl week. Often, if a particularly notable player will be entering the Hall of Fame that year, a team they were strongly associated with may be selected to play in the game to help maximize attendance and publicity of the game itself. From 1971 to 2010, the opponents for each game usually included one AFC team and one NFC team. In 2009, as recognition of the 50th anniversary of the American Football League, the game paired two AFC teams who were part of the \"original eight\" franchises of the AFL, the Tennessee Titans (dressed as their previous incarnation, the Houston Oilers) and the Buffalo Bills, whose owner, Ralph Wilson, was inducted into the Hall that year. An all-NFC matchup was scheduled for 2011, but it was canceled due to the 2011 NFL lockout; the following year, another intra-conference matchup of two NFC teams took its place. From 2011 onward, each team selected to play in the game has had at least one prominent alumnus being inducted into the Hall that year.\n\nBecause this game and the Hall of Fame's induction ceremonies are scheduled on the weekend before the league's regular four-week exhibition season begins, both teams end up playing five exhibition games instead of the normal four, and unlike the Canadian Football League (which plays its two-game exhibition season over three weeks), the league does not remove antone. \nThe last four expansion teams to have been added to the league each played in the Hall of Fame Game as their first game. In 1995, expansion clubs Jacksonville and Carolina played each another, and in 2002, Houston was one of the participants. When the Cleveland Browns returned to the league with a rebooted roster in 1999, they too played in the Hall of Fame Game. The Baltimore Ravens, while officially considered as being established in 1996, did not play in the Hall of Fame Game until 2018. With the Ravens' participation in the 2018 game, all 32 current NFL teams have now played in the Hall of Fame game at least once.\n\nPrior to the AFL–NFL merger, the Hall of Fame Game was played in August or September, in some cases at the end of the preseason. In 1970, it was moved to the beginning of the preseason. Prior to 2002, it was not uncommon for the game to be played in July. Since 2002, when the league permanently moved the start of the season to the weekend after Labor Day, the game has always been played in early August.\n\nThe 2011 game was originally scheduled between the St. Louis Rams and the Chicago Bears, but the game was canceled due to an ongoing labor dispute that had disrupted nearly all league activity during the 2011 offseason. The two clubs had set a deadline of July 22 to ratify a resolution in enough time to prepare for the game. The league and players did not ratify the agreement until July 25, forcing cancellation of the game.\n\nThe 2016 edition, which was scheduled to be played between the Green Bay Packers and the Indianapolis Colts, was canceled due to unsafe playing conditions. Mike Silver of NFL.com reported that on the morning of game day, the logos at midfield and the end zones had been painted using paint which was not intended for use on artificial turf. When it was apparent the paint wasn't drying fast enough, the field was heated to speed up the drying process, but this caused the turf's rubber to melt. These issues led to unfavorable play conditions. The affected areas were described as being slick and \"like cement,\" making it impossible to get decent footing. Stadium officials attempted to address this by applying a solvent, reportedly paint thinner, to the turf. A Packers employee noticed a label warning that this substance could result in burns when exposed to skin, and alerted others to the discovery. When officially cancelling the game, both the league and the Players Association cited safety concerns. Both teams were told at 6:40 p.m.—an hour and 20 minutes before kickoff—that the game was going to be canceled. However, fans in the stadium only learned of the pending cancellation via social media. No official announcement was made until just before the scheduled 8 p.m. kickoff.\n\nOn December 28, 2016, the NFL announced that the 2017 edition of the game would be played on a Thursday (August 3). This scheduling change made the Hall of Fame Game the first event of the Hall of Fame Weekend. The 2018 game was also played on a Thursday (August 2). Come 2019, the game will be played on August 1.\n\nUnlike the majority of NFL preseason games, which air on local TV stations, the Hall of Fame Game airs nationwide. From 1999 to 2005, the game was held on Monday night, televised as part of ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" package. It had previously been held typically on Saturday afternoons, except from 1963 to 1965 on Sunday afternoons, televised as part of ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" package (still using the \"MNF\" crew). In 1998, the game was put in the \"MNF\" package, and played on a Saturday night, which served as a test run for the move to Monday night. Starting in 2006, it was moved to Sunday night, coinciding with the new \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" television package. \n\nThe 2007 game was telecast on NFL Network, as NBC was intending to televise the China Bowl game in Beijing, China (a game which was postponed to 2009 and later canceled). The Hall of Fame Game has since bounced between both networks. The 2012 game aired on NFL Network due to NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympics. After a two-year absence, the game returned to NBC in 2013 and remained on the network until 2015. The 2016 game was scheduled to air on ESPN due to NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics, but the game was canceled due to field conditions. It returned to NBC in 2017 and will remain on the network until 2019.\n\nWestwood One owns national radio rights; it is the only preseason game to air on a nationwide network. Each team's radio network is also allowed to broadcast the games (albeit usually with fewer affiliates since exhibition games are traditionally much lower priority to non-sports and non-flagship stations).\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, the game was broadcast live in both Ireland and the United Kingdom by Sky Sports. It was not shown in 2009 because of a dispute between Sky Sports and the NFL over TV rights. ESPN America (formerly North American Sports Network) broadcasts the game in the rest of Europe.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2005, the Global Television Network aired the game in Canada, simulcasting ABC; upon the move to Sunday night in 2006, the CTV Television Network aired the game until 2010. With CTV airing the 2012 Summer Olympics, TSN broadcast the Hall of Fame Game in 2012. Azteca 7 aired Spanish-language coverage of the Hall of Fame Game in Mexico from 1998 to 2005; the Game moved to Canal 5 in 2006 and aired on that station until 2010. Due to the cancellation of the 2011 Hall of Fame Game and Televisa's Summer Olympics coverage, the Hall of Fame Game moved to Televisa Deportes in 2012 and then to Galavision in 2013.\n\nTom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium is part of the Cleveland market, and is also within 75 miles of numerous other television markets in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. As such, the NBC affiliates (and before them, the ABC affiliates) were within league requirements to blackout the game in the rare event the game does not sell out, during the time the league had a blackout policy (the policy has been suspended indefinitely since 2015). Because the stadium only holds 22,375 fans (less than half the capacity of any other NFL stadium except the StubHub Center, which is the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers while their permanent stadium Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park is built) and the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies bring large numbers of outside fans to Canton, the game has, to date, always sold out; several NFL teams, as well as the Super Bowl, have similarly enjoyed long sellout streaks.\n\nABCMonday Night Football (1963-1965)\nNBC Sunday Night Football(2006-present)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4040738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4040738", "title": "Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual", "text": "Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual\n\nThe Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) is a diagnostic handbook similar to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) or the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM). The PDM was published on May 28, 2006.\n\nThe information contained in the PDM was collected by a collaborative task force which includes members of the American Psychoanalytic Association, the International Psychoanalytical Association, the Division of Psychoanalysis (Division 39) of the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, and the National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work.\n\nAlthough it is based on current neuroscience and treatment outcome studies, Carey (2006) points out that many of the concepts in the PDM are adapted from the classical psychoanalytic tradition of psychotherapy. For example, the PDM indicates that the anxiety disorders may be traced to the \"four basic danger situations\" described by Sigmund Freud (1926) as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience. It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient.\n\nThe PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes \"individual variations as well as commonalities\" by \"focusing on the full range of mental functioning\" and serves as a \"[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms. The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing \"a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.\".\n\nThis first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains. First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person \"organizes mental functioning and engages the world\".\n\nThe task force adds, \"This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms\". In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context. By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment. Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral. The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral. All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently.\n\nNext, the PDM provides a \"detailed description of emotional functioning\" which are understood to be \"the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology\". This dimension provides a \"microscopic\" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to\n\nThe third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM \"goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically\" with each diagnosis. In this dimension, \"symptom clusters\" are \"useful descriptors\" which presents the patient's \"symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties\". The task force concludes, \"The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning. The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments\".\n\nGuilford Press will be publishing a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), which is being developed by a steering committee composed by Vittorio Lingiardi (Editor), Nancy McWilliams (Editor), and Robert S. Wallerstein (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the current release date is set for June 2017.\n\n\n"}

It primarily classifies books but is also used for other media, such as audio and video recordings. The first edition of the system was released in 1921 and was based on the classification that was used in the accession catalogs of the scientific libraries of that time. The abbreviation 'SAB' is for \"Sveriges Allmänna Biblioteksförening\" (\"Sweden's public library association\"). SAB merged with Svenska bibliotekariesamfundet (\"Swedish librarians' association\") to form present day Svensk Biblioteksförening (\"Swedish library association\").\n\nThe SAB system is regularly revised to track developments in new subject areas. The committee for classification systems for Swedish libraries — a part of Svensk Biblioteksförening — promulgates changes, corrections, and usage notes. Larger revisions may cause changes to the whole system and a new version of the classification system is published. The latest, eighth revision was started in 2002 and was put in use in autumn 2006.\nBoth the research libraries (via the National Library of Sweden) and the public libraries decided at the end of 2008 to recommend a transition to the Dewey Decimal system. The research libraries' major reason for transitioning are simplification: large parts of research literature is already classified in this system. For public libraries the concern is to have the same classification system over the entire country. A considerable savings would be enjoyed by both parties by not having to maintain a distinct national classification system.\n\nSAB is built in a tree structure, where each individual subject has a \"signum\". A signum is a code of one or more letters and sometimes other symbols, which together represent a particular subject category. The first letter, in upper case, indicates a general subject area (e.g. C for \"religion\"). Additional lower case letters after the initial letter indicate more specialized subjects (e.g. Cg for \"practical theology\" and Cge for cathechethics. There is in principle no limit to how many subcategories can be formed in this way.\n\nA signum can be made more precise with additional notation. The following additional notations exist:\n\nIn addition special additional codes are available which are only used on particular signums. These always begin with .0. For instance, the category Fc (\"the Swedish language\") can be subdivided \netc.\n\nAdditional notation may be combined.
