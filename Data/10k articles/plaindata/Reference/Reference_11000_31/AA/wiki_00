The atlas, in which toponymy was based on the official language of each country, was presented to the public in 1927 as Atlante Internazionale del Touring Club Italiano; it had 169 leaves of maps, large folio format, and contained more than 200,000 entries. The second edition appeared already one year later and received the highest recognitions at the International Geographical Congress in Cambridge. Three more editions were issued up to World War II.\n\nAfter the war the atlas maintained the same character with relief in the style of the great classic atlases (hachuring), in contrast to newly published works, that used isohypses (contour lines) to indicate altitudes. This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the \"Atlante Internazionale\", the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the map surface consisted of about 18 square metres!

{"id": "1916138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1916138", "title": "Ax (wrestler)", "text": "Ax (wrestler)\n\nWilliam Reid \"Bill\" Eadie (born December 27, 1947) is an American professional wrestler who has competed under the names of Ax as part of Demolition and The Masked Superstar. He was a high school teacher and coach at Cambridge High School in Cambridge, Ohio, and at East Liverpool, Ohio.\n\nEadie's first match was on December 15, 1972 under the name \"The Paramedic.\" Throughout 1973, he wrestled under a mask as the tag team \"Para-Medics\" in The Sheik's Detroit territory. He then wrestled in Pittsburgh, Detroit, WWWF, and the IWA as Bolo Mongol, the new partner of his trainer, Geeto Mongol. He soon entered the Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory under the management of Boris Malenko and donned a mask as The Masked Superstar, given the character at the advice of matchmaker George Scott. It was stated that he was an Olympic champion by various wrestling promoters. He challenged opponents with a $10,000 reward to whoever could break his \"cobra clutch\", as well as utilizing the \"corkscrew neckbreaker\". The Masked Superstar was 6' 3\", weighed 300 lbs and created many mismatches due to his size, strength and quickness. He had many bouts with Mighty Igor, Paul Jones, Blackjack Mulligan, Wahoo McDaniel, Mr. Wrestling II, Stan Hansen and \"Wildfire\" Tommy Rich, and Dick Murdoch. He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of \"12\" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan. It is believed that neither feat of hour or hour and a half cage matches has since been performed by any wrestlers. He was one of the first wrestlers to body slam André the Giant. Among other accomplishments, he won four Georgia Heavyweight titles and unified that title with the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. He also competed in the World Wrestling Federation against many top wrestlers in 1983-84. He fought against many top level opponents, including then WWF champion Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter, and Jimmy Snuka.\n\nIn 1986, he returned to the World Wrestling Federation and became Super Machine with André the Giant as \"Giant Machine\" and Blackjack Mulligan as \"Big Machine\". Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of Bobby Heenan and his massive tag team of Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy. (The Machines' masks and gimmick were copied from New Japan Pro Wrestling character \"Super Strong Machine\", played by Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata). Eadie later dropped the Machine gimmick and left the WWF to head to Florida for a run as the Masked Superstar, upending Lex Luger to win the NWA Southern title. He held the title for two weeks before Luger regained it.\n\nIn January 1987, Eadie returned to the WWF and formed the tag team Demolition with Randy Colley, formerly Moondog Rex, who wrestled as Smash while Eadie wrestled as Ax. Colley was later replaced by Barry Darsow as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed. Though they began as heels, their unique brawling style and charisma made them so popular that they became faces in November 1988. They won the WWF Tag Team Championship three times as a team of two, but lost the belts at SummerSlam 1990 after they reverted to being heels by forming a threesome with Crush. The trio concept was precipitated by a mutual decision to phase out the Ax character and for Eadie to take a backstage role in the company. Popular rumor at the time cited heart problems on Eadie's part, which have been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement. Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was at Survivor Series 1990. This event also marked the last time that he and Smash worked together for sixteen years.\n\nIn the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as \"Jake Bullet\" in the movie \"No Holds Barred\". He and Smash appeared in several Pizza Hut commercials for the \"Kids Night Out\" promotion widely seen on national television.\n\nAround 1991, Ax formed a new tag team, using the Demolition name, and pairing up with a Canadian wrestler, dubbed \"Canadian Giant\" or \"Demolition Hux.\" They toured with New Japan Pro Wrestling, facing established stars such as Masa Saito, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami, at the same time that Smash and Crush were still wrestling under the name for the then WWF and on Japanese tours with Super World of Sports. Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways.\n\nEadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar. On August 15, 1997, Eadie was disqualified in a match against Jimmy Snuka at the \"IWA Night of the Legends\" show in Kannapolis, North Carolina after hitting special guest referee Ricky Steamboat. On March 1, 1998, he defeated Vladimir Koloff in Fredericksburg, Virginia to win the UCW Heavyweight Championship. On March 14, 1999, Eadie and Ben Steele captured the NAWA United States Tag Team Championship from Kane and Abel Atoms in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nAs of 2013, Eadie still wrestles occasionally for independent promotions and makes signing appearances in \"legends\" shows across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Masked Superstar defeated Greg Valentine for the Mid-Atlantic Heritage Championship. The title changed hands at the Carolina Wrestling Classic on Saturday, June 2, 2007 at the L.P. Frans Stadium in Hickory, North Carolina. The Millennium Wrestling Federation reunited Ax and Smash of Demolition at the Wrestling's Living Legends reunion April 1, 2007, prior to WrestleMania 23 in Windsor, Ontario. They began regularly competing as Ax and Smash for the first time in 16 years. Alongside One Man Gang, Demolition competed in the Chikara King of the Trios Tournament in 2008, but were eliminated in the second round by \"The Fabulous Three\" (Larry Sweeney, Mitch Ryder and Shayne Hawke). On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ax was inducted because of his success, and the fact that he is a native of Brownsville, PA, also in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nOn October 2, 2010 Ax made his third appearance for the Dynamic Wrestling Alliance based in Middletown, Ohio.\n\nOn May 21, 2011, Demolition reunited at Full Impact Pro's debut iPPV \"In Full Force\". Their match against Tony DeVito and Ralph Mosco went to a no contest when local commentator and manager Larry Dallas came out and said his men wanted revenge. The ring was stormed by Manu, Sami Callihan, Blain Rage and Joey Attel. Demolition, Devito and Mosco managed to clear the ring and beat Dallas to end the show.\n\nDemolition returned to Chikara on September 16, 2012, taking part in a tag team gauntlet match, from which they eliminated The Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive and Max Smashmaster), before being eliminated themselves by their old WWF rivals, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and Warlord). On June 3, 2017, Eadie announced his retirement, although he went on to have two more matches. His final singles match took place at KSWA's \"Brawl Under the Bridge\" event in the Homestead neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA on July 22, 2017. On August 12, 2017, Eadie had his final match, resulting in a victory in a 6-man tag team match for Georgia Premier Wrestling in Canton, Georgia.\n\nEadie formerly supported the good work of the Inner Harbour Hospital Springs Campus in Rockmart, Georgia. For several years, the Masked Superstar has made many of his masks and wrestling gear available to wrestling fans through raffles and auctions, the proceeds of which support the general operating fund of the non-profit Inner Harbour Hospital, which has since closed and all operations moved to The Shoals campus in Douglasville, Georgia due to a lack of funding.\n\nIn July 2016, Eadie was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\nA long time friend of André the Giant outside of wrestling, Eadie revealed in a 2016 interview that André was the godfather to his two daughters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10485277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10485277", "title": "Comparison microscope", "text": "Comparison microscope\n\nA comparison microscope is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.\n\nIn the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\n Philip O. Gravelle, a chemist, developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\" Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.\n\nThe modern instrument has many optical, mechanical and electronic refinements, including fiber optic illumination, video capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single firearm based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a \"no conclusion\" result if insufficient marks are present.\n\nSince, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match bullets and cartridge cases to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of forensic science.\n\nVisualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.\n\nThe prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the United States compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope. As with most firearms, the fired ammunition components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as \"ballistics\".\n\nHistorically, and currently, this forensic discipline ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired bullets or cartridge cases, one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.\n\nThe interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called rifling) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called \"lands\" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the barrel surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a \"signature\" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this \"signature\" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.\n\nWhen a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.\n\nForensic innovator Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927.\nGoddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.\nIn October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.\n\nColonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in which seven gangsters were killed by rival Al Capone mobsters dressed as Chicago police officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at Northwestern University and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were all brought under one roof.\nIn 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7643", "title": "Conciliation", "text": "Conciliation\n\nConciliation is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties both separately and together in an attempt to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, encouraging parties to explore potential solutions and assisting parties in finding a mutually acceptable outcome.\n\nConciliation differs from arbitration in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award.\n\nConciliation differs from mediation in that in conciliation, often the parties are in need of restoring or repairing a relationship, either personal or business.\n\nA conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to \"give\" on the objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most important for each party in turn. The parties rarely place the same priorities on all objectives, and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party. Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.\n\nMost successful conciliators are highly skilled negotiators. Some conciliators operate under the auspices of any one of several non-governmental entities, and for governmental agencies such as the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in the United States.\n\nHistorical conciliation is an applied conflict resolution approach that utilizes historical narratives to positively transform relations between societies in conflicts. Historical conciliation can utilize many different methodologies, including mediation, sustained dialogue, apologies, acknowledgement, support of public commemoration activities, and public diplomacy.\n\nHistorical conciliation is not an excavation of objective facts. The point of facilitating historical questions is not to discover all the facts in regard to who was right or wrong. Rather, the objective is to discover the complexity, ambiguity, and emotions surrounding both dominant and non-dominant cultural and individual narratives of history. It is also not a rewriting of history. The goal is not to create a combined narrative that everyone agrees upon. Instead, the aim is to create room for critical thinking and more inclusive understanding of the past and conceptions of “the other.”\n\nConflicts that are addressed through historical conciliation have their roots in conflicting identities of the people involved. Whether the identity at stake is their ethnicity, religion or culture, it requires a comprehensive approach that takes people’s needs, hopes, fears, and concerns into account.\n\nJapanese law makes extensive use of in civil disputes. The most common forms are civil conciliation and domestic conciliation, both of which are managed under the auspice of the court system by one judge and two non-judge \"conciliators.\"\n\nCivil conciliation is a form of dispute resolution for small lawsuits, and provides a simpler and cheaper alternative to litigation. Depending on the nature of the case, non-judge experts (doctors, appraisers, actuaries, and so on) may be called by the court as conciliators to help decide the case.\n\nDomestic conciliation is most commonly used to handle contentious divorces, but may apply to other domestic disputes such as the annulment of a marriage or acknowledgment of paternity. Parties in such cases are required to undergo conciliation proceedings and may only bring their case to court once conciliation has failed.\n"}

The site and community who maintained it were also known as the Open Directory Project (ODP). It was owned by AOL (now a part of Verizon's Oath Inc.) but constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors.\n\nDMOZ used a hierarchical ontology scheme for organizing site listings. Listings on a similar topic were grouped into categories which then included smaller categories.\n\nDMOZ closed on March 17, 2017 because AOL no longer wished to support the project. The website became a single landing page on that day, with links to a static archive of DMOZ, and to the DMOZ discussion forum, where plans to rebrand and relaunch the directory are being discussed.\n\n, a non-editable mirror remained available at dmoztools.net, and it was stated that while the DMOZ URL would not return, a successor version of the directory would and did, at Curlie.org.\n\nDMOZ was founded in the United States as Gnuhoo by Rich Skrenta and Bob Truel in 1998 while they were both working as engineers for Sun Microsystems. Chris Tolles, who worked at Sun Microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products, also signed on in 1998 as a co-founder of Gnuhoo along with co-founders Bryn Dole and Jeremy Wenokur. Skrenta had developed TASS, an ancestor of tin, the popular threaded Usenet newsreader for Unix systems. The original category structure of the Gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of Usenet newsgroups then in existence.\n\nThe Gnuhoo directory went live on June 5, 1998. After Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation objected to the use of \"Gnu\" in the name, Gnuhoo was changed to NewHoo. Yahoo! then objected to the use of \"Hoo\" in the name, prompting a proposed name change, to ZURL. Prior to switching to ZURL, NewHoo was acquired by Netscape Communications Corporation in October 1998 and became the Open Directory Project. Netscape released Open Directory data under the Open Directory License. Netscape was acquired by AOL shortly thereafter and DMOZ was one of the assets included in the acquisition.\nBy the time Netscape assumed stewardship, the Open Directory Project had about 100,000 URLs indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors. On October 5, 1999, the number of URLs indexed by DMOZ reached one million. According to an unofficial estimate, the URLs in DMOZ numbered 1.6 million in April 2000, surpassing those in the Yahoo! Directory. DMOZ achieved the milestones of indexing two million URLs on August 14, 2000, three million listings on November 18, 2001 and four million on December 3, 2003. As of April 2013 there were 5,169,995 sites listed in over 1,017,500 categories. On October 31, 2015, there were 3,996,412 sites listed in 1,026,706 categories.\n\nIn January 2006, DMOZ began publishing online reports to inform the public about the development of the project. The first report covered the year 2005. Monthly reports were issued subsequently until September 2006. These reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics provided on the front page of the directory. The number of listings and categories cited on the front page included \"Test\" and \"Bookmarks\" categories but these were not included in the RDF dump offered to users. There were about 7330 active editors during August 2006. 75,151 editors had contributed to the directory as of March 31, 2007. As of April 2013, the number of contributing editors had increased to 97,584.\n\nOn October 20, 2006, DMOZ's main server suffered a catastrophic failure that prevented editors from working on the directory until December 18, 2006. During that period, an older build of the directory was visible to the public. On January 13, 2007, the Site Suggestion and Update Listings forms were again made available. On January 26, 2007, weekly publication of RDF dumps resumed. To avoid future outages, the system resided on a redundant configuration of two Intel-based servers from then on.\n\nThe site's interface was given an upgrade in 2016, branded \"DMOZ 3.0\", but AOL took it offline the following year.\n\nAs DMOZ became more widely known, two other major web directories edited by volunteers and sponsored by Go.com and Zeal emerged, both now defunct. These directories did not license their content for open content distribution.\n\nThe concept of using a large-scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects. DMOZ's editing model directly inspired at least three other open content volunteer projects: music site MusicMoz, an open content restaurant directory known as ChefMoz and an encyclopedia known as Open Site. Finally, according to Larry Sanger, DMOZ was part of the inspiration for the Nupedia project, out of which Wikipedia grew.\n\nGnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from Usenet. In 1998, Rich Skrenta said, \"I took a long list of groups and hand-edited them into a hierarchy.\" For example, the topic covered by the comp.ai.alife newsgroup was represented by the category Computers/AI/Artificial_Life. The original divisions were for \"Adult\", \"Arts\", \"Business\", \"Computers\", \"Games\", \"Health\", \"Home\", \"News\", \"Recreation\", \"Reference\", \"Regional\", \"Science\", \"Shopping\", \"Society\", \"Sports\" and \"World\". While these sixteen \"top-level\" categories have remained intact, the ontology of second- and lower-level categories has undergone a gradual evolution; significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached.\n\nIn July 1998, the directory became multilingual with the addition of the \"World\" top-level category. The remainder of the directory lists only English language sites. By May 2005, seventy-five languages were represented. The growth rate of the non-English components of the directory has been greater than the English component since 2002. While the English component of the directory held almost 75% of the sites in 2003, the \"World\" level grew to over 1.5 million sites as of May 2005, forming roughly one-third of the directory. The ontology in non-English categories generally mirrors that of the English directory, although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common.\n\nSeveral of the top-level categories have unique characteristics. The \"Adult\" category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the RDF dump that DMOZ provides. While the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic, the Regional category is categorized primarily by region. This has led many to view DMOZ as two parallel directories: \"Regional\" and \"Topical\".\n\nOn November 14, 2000, a special directory within DMOZ was created for people under 18 years of age. Key factors distinguishing this \"Kids and Teens\" area from the main directory are:\n\nBy May 2005, this portion of DMOZ included over 32,000 site listings.\n\nSince early 2004, the whole site has been in UTF-8 encoding. Prior to this, the encoding used to be ISO 8859-1 for English language categories and a language-dependent character set for other languages. The RDF dumps have been encoded in UTF-8 since early 2000.\n\nDirectory listings are maintained by editors. While some editors focus on the addition of new listings, others focus on maintaining the existing listings and some do both. This includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and/or grammatical errors, as well as monitoring the status of linked sites. Still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions.\n\nRobozilla is a Web crawler written to check the status of all sites listed in DMOZ. Periodically, Robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action. This process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals: to reduce the link rot in web directories. Shortly after each run, the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits.\n\nDue to the popularity of DMOZ and its resulting impact on search engine rankings (See PageRank), domains with lapsed registration that are listed on DMOZ have attracted domain hijacking, an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory.\n\nWhile corporate funding and staff for DMOZ have diminished in recent years, volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement Robozilla, category crawlers, spellcheckers, search tools that directly sift a recent RDF dump, bookmarklets to help automate some editing functions, mozilla based add-ons, and tools to help work through unreviewed queues.\n\nDMOZ data was previously made available under the terms of the Open Directory License, which required a specific DMOZ attribution table on every Web page that uses the data.\n\nThe Open Directory License also included a requirement that users of the data continually check DMOZ site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs. This restriction prompted the Free Software Foundation to refer to the Open Directory License as a non-free documentation license, citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license.\n\nIn 2011, DMOZ silently changed its license to a Creative Commons Attribution license, which is a free license (and GPL compatible).\n\nDMOZ data is made available through an RDF-like dump that is published on a download server, older versions are also archived there. New versions are usually generated weekly. An DMOZ editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are encountered in the DMOZ RDF dump, most importantly that the file format isn't RDF. So while today the so-called RDF dump is valid XML, it is not valid RDF and as such, software to process the DMOZ RDF dump needs to be specifically written for DMOZ data.\n\nDMOZ data powers the core directory services for many of the Web's largest search engines and portals, including Netscape Search, AOL Search, and Alexa. Google Directory used DMOZ information, until being shuttered in July 2011.\n\nOther uses are also made of DMOZ data. For example, in the spring of 2004 Overture announced a search service for third parties combining Yahoo! Directory search results with DMOZ titles, descriptions and category metadata. The search engine Gigablast announced on May 12, 2005 its searchable copy of DMOZ. The technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories, \"in effect, instantly creating over 500,000 vertical search engines\".\n\n, DMOZ listed 313 English-language Web sites that use DMOZ data as well as 238 sites in other languages. However, these figures do not reflect the full picture of use, as those sites that use DMOZ data without following the terms of the DMOZ license are not listed.\n\nRestrictions are imposed on who can become an DMOZ editor. The primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities, disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest, and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the DMOZ culture and mission. A majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged. The same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories.\n\nDMOZ's editing model is a hierarchical one. Upon becoming editors, individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category. Once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the Editing Guidelines, they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or else another category in the directory. Mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged, and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions.\n\nDMOZ has its own internal forums, the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics. Access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private.\n\nOver time, senior editors can be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are \"editall\" privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. \"Meta\" privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. \"Cateditall\" privileges are similar to \"editall\", but only for a single directory category. Similarly, \"catmod\" privileges are similar to \"meta\", but only for a single directory category. \"Catmv\" privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with \"meta\" editors.\n\nIn August 2004, a new level of privileges called \"admin\" was introduced. Administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff. Administrators have the ability to grant editall+ privileges to other editors and to approve new directory-wide policies, powers which had previously only been available to root (staff) editors.\n\nAll DMOZ editors are expected to abide by DMOZ's Editing Guidelines. These guidelines describe editing basics: which types of sites may be listed and which may not; how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner; conventions for the naming and building of categories; conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with; and a code of conduct within the community. Editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors, have their editing permissions cut back, or lose their editing privileges entirely. DMOZ Guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums.\n\nThere have long been allegations that volunteer DMOZ editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition. Such allegations are fielded by ODP's staff and meta editors, who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices. In 2003, DMOZ introduced a new \"Public Abuse Report System\" that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form. Uninhibited discussion of DMOZ's purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream webmaster discussion forums. Although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category, as of October 2007, Topix.com, a news aggregation site operated by DMOZ founder Rich Skrenta, had more than 17,000 listings.\n\nEarly in the history of DMOZ, its staff gave representatives of selected companies, such as \"Rolling Stone\" or CNN, editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites. Links to individual CNN articles were added until 2004, but were entirely removed from the directory in January 2008 due to the content being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain. There have been no similar experiments with the editing policy since then.\n\nUnderlying some controversy surrounding DMOZ is its ownership and management. Some of the original GnuHoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise. To varying degrees, those complaints have continued up until the present.\n\nAt DMOZ's inception, there was little thought given to the idea of how DMOZ should be managed and there were no official forums, guidelines or FAQs. In essence, DMOZ began as a free for all.\n\nAs time went on, the ODP Editor Forums became the \"de facto\" DMOZ parliament and when one of DMOZ's staff members would post an opinion in the forums, it would be considered an official ruling. Even so, DMOZ staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges, including the ability to approve new editor applications, which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among DMOZ editors, with DMOZ's paid staff having the final say regarding DMOZ's policies and procedures.\n\nRobert Keating, a principal of Touchstone Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. since 2006, has worked as AOL's Program Manager for DMOZ since 2004. He started working for AOL in 1999 as Senior Editor for AOL Search, then as Managing Editor, AOL Search, DMOZ, and then as Media Ecosystem Manager, AOL Product Marketing.\n\nDMOZ's editor removal procedures are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place. Some people find this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modeled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.\n\nIn the article \"Editor Removal Explained\", DMOZ meta editor Arlarson states that \"a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from DMOZ results from false or misleading statements by former editors\".\n\nThe DMOZ's confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current DMOZ editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals. However, a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines. In the past, this has led to removed DMOZ editors wondering why they cannot login at DMOZ to perform their editing work.\n\nDavid F. Prenatt, Jr., former DMOZ editor \"netesq\", and another former editor known by the alias \"The Cunctator\", both claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to policies, particularly DMOZ's copyright policies. According to their claims, staff use the excuse of uncivil behaviour as a means to remove bothersome editors.\n\nSenior DMOZ editors have the ability to attach \"warning\" or \"do not list\" notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed. Sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion.\n\nCriticism of DMOZ's hierarchical structure emerged by around 2005. Many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated. With the emergence of Web 2.0, folksonomies began to appear, and some editors proposed that folksonomies, networks and directed graphs are more \"natural\" and easier to manage than hierarchies.\n\nThe ODPSearch software is a derivative version of Isearch which is open source, licensed under the Mozilla Public License.\n\nThe ODP Editor Forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary Ultimate Bulletin Board system. In June 2003, they switched to the open source phpBB system. As of 2007, these forums are powered by a modified version of phpBB.\n\nThe bug tracking software used by the ODP is Bugzilla and the web server Apache. Squid web proxy server was also used but it was removed in August 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized. All these applications are open source.\n\nThe DMOZ database/editing software is closed source (although Richard Skrenta has said in June 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the GNU General Public License). This has led to criticism from the aforementioned GNU project, many of whom also criticized the DMOZ content license. The content was later released under a Creative Commons license, which is compatible with the GNU license.\n\nAs such, there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to DMOZ. These alternatives would allow communities of like-minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source/open content Web directories. The only credible alternative, now that DMOZ, has closed is Curlie, where the links from DMOZ have been utilised and many of the DMOZ editors work there. \n\n\n"}

Such analysis of DNS traffic has a significant application within information security and computer forensics, primarily when identifying insider threats, malware, cyberweapons, and \"advanced persistent threat\" (APT) campaigns within computer networks.\n\nSince DNS Analytics processes and interactions involve the communications between DNS clients and DNS servers during the resolution of DNS queries and updates, it may include tasks such as request logging, historical monitoring by node, tabulation of request count quantities, and calculations based on network traffic requests. While a primary driver for DNS Analytics is security described below, another motivation is understanding the traffic of a network so that it can be evaluated for improvements or optimization. For example, DNS Analytics can be used to gather data on a lab where a large number of related requests for PC software updates are made. Finding this, a local update server may be installed to improve the network.\n\nResearch within the public domain shows that state-sponsored malware and APT campaigns exhibit DNS \"indicators of compromise\" (IOC). Since June 2010, analysis of cyberweapon platforms and agents has been undertaken by labs including Kaspersky Lab, ESET, Symantec, McAfee, Norman Safeground, and Mandiant. The findings as released by these organizations include detailed analysis of Stuxnet, Flame, Hidden Lynx, Operation Troy, The NetTraveler, Operation Hangover, Mandiant APT1, and Careto.

Likely compiled around 1570, it is a composite atlas featuring 186 printed and manuscript maps from two distinct atlases of the Lafreri school. It also contains rare Italian maps dating to the 1620s, in addition to a series of manuscript maps, written by little-known publishers during the 1620s and 1630s and detailing the commercial, political and military interests of the Doria family. As of the 21st century it is one of the world's most expensive books.\n\nHaving passed through successive generations of the Doria family, and later the British Rail Pension Fund, it was bought at auction by rare book collector Christopher Pease, 2nd Baron Wardington, for £240,000 in September 1988. In April 2004, the \"Doria Atlas\" was saved from a fire at Wardington Manor in Oxfordshire, when approximately 50 local residents \"formed a human chain\" to remove items from the Wardington library while firefighters were still attempting to put out the fire. Though most of the rare atlases contained in the library were saved with little or no damage, extensive damage to the property forced Lord Wardington to auction much of the collection.\n\nRepair costs, in addition to Wardington's advanced age and frailty, forced a sale of 700 items from the collection. The \"Doria Atlas\" was sold at auction by Sotheby's in October 2005. Initially expected to fetch £700,000 to £1 million, it ultimately was purchased by Bernard Shapero, a London rare book dealer, for £1.46 million. Its sale price was the highest ever for an atlas, a record surpassed by the \"Cosmographia\" the following year.\n\n"}

In the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\", Ferdiad finds himself on opposite sides to his best friend and foster-brother Cúchulainn who may also have been his lover, with whom he had trained in arms under the renowned warrior woman Scáthach. He and Cúchulainn are equal in all martial feats, with two exceptions: the \"Gáe Bulg\", a barbed spear which Scáthach has taught only Cúchulainn to use; and Ferdiad's horny skin, which no weapon can pierce.\n\nWhen Ailill and Medb, king and queen of Connacht, invade Ulster to steal the bull Donn Cúailnge, their progress is held up by Cúchulainn, who demands single combat. After Cúchulainn has defeated a series of Connacht champions, Medb sends for Ferdiad, but he only agrees to fight Cúchulainn after Findabair, Ailill and Medb's daughter, has seductively plied him with alcohol, and Medb has variously bribed, shamed and goaded him to do so. They fight in the ford for three days, first fighting with 8 swords, darts, and spears, then fighting with \"throwing-spears\" and lances, and finally moving on to \"heavy, hard-smiting swords.\" It is on the third day that Ferdiad starts to gain the upper hand. At this point, Cúchulainn calls to his charioteer, Laeg, for the \"Gáe Bolga\", which he floats down the river to him. Cúchulainn throws a light spear at Ferdiad's chest, causing him to raise his shield, and then picks up the \"Gáe Bolga\" between his toes and thrusts it through his anus upon which the barbs spread throughout his body, killing him. The \"Gáe Bolga\" is then removed from Ferdiad's body by Laeg, and Cúchulainn mourns Ferdiad's death, praising his strength and bravery:\n\nScholars believe that the fight between Cuchulainn and Ferdiad is a late addition to the Táin, originating not earlier than the eleventh century and drawing on earlier episodes in the story. \"Ferdiad\" means \"man/warrior of the pair\" (\"Diad\" related to \"dïas\", \"two persons\"). But can also be read as \"Fear\" (man) \"dia\" (god), as opposed to Cúchulainn's position as a literal god-man (being a demigod, his father the chief god Lugh).\n"}

The original society was founded in 1770 and wound up in 1843. It was briefly revived in 1978. Its proceedings were conducted through the medium of Welsh.\n\nThe Gwyneddigion Society was founded in December 1770 by a group of expatriate Welshmen resident in London, its first formal meeting taking place on 4 February 1771. Foremost of the founders was Owen Jones (known as Owain Myfyr), who became the society's first President. Originally from Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier. Other notable early members included Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams), William Owen Pughe, Jac Glan-y-gors (John Jones), Siôn Ceiriog (John Edwards), Edward Jones (\"Bardd y Brenin\"), and Twm o'r Nant (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning \"Gwynedd scholars\") suggests a particular link with the region of Gwynedd, its affiliations were from the start with the whole of North Wales, and later with all parts of Wales. \n\nIt seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including harp-playing and penillion-singing), and pleasure. The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in Walbrook, and one member, David Samwell, wrote:\n\nUnder rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp. However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society. One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the \"centre of Welsh literary life\" (\"canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad\").\n\nThe society promoted annual eisteddfodau in Wales, the precursors of the National Eisteddfod (the first being held at Bala in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793. It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as William Jones, to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including \"Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym\" (1789) and \"The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales\" (1801–07).\n\nA noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of John Evans' exploration of North America in search of the legendary \"Welsh Indians\", the supposed descendants of Madog ab Owain Gwynedd.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the Cymreigyddion Society (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843. \n\nA new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.\n\n\n"}

Dialogue and Sons, of Camden, New Jersey. She was built for the Shipowners' and Merchants' Tugboat Company of San Francisco, as part of their Red Stack Fleet (a part of today's Crowley Maritime Corporation). After completion, \"Hercules\" was sailed to San Francisco via the Straits of Magellan with her sister ship, \"Goliah\", in tow.\n\nFor the first part of her life, \"Hercules\" was an oceangoing tug. Because of the prevailing northwest winds, sailing ships often employed \"Hercules\" and her sisters on journeys north up the coast from San Francisco. For example, in 1916, \"Hercules\" towed to Port Townsend, Washington. On return trips back down the coast, \"Hercules\" often towed log rafts of Pacific Northwest timber, to Southern California mills. At other times, \"Hercules\" was employed towing barges to other ports on the West Coast and to Hawaii, and in transporting equipment for the construction of the Panama Canal.\n\nIn 1924, \"Hercules\" was acquired by the Western Pacific Railroad. For her new owners, she worked shuttling railroad car floats across San Francisco Bay from Oakland and Alameda to San Francisco.\n\nIn 1947, she and the tugboat \"Monarch\" were given the task of towing the hulk of the battleship to San Francisco Bay to be scrapped. However, 500 miles from Hawaii, they were struck by a powerful storm and the \"Oklahoma\" began taking on water and sinking, threatening to drag the two tugs along with her. While the \"Monarch\" managed to release her lines, \"Hercules\" could not get free until the last moment, narrowly avoiding being dragged into the deep by the \"Oklahoma.\" Afterwards, she returned to shuttling car floats and worked in this role until 1957, when she was replaced by the diesel-powered train ferry . \"Hercules\" was kept in a stand-by role to the new ferry until 1961.\n\nThe California State Park Foundation acquired \"Hercules\" in 1975, and the National Park Service took over her restoration in 1977. In 1986 she was designated a National Historic Landmark. She is now one of the exhibits of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park and is to be found moored at the park's Hyde Street Pier.\n\nHercules from the TV show \"Tugs\" is based on this vessel.\n"}

The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.\n\nThe lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the Ilkhanate, in the Middle East, Central Asia, Anatolia, and the Indian subcontinent. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the Khalili Collection, comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the Edinburgh University Library. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the Topkapı Palace Library in Istanbul. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent \"one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium\", and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the Persian miniature.\n\nRashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at Hamadan, Iran into a Jewish family. The son of an apothecary, he studied medicine and joined the court of the Ilkhan emperor, Abaqa Khan, in that capacity. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty. He rapidly gained political importance, and in 1304 became the vizier of emperor and Muslim convert Ghazan. He retained his position until 1316, experiencing three successive reigns, but, convicted of having poisoned the second of these three Khans, Öljaitü, he was executed on July 13, 1318.\n\nHamdani was responsible for setting up a stable social and economic system in Iran after the destruction of the Mongol invasions, and was an important artistic and architectural patron. He expanded the university at Rab'-e Rashidi, which attracted scholars and students from Egypt and Syria to China, and which published his many works. He was also a prolific author, though few of his works have survived: only a few theological writings and a correspondence which is probably apocryphal are known today in addition to the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\". His immense wealth made it said of him that he was the best paid author in Iran.\n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" was one of the grandest projects of the Ilkhanate period, \"not just a lavishly illustrated book, but a vehicle to justify Mongol hegemony over Iran\". The text was initially commissioned by Il-Khan Ghazan, who was anxious for the Mongols to retain a memory of their nomadic roots, now that they had become settled and adopted Persian customs. Initially, the work was intended only to set out the history of the Mongols and their predecessors on the steppes, and took the name \"Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī\", which makes up one part of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\". To compile the History, Rashid al-Din set up an entire precinct at the university of Rab'-e Rashidi in the capital of Tabriz. It contained multiple buildings, including a mosque, hospital, library, and classrooms, employing over 300 workers.\n\nAfter the death of Ghazan in 1304, his successor Öljaitü asked Rashid al-Din to extend the work, and write a history of the whole of the known world. This text was finally completed in sometime between 1306 and 1311.\n\nAfter Rashid al-Din's execution in 1318, the Rab-i-Rashidi precinct was plundered, but the in-process copy that was being created at the time survived, probably somewhere in the city of Tabriz, possibly in the library of Rashid's son, Ghiyath al-Din. Later, Rashid's son became Vizier, in his own right, and expanded the restored university precinct of his father. Several of the \"Jāmiʿ\"s compositions were used as models for the later seminal illustrated version of the \"Shahnameh\" known as the Demotte \"Shahnameh\".\n\nIn the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in Herat, perhaps claimed after a victory by the Timurid dynasty. It then passed to the court of the Mughal Empire in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince Farzada Kuli. This fragment was acquired by Colonel John Baillie of Leys of the East India Company, and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library. The other portion was acquired by John Staples Harriott of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General Thomas Gordon. He then bequeathed it to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at Sotheby's, where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for £850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript. The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990.\n\nTo write the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\", Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified:\n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" consists of four main sections of different lengths:\n\n1. The \"Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī\", the most extensive part, which includes:\n\n2. The second part includes :\n\n3. The \"Shu'ab-i panjganah\" (\"Five genealogies, of the Arabs, Jews, Mongols, Franks, and Chinese\"). This text exists in two copies of the manuscript in the library of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul (ms 2937), but has only been published on microfilm.\n\n4. The \"Suwar al-akalim\", a geographical compendium. Unfortunately, it has not survived in any known manuscript.\n\nRecent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in the Muslim world in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia). Although much of the illustration for the various \"Tawarikh\" copies was probably done at the Rab-al Rashidi university complex, a contemporary written account mentions that they were also done elsewhere in Mongol empire. \nThe scene now in the Kahlili collection illustrating the Battle of Badr used a collection of stock figures, and scholars are in disagreement as to who is represented. One descriptor says it shows Muhammad with Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ali before sending them to battle. Another says Muhammad is on the right, but Hamza and Ali on the left, or perhaps the center. Another description says it is Muhammad exhorting his family to fight, and that he may be one of the central figures, but it is not clear which one.\n\nThere is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din’s editorial authorship but the work is generally considered a collective effort. It may also be possible that it was compiled by a group of international scholars under his leadership. Yet, a number of questions remain about the writing of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh.\" Several others, such as Abu’l Qasim al-Kashani, claimed to have written the \"universal history\". Rashid al-Din was of course a very busy man, with his public life, and would have employed assistants to handle the materials assembled and to write the first draft: Abu'l Qasim may have been one of them. Furthermore, not all of the work is original: for instance, the section on the period following the death of Genghis Khan in particular is directly borrowed from Juvayni. Other questions concern the objectivity of the author and his point of view: it is after all an official history, concerning events with which Rashid al-Din in his political capacity was often involved at first hand (for the history of the Ilkhanate in particular). Nonetheless, the work \"is characterized by a matter-of-fact tone and a refreshing absence of sycophantic flattery.\" \n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities. Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.\n\nThe earliest known copy is in Arabic, dated to the early 1300s. Only portions of it have survived, divided into two parts between the University of Edinburgh (151 folios) and the Khalili Collection (59 folios), although some researchers argue for these being from two different copies. Both sections come from the second volume, with the pages interwoven. The Edinburgh part covers some of the earlier history up through a section about the Prophet Muhammad, and then this story is continued in the Khalili portion, with further narratives weaving back and forth between the two collections, ending with the final section also being in the Edinburgh collection.\n\nThe Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2 cm, with a written area of 37 × 25 cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in Naskhi calligraphy. There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as \"Baillie's collection\".\n\nSeventy rectangular miniatures adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of Tabriz at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.\n\nThe miniatures have an unusual horizontal format and only take up about a third of the written area; this may reflect the influence of Chinese scrolls. Some parts of the surviving text are heavily illustrated and other parts not at all, apparently reflecting the importance accorded to them. The miniatures are ink drawings with watercolour washes added, a technique also used in China; although they are generally in good condition, there was considerable use of metallic silver for highlights, which has now oxidized to black. Borrowings from Christian art can also be seen; for example the \"Birth of Muhammad\" adapts the standard Byzantine composition for the \"Nativity of Jesus\", but instead of the Biblical Magi approaching at the left there is a file of three women. The section includes the earliest extended cycle of illustrations of the life of Muhammad. Like other early Ilkhanid miniatures, these differ from the relatively few surviving earlier Islamic book illustrations in having coherent landscape backgrounds in the many scenes set outside, rather than isolated elements of plants or rocks. Architectural settings are sometimes given a sense of depth by different layers being shown and the use of a three-quarters view.\n\nRice distinguished four major painters and two assistants:\n\n\nJust as distinguishable are different racial and ethnic types, made manifest not just in the physical attributes of the characters, but also their clothes and their hats. One can thus distinguish a remarkably well observed group of Abyssinians, Western-style figures based on Syrian Christian manuscripts, Chinese, Mongols, Arabs, and so on.\n\nThe Edinburgh folios were displayed at an exhibition at the University of Edinburgh Main Library in summer 2014\n\nThe portion in the Khalili Collection, where it is referred to as MSS727, contains 59 folios, 35 of them illustrated.\nUntil sold in 1980 it was owned by the Royal Asiatic Society in London. It is a different section of the History than that of the Edinburgh version, possibly from a different copy. Each page measures (slightly different dimensions to the Edinburgh portion due to different models copied). According to Blair's description of the collection, \"Two major sections were lost after division: thirty-five folios (73-107) covering the life of Muhammad up to the caliphate of Hisham, and thirty folios (291-48) going from the end of the Khwarazmshahs to the middle of the section on China. The latter may have been lost accidentally, but the former block may have been jettisoned deliberately because it had no illustrations. The folios about the life of the Prophet were further jumbled, and four were lost. The final three folios (301-303) covering the end of the section on the Jews were also lost, perhaps accidentally, but judging from the comparable section in MS.H 1653, they had no illustrations and may also have been discarded.\"\n\nThe manuscript was brought to Western attention by William Morley, who discovered it in 1841 while he was cataloguing the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. For some time this collection was displayed in the King's Library of the British Museum. It includes twenty illustrations, plus fifteen pages with portraits of the emperors of China. The text covers the history of Islam, the end of China's history, the history of India, and a fragment from the history of the Jews. The work of the Painter of Luhrasp and Master of Alp Arslan is again evident. Some differences in style can be observed, but these can be attributed to the difference in date. A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of Yuan mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China. The folios are dated 1314, and it was transcribed and illustrated in Tabriz under the supervision of Rashid al-Din.\n\nThere are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the Topkapi Palace Library, Istanbul.\n\n\nInterest in the work continued after the Ilkhans were replaced as Persia's ruling dynasty by the Timurids. Timur's youngest son, Shahrukh, who ruled the eastern portion of the empire from 1405–47, owned incomplete copies of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" and commissioned his court historian Hafiz-i Abru to complete it. The earliest dated manuscript made for Shahrukh includes the original text and additions by Hafiz-i Abru, along with other histories, and is dated 1415-16 (Topkapi Palace Library, MS B 282). The Topkapi MS H 1653, discussed above, combines an incomplete Ilkhanid \"Jāmiʿ\" with Timurid additions, which are dated 1425. Another \"Jāmiʿ\" is in Paris (BnF, Supplément persan 1113), dated to about 1430, with 113 miniatures. Most of the miniatures for these volumes copy the horizontal format and other features of the Ilkhanid manuscripts, while retaining other features of Timurid style in costume, colouring and composition, using what is sometimes known as the \"Historical style\".\n\n\n\n"}

The premises, on New Road, consist of a house and backyard workshops, typical of the many family run lock making businesses which once thrived in the town. The house itself was built in 1840, but the period interiors date to 1904, when the Hodson lock making family first lived there. Lock making skills are demonstrated by volunteers using original tools and equipment, such as the floor press and belt driven machinery.\n\nThe Lock Museum was opened to the public in 1987. Since 2003, it has been owned and managed by the Black Country Living Museum.\n\nThe house and its adjoining workshops and outbuildings were awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 1984 and 1986. The listed structures include the two storey workshop on the East side of the yard plus the single storey workshop (originally a stamping shop) on the West side of the yard, directly adjoining the back of the house.\n\nThe business of Richard Hodson & Sons was established in 1792, according to the firm's letterhead. In 1893, it was taken on by John Hodson, who later passed it to his son Edgar. The Hodsons specialised in bar padlocks and also in lighter locks - these locks would have been used to secure cargo on a lighter. Lock parts were manufactured and assembled in the two storey workshop behind the house. Completed orders would have been brought into the yard and loaded into carts. From here they could have been sent all over the world, by rail or via the extensive Midlands canal network and on to coastal ports. Hodson locks were certainly exported to South America and beyond.\n\nFrom the 1920s, the front room of the Locksmith's House was run as a drapers' shop by two of Edgar Hodson's sisters, Edith and Flora. The Hodson Shop operated until 1971, and the unsold stock forms a rich resource on working class costume, now in the care of Walsall Museum.\n\nThere is a wide variety of locks and keys on display in the gallery, many of which were made in Willenhall. \n\n"}

{"id": "41414025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41414025", "title": "Low's Encyclopaedia", "text": "Low's Encyclopaedia\n\nLow's Encyclopædia is an early American encyclopedia, titled \"The New and Complete American Encyclopædia or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\". It was published in New York City, from 1805 to 1811. Consisting of seven volumes quarto, it is noteworthy among America's earliest encyclopedias for having been written in the United States, as opposed to being an American reprint of a British work, as were, for examples, \"Dobson's Encyclopedia\" (1789 to 1798), the Bradford printing (1806 to 1820) of \"Rees's Cyclopædia\" (1802 to 1820), Samuel A. Mitchell's American printing (1816) of the \"British Encyclopaedia\" (1809), or the Birch and Small printing (A. F. M. Willich and James Mease, Philadelphia, 1803) of the \"Domestic Encyclopedia\" (A. F. M. Willich, London, 1802).\n\nThe first five volumes of the encyclopedia were published by John Low (1763-1809), and the final two by his widow and successor, Esther Prentiss Low (1762-1816). John Low was born in London and immigrated to America with Esther shortly after the birth of their son John (ca. 1790–1829). By 1795, John Low had established himself as a printer and bookseller in New York City. Upon his death, Esther ran their printing establishment, and the younger John Low carried on in the printing business. She continued issuing the encyclopedia and printing maps posthumously until at least 1831.\n\n\n\"Low's Encyclopedia\" is primarily an American work. Although the title page says it was taken from the \"Encyclopædia Perthensis\", this does not appear to be the case, as this work is seven volumes of around 650 pages each, while the latter work was 23 volumes of 800 pages each. Many of the minor definitional entries are borrowed from \"Perthensis\" or \"Britannica\", usually with changes in wording, but a roughly equal number are original, and the articles are disproportionately of American concern: London takes up half a page while New York City gets five, when populations at the time were nearly 1 million for the former city and 80,000 for the latter. By comparison, \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"'s fourth edition of 1810 gives the two cities 42 pages versus one and one half, respectively. Scotland receives four pages, while each of the states of the United States get equally long articles, and most maps are of the various states. The American Revolutionary War gets a 30-page treatment, while the British revolution of 1688 gets a paragraph. The article \"New York\" describes Sir William Johnson as being a land jobber and an enemy of the nation, for example.\n\nAlmost every American city, town, and county is listed, there are many biographies of Americans, and all the maps and most of the plates are original, a few plates being taken from \"Britannica\". They are found with an inconsistent number of maps, usually around 30, and plates. Although the title page says there would be 170 copperplates, the copy in the Library of Congress only has 149. Most of the maps appear to have been published earlier by John Low; many are dated 1799 and 1800, and some appear to be even older. The map of Kentucky and Tennessee calls Kentucky a state, but Tennessee was called Southwestern Territory. This dates the map to the mid-1790s. It is known that John Low published and sold John Payne's \"A New and Complete System of Universal Geography\" in 1798-1800, with maps that re-appeared in this encyclopedia. From this we can credit Payne as cartographer for the maps which were not updated for the encyclopedia except in the inscriptions, which say \"Engraved for the New Encyclopedia\" where \"Engraved for Payne's Universal Geography\" had been. Other maps are newer, such as Pennsylvania, dated 1810, which was engraved and published by Esther Low. A reprint of the encyclopedia by Esther between 1811 and 1815 includes some new maps.\n\nPlans for the encyclopedia were begun, and subscriptions began being taken, much earlier than the original publication date, as it is known that around 1802, Thomas Jefferson subscribed to a set, which was delivered in 1811 for $75. Its intention was to compete with \"Dobson's Encyclopedia\", as stated in the \"Preface\", which was written in 1811 by Esther Low:\n\nThe motive that produced the publication of this Encyclopædia originated in the general voice of a numerous class of readers; who, although they might have been ever so anxious for the promulgation of literature, were yet induced to express their regret, that another similar work which had been published at Philadelphia, was of too voluminous and expensive a nature to answer the beneficial purposes of a general circulation. To remedy this complaint, they chose to decide in favor of another compilation; which, whilst it should embrace all the utility without the diffuseness of the former, would nevertheless, prove equally interesting, and at the same time more conveniently portable, and might be procured at nearly one-fourth of the expense.\n\nNo author or editor is mentioned in the preface, only:\n\n...although it may be considered as a compilation of all the best dictionaries and books of science extant, yet it may justly claim in other respects, a right to originality; as a vast mass of matter has been generously supplied by men of the first eminence in the various pursuits of literature, as well natives of America as foreigners of distinction; who were well versed in the Mathematical, Theological, Physical, and other departments. To enumerate their names would be impracticable in the present instance, and to particularise (sic) any, might be thought invidious; they are all of them entitled to the warmest thanks of the publishers for their communications on the several topics on which they have so ably written. The Geographical, Botanical, and Chemical parts are nearly all original; as well as those of Agriculture, Gardening, etc.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "1792011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792011", "title": "Mari (goddess)", "text": "Mari (goddess)\n\nMari, also called Mari Urraca, Anbotoko Mari (\"the lady of Anboto\"), and Murumendiko Dama (\"lady of Murumendi\") was a goddess—a \"lamia\"—of the Basques. She was married to the god Sugaar (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travelled together hail would fall, her departures from her cave would be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lived in at different times would determine dry or wet weather: wet when she was in Anboto; dry when she was elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she was said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of Gurutzegorri (Ataun), Aizkorri and Aralar, although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered to pertain to the same lamia.\n\nIt is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between Mary and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the Virgin Mary. The first known written citation of the \"Dame of Amboto\" was made by Charles V's chronicler Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa in his Memorial histórico español.\n\nMari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort Sugaar meet every Friday (the night of the \"Akelarre\" or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of \"sorginak\" (witches), and is said to feed \"on the negation and affirmation\" (that is, on falsehood).\n\nOccasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (\"lamiak\", \"jentilak\", etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields.\n\nIn various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, Atxular and Mikelatz. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the Devil in a church in Salamanca and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, Hodei, or embodied as a young red bull.\n\nAnother legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of Biscay, Diego López I de Haro. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the sign of the cross. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose.\n\nOther legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way.\n\nThe people of Oñati believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in Aloña. In Zeanuri, Biscay, they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in Oiz called Supelegor. A similar legend in Olaeta, Biscay substitutes Gorbea for Supelegor.\n\nA legend from Otxandio, Biscay tells that Mari was born in Lazkao, Gipuzkoa, and that she was the evil sister of a Roman Catholic priest. In other legends, the priest is her cousin Juanito Chistu, rather than a brother, and is a great hunter. She was said to take a distaff by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake.\n\nIn Elorrieta, Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of sin.\n\nFolklorist Resurrección María de Azkue ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the Kingdom of Navarre, widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the Merindad de Durango. She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto. According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his \"Historia de Vizcaya.\" Labayru in her \"Historia de Vizcaya\" doubts it.\n\nLegends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a witch for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about. In Beizama, Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented. They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, \"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo\" (\"Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven\").\n\nMari was associated with various forces of nature, including thunder and wind. As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with Lurbira.\n\nMari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch. She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her idols usually feature a full moon behind her head.\n\nMari is the main character of Basque mythology, having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat.\n\nSanta Marina, a saint revered in the Basque Country, is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth.\n\nThe most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.\n\n\n\n"}

' may thus also appear as ' or ' or ' (and variants).\n\nOriginally and etymologically, \"\" means \"mortal being\" as Old Persian \"martya\", Persian \"mard\" and even Sanskrit \"martya\" also mean \"mortal\" and therefore \"man\". The root in Avesta and Sanskrit for death is \"mar\", \"mr\", \"to die\". The causative \"mâr\" means \"to kill\". Its derivatives \"merethyu\"/\"mrtyu\" means \"death\"; \"mareta\" and \"maretan\" means \"mortal\", and then \"man, human being\" \"mashya\". For more on the etymology of the \"aša\" and \"arta\" variants of these terms, see Avestan phonology.\n\nAccording to the creation myth as described in the \"Bundahishn\", Ohrmuzd's (Ahura Mazda) sixth creation is the primeval beast Gayomart (Gayamarətan), who was neither male nor female. Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), the Spirit of Evil that dwelt in the Absolute Darkness, sought to destroy all that Ohrmuzd had created, and sent the demoness Jeh (Jahi) to kill Gayomard. In this she was successful, but the moon (Mah) captured his seed before the animal died, from which all animal life then grew. From Gayomard's corpse grew a tree, the seeds of which were the origin of all plant life, and from the branches of which grew Mashya and Mashyana.\n\nThey promised to aid Ohrmuzd in his battle with Ahriman, and gave birth to fifteen sets of twins which scattered around the Earth and became the races of mankind.\n\nIndo-European connections to Ask and Embla have been proposed. In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla were the first man and woman, created from trees and given various gifts of life by three gods. According to Benjamin Thorpe \"Grimm says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assidous labour; the same relation as Meshia and Meshiane, the ancient Persian names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42583036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42583036", "title": "Monotone comparative statics", "text": "Monotone comparative statics\n\nMonotone comparative statics is a sub-field of comparative statics that focuses on the conditions under which endogenous variables undergo monotone changes (that is, either increasing or decreasing) when there is a change in the exogenous parameters. Traditionally, comparative results in economics are obtained using the Implicit Function Theorem, an approach that requires the concavity and differentiability of the objective function as well as the interiority and uniqueness of the optimal solution. The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the endogenous variable and exogenous parameter. Roughly speaking, a maximization problem displays complementarity if a higher value of the exogenous parameter increases the marginal return of the endogenous variable. This guarantees that the set of solutions to the optimization problem is increasing with respect to the exogenous parameter.\n\nLet formula_1 and let formula_2 be a family of functions parameterized by formula_3, where formula_4 is a partially ordered set (or poset, for short). How does the correspondence formula_5 vary with formula_6?\n\nStandard comparative statics approach: Assume that set formula_7 is a compact interval and formula_8 is a continuously differentiable, strictly quasiconcave function of formula_9. If formula_10 is the unique maximizer of formula_8, it suffices to show that formula_12 for any formula_13, which guarantees that formula_10 is increasing in formula_6. This guarantees that the optimum has shifted to the right, i.e., formula_16. This approach makes various assumptions, most notably the quasiconcavity of formula_8.\n\nWhile it is clear what it means for a unique optimal solution to be increasing, it is not immediately clear what it means for the correspondence formula_18 to be increasing in formula_6. The standard definition adopted by the literature is the following.\n\nDefinition (strong set order): Let formula_20 and formula_21 be subsets of formula_22. Set formula_21 dominates formula_20 in the \"strong set order\" (formula_25) if for any formula_26 in formula_21 and formula_9 in formula_20, we have formula_30 in formula_21 and formula_32 in formula_20.\n\nIn particular, if formula_34 and formula_35, then formula_36 if and only if formula_37. The correspondence formula_18 is said to be increasing if formula_39 whenever formula_40.\n\nThe notion of complementarity between exogenous and endogenous variables is formally captured by single crossing differences.\n\nDefinition (single crossing function): Let formula_41. Then formula_42 is a \"single crossing function\" if for any formula_43 we have formula_44.\n\nDefinition (single crossing differences): The family of functions formula_45, formula_46, obey \"single crossing differences\" (or satisfy the single \"crossing property\") if for all formula_37, function formula_48 is a single crossing function.\n\nObviously, an increasing function is a single crossing function and, if formula_49 is increasing in formula_6 (in the above definition, for any formula_51), we say that formula_45 obey \"increasing differences\". Unlike increasing differences, single crossing differences is an \"ordinal property\", i.e., if formula_45 obey single crossing differences, then so do formula_54, where formula_55 for some function formula_56 that is strictly increasing in formula_9.\n\nTheorem 1: Define formula_58. The family formula_45 obey single crossing differences if and only if for all formula_60, we have formula_61 for any formula_43.\n\nApplication (monopoly output and changes in costs): A monopolist chooses formula_84 to maximise its profit formula_85, where formula_86 is the inverse demand function and formula_87 is the constant marginal cost. Note that formula_88 obey single crossing differences. Indeed, take any formula_37 and assume that formula_90; for any formula_91 such that formula_92, we obtain formula_93. By Theorem 1, the profit-maximizing output decreases as the marginal cost of output increases, i.e., as formula_94 decreases.\n\nSingle crossing differences is not a necessary condition for the optimal solution to be increasing with respect to a parameter. In fact, the condition is necessary only for formula_95 to be increasing in formula_6 for \"any\" formula_97. Once the sets are restricted to a narrower class of subsets of formula_7, the single crossing differences condition is no longer necessary.\n\nDefinition (Interval): Let formula_1. A set formula_100 is an \"interval\" of formula_7 if, whenever formula_102 and formula_103 are in formula_20, then any formula_105 such that formula_106 is also in formula_20.\n\nFor example, if formula_108, then formula_109 is an interval of formula_7 but not formula_111. Denote formula_112.\n\nDefinition (Interval Dominance Order): The family formula_45 obey the \"interval dominance order\" (IDO) if for any formula_114 and formula_115, such that formula_116, for all formula_117, we have formula_118.\n\nLike single crossing differences, the interval dominance order (IDO) is an ordinal property. An example of an IDO family is a family of quasiconcave functions formula_45 where formula_120 increasing in formula_6. Such a family need not obey single crossing differences.\n\nA function formula_122 is \"regular\" if formula_123 is non-empty for any formula_124, where formula_125 denotes the interval formula_126.\n\nTheorem 2: Denote formula_127. A family of regular functions formula_45 obeys the interval dominance order if and only if formula_129 is increasing in formula_6 for all intervals formula_100.\n\nThe next result gives useful sufficient conditions for single crossing differences and IDO.\n\nProposition 1: Let formula_7 be an interval of formula_22 and formula_45 be a family of continuously differentiable functions. (i) If, for any formula_115, there exists a number formula_167 such that formula_168 for all formula_169, then formula_45 obey single crossing differences. (ii) If, for any formula_115, there exists a nondecreasing, strictly positive function formula_172 such that formula_173 for all formula_169, then formula_45 obey IDO.\n\nApplication (Optimal stopping problem): At each moment in time, agent gains profit of formula_176, which can be positive or negative. If agent decides to stop at time formula_9, the present value of his accumulated profit is\n\nwhere formula_179 is the discount rate. Since formula_180, the function formula_181 has many turning points and they do not vary with the discount rate. We claim that the optimal stopping time is decreasing in formula_182, i.e., if formula_183 then formula_184. Take any formula_185. Then, formula_186 Since formula_187 is positive and increasing, Proposition 1 says that formula_188 obey IDO and, by Theorem 2, the set of optimal stopping times is decreasing.\n\nThe above results can be extended to a multi-dimensional setting. Let formula_189 be a lattice. For any two formula_9, formula_26 in formula_7, we denote their supremum (or \"least upper bound\", or join) by formula_193 and their infimum (or \"greatest lower bound\", or meet) by formula_194.\n\nDefinition (Strong Set Order): Let formula_189 be a lattice and formula_20, formula_21 be subsets of formula_7. We say that formula_21 dominates formula_20 in the \"strong set order\" (formula_25 ) if for any formula_26 in formula_21 and formula_9 in formula_20, we have formula_206 in formula_21 and formula_208 in formula_20.\n\nExamples of the strong set order in higher dimensions.\n\nDefinition (Quasisupermodular function): Let formula_189 be a lattice. The function formula_249 is \"quasisupermodular\" (QSM) if\n\nformula_250\n\nThe function formula_251 is said to be a supermodular function if formula_252 Every supermodular function is quasisupermodular. As in the case of single crossing differences, and unlike supermodularity, quasisupermodularity is an ordinal property. That is, if function formula_251 is quasisupermodular, then so is function formula_254, where formula_255 is some strictly increasing function.\n\nTheorem 3: Let formula_189 is a lattice, formula_4 a partially ordered set, and formula_20, formula_21 subsets of formula_7. Given formula_261, we denote formula_262 by formula_129. Then formula_264 for any formula_43 and formula_36\n\nApplication (Production with multiple goods): Let formula_9 denote the vector of inputs (drawn from a sublattice formula_7 of formula_299) of a profit-maximizing firm, formula_300 be the vector of input prices, and formula_181 the revenue function mapping input vector formula_9 to revenue (in formula_22). The firm's profit is formula_304. For any formula_26, formula_169, formula_37, formula_308 is increasing in formula_309. Hence, formula_310 has increasing differences (and so it obeys single crossing differences). Moreover, if formula_181 is supermodular, then so is formula_312. Therefore, it is quasisupermodular and by Theorem 3, formula_313 for formula_314.\n\nIn some important economic applications, the relevant change in the constraint set cannot be easily understood as an increase with respect to the strong set order and so Theorem 3 cannot be easily applied. For example, consider a consumer who maximizes a utility function formula_315 subject to a budget constraint. At price formula_316 in formula_317 and wealth formula_318, his budget set is formula_319 and his demand set at formula_320 is (by definition) formula_321. A basic property of consumer demand is normality, which means (in the case where demand is unique) that the demand of each good is increasing in wealth. Theorem 3 cannot be straightforwardly applied to obtain conditions for normality, because formula_322 if formula_323 (when formula_324 is derived from the Euclidean order). In this case, the following result holds.\n\nTheorem 4: Suppose formula_325 is supermodular and concave. Then the demand correspondence is normal in the following sense: suppose formula_326, formula_327 and formula_328; then there is formula_329 and formula_330 such that formula_331 and formula_332.\n\nThe supermodularity of formula_333 alone guarantees that, for any formula_9 and formula_335, formula_336. Note that the four points formula_9, formula_335, formula_339, and formula_340 form a rectangle in Euclidean space (in the sense that formula_341, formula_342, and formula_343 and formula_344 are orthogonal). On the other hand, supermodularity and concavity together guarantee that\nformula_345\nfor any formula_346, where formula_347. In this case, crucially, the four points formula_9, formula_335, formula_350, and formula_351 form a backward-leaning parallelogram in Euclidean space.\n\nLet formula_352, and formula_45 be a family of real-valued functions defined on formula_7 that obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order. Theorem 1 and 3 tell us that formula_355 is increasing in formula_6. Interpreting formula_6 to be the state of the world, this says that the optimal action is increasing in the state if the state is known. Suppose, however, that the action formula_9 is taken before formula_6 is realized; then it seems reasonable that the optimal action should increase with the likelihood of higher states. To capture this notion formally, let formula_360 be a family of density functions parameterized by formula_361 in the poset formula_362, where higher formula_361 is associated with a higher likelihood of higher states, either in the sense of first order stochastic dominance or the monotone likelihood ratio property. Choosing under uncertainty, the agent maximizes\n\nFor formula_365 to be increasing in formula_361, it suffices (by Theorems 1 and 2) that family formula_367 obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order. The results in this section give condition under which this holds.\n\nTheorem 5: Suppose formula_45 formula_369 obeys increasing differences. If formula_360 is ordered with respect to first order stochastic dominance, then formula_367 obeys increasing differences.\n\nIn the following theorem, X can be either ``single crossing differences\" or ``the interval dominance order\".\n\nTheorem 6: Suppose formula_45 (for formula_382) obeys X. Then the family formula_367 obeys X if formula_360 is ordered with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.\n\nThe monotone likelihood ratio condition in this theorem cannot be weakened, as the next result demonstrates.\n\nProposition 2: Let formula_385 and formula_386 be two probability mass functions defined on formula_387 and suppose formula_388 is does not dominate formula_385 with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property. Then there is a family of functions formula_390, defined on formula_391, that obey single crossing differences, such that formula_392, where formula_393 (for formula_394).\n\nApplication (Optimal portfolio problem): An agent maximizes expected utility with the strictly increasing Bernoulli utility function formula_395. (Concavity is not assumed, so we allow the agent to be risk loving.) The wealth of the agent, formula_396, can be invested in a safe or risky asset. The prices of the two assets are normalized at 1. The safe asset gives a constant return formula_397, while the return of the risky asset formula_6 is governed by the\nprobability distribution formula_399. Let formula_9 denote the agent's investment in the risky asset. Then the wealth of the agent in state formula_6 is formula_402. The agent chooses formula_9 to maximize\n\nNote that formula_405, where formula_406, obeys single crossing (though\nnot necessarily increasing) differences. By Theorem 6, formula_407 obeys single crossing differences, and hence formula_408 is increasing in formula_361, if formula_410 is ordered with\nrespect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.\n\nWhile the sum of increasing functions is also increasing, it is clear that the single crossing property need not be preserved by aggregation. For the sum of single crossing functions to have the same property requires that the functions be related to each other in a particular manner.\n\nDefinition (monotone signed-ratio): Let formula_411 be a poset. Two functions formula_412 obey \"signed{ -}ratio monotonicity\" if, for any formula_413, the following holds:\n\n\nProposition 3: Let formula_251 and formula_421 be two single crossing functions. Then formula_422 is a single crossing function for any non{-}negative scalars formula_423 and formula_424 if and only if formula_251 and formula_421 obey signed-ratio monotonicity.\n\nThis result can be generalized to infinite sums in the following sense.\n\nTheorem 7: Let formula_452 be a finite measure space and suppose that, for each formula_453, formula_454 is a bounded and measurable function of formula_455. Then formula_456 is a single crossing function if, for all formula_361, formula_458, the pair of functions formula_454 and formula_460 of formula_461 satisfy signed-ratio monotonicity. This condition is also necessary if formula_462 contains all singleton sets and formula_463 is required to be a single crossing function for any finite measure formula_464.\n\nApplication (Monopoly problem under uncertainty): A firm faces uncertainty over the demand for its output formula_9 and the profit at state formula_466 is given\nby formula_467, where formula_468 is the marginal cost and formula_469 is the inverse demand function in state formula_361. The firm maximizes\n\nwhere formula_472 is the probability of state formula_361 and formula_474 is the Bernoulli utility function representing the firm’s attitude towards uncertainty. By Theorem 1, formula_475 is increasing in formula_476 (i.e., output falls with marginal cost) if the family formula_477 obeys single crossing differences. By definition, the latter says that, for any formula_37, the function\n\nis a single crossing function. For each formula_361, formula_481 is s single crossing function of formula_476. However, unless formula_333 is linear, formula_484 will not, in general, be increasing in formula_476. Applying Theorem 6, formula_486 is a single crossing function if, for any formula_487, the functions formula_488 and formula_489 (of formula_476) obey signed-ratio monotonicity. This is guaranteed when (i) formula_491 is decreasing in formula_9 and increasing in formula_361 and formula_494 obeys increasing differences; and (ii) formula_474 is twice differentiable, with formula_496, and obeys decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5295016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5295016", "title": "Ottoman Imperial Harem", "text": "Ottoman Imperial Harem\n\nThe Imperial Harem (, \"Harem-i Hümâyûn\") of the Ottoman Empire was the Ottoman sultan's harem composed of the wives, servants (both female slaves and eunuchs), female relatives, and the sultan's concubines, occupying a secluded portion of the Ottoman imperial household. This institution played an important social function within the Ottoman court, and demonstrated considerable political authority in Ottoman affairs, especially during the long period known as the Sultanate of Women. The utmost authority in the Imperial Harem was the Valide Sultan, who ruled over the other women in the household and was often of slave origin herself. The Kizlar Agha (Kızlarağası, also known as the \"Chief Black Eunuch\" because of the Nilotic origin of most aghas) was the head of the eunuchs responsible for guarding the Imperial Harem.\n\nThe word \"harem\" is derived from the Arabic \"harim\" or \"haram\" which give connotations of the sacred and forbidden. The female quarters of Turkish households were then referred to as \"haremlik\" due to their prevailing exclusivity.\n\nThe harem was the ultimate symbol of the Sultan's power. His ownership of women, mostly slaves, was a sign of wealth, power, and sexual prowess. The institution was introduced in the Turkish society with adoption of Islam, under the influence of the Arab Caliphate, which the Ottomans emulated. To ensure the obedience of the women, many of them were bought and kept into slavery. However, not all members of the Harem were slaves. The main wives, especially those taken into marriage to consolidate personal and dynastic alliances were free women. This was the exception, not the rule. The relationship between slavery and polygamy/harems in the Turkish Harem continued until 1908, at the very least.\n\nThe imperial harem also served as a parallel institution to the sultan's household of male servants. The women were provided with an education roughly on par with that provided to male pages, and at the end of their respective educations they would be married off to one another, as the latter graduated from the palace to occupy administrative posts in the empire's provinces. Consequently, only a small fraction of the women in the harem actually engaged in sexual relations with the sultan, as most were destined to marry members of the Ottoman political elite, or else to continue service to the Valide Sultan.\n\nThe Imperial Harem occupied one of the large sections of the private apartments of the sultan at the Topkapi Palace which encompassed more than 400 rooms. After 1853, an equally lavish harem quarter was occupied at the new imperial palace at Dolmabahçe.\n\nThe mother of a new sultan came to the harem with pomp, circumstance and assumed the title of valide sultan or sultana mother upon her son's ascension. She was paramount chief and ran the Harem and ruled over the members of the dynasty. The Valide Sultan who influenced the political life of the Ottoman Empire during various periods of history (such as the Sultanate of Women in the 16th and 17th centuries) had the authority to regulate the relations between the sultan and his wives and children. At times the valide sultan acted as regent for her son, particularly in the seventeenth century, when a series of accidents necessitated regencies that endowed the position of Queen Mother with great political power.\n\nIn 1868, Empress Eugénie of France visited the Imperial harem, which was to have a lasting effect. She was taken by the sultan Abdülaziz to his mother, Valide Sultan Pertevniyal Sultan, but reportedly, Pertevniyal became outraged by the presence of a foreign woman in her harem, and greeted the Empress with a slap in the face, almost provoking an international incident. The visit of the Empress, however, did cause a dress reform in the harem by making Western fashion popular among the harem women, who dressed according to Western fashion ever after.\n\nFor the perpetuation and service of the Ottoman Dynasty, beautiful and intelligent slave girls were either captured in war, recruited within the empire, or procured from neighbouring countries to become imperial court ladies (\"Cariyes\"). Odalisque, a word derived from the Turkish \"oda\", meaning chamber: thus connoting odalisque to mean chamber girl or attendant, was not a term synonymous with concubine; however, in western usage the term has come to refer specifically to the harem concubine.\n\nThe court ladies who were introduced into the harem in their tender age were brought up in the discipline of the palace. They were promoted according to their capacities and became \"kalfas\" and \"ustas\".\n\nThe court ladies with whom the sultan shared his bed became a member of the dynasty and rose in rank to attain the status of \"Gözde\" (the Favorite), \"Ikbal\" (the Fortunate) or \"Kadın\" (the Woman/Wife). The highest position was the Valide Sultan, the legal mother of the sultan, who herself used to be a wife or a concubine of the sultan's father and rose to the supreme rank in the harem. No court lady could leave or enter the premises of the harem without the explicit permission of the valide sultan. The power of the valide sultan over concubines even extended to questions of life and death, with eunuchs directly reporting to her.\n\nThe court ladies either lived in the halls beneath the apartments of the consorts, the valide sultan and the sultan, or in separate chambers. The \"kadın\"s, who numbered up to four, formed the group who came next in rank to the valide sultan. Right below the \"kadın\"s in rank were the \"ikbal\"s, whose number was unspecified. Last in the hierarchy were the \"gözde\"s.\n\nDuring 16th and 17th century, chief consort of the sultan received title \"haseki sultan\" or sultana consort. This title surpassed other titles and ranks by which the prominent consorts of the sultans had been known (hatun and kadin). When the position of valide sultan was vacant, a haseki could take valide's role, have access to considerable economic resources, become chief of imperial harem, sultan's advisor in politic matters, and even have an influence upon foreign policy and on international politics. This cases happened during Hürrem Sultan and Kösem Sultan's periods.\n\nAt Topkapı Palace, at the court of the Ottoman sultans, the harem staff included eunuchs. These were Nilotic slaves captured in the Nile vicinity. The castrated servicemen in the Muslim and Turkish states in the Middle Ages were recruited to serve in the palace from the times of Sultan Mehmed I onwards. These eunuchs who were trained in the palace and were given the charge of guarding the harem rose in rank after serving in many positions. The harem eunuchs and the harem organization were under the command of the Chief harem eunuch, who was also called the Master of the Girls (\"Kızlar Ağası\") or Chief Black Eunuch. They supervised the quarters where the female population of the palace lived. They had influence on the palace and later on the state administration in the 17th and 18th centuries as they had access to the sultan and the sultan's family and became very powerful.\n\nThe Chief Black Eunuch was sometimes considered second only to the Grand Vizier (head of the imperial government, but often working in his own palace or even away, e.g., on military campaign) in the confidence of the Sultan, to whom he had and arranged access (including his bedchamber, the \"\" for every harem lady), also being his confidential messenger. As commander of an imperial army corps, the halberdiers ('baltacı'), he even held the supreme military dignity of three-horsetail pasha (general).\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief White Eunuch (\"Kapı Ağası\"), was in charge of 300 to 900 white eunuchs as head of the 'Inner Service' (the palace bureaucracy, controlling all messages, petitions, and State documents addressed to the Sultan), head of the Palace School, gatekeeper-in-chief, head of the infirmary, and master of ceremonies of the Seraglio, and was originally the only one allowed to speak to the Sultan in private. In 1591, Murad III transferred the powers of the white to the black eunuchs as there was too much embezzlement and various other nefarious crimes attributed to the white eunuchs, but later they regained some favour.\n\nDuring the Sultanate of Women (\"Kadınlar Sultanati\"), eunuchs increased their political leverage by taking advantage of minor or mentally incompetent sultans. Teenage Sultans were \"guided\" by regencies formed by the Queen Mother (\"Valide Sultan\"), the Grand Vizier and the Valide's other supporters- and the Chief Black Eunuch was the Queen Mother's and Chief Consorts' intimate and valued accomplice.\n\nThe Ottoman harem was often called \"the golden cage\". After Ahmed I's reformation of the law of succession to Ottoman throne and decline of \"sancağa çıkma\" (system of appointing young princes as provincial governors to train them in how to rule), princes were confined the \"kafes\", (cage, also the Şimşirlik, Boxwood Quarters) in Topkapı Palace. They lived here in seclusion until they either acceded to the throne or were executed in order to prevent a war of succession.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses PTR records. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the arpa top-level domain.\n\nAlthough the informational RFC 1912 (Section 2.1) recommends that \"every Internet-reachable host should have a name\" and that \"for every IP address, there should be a matching PTR record,\" it is not an Internet Standard requirement, and not all IP addresses have a reverse entry.\n\nThe modern \"reverse DNS lookup\" should not be confused with the now-obsolete \"inverse query\" (IQUERY) mechanism specified in RFC 1035:\nThe IQUERY message type was always \"optional\" and \"never achieved widespread use\"; it was \"permanently retired\" in 2002 with the adoption of RFC 3425.\n\nReverse DNS lookups for IPv4 addresses use the special domain codice_1. In this domain, an IPv4 address is represented as a concatenated sequence of four decimal numbers, separated by dots, to which is appended the second level domain suffix codice_2. The four decimal numbers are obtained by splitting the 32-bit IPv4 address into four octets and converting each octet into a decimal number. These decimal numbers are then concatenated in the order: least significant octet first (leftmost), to most significant octet last (rightmost). It is important to note that this is the reverse order to the usual dotted-decimal convention for writing IPv4 addresses in textual form.\n\nFor example, to do a reverse lookup of the IP address the PTR record for the domain name codice_3 would be looked up, and found to point to codice_4. \n\nIf the A record for codice_4 in turn pointed back to then it would be said to be forward-confirmed.\n\nHistorically, Internet registries and Internet service providers allocated IP addresses in blocks of 256 (for Class C) or larger octet-based blocks for classes B and A. By definition, each block fell upon an octet boundary. The structure of the reverse DNS domain was based on this definition. However, with the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing, IP addresses were allocated in much smaller blocks, and hence the original design of pointer records was impractical, since autonomy of administration of smaller blocks could not be granted. RFC 2317 devised a methodology to address this problem by using CNAME records.\n\nReverse DNS lookups for IPv6 addresses use the special domain codice_6 (previously codice_7). An IPv6 address appears as a name in this domain as a sequence of nibbles in reverse order, represented as hexadecimal digits as subdomains. For example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address is codice_8.\n\nWhile most rDNS entries only have one PTR record, DNS does not restrict the number. Multiple PTR records are used, for example, when a web server supports many virtual hosts i.e. multiple hostnames then resolve to a single address, and multiple hostnames will be returned for a PTR lookup for that shared address. However, DNS lookups typically occur over UDP, and since UDP has a limited message size, in extreme cases, multiple PTRs could cause a DNS response to exceed those UDP limits.\n\nRecord types other than PTR records may also appear in the reverse DNS tree. For example, encryption keys may be placed there for IPsec, SSH and IKE. DNS-Based Service Discovery uses specially-named records in the reverse DNS tree to provide hints to clients about subnet-specific service discovery domains. Less standardized usages include comments placed in TXT records and LOC records to identify the geophysical location of an IP address.\n\nThe most common uses of the reverse DNS include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "983398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=983398", "title": "Road Warrior Animal", "text": "Road Warrior Animal\n\nJoseph Michael Laurinaitis (born September 12, 1960) is an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Road Warrior Animal (or simply Animal). Along with Road Warrior Hawk, he was one-half of the tag team The Road Warriors/The Legion of Doom. Also a sporadic singles competitor, he headlined the 2001 WCW pay-per-view event Sin, in contention for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHe is also known for his work in the WWF/E, where he is a three-time tag team champion. He was inducted with Hawk into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nLaurinaitis grew up in Minnesota, having to work for a living from a very early age. He attended Irondale High School. Because of his size and love of power lifting, Laurinaitis was an imposing figure and thus a very effective bouncer. He worked as a bouncer at Grandma B's in the Twin Cities where he caught the eye of Eddie Sharkey, a well-known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Laurinaitis and Mike Hegstrand, Richard Rood, and Barry Darsow could make it big in professional wrestling, and trained all four of them.\n\nLaurinaitis made his debut in November 1982, competing as The Road Warrior using a biker gimmick. After only a few matches as a singles competitor, Joe's career and life would change thanks to an idea by Paul Ellering.\n\nWhen Paul Ellering was looking to put together a stable of heels in Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) called \"The Legion of Doom\", it was decided to put Laurinaitis together with his good friend Mike Hegstrand and change their names to \"Animal\" and \"Hawk\" respectively. Thus, the Road Warriors were born. They first started out as biker gimmicks; on The Road Warriors DVD, Animal said he felt like one of the Village People. To look more intimidating, the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, spiked shoulder pads, and face paint. The look and name were taken from \"The Road Warrior\", helping to paint the two as no-mercy monsters. Their interview style was vicious, yet charismatic and a bit humorous.\n\nThe team was an instant hit, revolutionizing the tag-team scene with their power moves, no mercy attitudes, and innovative face paint that would spawn many future imitators in wrestling. In Georgia, they won the NWA National Tag Team Championship four times before moving on to bigger promotions, such as the American Wrestling Association in the US and All Japan Pro Wrestling, winning more tag team titles.\n\nTheir hard hitting style, no nonsense attitude, and winning ways made the Road Warriors fan favorites. Even when they were booked as heels, the fans refused to boo them. They started to split their time between the AWA and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) until finally leaving the AWA for big money contracts with the NWA and a huge push for the monster duo. The move paid off instantly as they won the inaugural Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament and feuded with the top stars of the NWA such as The Four Horsemen and The Russian Team (which included the Road Warriors' old training buddy Barry Darsow). During their initial run in the NWA, they helped popularize the WarGames match, the Scaffold match, and their trademark Chicago Street Fight.\n\nIn 1988, the Road Warriors engaged in a violent feud with The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) the first team that could truly match the Road Warriors in power (and who were one of the most well known Road Warrior clones). The Powers of Pain even went so far as to injure Animal's eye (kayfabe) during a weightlifting competition. When Animal returned, he initially wore a hockey goalie mask to protect his eye. The angle abruptly ended when the Powers of Pain left the NWA after finding out they were booked against the Road Warriors in a series of Scaffold Matches and they did not want to get hurt by falling off the scaffold.\n\nNear the end of 1988, the Road Warriors captured the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Midnight Express whom they mauled in short order to win the titles. After being the \"Uncrowned champions\" for a long time the Road Warriors' run with the tag team titles was short lived. Teddy Long used a fast count to cheat the Road Warriors out of their titles. In their last year with the NWA, the Warriors feuded mainly with The Varsity Club, The Samoan Swat Team, and The Skyscrapers before leaving the NWA in the summer of 1990, due to conflicts with Jim Herd.\n\nThe Road Warriors immediately signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1990 and were pushed into a feud with the most famous of all \"Road Warrior Clones\", Demolition, a group which included their old training partner Barry Darsow. Due to the ailing health of one of Demolition (Ax) he was replaced by Crush but the magic of the original Demolition was gone and the feud did not live up to the high hopes of the fans.\n\nJust over a year after signing with the WWF, the Legion of Doom won the WWF Tag Team Championship and held it for about eight months. When they lost the titles, they briefly left the WWF, only to return with longtime manager Paul Ellering by their side, as well as a wooden ventriloquist dummy called \"Rocco\". Both members of the L.O.D. thought the Rocco gimmick was stupid, and it led to Hegstrand walking out of the WWF immediately following SummerSlam 1992, leaving Laurinaitis on his own for the first time in nine years. Animal went ahead and finished his contractual obligations with the WWF, as a singles wrestler and occasionally teaming with former rival Crush, formerly of Demolition. During a handicap match in Japan against the Beverly Brothers in September 1992, Laurinaitis legitimately injured his back from a botched double suplex and had to take a lengthy hiatus. His last match was a victory over Papa Shango in San Francisco, California on October 16. After this his back was too injured to allow him to wrestle.\n\nLaurinaitis made some non-wrestling appearances in WCW in 1993. On August 18, at the Clash of the Champions, Animal made his appearance, getting out of a black Camaro Z28 indicating his partner Hawk was Dustin Rhodes' mystery partner against Rick Rude and The Equalizer. On September 19, at Fall Brawl, Animal was the advisor for Sting's team, consisting of Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster for WarGames, defeating Big Van Vader, Sid Vicious, and Harlem Heat. On January 4, 1995, Animal seconded Hawk in his match against Scott Norton in New Japan Pro Wrestling's annual Tokyo Dome show.\n\nFor the next couple of years, Laurinaitis stayed out of the wrestling ring, collecting on an insurance policy from Lloyd's of London while Hegstrand competed all over the world. Near the end of 1995, Laurinaitis' back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition. Three years after everyone thought the Road Warriors had ended, they reunited and signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling. Upon their return in January 1996, they immediately started a feud with the Steiner Brothers, who returned in March, and Harlem Heat, before moving on to challenge the WCW Tag Team Champions Sting and Lex Luger. The Road Warriors had several shots at the champions but never won the title in the six months they were with the company. The Steiner Brothers also arrived shortly after the Warriors did, and feuded with them to try to prove who the best team of all time was. The Steiners got the better of the feud and the Warriors left WCW in June 1996.\n\nAfter leaving WCW they returned to the WWF where the Legion of Doom took part in the Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. the Hart Foundation feud, siding with Austin against the Harts. The Legion of Doom also became two-time tag team champions on October 7, 1997, when they defeated The Godwinns. In November 1997, the Legion of Doom faced the newly formed New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and lost the titles to the upstart team.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful challenges the L.O.D. were repackaged as Legion of Doom 2000 with manager Sunny, although she did not stay with the team for long. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with D.O.A., whom L.O.D. were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the Road Warriors DVD that it was hard for Ellering to work with another team against the Road Warriors and difficult to rip on his former team on promos.\n\nIn 1998, the Legion of Doom became involved in their most controversial angle; playing off Hegstrand's real life drug and alcohol problems. Hawk started to show up drunk or \"unable to perform\" on TV. As Hawk proved more and more erratic and unreliable, a third L.O.D. member, Puke, was introduced to team with Animal while Hawk dealt with his personal issues. The storyline ended with accusations that Puke had been the \"enabler\" of Hawk's problems, exploiting them to take Hawk's place in the team. During the controversial segment, Hawk was shown to have fallen off the Titan Tron. Neither Hegstrand nor Laurinaitis approved of the WWF exploiting Hegstrand's personal problems, which caused them to subsequently leave the WWF.\n\nWhile the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nIn 2001 Animal landed a prominent position in WCW as the \"enforcer\" of the stable known as The Magnificent Seven with the objective to protect WCW World Champion Scott Steiner. The Magnificent Seven split up shortly before Vince McMahon purchased WCW; Animal's contract was not one of the contracts the WWF picked up.\n\nThe Road Warriors appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in late 2002-early 2003 as part of a group that opposed Vince Russo's faction Sports Entertainment Xtreme, but would only wrestle one actual match for the promotion.\n\nOn June 17, 2007, Road Warrior Animal returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the pay-per-view, Slammiversary, with Rick Steiner; he replaced Scott Steiner, who was out with an injury. They ended up losing to Team 3D.\n\nOn December 15, 2016, Animal returned to TNA for a guest appearance on the \"Impact Wrestling\" special, \"Total Nonstop Deletion\".\n\nAnimal and Hawk made a surprise appearance on RAW on May 12, 2003 when they took on Kane and Rob Van Dam for the World Tag Team Championship. Hawk would die five months later, on October 19, 2003.\n\nAnimal made a return to WWE on the July 14 episode of \"SmackDown!\" in 2005, where he was challenged by the then-WWE Tag Team Champions MNM to a title match at \"The Great American Bash\". Finding a new tag team partner in Heidenreich, Animal went on to defeat MNM for the titles, dedicating the win to Hawk by saying, \"Hawk, this one was for you, brother!\" The two would team up for a few months in a new chapter of the Legion of Doom, with Heidenreich adopting the L.O.D.'s shoulder pads, face paint, and mohawk haircut. However, this came to an end with Heidenreich's release from WWE on January 17, 2006.\n\nOn the March 3, 2006, episode of \"SmackDown!\", Animal teamed up with Matt Hardy to face MNM. After he and Hardy lost the match, Animal turned heel for the second time in his career by attacking and injuring Hardy's knee. Animal reasoned that he had realized that Hardy and Heidenreich were screw-ups and that Road Warrior Hawk was the only tag team legend and partner for him. After the heel turn, Animal, once again known simply as The Road Warrior, would drop many aspects of the well-known Road Warrior gimmick, losing the face paint, and shoulder pads. Animal's look at this time was similar to his old Road Warrior gimmick in the early 1980s he had prior to teaming up with Hawk. On the March 17 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Animal lost to Hardy in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. Animal was defeated by United States Champion Chris Benoit on the March 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\".\n\nIn his final WWE match, Animal defeated Paul Burchill on the May 6, 2006, episode of \"Velocity\". On June 26, 2006, Animal was released from his WWE contract.\n\nWWE announced on March 28, 2011, on \"WWE Raw\" that the Road Warriors would be inducted into the 2011 Hall of Fame. Animal also spoke openly about his future induction on Right After Wrestling just minutes after the announcement on \"WWE Raw\". Animal told hosts, Arda Ocal and Jim Korderas that the WWE was going to create a physical Hall of Fame in Tampa and he was going to donate his trademarked 'spiked-shoulder pads' to that Hall.\n\nOn the July 20, 2012, episode of \"WWE SmackDown\" on Syfy, Animal returned to face Heath Slater in honor of \"Raw\"'s 1,000th episode. He went on to squash Slater. He then reappeared on the actual 1,000th episode on July 23 with other WWE Legends to help Lita take down Slater.\n\nIn 2011, Laurinaitis co-wrote an autobiography with William Andrew Wright titled \"The Road Warriors: Danger, Death, and the Rush of Wrestling\", published by Medallion Press, Inc. The book talks about the rise of The Road Warriors, shares funny stories of life on the road, and offers behind-the-scenes accounts of the wrestling industry.\n\nLaurinaitis and his former wife Julie, a former powerlifter and bodybuilder, have two children, son James (born 1986) and daughter Jessica (born 1989). Laurinaitis also has a son named Joseph (born 1981) from a previous marriage.\n\nLaurinaitis' brothers have both been involved in professional wrestling over the years. John Laurinaitis (Johnny Ace) is the former Executive Vice President of Talent Relations for World Wrestling Entertainment and a former wrestler. Marcus Laurinaitis is a former wrestler, mainly known as one half of the tag team \"The Wrecking Crew\" (Terminator / Fury).\n\nLaurinaitis' son, James Laurinaitis, played linebacker for the Ohio State University. As a sophomore, James won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, given to the best defensive player in the country, and was a finalist for the Butkus Award, which is awarded to the best linebacker in the country. In 2007, James won the Butkus Award. In fact, \"Sports Illustrated\" made a joke about borrowing his father's shoulder pads and later did an interview with him that included a picture of him wearing them. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the second round as the 35th overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, and played with the Rams through the team's final season in St. Louis in 2015, after which he moved to the New Orleans Saints.\n\nIn July 2016, Laurinaitis was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158871", "title": "Root directory", "text": "Root directory\n\nIn a computer file system, and primarily used in the Unix and Unix-like operating systems, the root directory is the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy. It can be likened to the trunk of a tree, as the starting point where all branches originate from. The root file system is the file system contained on the same disk partition on which the root directory is located; it is the filesystem on top of which all other file systems are mounted as the system boots up.\n\nTo use the example of a physical file cabinet, if the separate drawers in the file cabinet are represented as the highest level of sub-directories in the file system or system prompt, then the room the file cabinet is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most operating systems, files can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any file cabinet within the room.\n\nUnix abstracts the nature of this tree hierarchy entirely and in Unix and Unix-like systems the root directory is denoted by the codice_1 (slash) sign. Though the root directory is conventionally referred to as codice_1, the directory entry itself has no name its name is the \"empty\" part before the initial directory separator character (codice_1). All filesystem entries, including mounted filesystems are \"branches\" of this root.\n\nUnder DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, each partition has a drive letter assignment (labeled codice_4 for a particular partition C) and there is no common root directory above that. DOS, OS/2, and Windows do support more abstract hierarchies, with partitions mountable within a directory of another drive, though this is rarely seen. This has been possible in DOS through the command codice_5 since it first was added to DOS, and can be achieved in all Windows versions as well. In some contexts, it is also possible to refer to a root directory containing all mounted drives, although it cannot contain files directly as it does not exist on any file system. For instance, when linking to a local file using the \"file:\" URI scheme, the syntax is of the form \"codice_6\", where \"codice_7\" is the standard prefix, and the third 'codice_1' represents the root of the local system.\n\nIn UNIX-like operating systems, each process has its own idea of what the root directory is. For most processes this is the same as the system's actual root directory, but it can be changed by calling the chroot system call. This is typically done to create secluded environment to run software that requires legacy libraries and sometimes to simplify software installation and debugging. Chroot is not meant to be used for enhanced security as the processes inside can break out. FreeBSD offers a stronger jail() system call that enables operating-system-level virtualization and also serves security purposes to restrict which files a process may access to just a subset of the file system hierarchy.\n\nSome Unix systems support a directory below the root directory. Normally, \"/..\" points back to the same inode as \"/\", however, under , this can be changed to point to a super-root directory, where remote trees can be mounted. If, for example, two workstations \"pcs2a\" and \"pcs2b\" were connected via \"connectnodes\" and \"uunite\" startup script, \"/../pcs2b\" could be used to access the root directory of \"pcs2b\" from \"pcs2a\". \n\n\n\n\n"}

Though the title is Latin, the work itself is written in Old English. The ' is Wulfstan's most well-known work. In it, he blames a lack of moral discipline amongst his fellow English as the source of God's anger against the English, which has taken the shape of thirty years of Viking raids against England. Wulfstan exhorts the English to behave in a manner more pleasing to God, and specifically to live according to the laws of the Church and of the king. The ' is noted for its rhetorical achievements, and is considered to represent the height of Wulfstan's skill as a homilist and rhetor. The text of the ' has been critically edited many times, most recently by Dorothy Bethurum. The work contains one of several mentions of Old English ', a term cognate to the Old Norse \"\"—valkyries.\n\nWulfstan's past is obscure, though it is possible that he began his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk. We know that he became Bishop of London in 996, perhaps already aged nearly 50. In 1002 he was simultaneously promoted to Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York. He held both sees in plurality until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester. He remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was Bishop of London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, perhaps specifically on the topic of Antichrist.\n\nAs Archbishop of York, Wulfstan's administrative duties were considerable. In addition to tending the spiritual and financial needs of the religious and secular communities of the North of England, he was deeply involved in the vital politics of the South. He was one of the most important members of king Æthelred II's advisory council, known as the Witan, and as such was active in all the most significant political decisions of the day. By 1008 he had secured the privilege of drafting the official royal legislation promulgated by the king and the Witan. He was deeply concerned with legislation, holding that good laws were essential if a people were to prosper. He continued as the king's chief legal draftsman on into the reign of the Danish king Cnut the Great. It is both remarkable and puzzling that Wulfstan was able to play so central a role in politics under both Æthelred's and Cnut's reigns, especially as it was under Æthelred's reign that Wulfstan, in his \"Sermo Lupi\", so vehemently decried the depredations of the Danish and Norwegian Vikings.\n\nKing Æthelred II — nicknamed Æthelred 'The Unready' - ruled England from 978-1016. For virtually his entire reign, England was the object of successive Viking raids. Between the period of 980-1016, few areas of southern England remained unscathed as first Viking raiding parties, then entire Viking armies looted and ravaged the English countryside. Æthelred, roundly criticised by historians as ineffectual in the face of the Viking onslaught, was never able to mount a successful offense against the nimble Viking fleets, and his efforts to defend his kingdom against Viking armies were continually undermined. Æthelred and his advisors eventually adopted a policy of buying off the Viking armies with money. These enormous payments, known as Danegeld, had to be levied against English landowners and citizens, and this had a devastating impact on the English economy. Together, the Viking raids and the Danegeld payments brought the English people to their knees. But the Viking assaults continued. Few Englishmen during this time would have seen any reason to be optimistic about his own future or that of his countrymen. The situation became desperate in 1013, when, despite Æthelred, a prominent leader of the Viking armies, Swein Forkbeard, managed to position himself as king of England. In response, Æthelred retreated to Normandy where he remained until Swein's death the following year, upon which he immediately negotiated his safe return to England and his reinstatement as king. It is of these events that one of the versions of the \"Sermo Lupi\" makes mention. Wulfstan's role in these events are unclear, though sentiments he expresses elsewhere in his writings suggest that he would have supported Æthelred's cause over any Dane's. Dorothy Whitelock writes that \"we have no evidence where Wulfstan was at the time of the submission [of England to Swein], but he was at York within a fortnight of [Swegn's] death, and we may suspect that he used his influence to win back the province to the English king Æthelred.\"\n\nThough Wulfstan's name is never directly attached to the \"'Sermo Lupi\", there is no question of Wulfstan's authorship. The text of the \"Sermo Lupi\" has survived in five manuscripts, a number of which associate the homily with Wulfstan's \"nom de plume\", \"Lupus\". The five manuscripts represent the text in three versions, one shorter and two longer. It is generally accepted that the shorter version is the original, and that one of the longer versions is a later authorial revision; that is, Wulfstan composed the homily, then later re-worked and expanded it. These versions thus provide an opportunity to study the practices of an Old English writer as he revises his own work.\n\nThe longer version, which Wulfstan probably revised himself, exists in a manuscript known to have been annotated and worked over by the archbishop; in fact, there are many corrections to the \"Sermo Lupi\" in this manuscript which were carried out by Wulfstan's own pen. The rubric, or title, for the \"Sermo Lupi\" in this manuscript reads: \"Sermo Lupi ad Anglos quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos, quod fuit anno millesimo XIIII ab incarnatione Domini nostri Iesu Cristi\", 'The sermon of the Wolf to the English at the time when the Danes [Vikings] harried them, which was in the 1014th year from the birth of Jesus Christ.' Thus the date at which the revision was made was probably 1014. This was the year that Æthelred returned to England from Normandy and resumed his position as king of the English. It is also the year of a great royal council, at which Æthelred and his Witan published a new law code. There is good reason to associate these events with a special oral delivery of the \"Sermo Lupi\" by Wulfstan to the re-constituted English Witan. It seems significant that the \"Sermo Lupi\" specifically mentions Æthelred's exile, recalling it with regret.\n\nWulfstan not only abstractly discussed the correlation between the Viking invasions and the anger of God, but also explicitly stated the types of acts that God would find condemnable. In order to emphasize the severity of their situation, Wulfstan employed a variety of rhetorical techniques to elicit a sense of urgency (phrase repetition, metaphorical language, etc.). Rather than suggesting a unified stance against the Vikings, he implored his congregation/English population to abandon the behaviors of plundering, selling one another into slavery, betraying one's lord, buying women for sexual gratification, breaking religious and moral pledges, praising false gods, and a variety of other deplorable acts. Wulfstan, however, articulated that it was still possible to avoid the apocalypse/wrath of God, if they steered away from the devil and instead remain obedient and respectful to the Almighty.\n\nWulfstan attained a high degree of competence in rhetorical prose, working with a distinctive rhythmical system based around alliterative pairings. He used intensifying words, distinctive vocabulary and compounds, rhetorical figures, and repeated phrases as literary devices. These devices lend Wulfstan's homilies their tempo-driven, almost feverish quality, allowing them to build toward multiple climaxes. The genius of his style is based chiefly on sound and parallelsim. The passage below, taken from the \"Sermo Lupi\", employs numerous rhetorical devices, including alliteration, parallelism, tautology, and rhyme:\n\nThe \"Sermo Lupi\", as with all of Wulfstan's literary works, is known for its frequent, almost habitual, use of intensifying phrases. Examples from the passage above include \"oft & gelome\" \"often and frequently\" and \"swyþe þearle\" \"very terribly.\" Other intensifying phrases frequently used by Wulfstan, in the \"Sermo Lupi\" and in other of his works, are \"ealles to swyðe\" \"altogether too much\", \"georne\" \"eagerly\", \"mide rihte\" \"in right manner\", \"for Gode and for worulde\" \"for God and for world\", among others. Famously, Wulfstan often created long 'lists of sinners', wherein he joined a series terms (of compound words, and often used by no-one else) into groups using alliteration. One of the most famous examples is found in the \"Sermo Lupi\":\n\nA similar device is at work in his list of afflictions in the first passage given above (\"here & hunger, bryne & blodgyte ... stalu & cwalu, stric & steorfa, orfcwealm & uncoþu, hol & hete...\"). The \"Sermo Lupi\" is considered to excel particularly in the use of repetition as a rhetorical device . Other devices which have been noticed in Wulfstan's works are \"dubitatio\" and \"verborum exornatio\". His works are almost completely without metaphor and simile, and Wulfstan as a rule shies away from narrative and descriptions of the particular. The \"Sermo Lupi\" is one of his only works where description (i.e. of the moral decline of the nation) plays a significant role.\n\nWulfstan's \"Sermo Lupi\" also employs the rhetorical device known as \"Ubi sunt\" (Latin, \"where are... ?\"), a common medieval literary refrain used \"to designate a mood or theme in literature of lament for the mutability of things.\" Though the refrain never properly arises in the \"Sermo Lupi\" (in English nor in Latin), the theme is nevertheless vigorously active as Wulfstan presents the cherished goods and virtues of the past as lost in the present due to the moral decline of Men and the world through time.\n\n\nIn the sermon, Wulfstan addresses the entire English nation and holds it accountable for the country's plight. A key element of Wulfstan's sermon was the connection he made between the initial Anglo-Saxon rulers of England (who drove out the Britons from the country) and the Danes who were currently plaguing the country. According to Gildas, the Britons had been defeated because they had sinned against God. God had therefore allowed them to be vanquished. Wulfstan warns his listeners to learn from the past, and not share the fate of the Britons.\n\nThe Sermon of the Wolf is one of many homilies that attribute the Viking raids to the anger of God. In understanding this text as part of Old English homilies that equated and analyzed physical events and natural processes with transcendental forces, modern audiences can observe Christian theology firmly manifesting itself in the psychology of the English population (a theology that most would have been unaware of only a few centuries earlier.) Inadvertently, such types of evocative speeches/texts presented the English as their own worst enemy, ultimately culminating in a passive response toward Viking conquests as they were not the source of their plagues. This attitude thus allowed the Danes to proceed further inland and form their own settlements in various regions.\n\nThe sermon has been regarded as \"an invaluable witness to the dismal state of affairs in Æthelred's reign\", as it is one of the only contemporary documents which describes the effects of the Viking invasions in the beginning of the eleventh century.\n\n\n\n"}

The book was released in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2000, and in United States release on 21 May 2001, where it became a New York Times Bestseller. Since its release, the book has sold more than nine million copies worldwide, been listed on the BBC's The Big Read, and in 2005 received a California Young Reader Medal.\n\nThe book's plot revolves around Alex Rider being secretly recruited into MI6 to investigate the Stormbreaker computer factory and stop a terrorist attack that will kill hundreds of thousands of British school children.\n\nA film adaptation, starring Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider, was released in 2006.\n\nThe book begins with Alex Rider learning that his uncle and guardian, Ian Rider, has been killed in a car crash. Unknown to Alex and his housekeeper, Jack Starbright, Ian's job as a banker was actually a cover for his role as an MI6 agent. Alex becomes suspicious upon being told that Ian had not been wearing his seat belt and discovering that Ian's office has been emptied out. He finds his uncle's car at a wrecking yard, and discovers that his uncle had been murdered, being shot several times. After a near escape from a car crusher, Alex is asked to visit Ian's former employers, ostensibly a bank called \"The Royal & General\". He breaks into Ian's office at the bank, discovering evidence of his uncle's double life before he is knocked out by a drugged dart.\n\nAfter waking up, Alex meets MI6 head Alan Blunt and his deputy, Mrs Tulip Jones. They reveal the truth about his uncle's job, and explain that they had sent Ian to investigate Herod Sayle, a wealthy Lebanese (Egyptian in American adaptations) businessman who has developed a revolutionary new computer, the Stormbreaker. Sayle plans to give a free Stormbreaker to every secondary school in the United Kingdom, accompanied by a grand activation ceremony in the Science Museum, supposedly as a gesture of thanks for the country taking him in when he was a child, after a wealthy American couple sent him to England after he saved their lives in Olive Street. In his last communication with them, Ian had warned MI6 that the Stormbreakers could not be allowed to leave Sayle's manufacturing plant, but before he could explain, he was assassinated by Yassen Gregorovich, a professional killer supposedly working for Sayle, on the return to London.\n\nIntending to use him to covertly investigate Sayle, MI6 recruits Alex by essentially blackmailing him; if he does not co-operate, Jack will be deported back to America, his house will be sold and he will leave his school and friends for an institute until he is of age. They put him through a gruelling eleven-day long stint at an SAS training camp (which MI6 also uses), before deploying him to Herod Sayle's base in Cornwall, using the alias of another boy, Felix Lester, who won a competition to visit the plant and be the first child to use a Stormbreaker. To aid him in his mission, Alex is given a grappling hook disguised as a yo-yo, acne cream capable of dissolving metal, and a Nintendo Gameboy which functions as a transmitter, smoke screen, surveillance camera and microphone and bug detector, by MI6 agent Smithers.\n\nSayle shows Alex around his mock-Victorian mansion, which houses a large jellyfish aquarium containing a giant Portuguese Man o' War, located in his office. Alex also meets Mr. Grin, a butler and henchman whose name derives from his time as a circus performer, catching knives with his teeth. An accident in his hometown left him without a tongue and two large scars, which give him the appearance of constant smiling.\n\nInitially the trip goes well, with Alex finding a cryptic diagram made by his Uncle Ian in the canopy of his four-poster bed. However, Sayle grows to dislike Alex, firstly after Alex is discovered in a restricted area of the base, and later when Alex defeats Sayle in a game of snooker. While investigating the base at night, Alex sees several of Sayle's agents unloading metal cases with great care from a Chinese nuclear submarine at the local port, with Yassen supervising. When one of the agents drops a metal case, he is promptly shot dead by Yassen. The next afternoon, Alex decides to visit Port Tallon, the nearby village, but finds himself attacked by a pair of armed guards on quad bikes. He survives by tricking the guards into crashing: one collides with an electric fence while the other falls from a cliff face.\n\nWhile searching the library, Alex finds a map in a book about tin mining which matches the diagram left by Ian, discovering that Sayle's land once belonged to Sir Rupert Dozmary, a tin-mining magnate. He also learns that Ian had borrowed several books about viruses, and assumes that Sayle plans to use the Stormbreaker network to release a computer virus into Britain's computer infrastructure. Alex investigates the Dozmary mine and, following the path left by his uncle, discovers a large computer manufacturing facility, where the Stormbreaker computers are being filled with a strange fluid. Alex realises that the 'viruses' being investigated by Ian were not computer viruses, but biological weapons. Alex is detected, and nearly escapes but is eventually caught and tranquilised. When he comes to, Sayle explains to Alex his plan.\n\nWhen Sayle attended school, he was bullied because of his accent and skin colour. The worst bully was none other than the future Prime Minister, leading him to despise English children, and all of Britain in general. As a result, Sayle plans to take revenge on the Prime Minister and Britain with his \"April Fools Joke\"; when the computers are activated by the Prime Minister, the virus, a potent, nearly unstoppable strain of smallpox, will be released into every school in the country, killing every schoolchild and teacher in England as well as those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nAlex is then left handcuffed to a chair, until Nadia Vole, an assistant of Sayle's, frees him, claiming that she is a fellow spy who worked with Ian Rider. However, as they head to find a mobile phone to call MI6 and inform them of Sayle's plan, she triggers a trapdoor which drops Alex into the jellyfish tank and stays behind to watch him die. Alex eventually gets free by using the acne cream gadget to damage the tank's supporting iron girders, causing it to rupture and sending thousands of gallons of water crashing into the room. Unfortunately for Vole, she was directly in front of the tank when it burst, releasing the immense jellyfish and causing it to land right on her, killing her painfully and instantly. Snatching up a harpoon gun, Alex rushes outside to find that Sayle's private helicopter has already left, leaving only a cargo plane on the tarmac. Using the handle of the harpoon gun, Alex knocks out a guard, taking his jeep and pistol. As he starts the jeep, several other jeeps start to pursue him as the cargo plane starts to take off. Through some fancy driving and good fortune, Alex manages to cause the destruction of the hostile jeeps. Tying the nylon cord of the yo-yo gadget to the harpoon with the yo-yo clipped to his belt, Alex shoots the harpoon which catches on the underbelly of the airborne plane. Using the gadget, he gets himself on to the plane where he confronts the pilot, who is none other than Mr. Grin. Alex instructs Mr. Grin to fly to London by threatening him with the pistol.\n\nWhen they are finally over London, Alex realises that there is not much time left before noon. He spots several parachutes and uses one to jump off the plane. Mr. Grin turns the plane around hoping to ram into Alex. Alex pulls out the Game Boy Color and activates a cartridge disguised as a game called \"Bomber Boy\", which activates a smoke bomb that he left on the plane. Unable to see, Mr. Grin loses control of the plane and fatally crashes into a dock near the River Thames. Alex crashes through the roof of the Science Museum and dangles from his parachute which had gotten caught on a beam. Alex draws the gun he took from a guard back at Sayle's mansion and fires blindly at the Stormbreaker computer, one accidentally hitting the Prime Minister and Sayle himself being struck by two more, though he inexplicably vanishes. Mrs. Jones saves Alex's life by ordering security not to open fire on him. MI6 immediately recalls all the computers, citing \"safety issues\".\n\nLater, after a debriefing by Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones, Alex enters a taxi. The driver is in fact Sayle who holds Alex at gunpoint. He leads Alex to the top of a building where he is about to shoot Alex, but is himself shot by Yassen Gregorovich, who lands in a helicopter. When Alex questions Yassen about why he shot Sayle, Yassen explains that Sayle had \"become an embarrassment to the people he (Yassen) works for\", so he had to be eliminated. Knowing that he is facing his uncle's killer, Alex tells Yassen he will one day kill him, but Yassen brushes aside the comment and tells Alex to drop the spy business and become a normal schoolboy again, before leaving in the helicopter.\n\nCritical reception for \"Stormbreaker\" was mixed to positive, with the book being placed on multiple ALA lists. Commonsensemedia praised \"Stormbreaker\" for its action sequences, but criticised its dialogue and logic. Kirkus Reviews also commented that the book's plot was \"preposterous\" but stated that the readers \"won't care\".\n\n\nIn 2005 a graphic novel adaptation of \"Stormbreaker\" was released in the United Kingdom and the United States. The graphic novel was an adaptation of the screenplay written for the movie released the same year, and was intended as a tie-in for the film.\n\nIn 2006 a film adaptation of \"Stormbreaker\" was released to theatres starring Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider and Geoffrey Sax directing. Critical reception for the film was average, with \"Stormbreaker\" holding only a 33% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus being that the film was \"strictly children's fare, as it lacks originality, excitement, and believabiltity\".\n\nA video game adaptation of the film was released in 2006 under the name of for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. The game received mixed reviews, with IGN criticising the game and giving it a rating of 4/10.\n\n"}
