It was published in July 2009 by Oxford University Press. The book tells the history of popular music from the introduction of the long-playing (LP) record in 1948. It focuses on key albums, from the Folkways compilation \"Anthology of American Folk Music\" (1952) to the White Stripes' \"Elephant\" (2003).\n\nChris Smith previous wrote about music and popular culture for \"Rolling Stone\", \"Billboard\" and MTV, among others, and authored \"The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History\", published by Greenwood Press in 2006. In \"101 Albums That Changed Popular Music\", he focuses on albums and their impact on the cultural landscape, as opposed to songs and musical performance. In the book's preface, he says that, rather than looking to compile a list of the \"best\" albums, the criteria for inclusion was a combination of an album's sales performance and influence on American music and culture, together with the level of critical commentary it had inspired. He says that artists such as Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and Hank Williams, and many pioneers in the blues genre are necessarily excluded, since their most influential work was either confined to 78rpm singles or achieved through live performance.\n\nIn Smith's opinion, Miles Davis is \"the most revolutionary artist\" in the book, while the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967) is the album that most clearly satisfies the three criteria for inclusion. He comments that the featured albums show artistic ambition and influence in the areas of, variously, technological experimentation, mixing musical genres, presentation of alternate realities, and commentary on contemporaneous music – the latter being demonstrated especially by the Mothers of Invention's \"Freak Out!\" (1966), which ridiculed \"both the status quo and the counterculture\".\n\nThe book includes a timeline of key events in the history of recorded sound and divides the main discussion into seven chapters, starting with \"The Birth of the Long Player, 1952–1962\". The other six chapters cover the periods 1963–1967, 1968–1971, 1972–1976, 1977–1985, 1986–1990 and 1991–2008. Each of the featured albums is afforded two or three pages of text. Smith also includes appendices titled \"Ten Albums That Almost Made It\" and \"Ten Important Producers\". In the first of these, he comments that his omission of the Beatles' \"Revolver\" (1966) from the main body of the book is \"somewhat unfair\".\n\nThe following artists have albums featured in \"101 Albums That Changed Popular Music\":\n\n\nIn addition, the \"Ten Albums That Almost Made It\" appendix contains works by Ornette Coleman, James Brown, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, the Eagles, Pink Floyd, the Police, U2 and Alanis Morissette.\n\nEric Weisbard, the co-editor of \"Spin\" magazine's \"Alternative Record Guide\" and an organizer of the Experience Music Project conferences, wrote that, just as albums are \"structures of order, turning songs, an inherently ersatz form, into statements\", Smith's book \"albums the album, compiling the 'statement' works that prevailed in jazz, folk, and two generations of rock into a single package\". The \"Financial Times\" described Smith's \"101 Albums\" as a \"diverting\" work that was \"an upmarket version of the best-of lists that rock fans love to argue over\". \"Express Milwaukee\"s reviewer wrote: \"Well argued, Smith compiles a history of rock that is generally correct and identifies such important trends as the fertile interplay between the Beatles and Dylan, the transmogrification of communal '60s folk-rock into me-only '70s singer-songwriter and the punk's reaction against hippy hypocrisy and pompous arena rock.\"\n\nIn his review for \"The Independent\", Christopher Hirst admired Smith's writing and choice of suitable quotes. He said the inclusion of early albums such as \"Elvis Presley\" (1956), \"Muddy Waters at Newport\" (1960) and \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" (1963) was logical, but \"sometimes the wrong record is picked by the right artist\" in the case of the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\" (1965) and Davis' \"Bitches Brew\" (1970), which were chosen over \"Revolver\" and \"In a Silent Way\" (1969), respectively. Hirst also found the inclusion of \"Boston\" (1976) and \"Van Halen\" (1978) \"inexplicable\" and bemoaned the absence of Neil Young's \"After the Goldrush\" (1970) and the Allman Brothers Band's \"At Fillmore East\" (1971).<ref name=\"Hirst/Independent\"></ref> Douglas Lord, in a review for \"Library Journal\", said the coverage and detail was impressive and that the author \"prov[es] a consummate music critic/historian\". Lord also approved of the recognition afforded Television's \"Marquee Moon\" (1977), Metallica's \"Kill 'Em All\" (1983) and Public Enemy's \"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\" (1988), alongside the expected \"classics\" from the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"Lord/Library\"></ref>\n\nThe website for the JW Pepper sheet music company describes the book as \"A lively and provocative account\" that \"tells the fascinating stories behind the most groundbreaking, influential, and often controversial albums ever recorded\".\n"}

It highlights one of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule, that is contracts that are partly written, and partly oral contracts.\n\nThompson ordered a grain dryer to be installed by A M Bisley on his crop farm so he could harvest his grain crops early.\n\nIn the written contract, the \"estimated delivery date\" was a vague \"ASAP\", however, it had been orally promised to be installed by the next harvest. However, A M Bisley ordered the grain dryer from an overseas manufacturer late, resulting in the grain dryer not being fully installed on Thompson's farm in time.\n\nThis unfortunately left Thompson unable to harvest his barley crop early when a storm destroyed his crop.\n\nAs a result of this, Thompson refused to pay Bisley for the grain dryer.\n\nBisley ultimately sued him for the cost of the grain dryer, and Thompson filed a counterclaim for breach of contract for the loss of his barley crop.\n\nThe District Court ruled in favour of both claims, meaning that Thompson did not have to pay Bisley's for the grain dryer.\n\nBoth parties appealed.\n\nThe Court of appeal dismissed both the appeals.\n"}

Instead, he found archives describing the fates of thousands of Latin Americans who had been secretly kidnapped, tortured, and killed by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay with cooperation of the CIA. This was known as Operation Condor.\n\nThe \"terror archives\" listed 50,000 people murdered, 30,000 people disappeared and 400,000 people imprisoned. They also revealed that other countries such as Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela cooperated, to various degrees, by providing intelligence information that had been requested by the security services of the Southern Cone countries. Some of these countries have used portions of the archives, now in Asunción's Palace of Justice, to prosecute former military officers. Much of the case built against General Pinochet by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón was made using those archives. Almada, himself a victim of Condor, was twice interviewed by Baltasar Garzón. \n\n\"[The documents] are a mountain of ignominy, of lies, which Stroessner [Paraguay's dictator until 1989] used for 40 years to blackmail the Paraguayan people,\" states Almada. He wants the UNESCO to list the \"terror archives\" as an international cultural site, as this would greatly facilitate access to funding to preserve and protect the documents.\n\nIn May 2000, a UNESCO mission visited Asunción following a request from the Paraguayan authorities for help in putting these files on the Memory of the World Register, one element of a program aimed at safeguarding and promoting the documentary heritage of humanity to ensure that records are preserved and available for consultation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1081926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1081926", "title": "Child prostitution", "text": "Child prostitution\n\nChild prostitution is prostitution involving a child, and it is a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children. The term normally refers to prostitution of a minor, or person under the legal age of consent.\nIn most jurisdictions, child prostitution is illegal as part of general prohibition on prostitution.\n\nChild prostitution usually manifests in the form of sex trafficking, in which a child is kidnapped or duped into becoming involved in the sex trade, or \"survival sex\", in which the child engages in sexual activities to procure basic essentials such as food and shelter. Prostitution of children is commonly associated with child pornography, and they often overlap. Some people travel to foreign countries to engage in child sex tourism. Research suggests that there may be as many as 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide. The problem is most severe in South America and Asia, but prostitution of children exists globally, in undeveloped countries as well as developed. Most of the children involved with prostitution are girls, despite an increase in the number of young boys in the trade.\n\nThe United Nations has declared the prostitution of children to be illegal under international law, and various campaigns and organizations have been created to protest its existence.\n\n\"Most of the victimized children who face prostitution are vulnerable children who are exploited. Many predators target runaways, sexual assault victims, and children who have been harshly neglected by their biological parents. Not only have they faced traumatic violence that affects their physical being, but become intertwined into the violent life of prostitution.\" – U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole.\n\nSeveral definitions have been proposed for prostitution of children. The United Nations defines it as \"the act of engaging or offering the services of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person\". The Convention on the Rights of the Child's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography defines the practice as \"the act of obtaining, procuring or offering the services of a child or inducing a child to perform sexual acts for any form of compensation or reward\". Both emphasize that the child is a victim of exploitation, even if apparent consent is given. The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, (Convention No 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO) describes it as the \"use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution\".\n\nAccording to the International Labour Office in Geneva, prostitution of children and child pornography are two primary forms of child sexual exploitation, which often overlap. The former is sometimes used to describe the wider concept of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC). It excludes other identifiable manifestations of CSEC, such as commercial sexual exploitation through child marriage, domestic child labor, and the trafficking of children for sexual purposes.\n\nThe terminology applied to the practice is a subject of dispute. The United States Department of Justice states, \"The term itself implies the idea of choice, when in fact that is not the case.\" Groups that oppose the practice believe that the terms \"child prostitution\" and \"child prostitute\" carry problematic connotations because children are generally not expected to be able to make informed decisions about prostitution. As an alternative, they use the terms \"prostituted children\" and \"the commercial sexual exploitation of children\". Other groups use the term \"child sex worker\" to imply that the children are not always \"passive victims\".\n\nChildren are often forced by social structures and individual agents into situations in which adults take advantage of their vulnerability and sexually exploit and abuse them by selling them or selling their bodies. Structure and agency commonly combine to force a child into commercial sex: for example, the prostitution of a child frequently follows from prior sexual abuse, often in the child's home. Many believe that the majority of prostituted children are from Southeast Asia and the majority of their clients are Western sex tourists, but sociologist Louise Brown argues that, while Westerners contribute to the growth of the industry, most of the children's customers are Asian locals.\n\nProstitution of children usually occurs in environments such as brothels, bars and clubs, homes, or particular streets and areas (usually in socially run down places). According to one study, only about 10% of prostituted children have a pimp and over 45% entered the business through friends. Maureen Jaffe and Sonia Rosen from the International Child Labor Study Office write that cases vary widely: \"Some victims are runaways from home or State institutions, others are sold by their parents or forced or tricked into prostitution, and others are street children. Some are amateurs and others professionals. Although one tends to think first and foremost of young girls in the trade, there is an increase in the number of young boys involved in prostitution. The most disquieting cases are those children who are forced into the trade and then incarcerated. These children run the possible further risk of torture and subsequent death.\"\n\nHuman trafficking is defined by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as \"the recruitment, transport, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation\". The UNODC approximates the number of victims worldwide to be around 2.5 million. UNICEF reports that since 1982 about 30 million children have been trafficked. Trafficking for sexual slavery accounts for 79% of cases, with the majority of victims being female, of which an estimated 20% are children. Women are also often perpetrators as well.\n\nIn 2007 the UN founded United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT). In cooperation with UNICEF, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) the United Nations took a grant from the United Arab Emirates to establish UN.GIFT. UN.GIFT aims to fight human trafficking through a mutual support from its stakeholders which includes governments, businesses, and other large global actors. Their first initiative is to spread the word that human trafficking is immoral and has become a growing problem that it will take a global cooperation to cease its continuation. UN.GIFT strives to lower the demand for this exploitation and create a safe environment for potential victims.\n\nIn some cases, victims of sex trafficking are kidnapped by strangers, either by force or by being tricked into becoming involved through lies and false promises. In other cases, the children's families allow or force them to enter the industry as a result of severe poverty. In cases where they are taken out of the country, traffickers prey on the fact that the children are often unable to understand the language of their new location and are unaware of their legal rights.\n\nResearch indicates that traffickers have a preference for females age 12 and under because young children are more easily molded into the role assigned to them and because they are assumed to be virgins, which is valuable to consumers. The girls are then made to appear older, and documents are forged as protection against law enforcement. Victims tend to share similar backgrounds, often coming from communities with high crime rates and lack of access to education. However, victimology is not limited to this, and males and females coming from various backgrounds have become involved in sex trafficking.\n\nPsychotherapist Mary De Chesnay identifies five stages in the process of sex trafficking: vulnerability, recruitment, transportation, exploitation, and liberation. The final stage, De Chesnay writes, is rarely completed. Murder and accidental death rates are high, as are suicides, and very few trafficking victims are rescued or escape.\n\nSex trafficking is a lucrative business due to the low risk and high demand for its existence. The return of high profits acts as a primary incentive driving the spread of human trafficking. Today, most markets are operated online disguised as salon parlors making it harder to enforce sex trafficking laws. Examples are online escort services, residential brothels, brothels disguised as massage businesses or spas, many of which enslave children to their services.\n\nThe other primary form of prostitution of children is \"survival sex\". The US Department of Justice states:\n\nA study commissioned by UNICEF and Save the Children and headed by sociologist Annjanette Rosga conducted research on prostitution of children in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rosga reported that poverty was a strong contributing factor. She stated, \"The global sex trade is as much a product of everyday people struggling to survive in dire economic straits as it is an organized crime problem. Attacking the crime and not the poverty is treating the symptom but not the disease...It's not uncommon for girls to know what they're entering into, and to enter voluntarily to some degree. Maybe they think they'll be different and able to escape, or maybe they'd rather take the risk than feel powerless staying at home in poverty.\" Jaffe and Rosen disagree and argue that poverty alone does not often force children into prostitution, as it does not exist in a large scale in several impoverished societies. Rather, a number of external influences, such as poor family situations and domestic violence, factor into the problem.\n\nProstitution of children in the form of survival sex occurs in both undeveloped and developed countries. In Asia, underage girls sometimes work in brothels to support their families. In Sri Lanka, parents will more often have their sons prostitute themselves rather than their daughters, as the society places more weight on sexual purity among females than males. Jaffe and Rosen write that prostitution of children in North America often results from \"economic considerations, domestic violence and abuse, family disintegration and drug addiction\". In Canada, a young man was convicted of charges relating to the prostitution of a 15-year-old girl online in 2012; he had encouraged her to prostitute herself as a means of making money, kept all of her earnings, and threatened her with violence if she did not continue.\n\nProstituted children are often forced to work in hazardous environments without proper hygiene. They face threats of violence and are sometimes raped and beaten. Researchers Robin E. Clark, Judith Freeman Clark, and Christine A. Adamec write that they \"suffer a great deal of abuse, unhappiness, and poor health\" in general. For example, Derrick Jensen reports that female sex trafficking victims from Nepal are \"'broken in' through a process of rapes and beatings, and then rented out up to thirty-five times per night for one to two dollars per man\". Another example involved mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Lucknow, and Gorakhpur. One victim left Nepal at the age of 14 and was sold into slavery, locked up, beaten, starved, and forcibly circumcised. He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys, many of whom were castrated, before escaping and returning to Nepal.\n\nCriminologist Ronald Flowers writes that prostitution of children and child pornography are closely linked; up to one in three prostituted children have been involved in pornography, often through films or literature. Runaway teenagers, he states, are frequently used for \"porn flicks\" and photographs. In addition to pornography, Flowers writes that, \"Children caught up in this dual world of sexual exploitation are often victims of sexual assaults, sexual perversions, sexually transmitted diseases, and inescapable memories of sexual misuse and bodies that have been compromised, brutalized, and left forever tarnished.\"\n\nAccording to Humanium, an NGO that opposes the prostitution of children, the practice causes injuries such as \"vaginal tearing, physical after-effects of torture, pain, infection, or unwanted pregnancy\". As clients seldom take precautions against the spread of HIV, prostituted children face a high risk of contracting the disease, and the majority of them in certain locations contract it. Other sexually transmitted diseases pose a threat as well, such as syphilis and herpes. High levels of tuberculosis have also been found among prostituted children. These illnesses are often fatal.\n\nFormer prostituted children often deal with psychological trauma, including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Other psychological effects include anger, insomnia, sexual and personality confusion, inability to trust adults, and loss of confidence. Drug-related health problems included dental problems, hepatitis B and C, and serious liver and kidney problems. Other medical complications included reproductive problems and injuries from sexual assaults; physical and neurological problems from violent physical attacks; and other general health issues including respiratory problems and joint pains.\n\nProstitution of children is illegal under international law, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 34, states, \"the State shall protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, including prostitution and involvement in pornography.\" The convention was first held in 1989 and has been ratified by 193 countries. In 1990, the United Nations appointed a Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. Over at least the last decade, the international community has increasingly acknowledged the importance of addressing problems posed by the trafficking of children, child prostitution, and child pornography; activities that undermine the rights of children and are frequently linked to organized crime. While the legality of adult prostitution varies between different parts of the world, the prostitution of minors is illegal in most countries, and all countries have some form of restrictions against it.\n\nThere is a dispute surrounding what constitutes a prostituted child. International law defines a child as any individual below the age of 18, but a number of countries legally recognize lower ages of consent and adulthood, usually ranging from 13 to 17 years of age. Thus, law enforcement officers are sometimes hesitant to investigate cases because of the differences in age of consent. The laws of some countries do, however, distinguish between prostituted teenagers and prostituted children. For example, the Japanese government defines the category as referring to minors between 13 and 18.\n\nConsequences for offenders vary from country to country. In the People's Republic of China, all forms of prostitution are illegal, but having sexual contact with anyone under the age of 14, regardless of consent, will result in a more serious punishment than raping an adult. In the United States, the legal penalty for participating in the prostitution of children includes five to twenty years in prison. The FBI established \"Innocence Lost\", a new department working to free children from prostitution, in response to the strong public reaction across the country to the news of Operation Stormy Nights, in which 23 minors were released from forced prostitution.\n\nProstitution of children exists in every country, though the problem is most severe in South America and Asia. The number of prostituted children is rising in other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, and Europe. Exact statistics are difficult to obtain, but it is estimated that there are around 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide.\n\nBy 1999, it was reported that in Argentina prostitution of children was increasing at an alarming rate and that the average age was decreasing. The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) fact book says Argentina is one of the favored destinations of pedophile sex tourists from Europe and the United States. Argentina's Criminal Code criminalizes the prostitution of minors of eighteen years of age or younger, but it only sanctions those who \"promote or facilitate\" prostitution, not the client who exploits the minor.\n\nAnthropologist Heather Montgomery writes that society has a largely negative perception of prostitution of children, in part because the children are often viewed as having been abandoned or sold by their parents and families. The International Labour Organization includes the prostitution of children in its list of the \"worst forms of child labour\". At the 1996 World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children it was called \"a crime against humanity\", \"torture\", and \"slavery\". Virginia Kendall, a district judge and expert on child exploitation and human trafficking, and T. Markus Funk, an attorney and law professor, write that the subject is an emotional one and that there are various perspectives about its prevention:\n\nInvestigative journalist Julian Sher states that widespread stereotypes about the prostitution of children continued into the 1990s, when the first organized opposition arose and police officers began working to dispel common misconceptions. Criminologist Roger Matthews writes that concerns over pedophilia and child sexual abuse, as well as shifting perceptions of youth, led the public to see a sharp difference between prostitution of children and adult prostitution. While the latter is generally frowned upon, the former is seen as intolerable. Additionally, he states, children are increasingly viewed as \"innocent\" and \"pure\" and their prostitution as paramount to slavery. Through the shift in attitude, the public began to see minors involved in the sex trade as victims rather than as perpetrators of a crime, needing rehabilitation rather than punishment.\n\nThough campaigns against prostitution of children originated in the 1800s, the first mass protests against the practice occurred in the 1990s in the United States, led largely by ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism). The group, which historian Junius P. Rodriguez describes as \"the most significant of the campaigning groups against child prostitution\", originally focused on the issue of children being exploited in Southeast Asia by Western tourists. Women's rights groups and anti-tourism groups joined to protest the practice of sex tourism in Bangkok, Thailand. The opposition to sex tourism was spurred on by an image of a Thai youth in prostitution, published in \"Time\" and by the publication of a dictionary in the United Kingdom describing Bangkok as \"a place where there are a lot of prostitutes\". Cultural anthropologists Susan Dewey and Patty Kelly write that though they were unable to inhibit sex tourism and rates of prostitution of children continued to rise, the groups \"galvanized public opinion nationally and internationally\" and succeeded in getting the media to cover the topic extensively for the first time. ECPAT later expanded its focus to protest child prostitution globally.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the creation of a number of shelters and rehabilitation programs for prostituted children, and the police began to actively investigate the issue. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) was later established by the Polaris Project as a national, toll-free hotline, available to answer calls from anywhere in the United States, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year. Operated by Polaris Project, the hotline was designed to allow callers to report tips and receive information on human trafficking.\n\nThe opposition to prostitution of children and sexual slavery spread to Europe and elsewhere, and organizations pushed for prostituted children to be recognized as victims rather than offenders. The issue remained prominent in the following years, and various campaigns and organizations continued into the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nProstitution of children dates to antiquity. Prepubescent boys were commonly prostituted in brothels in ancient Greece and Rome. According to Ronald Flowers, the \"most beautiful and highest born Egyptian maidens were forced into prostitution...and they continued as prostitutes until their first menstruation.\" Chinese and Indian children were commonly sold by their parents into prostitution. Parents in India sometimes dedicated their female children to the Hindu temples, where they became \"devadasis\". Traditionally a high status in society, the devadasis were originally tasked with maintaining and cleaning the temples of the Hindu deity to which they were assigned (usually the goddess Renuka) and learning skills such as music and dancing. However, as the system evolved, their role became that of a temple prostitute, and the girls, who were \"dedicated\" before puberty, were required to prostitute themselves to upper class men. The practice has since been outlawed but still exists.\n\nIn Europe, child prostitution flourished until the late 1800s; minors accounted for 50% of individuals involved in prostitution in Paris. A scandal in 19th-century England caused the government there to raise the age of consent. In July 1885, William Thomas Stead, editor of \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", published \"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\", four articles describing an extensive underground sex trafficking ring that reportedly sold children to adults. Stead's reports focused on a 13-year-old girl, Eliza Armstrong, who was sold for £5 (the equivalent of around £500 in 2012), then taken to a midwife to have her virginity verified. The age of consent was raised from 13 to 16 within a week of publication. During this period, the term \"white slavery\" came to be used throughout Europe and the United States to describe prostituted children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3989604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3989604", "title": "Cohabitation agreement", "text": "Cohabitation agreement\n\nA cohabitation agreement is a form of legal agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together (whether they are heterosexual or homosexual). In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a married couple, such as when applying for a mortgage or working out child support. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, pensions and inheritance, they are treated differently.\n\nA cohabitation agreement contains documentation for a couple who want to live together in order to protect themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with debt, caring for children, etc.\n\nThe agreement also, much like a prenuptial agreement, allows the individuals concerned to determine in advance who will keep specific assets and what will happen to assets that have been purchased jointly if they separate. This agreement is intended to bind both parties.\n\nIn the United States, about 15 million couples qualify as cohabiting. A cohabitation agreement can give each party an idea of the expectations of the relationship with the legal enforceability to protect against financial ruin or the loss of support that was promised. It is a good idea in that if the couple does break up, an altercation about who receives what may be less likely. However, the courts may occasionally change or ignore provisions set out in a cohabitation agreement if they feel that they are inadequate under the circumstances.\n\nCohabitation agreements are not considered to be legally binding in the United Kingdom.\n\nA cohabitation agreement will usually not be adequate to settle all legal issues that might arise, so a trust deed setting out property rights and a will are also recommended.\n\nIt is a common misconception that there is a doctrine of \"Common Law marriage\" in English law. That is to say that without having married, there is no automatic right to home ownership, even if the home is shared for a long time. Instead, the only way in which ownership can be obtained is through ordinary trust law. Even if the parties are legally married, there is still no automatic right to home ownership. Instead, any transfer of ownership will be at the discretion of the court when exercising their power under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.\n\nIn Canada, each province has legislation which governs the creation of cohabitation agreements. In the Province of Ontario there are restrictions on what can be included in such agreements. For example, clauses requiring chastity are unenforceable. Provisions which pre-determine issues of child custody and access as well as child support may be disregarded by a court As well, in Canada, for a cohabitation agreement to be valid, it must be signed, witnessed, and accompanied by financial disclosure.\n\nSome gay activists have been campaigning for legal recognition of their partnerships. Their campaigning for the right to take over a partner's tenancy of the family home on bereavement have been gained, regardless of any cohabitation agreement existing, but if a couple share a home their chances of buying the rights are much more limited.\n\nIn December 2005, the British government offered gay couples equal rights with married couples if they register a civil partnership legally. The government-backed scheme – which enables same-sex couples to qualify for next-of-kin entitlements on inheritance tax, pensions and property – is likely to attract many more couples.\n\nThere will still be large legal differences between civil partnership and marriage. For example, a couple can get married and have all the legal rights and benefits after knowing each other for only a few days, but a same-sex couple will almost certainly be required to show a lengthy commitment to each other before they are allowed to register their partnership. Currently, for immigration purposes, a same-sex couple must show they have a relationship of two years' standing, and it is likely that a similar term will be imposed for registering a partnership. Consequently, same-sex couples will need to make wills and a cohabitation agreement, to provide security in the event of break-up.\n\nIn the United States, a cohabitation agreement offers fewer legal protections than a registered domestic partnership.\nAs afore mentioned, the term is also sometimes used loosely to refer to prenuptial agreements. These are often designed when one intends to protect his or her wealth in the event of the marriage ending in divorce. The contract aims to achieve a measure of certainty about what the financial \"damage\" would be if the marriage came to an end. However \"K v K\" (2003) has heightened the importance of prenuptial agreements by deciding that the wife had to stick by the terms of a prenuptial agreement she signed. The courts still keep their discretion about whether or not a prenuptial agreement will be upheld but this new case shows that the courts are in favour of couples making private agreements between themselves.\n\n"}

The questions asked for “episodes” or “critical incidents” that surprised and confused members of culture B when they interacted with people from culture A. Student samples from the two cultures were asked to explain why the problem or confusion occurs. When the explanations given by the students from culture A were different from the explanations given by members from culture B, there was something to teach. For example, teachers from the U.S. are annoyed that pupils from Latin America do not look at them when they talk. Why is that? The explanation is that in the U. S. people usually pay attention to the speaker by looking at the speaker, but in Latin America it is “insolent” to look at a high status person in the eyes. One is supposed to look down.\n\n"}
{"id": "617973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617973", "title": "Domain name speculation", "text": "Domain name speculation\n\nDomain name speculation is the practice of identifying and registering or acquiring Internet domain names as an investment with the intent of selling them later for a profit.\n\nThe main targets of domain name speculation are generic words which can be valuable for type-in traffic and for the dominant position they would have in any field due to their descriptive nature. Hence generic words and phrases such as \"poker\", \"insurance\", \"travel\", \"creditcards\", \"loan\" and others are attractive targets of domain speculation in any top-level domain.\n\nThe speculative characteristics of domain names may be linked to news reports or current events. However, the effective period during which such opportunities exist may be limited. Quick turnaround in the resale of domains is often called \"domain flipping\". Domain flipping may also involve the process of buying a valuable domain name and building a related website around it, all this with the objective of selling the domain and newly built website to an interested party.\n\nSometimes, domain name speculation involves finding domain names early in a market, particularly when a new top-level domain is launched, registering them and waiting until the market grows to sell them. Domains such as sex.com, marijuana.com and business.com have sold for millions of US dollars.\n\nThe COM top-level domain (or 'TLD') is the focus of most domain speculation activity as it is the largest TLD. Domain speculation occurs in other TLDs as well, such as NET and to a lesser extent in ORG, INFO, and BIZ. Of the Generic top-level domains, INFO is the most popular by registration volume compared to BIZ gTLD due to the low cost of initial registration and the recognizability of INFO as being an abbreviation of \"information\".\n\nDomain name speculation also occurs in country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .uk, .de and .us. The German TLD consists of over 12 million domains. The UK's domain has over 7.7 million domains registered according to Nominet's domain registration statistics webpage, mainly in its commercial sub-domain co.uk. These TLDs are mature markets where good domain names may command high prices. The EU ccTLD is an example of what happens when speculative activity overtakes \"ordinary\" domain registrations. A combination of an inept registry (EURid) and excessive speculation by businesses exploiting a poorly structured regulatory framework meant that, according to EURid's own statistics at the end of 2006, over 50% of the registrations could be considered at best speculative and at worst domain name warehousing.\n\nSpecialist and \"repurposed\" ccTLDs have also seen elements of domain name speculation. One of the best examples is that of the .tv ccTLD which has found the fact that \"TV\" is an abbreviation for the word television to be rather lucrative. The .mobi TLD is a good example of a specialist TLD in that it is specifically targeted at mobile phones and similar mobile technology. The operators of .mobi, mTLD, have reserved some of the premium generic words which will be auctioned off. The intent is to create a more level playing field for those interested in developing websites. The .mobi premium generic words and phrases list is a good example of the domain names that are at the heart of most early-market domain name speculation.\n\nDomain name speculators, sometimes known as domainers or domain investors, also register domain names based on seemingly generic phrases such as \"propertyforsale\" in the hope that these domain names could be sold later to businesses. Some (but not all) domain name investors will try to stay away from domain names containing trademarks as this could be considered cybersquatting.\n\nSome country code TLDs or sponsored TLDs will have what is referred to as an eligibility or nexus requirement to limit registration to specific geographical or national regions. However this does not deter domain name speculation as various options such as using a local agent or company to enable people to register domains in such TLDs exist and have been used.\n\nDomain name speculation has evolved with the expansion of the domain name system. Domain names were registered primarily for business purposes. In the 1990s, much of the ccTLD landscape had yet to appear, and the growing public awareness of the COM TLD was gathering momentum owing to the growth of the Dot-com bubble. This inevitably attracted the attention of those who saw potential value in domain names, and by this time many of the most valuable generic domain names, such as sex.com and business.com, had been registered. No clear legal position existed to distinguish domain name speculation and cybersquatting. Due to the open nature of most TLDs, anyone could register a domain name. This led to the development of the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy in 1999.\n\nA common accusation against domain name speculation is that it is cybersquatting. Cybersquatting is defined as registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The key element in this definition is that the intellectual property rights of another's trademark are infringed by the cybersquatter. For a UDRP action to succeed one of the things that the complainant has to establish is that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights. Legitimate domain name speculation tends to steer clear of trademarks and concentrate on generic words and phrases as domains based on trademarks can be subject of UDRP actions by the trademark owners. As the number of registered domain names has increased, the number of UDRP cases has also increased. Trademark and service mark owners now use brand protection services that monitor TLDs for newly registered domains that potentially infringe on their trademarks. This is due in part to typosquatting, a form of cybersquatting where variations of the spelling of a brand's domain will be registered in an attempt to profit from users mistyping the URL of the site they wish to visit.\n\nGeneric terms, such as the term \"salt\" when used in connection with sodium chloride, are not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing a product or service. This means that generic terms are generally not afforded any legal protection. The Canned Foods, Inc. v. Ult Search Inc. decision specifically deals with a case involving a generic term, \"Grocery Outlet\" and the domain name \"groceryoutlet.com\". The decision contains the key sentence \"Generic terms receive no protection in US trademark law when they are used to label the goods and services that they describe.\"\n\nCybersquatting was first used as a legal term in March 1998 by a U.S. District Court in California in the case of \"Avery Dennison vs Sumpton\". An early definition of the practice was given in \"Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen\", 947 F. Supp. 1227 (N.D. Ill. 1996). The definition was \"These individuals attempt to profit from the Internet by reserving and later reselling or licensing domain names back to the companies that spent millions of dollars developing the goodwill of the trademark.\" \n\nAs domain name speculation has evolved alongside the domain name system, the most memorable and shortest domains tend to be amongst those registered first in any TLD. For old TLDs like COM (introduced in 1985), these domains will be long gone and people registering their first domains are often frustrated at the lack of short and memorable domains in this and other mature TLDs.\n\nOne of the main problems concerning trademarks and domain names in unrestricted TLDs and gTLDs is that of trademarks in general: the rights of the trademark owner have to be asserted in order to protect the trademark. The trademark owner has to take legal action, typically a UDRP, to defend the trademark after the potentially infringing domain has been registered. The UDRP action has to follow a procedure of notifying the respondent, receiving a reply from the respondent, appointing an adjudication panel and awaiting a decision. The process can take two months or more and all costs (typically more than $1,000 even for a single domain) are borne by the complainant, while the infringing party stands to lose nothing except the registration fee (usually under $10) for the original domain and the registrar of the infringing name incurs no penalty at all.\n\nThe global and unrestricted nature of TLDs and gTLDs effectively means that anyone in any country can register a domain name in them regardless of whether they have any intellectual property rights in that name. With country code TLDs the jurisdiction is more clearly defined. The affected intellectual property rights owner would have to take a legal action, typically a UDRP case to transfer or cancel the domain unless the registrant is in the same jurisdiction as the affected intellectual property rights owner. In this case, local law may be sufficient as the action may be considered as common law tort of passing off.\n\nThe primary market for domain name speculation covers newly registered domain names that have not been registered before. Such domain names are often linked to news and current events. The launch of a new TLD encourages primary market speculation as domainers rush to register generic terms and also phrases that make a pun on the TLD name (domain hack). Other more organised domainers or domain name speculators register trademarks in advance of the launch of new TLDs specifically in order to register these short, memorable and potentially high value domains in the sunrise period of new gTLD launches. The Sunrise period is when intellectual property rights owners (trademark owners etc.) can register their trademark in the new gTLD in advance of the gTLD being opened for general registrations. In the last three years the main new TLDs launched were .eu ccTLD, .mobi TLD and .asia sTLD. All of these had landrush periods of varying success.\n\nThe secondary market for domain names covers previously registered domain names that have not been renewed by registrants or are available for resale. Sometimes these \"dropped\" domain names can be more valuable due to their having had high-profile websites associated with them. They will have links from other websites and could still have users searching for the websites because of these links. Others can be valuable because of the generic nature of the domain name or the length of the domain name, with two and three character names being the most sought after.\n\nThe business of registering the domain names as they are deleted by the registries is known as \"drop catching\". It is a highly competitive business. The main operators in this business typically set up a number of front companies as registrars. VeriSign, in the case of TLDs COM and NET, allows each registrar a slice of the resources that may be used to register dropped domains. VeriSign drops domains in a random order, giving registrars only a vague idea of the particular drop time of a particular domain. Sometimes a group of drop registrars often work in confederation to increase their possibility of registering a dropped domain immediately after it is deleted by the registry. If the domain is caught by a confederation of registrars attempting to fulfill a domain backorder, then whichever domain registrar caught the domain will register it to the entity who backordered the domain. If the newly reregistered domain is captured by a company that has no customers who backordered it, the domain may be auctioned to the highest bidder by the registrar who captured it or an auction intermediary. The time between a drop and a capture is often measured in seconds or fractions thereof.\n\nSome registrars do not allow domains to drop in the normal fashion, instead introducing an intermediary (e.g., Snapnames and Namejet) that auction the domain prior to their deletion. If nobody buys the domain at auction, it will pass through the normal deletion process.\n\nCybersquatting has a clear legal definition, but this definition tends to be lost when people open a webpage with only pay per click ('PPC') advertising. It is often assumed that such a domain is \"cybersquatted\", especially when the person is searching for the domain in order to register it.\n\nThe ease with which PPC revenue could be derived from parked domains effectively created a situation where domains were being registered purely for their type-in traffic. Many of exact phrases that people were searching for in search engines were being registered for the sole purpose of serving PPC advertising. The COM TLD grew from 23,662,001 registered domains 1 January 2003 to 80,759,835 registered domains as of 1 January 2009. While part of that increase in the number of registered domain names is due to the increase in ecommerce and business conducted online, some of the increase is due to the ease of generating revenue from PPC and type-in traffic. Domain tasting, a practice by which millions of domains would be registered for a limited period (the five-day Add Grace Period during which a domain could be deleted without the registrar effectively having to pay a registration fee to ICANN) and only those generating sufficient revenue from PPC advertising would be retained, also served to increase the number of domains registered. This practice involved domain name registrars being created purely for the purpose of domain tasting. The situation became so bad in 2007 that ICANN was forced to take action. In June 2008 ICANN added a provision to its Fiscal Year 2009 budget to limit the number of domains that a registrar could delete using the Add Grace Period before having to pay the ICANN fee. The effect of this was to massively curtail the number of domains deleted in .com and .net during the Add Grace Period. From June 2008 to April 2009, AGP deletions fell by 99.7%.\n\nThe March 2006 Verisign Domain Brief stated that out of approximately 57.37 million COM and NET websites spidered, 26% were single page websites, 60% were multipage websites and 14% had no associated websites. Numerically, the number of single page websites was approximately 14.91 million. The single page websites include under-construction, brochure-ware and parked pages in addition to online advertising revenue generating (PPC) parked pages.\n\nThe latest statistics for domain name usage quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief for June 2009 states that of the 92 million COM and NET domain names, 24% of these domains have one page websites, 64% have multipage websites and 12% have no associated websites. In purely numerical terms, those single page websites would account for approximately 22 million COM and NET websites. The survey quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief does not explain the methodology or provide anything other than a summary of the results. However this is effectively a rise in single page websites of just over 7 million websites.\n\nSome hosters such as Godaddy have their own domain parking systems and allow unused domains to be parked with the registrant receiving a share of the PPC revenue earned. Other hosters have similar systems.\n\n\n"}

It is the first part in a new series of films produced by Musée d'Orsay, and tells the story of a French family as seen through the eyes of a Chinese student. The film was shot in August and September 2006 on location in Paris. This is Hou Hsiao-hsien's first non-Asian film. It references the classic 1956 French short \"The Red Balloon\" directed by Albert Lamorisse.\n\nThe film opened the \"Un Certain Regard\" section of the Cannes Film Festival in May 2007.\n\nSuzanne, a puppeteer, lives with her young son Simon in an apartment in Paris. While Suzanne is busy with producing her new Chinese puppet play based on an ancient Chinese text (求妻煮海人), she hires a Chinese film student Song as Simon's new nanny. For her college project - a homage to Albert Lamorisse's famous 1956 film \"The Red Balloon\" - Song starts to film Simon. She develops a good relationship with mother and son, and translates for Suzanne's masterclass with a Chinese puppet master. \n\nWhile Simon's older sister Louise is about to graduate from a high school in Brussels, Suzanne plans for Louise to apply for colleges in Paris. For that, she tries to evict her downstairs tenant Marc, who has repeatedly failed to pay his rent, while arguing on the phone with Pierre, Simon's father, who has absented himself to Canada for two years to write a novel and who is rarely in touch. Simon visits the Musée d'Orsay on a school trip, where his class is shown \"The Ball\", a painting by Félix Vallotton in which a child chases a red ball.\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of 87 sampled critics and 90% of top critics gave the film positive reviews. The average rating is 6.9 out of 10.\n\nJ. Hoberman, writing in \"The Village Voice\" was particularly appreciative of the film stating, \"Flight of the Red Balloon is contemplative but never static, and punctuated by passages of pure cinema\".\n\nKate Stables of Sight & Sound also highly praised the film, \"Finding a serene and contemplative beauty in the quotidian world has long been Taiwanese master-minimalist Hou Hsiao Hsien's stock in trade... Hou brings the same depth and deliberation to the film's Parisian exterior... ultimately, it is cinema that is the film's sacred repository of memory and creativity.\"\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader likes the film as <nowiki>\"</nowiki>A relatively slight but sturdy work by Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, this slice of contemporary urban life more or less does for Paris what his Cafe Lumiere did for Tokyo, albeit with less minimalism and more overt emotion\".<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\"\n\nOn the other hand, Duane Byrge of Hollywood Reporter was not impressed. \"The imagery of the classic movie, where a spirited red balloon wafts unpredictably over Paris, never even attempts to reach a metaphorical height, nor does it even engage us compositionally.\"\n\nThe film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.\n\n\nThe film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2007 Valladolid International Film Festival.\n\n"}

The second edition consists of six volumes published in 1993–2003 and is available on-line.\n\nTaiwan is an island of diverse geography and varied climates, allowing for a vast array of flora to be present. Situated between China and the Philippine sea basin, it is said to be the home of approximately 4000 species of vascular plants. Of these plants, it is estimated that 600 are ferns, 28 are gymnosperms, 2400 are dicots, and 1000 are monocots. The island can also be divided up into seven different floristic regions; Northeastern, Central, Hengchun, Lanyu (Orchid Island) and Lutao (Green Island), Alpine, Upper montaine and supalpine, and Lower montane and lowland.\n\nThe Northeastern region of Taiwan receives much more rainfall and cloud coverage than other regions, making the species of this particular region distinct to this particular climate. Species of flora within this region include; Isoetes taiwanensis, Fagus hayatae, Maackia taiwaneses, Acer buergerianum var. formosanum, Sedum sekietense, Sedum uniflorum, Angelica dahurica, Angelica hirsutiflora, Rhododendron nakaharai, R. hyperthrum, Rhuchotechum formosanum, Salvia nippocanica var. formosana, Ericaulon chishingsanesis, Woodwardia harlandi, Cinnamomum austro-sinense, Mahonia japonica, Breischneidera sinensis, Triplerygium wilfordii, Lingularia japonica, Enkianthus perulaius, Quercus (Cyclybalanopsis) myrsinaefolia, Acronychia pedunculata, Enscaphis japonica, Lilum speciosum var. gloriosoides, Smilax nipponica, Keteleeria davidiana var. formosana.\n\nThe Central region of Taiwan is characterized by basins, and is a plains region mostly surrounded by mountain ranges, such as the Hsueshan Range in the North. The isolated region consists of forests of endemic flora species such as; Castanopsis eyrie, C. kawakami, Quercus dentate, Q. serrata var. brevipetiolata, Lindera aggregate, Podocarpus nakaii, Ormosiaformosana, Wuercus (Cyclobalanopsis) globose, Castanopsis fargesii, Lithocarpus nantoensis. \n\nThe Hengchun region of Taiwan is a subtropical evergreen forested area, with broad-leaved forests, as well as a few semi-tropical rain forests in the low-lands. Some of the flora species that can be found here include; Lithocarpus dodanaeifolia, L. shinsuiensis, Quercus (cuclobalanopsis) hypophaea, Q. (c.) repandaefolia, Cinnamomum brevipedunculatum, C. reticulatum, Litsea lii, Machilus abovatifolia, Neolitsea daibuensis, N.hiiransis, Ilex loonicerifolia v. matsudai, Aristolochia kaoi, Asarum epigynum, Acalpha matudai, Euonymus pallidifolia, Dolichos trilobus var.kosyunensis, Gleditsia rolfei, Indigofera byobiensis, Millia formosana, Myrica adenphora var. kusanoi, Piper kawakamii, Reevesia formosana, Symplocos shilanensis, Camellia hengchunesis, Syzygium euphlebium, Syzygium kiskusense, Callicarpa remotiserrrulata.\n\nThe Lanyu (Orchid Island) and Lutao (Green Island) regions of Taiwan are the most similar to the Philippines, though the rest of Taiwan is more similar to mainland China. Forty-six of four-hundred and forty five seed-plant species within these two islets of Taiwan are shared with the Philippines, the only region still considered Taiwan that shares species with the neighboring country. Endemic species within this district consist of Cinnamomum kotoense, Murraya paniculata var. omphalocarpa, Chisocheton kanehirai, Acalypha hontauyensis, Exoecaria kawakamii, Cissus lanyuesis, Calopphyllum changii, Garcinia linii, Medimilla hayataiana, Diospyros kotoensis, Alyxia insularis, Trachelospermum lanyuense, Lysionotus ikeadae, and Lasianthus obliquinervis var. simizui.\n\nThe Alpine district of Taiwan has distinctly different flora than the rest of the country. The alpine district pertains mostly of boreal and temperate vegetation such as Botrychium lunar, Lycopodium selago appressum, Osmunda cinnamomea, etc. \n\nThe Upper montane/subalpine district, similar to the alpine district, is temperate to cool temperate. Conifers are the main vegetation of this region. Abies kawakamii, Tsuga chinensis, and Picea morrisoncola, to name a few, are some of the species that exist within this floristic zone. \n\nThe Lower montane/lowland district of Taiwan is more similar to the warm climate forests, supporting broad-leaved forests. Some of the species of the forests common to this floristic zone include; Castanopsis, Quercus, and Lithocarpus. \n\nCultivated agriculture produced in Taiwan has drastically changed Taiwan's development. Agriculture has become as much a part of the naturally existing flora of Taiwan, and human influence on the land has greatly contributed to the vegetation of the country. Bamboo, Fruits, Grains and vegetable crops all thrive on the island, mostly thriving in the Central, Southern and Eastern regions.\n\nBamboo has largely taken a hold in the country as a cash-crop. Large areas of Taiwan have been converted into various bamboo plantations. Most of the bamboo is grown to support the developing economy, however the species also provides support to rural communities as its sturdiness provides strength and stands firm in the midst of the high-speed winds that can dominate the country during rainy-monsoon seasons. \n\nFruit trees typically grow in the low-lands of the island. Western and Southwestern Taiwan is the primary fruit producing region. Fruit commonly grown in Taiwan are tropical and plentiful including lychees, pengkan tangerines, hseukan tangerines, oranges, bananas, grapes, betel nuts, kaochie pear, plum, peach, starfruit, persimmon, guava, papaya, mango, lemon, Indian dates, pineapples, coconuts, apricots, and loquat.\n\nGrain and Vegetable crops are mainly cultivated in Northern Taiwan. Rice and vegetables are grown in large paddies in the lowlands of the TTa'an river, plains of Miaoli and Hsinchu counties, the Hungli and Taoyen terraces, the Taipei basin, and the Ilan plain. The vegetables grown in these areas consist of kale, mustard, Chinese cabbage, wengtsai, celery, cucumber, yucca, winter melon, pumpkin, eggplant, red bean, peas, tomatoes, radishes, ginger, taro, onion, leek, and garlic. Vegetables are typically planted in rotation with rice, and their seasons do not coincide. \n\nThe major agricultural exports from Taiwan include paddy rice, sugar cane, cloud apples, and betel nuts.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite efforts to save the most valuable parts of the collection, almost half of the archive's total contents were destroyed during World War II.\n\nIn 1946, the German Central Archive was founded in Potsdam, then in the Soviet occupation zone and later in East Germany. This archive, renamed the Central State Archive in 1973, was viewed as the successor to the original archive, in part because it was located in the same city. By the end of the 1950s, records that had originally been seized by the government of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of World War II had been returned to the archive.\n\nIn West Germany, the Cabinet of Germany decided to create a new Federal Archive in Koblenz in 1950, a project that was realized in 1952. The United States and the United Kingdom, like the Soviet Union, also seized records from Germany following World War II in their respective zones of occupation. In 1955, a \"Military Archives Division\" was established as part of the Federal Archives as a place into which these records were returned. In 1988, the Federal Archives Act elevated the tasks of the Federal Archive into law, and granted it rights to the documents produced by West Germany's courts, public authorities, and constitutional institutions.\n\nThe reunification of Germany in 1990 also led to the unification of West Germany's Federal Archive with East Germany's Central State Archive. In the course of this development, the formerly separate National Film Archive and Military Archives of East Germany were also merged into the Federal Archives.\n\nWith the unification of the two German archives in 1990, the traditions of the East Germany state authorities were absorbed into the Federal Archives. However, legal problems were encountered during this process in securing the archives and libraries of East Germany's political parties and mass organizations. Even though East Germany's political structure meant that these institutions had very close ties to the government, they were not public institutions. Further problems arose as these records were separated from other East German documents, resulting in the Federal Archives presenting an incomplete picture of East Germany's history. In 1991, an initiative was implemented that placed the records in question into the possession of the Federal Archives. As a result of this initiative, a bill amending the Federal Archives Act of 1988 that established the department foundation provided for the Federal Archives came into force on 13 March 1992.\n\nThe collection of the German Federal Archives today includes older documents from Germany's imperial past, Nazi Germany, civilian and military records from East Germany (including East German political parties and mass organizations), and the documents inherited from West Germany's Federal Archive. In addition to state records, the Archives also contain material from political parties, associations, and societies of national prominence as well as historical collections. Besides the text documents, the Archives also keeps photographs, films, maps, posters, and electronic data in its collection.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45377527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45377527", "title": "Ghayrah", "text": "Ghayrah\n\nGhayrah () (sometimes transliterated as Ghayra, Ghira, or Gheerah) is an Arabic word which means a person’s dislike of another’s sharing in a right (which belongs to the former). It has a sense of earnest concern or zeal over something and can be considered a kind of protective jealousy. In Islam, there are different kinds of ghayrah: that which relates to Allah and which relates to a Muslim. Allah's discontent is with sharing the obedience of His servant which rightfully belongs to Him. For a Muslim it is the uneasiness in his heart which moves him to guard his family from indecency.\n\nThe term is based on the following Quran verses:\n\nMen who do not have Ghayrah are known as a \"dayyuth\" (). Being a dayyuth is a major sin and a description of what is deemed an evil characteristic can be found in Az-Zahabi's book of Major Sins (Al-Kaba'ir). The prophet Mohammed and his companions were known to have very strong Ghayrah.\n\nAlthough it is claimed that the concept of Ghayrah is the source of honor killings in the Islamic world, Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid asserts that punishment of any crime is reserved for the Islamic ruler noting that the penalty for fornication (unmarried sexual relationships for unmarried people) is 100 lashes. As it is a Muslim man's role as the guardian of his family, he is responsible for those in his custody and it is his duty to observe the conduct of his wife and children; although this does allow him to be overly suspicious or exceed the acceptable standards of supervision. For conservative Muslims, the enforcement of the wearing of the hijab by a Muslim man's wife and daughters and the prevention of the free mingling between the sexes for those under a Muslim man's guardianship are necessary actions under the concept of Ghayrah to preserving one's honor. Per Salafi scholar Al-Munajjid, if a Muslim man suspects that certain family members will commit an immoral act, he is allowed to tie up or otherwise detain them in order to prevent the action.\n\nSalafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid indicates that the concept also applies to protecting the Prophet Muhammad from blasphemy although the determination of guilt and application of the penalty (execution) is to be solely applied by Islamic authorities.\n\nHans Wehr's Arabic dictionary defines ghayrah as: jealously; zeal, fervor, earnest concern, vigilant care, solicitude (على for); sense of honor, self-respect. It can be defined as a person’s dislike of another’s sharing in a right (which belongs to the former).\n\n"}

After much wine has been drunk, David pretends to read a chapter from his autobiographical novel, in which the 'stifling, sinister attractions' of his mother drive the protagonist, Jack Flea into the arms of Hermione, an older woman who turns David into her fantasy child. When Mrs. Lee grabs the piece of paper from David it is blank. Ruth and David then act up the fantasy of being mother and child; Ruth and Mrs. Lee vying for possession of David.

The self-reflecting fiction at the centre of the play is perhaps one of those conceits that many writers new to the form are tempted to exploit.

Thus, Ladislau Netto became the most influential Brazilian scientist of his time, with a mandate for modernizing and expanding the museum and making contacts with foreign scientists.\n\nHe was a France-trained botanist, and in this capacity his contributions were substantial. \n\nHe was also drawn to anthropology, especially physical anthropology and the question of the origin of Brazilian Indians. Here his record is less commendable: his use of science to back racism and elitism was not unusual for the period, but his exclusive focus on the interests of the National Museum led him to questionable practices, such as not returning a collection borrowed from the Museu Paraense for an exhibition.\n\nIn 1874 Ladislau Netto was taken in by a supposed Phoenician inscription from Brazil's state of Paraíba. Netto initially accepted the inscription as genuine, but when his mentor Ernest Renan declared it to be a hoax, he backed down and blamed foreigners for its fabrication.\n\nIn 1876, he founded the museum's scientific journal, the \"Archivos do Museu Nacional\", which is still published.

The document was issued against persons who had not paid their debts.\n\nHistorically, the documents would be announced by three blasts of a horn, and the documents themselves came to be known as \"letters of horning\". A person who was denounced in these documents was described as having been \"put to the horn\".\nOriginally in Scotland, imprisonment for debt was enforceable only in certain cases, but a custom gradually grew up of taking the debtor's oath to pay. If the debtor broke his oath, he became liable to the discipline of the Church. The civil power could step in to aid the ecclesiastical, denouncing the debtor as a rebel, imprisoning his person and confiscating his goods. The method of declaring a person a rebel was by giving three blasts on a horn and publicly proclaiming the fact; hence the expression \"put to the horn\".\n\nThe subsequent process, a warrant directing a messenger-at-arms to charge the debtor to pay or perform in terms of the letters, was called letters of horning. This system of execution was simplified by the Personal Diligence Act of 1838, and execution was thereafter usually by diligence (see writ of execution).\n\nThe granting of letters of horning, letters of horning and poinding, letters of poinding, and letters of caption all ceased to be competent following the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987.

It is an electronic dictionary and lexical database.\n\nA machine-readable dictionary is a dictionary in an electronic form that can be loaded in a database and can be queried via application software. It may be a single language explanatory dictionary or a multi-language dictionary to support translations between two or more languages or a combination of both. Translation software between multiple languages usually apply bidirectional dictionaries. An MRD may be a dictionary with a proprietary structure that is queried by dedicated software (for example online via internet) or it can be a dictionary that has an open structure and is available for loading in computer databases and thus can be used via various software applications. Conventional dictionaries contain a lemma with various descriptions. A machine-readable dictionary may have additional capabilities and is therefore sometimes called a smart dictionary. An example of a smart dictionary is the Open Source Gellish English dictionary. \nThe term dictionary is also used to refer to an electronic vocabulary or lexicon as used for example in spelling checkers. If dictionaries are arranged in a subtype-supertype hierarchy of concepts (or terms) then it is called a taxonomy. If it also contains other relations between the concepts, then it is called an ontology. Search engines may use either a vocabulary, a taxonomy or an ontology to optimise the search results. Specialised electronic dictionaries are morphological dictionaries or syntactic dictionaries.\nThe term MRD is often contrasted with NLP dictionary, in the sense that an MRD is the electronic form of a dictionary which was printed before on paper. Although being both used by programs, in contrast, the term NLP dictionary is preferred when the dictionary was built from scratch with NLP in mind. An ISO standard for MRD and NLP is able to represent both structures and is called Lexical Markup Framework.\n\nThe first widely distributed MRDs were the Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate (W7) and the Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary (MPD). Both were produced by a government-funded project at System Development Corporation under the direction of John Olney. They were manually keyboarded as no typesetting tapes of either book were available. Originally each was distributed on multiple reels of magnetic tape as card images with each separate word of each definition on a separate punch card with numerous special codes indicating the details of its usage in the printed dictionary. Olney outlined a grand plan for the analysis of the definitions in the dictionary, but his project expired before the analysis could be carried out. Robert Amsler at the University of Texas at Austin resumed the analysis and completed a taxonomic description of the Pocket Dictionary under National Science Foundation funding, however his project expired before the taxonomic data could be distributed. Roy Byrd et al. at IBM Yorktown Heights resumed analysis of the Webster's Seventh Collegiate following Amsler's work. Finally, in the 1980s starting with initial support from Bellcore and later funded by various U.S. federal agencies, including NSF, ARDA, DARPA, DTO, and REFLEX, George Armitage Miller and Christiane Fellbaum at Princeton University completed the creation and wide distribution of a dictionary and its taxonomy in the WordNet project, which today stands as the most widely distributed computational lexicology resource.\n"}
{"id": "23372115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23372115", "title": "Monty Python's Flying Circus", "text": "Monty Python's Flying Circus\n\nMonty Python’s Flying Circus (known during the final series as just Monty Python) is a British sketch comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python and broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974. The shows were composed of surreality, risqué or innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. It also featured animations by group member Terry Gilliam, often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC One, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.\n\nThe show often targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, and is at times politically charged. The members of Monty Python were highly educated. Terry Jones and Michael Palin are Oxford University graduates; Eric Idle, John Cleese and Graham Chapman attended Cambridge University; and American-born member Terry Gilliam graduated from Occidental College. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures. The series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series \"Q5\", rather than the traditional sketch show format. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded (although, by their perspective, failed) so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material.\n\nThe Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, including the majority of the female characters, but occasionally they cast an extra actor. Regular supporting cast members include Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, Neil Innes (in the fourth series), and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers (for musical numbers).\n\nThe theme music is the Band of the Grenadier Guards' rendition of John Philip Sousa's \"The Liberty Bell\" which was first published in 1893. Under the Berne Convention's \"country of origin\" concept, the composition was subject to United States copyright law which states that any works first published prior to 1923 was in the public domain due to copyright expiration. This enabled Gilliam to co-opt the march for the series without having to make any royalty payments.\n\nThe title \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" was partly the result of the group's reputation at the BBC. Michael Mills, the BBC's Head of Comedy, wanted their name to include the word \"circus\" because the BBC referred to the six members wandering around the building as a circus, in particular, \"Baron Von Took's Circus\", after Barry Took, who had brought them to the BBC. The group added \"flying\" to make it sound less like an actual circus and more like something from World War I. The group was coming up with their name at a time when the 1966 Royal Guardsmen song \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" had been at a peak. \"Freiherr\" Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I German flying ace known as The Red Baron, commanded the Jagdgeschwader 1 squadron of planes known as \"The Flying Circus.\" \n\nThe words \"Monty Python\" were added because they claimed it sounded like a really bad theatrical agent, the sort of person who would have brought them together, with John Cleese suggesting \"Python\" as something slimy and slithery, and Eric Idle suggesting \"Monty\". They later explained that the name Monty \"...made us laugh because Monty to us means Lord Montgomery, our great general of the Second World War\".\n\nThe BBC had rejected some other names put forward by the group including \"Whither Canada?\", \"The Nose Show\", \"Ow! It's Colin Plint!\", \"A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin\", \"The Toad Elevating Moment\" and \"Owl Stretching Time\". Several of these titles were later used for individual episodes.\n\nCompared to many other sketch comedy shows, \"Flying Circus\" had fewer recurring characters, many of whom were involved only in titles and linking sequences. Continuity for many of these recurring characters was frequently non-existent from sketch to sketch, with sometimes even the most basic information (such as a character's name) being changed from one appearance to the next.\n\n\n\n\nOther returning characters include a married couple, often mentioned but never seen, Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. In \"Election Night Special\", Pip has lost a political seat to Engelbert Humperdinck. Several recurring characters are played by different Pythons. Both Palin and Chapman played the insanely violent Police Constable Pan Am. Both Jones and Palin portrayed police sergeant Harry 'Snapper' Organs of Q division. Various historical figures were played by a different cast member in each appearance, such as Mozart (Cleese, then Palin), or Queen Victoria (Jones, then Palin, then all five Pythons in Series 4).\n\nSome of the Pythons' real-life targets recurred more frequently than others. Reginald Maudling, a contemporary Conservative politician, was singled out for perhaps the most consistent ridicule. Then-Secretary of State for Education and Science, and (well after the programme had ended) Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was occasionally mentioned, in particular referring to Thatcher's brain as being in her shin received a hearty laugh from the studio audience. Then-US President Richard Nixon was also frequently mocked, as was Conservative party leader Edward Heath, prime minister for much of the series' run. The British police were also a favourite target, often acting bizarrely, stupidly, or abusing their authority, frequently in drag.\n\nAlthough there were few recurring characters, and the six cast members played many diverse roles, each perfected some character traits.\n\nGraham Chapman often portrayed straight-faced men, of any age or class, frequently authority figures such as military officers, policemen or doctors. His characters could, at any moment, engage in \"Pythonesque\" maniacal behaviour and then return to their former sobriety. He was also skilled in abuse, which he brusquely delivered in such sketches as \"The Argument Clinic\" and \"Flying Lessons\". He adopted a dignified demeanour as the leading \"straight man\" in the Python feature films \"Holy Grail\" (King Arthur) and \"Life of Brian\" (title character Brian).\n\nJohn Cleese played ridiculous authority figures. Gilliam claims that Cleese is the funniest of the Pythons in drag, as he barely needs to be dressed up to look hilarious, with his square chin and 6' 5\" (196 cm) frame (see the \"Mr. and Mrs. Git\" sketch). Cleese also played intimidating maniacs, such as an instructor in the \"Self Defence Against Fresh Fruit\" sketch. His character Mr. Praline, the put-upon consumer, featured in some of the most popular sketches, most famously in \"Dead Parrot\". One star turn that proved most memorable among Python fans was \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\", where he worked for the eponymous government department. The sketch features some rather extravagant physical comedy from the notoriously tall and loose-limbed Cleese. Despite its popularity, particularly among American fans, Cleese himself particularly disliked the sketch, feeling that many of the laughs it generated were cheap and that no balance was provided by what could have been the true satirical centrepoint. Another of his trademarks is his over-the-top delivery of abuse, particularly his screaming \"You bastard!\"\n\nCleese often played foreigners with ridiculous accents, especially Frenchmen, most of the time with Palin. Sometimes this extended to the use of actual French or German (such as \"The Funniest Joke in the World\", \"Hitler in Minehead\", or \"La Marche Futile\" at the end of \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\"), but still with a very heavy accent (or impossible to understand, as for example Hitler's speech).\n\nMany Python sketches were linked together by the cut-out animations of Terry Gilliam, including the opening titles featuring the iconic giant foot that became a symbol of all that was 'Pythonesque'. Gilliam’s unique visual style was characterised by sudden, dramatic movements and deliberate mismatches of scale, set in surrealist landscapes populated by engravings of large buildings with elaborate architecture, grotesque Victorian gadgets, machinery, and people cut from old Sears Roebuck catalogues. Gilliam added airbrush illustrations and many famous pieces of art. All of these elements were combined in incongruous ways to obtain new and humorous meanings in the tradition of surrealist \"collage assemblies\".\n\nThe surreal nature of the series allowed Gilliam’s animation to go off on bizarre, imaginative tangents. Some running gags derived from these animations were a giant hedgehog named Spiny Norman who appeared over the tops of buildings shouting, \"Dinsdale!\", further petrifying the paranoid Dinsdale Piranha; and The Foot of Cupid, the giant foot that suddenly squashed things. The latter is appropriated from the figure of Cupid in the Agnolo Bronzino painting \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\".\n\nNotable Gilliam sequences for the show include Conrad Poohs and his Dancing Teeth, the rampage of the cancerous black spot, The Killer Cars and a giant cat that stomps its way through London, destroying everything in its path.\n\nInitially only hired to be the animator of the series, Gilliam was not thought of (even by himself) as an on-screen performer at first, being American and not very good at the deep and sometimes exaggerated English accent of his fellows. The others felt they owed him something and so he sometimes appeared before the camera, usually in the parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of make-up or involved uncomfortable costumes. The most recurrent of these was The-Knight-Who-Hits-People-With-A-Chicken, a knight in armour who would walk on-set and hit another character on the head with a plucked chicken when they said something really corny. Some of Gilliam's other on-screen portrayals included:\n\nGilliam soon became distinguished as the go-to member for the most obscenely grotesque characters. This carried over into the \"Holy Grail\" film, where Gilliam played King Arthur's hunchbacked page 'Patsy' and the bridgekeeper at the Bridge of Death. It has also been claimed that he was originally asked by Terry Jones to play Mr. Creosote in \"The Meaning of Life\", but turned it down.\n\nEric Idle is known for his roles as a cheeky, suggestive playboy (\"Nudge Nudge\"), a variety of pretentious television presenters (such as his over-the-top portrayal of Philip Jenkinson in the segments connecting the \"Cheese Shop\" and \"Salad Days\" sketches), a crafty, slick salesman (\"Door-to-Door Joke Salesman\", \"Encyclopedia Salesman\") and the merchant who loves to haggle in \"Monty Python’s Life of Brian\". He is acknowledged as 'the master of the one-liner' by the other Pythons. He is also considered the best singer/songwriter in the group; for example, he wrote and performed \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" from \"The Life of Brian\". Unlike Jones, he often played female characters in a more straightforward way, only altering his voice slightly, as opposed to the falsetto shrieking used by the others. Several times, Idle appeared as upper-class, middle-aged women, such as Rita Fairbanks (\"Reenactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor\") and the sexually-repressed Protestant wife in the \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" sketch, \"The Meaning of Life\".\n\nBecause he was not from an already-established writing partnership prior to Python, Idle wrote his sketches alone.\n\nAlthough all of the Pythons played women, Terry Jones is renowned by the rest to be 'the best Rat-Bag woman in the business'. His portrayal of a middle-aged housewife was louder, shriller, and more dishevelled than that of any of the other Pythons. Examples of this are the \"Dead Bishop\" sketch, his role as Brian's mother Mandy in \"Life of Brian\", Mrs. Linda S-C-U-M in \"Mr. Neutron\" and the café proprietor in \"Spam\". Also recurring was the upper-class reserved men, in \"Nudge, Nudge\" and the \"It's a Man's Life\" sketch, and incompetent authority figures (Harry \"Snapper\" Organs). He also played the iconic Nude Organist that introduced all of series three. Generally, he deferred to the others as a performer, but proved himself behind the scenes, where he would eventually end up pulling most of the strings.\n\nMichael Palin was regarded by the other members of the troupe as the one with the widest range, equally adept as a straight man or wildly over the top character. He portrayed many working-class northerners, often portrayed in a disgusting light: \"The Funniest Joke in the World\" sketch and the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" segment of \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\". In contrast, Palin also played weak-willed, put-upon men such as the husband in the \"Marriage Guidance Counsellor\" sketch, or the boring accountant in the \"Vocational Guidance Counsellor\" sketch. He was equally at home as the indefatigable Cardinal Ximinez of Spain in \"The Spanish Inquisition\" sketch. Another high-energy character that Palin portrays is the slick TV show host, constantly smacking his lips together and generally being over-enthusiastic (\"Blackmail\" sketch). In one sketch, he plays the role with an underlying hint of self-revulsion, where he wipes his oily palms on his jacket, makes a disgusted face, then continues. One of his most famous creations was the shopkeeper who attempts to sell useless goods by very weak attempts at being sly and crafty, which are invariably spotted by the customer (often played by Cleese), as in the \"Dead Parrot\" and \"Cheese Shop\" sketches. Palin is also well known for his leading role in \"The Lumberjack Song\".\n\nPalin also often plays heavy-accented foreigners, mostly French (\"La marche futile\") or German (\"Hitler in Minehead\"), usually alongside Cleese. In one of the last episodes, he delivers a full speech, first in English, then in French, then in heavily accented German.\n\nOf all the Pythons, Palin played the fewest female roles. Among his portrayals of women are: Queen Victoria in the \"Michael Ellis\" episode, Debbie Katzenberg the American in \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\", or as a rural idiot's wife in the \"Idiot in rural society\" sketch.\n\nSome material originally recorded went missing later, such as the use of the word \"masturbation\" in the \"Summarize Proust\" sketch (which was muted during the first airing, and later cut out entirely) or \"What a silly bunt\" in the Travel Agent sketch (which featured a character [Idle] who has a speech impediment that makes him pronounce \"C\"s as \"B\"s), which was cut before the sketch ever went to air. However, when this sketch was included in the album \"Monty Python's Previous Record\" and the \"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" film, the line remained intact. Both sketches were included in the Danish DR K re-airing of all episodes (\"Episode 31\", aired 1 November 2018, 6:50 pm). After a less successful participation in the \"Summarize Proust Competition\", Mr Harry Bagot from Luton (Graham Chapman) is asked by the television host (Terry Jones) what other hobbies outside summarizing he might have. Harry replies, \"Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating.\"\n\nSome sketches were deleted in their entirety and later recovered. One such sketch is the \"Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)\", where a Conservative Party spokesman (Cleese) delivers a party political broadcast before getting up and dancing, being coached by a choreographer (Idle), and being joined by a chorus of spokesmen dancing behind him. The camera passes two Labour Party spokesmen practising ballet, and an animation featuring Edward Heath in a tutu. Once deemed lost, a home-recorded tape of this sketch, captured from a broadcast from Buffalo, New York PBS outlet WNED-TV, turned up on YouTube in 2008. Another high-quality recording of this sketch, broadcast on WTTW in Chicago, has also turned up on YouTube. The Buffalo version can be seen as an extra on the new Region 2/4 eight-disc \"The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus\" DVD set. The Region 1 DVD of \"Before The Flying Circus\", which is included in \"The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus Collector's Edition Megaset\" and \"Monty Python: The Other British Invasion\", also contains the Buffalo version as an extra.\n\nAnother lost sketch is the \"Satan\" animation following the \"Crackpot Religion\" piece and the \"Cartoon Religion Ltd\" animation, and preceding the \"How Not To Be Seen\" sketch: this had been edited out of the official tape. Six frames of the animation can be seen at the end of the episode, wherein that particular episode is repeated in fast-forward. A black and white 16 mm film print has since turned up (found by a private film collector in the US) showing the animation in its entirety.\n\nAt least two references to cancer were censored, both during the second series. In the sixth episode (\"It's A Living\" or \"School Prizes\"), Carol Cleveland's narration of a Gilliam cartoon suddenly has Michael Palin's voice dub 'gangrene' over the word cancer (although the word 'cancer' was used unedited when the animation appeared in the movie \"And Now for Something Completely Different\" as well as the 2006 special \"Terry Gilliam's Personal Best\"). Another reference was removed from the sketch \"Conquistador Coffee Campaign\", in the eleventh episode \"How Not to Be Seen\", although a reference to leprosy remained intact. This line has also been recovered from the same 16 mm film print as the above-mentioned \"Satan\" animation.\n\nA sketch from Episode 7 of Series 2 (subtitled 'The Attila the Hun Show') featured a parody of Michael Miles, the 1960s TV game show host (played by Cleese), and was introduced as 'Spot The Braincell'. This sketch was deleted shortly afterwards from a repeat broadcast as a mark of respect following Miles' death in February 1971.\n\nA restored Region 2 DVD release of Series 1–4 was released in 2007, with no additional features.\n\nTwo episodes were produced in German for WDR (Westdeutscher Rundfunk), both entitled \"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\", the literal German translation of the English title. While visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer Alfred Biolek caught notice of the Pythons. Excited by their innovative, absurd sketches, he invited them to Germany in 1971 and 1972 to write and act in two special German episodes.\n\nThe first episode, advertised as \"Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln für Deutschland\" (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around for Germany\"), was produced in 1971 and performed in German. The second episode, advertised as \"Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln auf die feine englische Art\" (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around in the distinguished English way\"), produced in 1972, was recorded in English and dubbed into German for its broadcast in Germany. The original English recording was transmitted by the BBC in October 1973.\n\nThe members of Monty Python embarked on a series of stage shows during and after the television series. These mostly consisted of sketches from the series, though they also included other famous sketches that had preluded them. One such sketch was the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, written by Cleese and Chapman, and performed for \"At Last the 1948 Show\"; the sketch subsequently became part of the live Python repertoire. The shows also included songs from collaborator Neil Innes.\n\nRecordings of four of these stage shows have subsequently appeared as separate works:\n\nGraham Chapman also performed on stage at the Knebworth Festival in 1975 with Pink Floyd.\n\nIn 2005, a troupe of actors headed by Rémy Renoux, translated and \"adapted\" a stage version of \"Monty Python’s Flying Circus\" into French. Usually the original actors defend their material very closely, but given in this case the \"adaptation\" and also the translation into French (with subtitles), the group supported this production. The adapted material sticks close to the original text, mainly deviating when it comes to ending a sketch, something the Python members themselves changed many times over the course of their stage performances.\nLanguage differences also occur in the lyrics of several songs. For example, \"Sit on My Face\" (which translated into French would be \"Asseyez-vous sur mon visage\") becomes \"cum in my mouth\".\n\nJohn Cleese left the show after the third series and did not appear in the six episodes of the fourth and final series. (However, he did receive writing credits for sketches derived from the writing sessions for the film of \"Holy Grail\"). Neil Innes and Douglas Adams are the only two non-Pythons to get writing credits in the show – Innes for songs in episodes 40, 42 and 45 (and for contributing to a sketch in episode 45), and Adams for contributing to a sketch about a doctor whose patients are stabbed by his nurse, in episode 45. (He also had walk-on acting parts in episodes 42 and 44.) Innes frequently appeared in the Pythons' stage shows and can also be seen as Sir Robin's lead minstrel in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" and (briefly) in \"Life of Brian\". Adams had become friends with Graham Chapman, and they later went on to write the failed sketch show pilot \"Out of the Trees\".\n\nAlthough Cleese stayed for the third series, he claimed that he and Chapman only wrote two original sketches (\"Dennis Moore\" and \"Cheese Shop\"), whereas he felt everything else was derivative of previous material. Either the third or fourth series are often seen as the weakest and most uneven of the show's run by both fans and the Pythons themselves. However, with the fourth series, the Pythons started making episodes into more coherent stories that would be a precursor to their films, and featured Terry Gilliam onscreen more.\n\nThe final episode of Series 4 was recorded on 16 November and broadcast on 5 December 1974. That year NBC's summer replacement series, \"Dean Martin's Comedyworld\" aired several segments from the Python shows. This paid enough to the BBC-TV distributors, Time-Life Films, to finally pay for the conversion of the \"Flying Circus\" programmes from PAL to the American NTSC system, and meant the PBS stations could afford the series at last. It was an instant hit, rapidly garnering an enormous loyal cult following nationwide that surprised even the Pythons themselves, who did not believe that their humour was exportable without being tailored specifically, even without a language barrier.\n\nIn 1974, the PBS station KERA in Dallas was the first television station in the United States to broadcast episodes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", and is often credited with introducing the programme to American audiences. When several episodes were broadcast by ABC in their \"Wide World of Entertainment\" showcase in 1975, the episodes were re-edited, thus losing the continuity and flow intended in the originals. When ABC refused to stop treating the series in this way, the Pythons took them to court. Initially the court ruled that their artistic rights had indeed been violated, but it refused to stop the ABC broadcasts. However, on appeal the team gained control over all subsequent US broadcasts of its programmes. The case also led to their gaining the rights from the BBC, once their original contracts ended at the end of 1980.\n\nThe show also aired on MTV during the network's infancy; \"Monty Python\" was part of a two-hour comedy block on Sunday nights that also included another BBC series, \"The Young Ones\".\n\nIn April 2006, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" returned to non-cable American television on PBS. In connection with this, PBS commissioned \"Monty Python's Personal Best\", a six-episode series featuring each Python’s favourite sketches, plus a tribute to Chapman, who died in 1989. BBC America has aired the series on a sporadic basis since the mid-2000s, in an extended 40-minute time slot in order to include commercials. Independent Film Channel acquired the rights to the show in 2009, though not exclusive, as BBC America still airs occasional episodes of the show. IFC also presented a six-part documentary \"\", produced by Terry Jones' son Bill.\n\n\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" placed fifth on a list of the BFI TV 100, drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, and voted for by industry professionals.\n\n\"Time\" magazine included the show on its 2007 list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\".\n\nIn a list of the 50 Greatest British Sketches released by Channel 4 in 2005, five Monty Python sketches made the list:\n\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" was ranked #5 and #6 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.\n\nIn 2013, the programme was ranked #58 on TV Guide's list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.\n\nDouglas Adams, creator of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" and co-writer of the \"Patient Abuse\" sketch, once said \"I loved Monty Python's Flying Circus. For years I wanted to be John Cleese, I was most disappointed when I found out the job had been taken.\"\n\nLorne Michaels counts the show as a major influence on his \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches. Cleese and Palin re-enacted the Dead Parrot sketch on \"SNL\" in 1997.\n\nThe show was a major influence on the Danish cult sketch show \"Casper & Mandrilaftalen\" (1999) and Cleese starred in its 50th episode.\n\nIn computing, the terms spam and the Python programming language, are both derived from the series.\n\nAs of 2013, questions concerning the Pythons' most famous sketches are incorporated in the examinations required of those seeking to become British citizens.\n\nThe production team was headed by Ian MacNaughton. Other regular team members included Hazel Pethig (costumes), Madelaine Gaffney (makeup) and John Horton (video effects designer). Maggie Weston, who worked on both makeup and design, married Gilliam in 1973 and they are still together. The series was primarily filmed in London studios and nearby locations, although location shooting to take in beaches and villages included filming in Somerset and Norwich.\n\nThe overall humour of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" is built on an inherent Britishness; it is “based on observations of British life, society, and institutions”. However, part of this focus is achieved through seeing the ‘other’ through a British lens. The often “excessive generalization and utterly banal stereotypes” can be seen as a persiflage of the views held by the British public, rather than poking fun at the cultures that were depicted.\n\nFor example, while American culture is not often in the foreground in many sketches, it is rather a frequent side note in many skits. Almost all of the 45 episodes produced for the BBC contain a reference to Americans or American culture, with 230 references total, resulting in approximately five references per show, but increasing over the course of the show. In total, 140 references to the American entertainment industry are made. Entertainment tropes, such as Westerns, Film noir and Hollywood are referenced 39 times. Further, there are 12 references to arts and literature, 15 to US politics, 5 to the American military, 7 to US historical events, 12 to locations in the US, 7 to space and science fiction, 21 economic references, such as brands like Pan-Am, Time-Life, and Spam, and 8 sports references. Some references do double count in various categories. It is also notable that American music is regularly heard in the show, such as the theme to the television series \"Dr. Kildare\", but most prominently the show's theme tune (\"The Liberty Bell\" by John Philip Sousa).\n\nWhile American entertainment was a pervasive cultural influence in Britain at the time of the production of the series, not all references to American culture can be seen as conscious decisions. For example, Terry Jones did not know that Spam was an American product at the time he wrote the sketch. Kevin Kern summarises in his analysis of references to the US 'that portrayals of American themes reflected three broad responses to American hegemony: 1) minor or passing references to specific individuals, events, or products of American culture, 2) American cultural tropes used to serve a general comedic purpose, and 3) satire aimed at American targets, specifically US economic power, the crassness or banality of American culture, or American violence and militarism'. However, Kern does not see this as exhibiting anti-American tendencies, but as 'a natural extension of the Pythons’ frequent (…) satirical focus on vulgarity, banality, violence, and militarism in the United Kingdom (…)' \n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography \n"}

{"id": "9033166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9033166", "title": "Names of the Berber people", "text": "Names of the Berber people\n\nThe ethnonym Berber dates to the 19th century, derived from \"Barbary\" the term for the Maghreb coast used during the early modern period, itself from Greek \"barbaria\" \"land of barbarians\".\nThe contemporary self-designation current mostly in Morocco is \"Imazighen\" (singular \"Amazigh\"). \nThis term is common in Morocco, especially among Central Atlas, Rifian and Shilah speakers in 1980, but elsewhere within the Berber homeland sometimes a local, more particular term, such as Kabyle (Kabyle comes from Arabic: tribal confederation) or Chaoui, is more often used instead in Algeria.\n\nThe Berber tribal populations of antiquity are known as Numidians and later as Mauri in classical antiquity. These are umbrella terms that would include populations whose self-designation was a variety of tribal names, although Strabo asserts that \"Mauri\" was also used indigenously.\nThe \"Libu\" of ancient Egyptian sources, eponymous of the name \"Libya\" may also have been an early Berber or Proto-Berber population. \n\nThe term \"Berber\" is a variation of the Greek original word \"barbaros\" (\"barbarian\"), earlier in history applied by Romans specifically to their northern hostile neighbors from Germania (modern Germany) and Celts, Iberians, Gauls, Goths and Thracians. The variation is a French one when spelled \"Berbère\" and English when spelled \"Berber\". The term appeared first in the 4th century in the religious conflicts between Saint Augustine, a Numidian Berber-Roman bishop of the Catholic faith, and the Berber Donatists of the Donatism faith who were allies of the Barbarian Vandals. The Vandals migrated from Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) where they were assailed by the Gauls allied to the Romans, and settled west of the Roman city of Carthage (in modern Tunisia) in the highlands (in modern Algeria).\n\nDerived terms include the toponym Barbary and the animals Barb horse and Barbary duck.\n\nThe Greek term \"βάρβαρος / βάρβαροι\" was originally a term for all non-Greek speakers, not necessarily used derogatively. The nonsense syllables \"bar-bar\" have no meaning in Greek; the term implied that all languages other than Greek were a collection of nonsense syllables. The term has been variously translated as \"stutterers,\" \"stammerers,\" or \"babblers.\" (Compare the widespread belief that the Dutch term \"Hottentot\", a term for the Khoikhoi people that came generally to mean 'barbarian', originated as an onomatopoetic term.) The term did in origin refer to any people of \"incomprehensible speech\" (cf. names for Germans), including Persia and Egypt; its connotation of uncivilized rudeness (cf. \"Philistine\" and \"Vandal\"), now the primary meaning of the term \"barbarian\", appears to have emerged in the Roman era or with the Migration period.\n\nBecause the Berbers were called \"Al-Barbar\" by the Arabs, the early modern \"Barbary\" seems to be a re-adoption of the name from Arabic.\nMuslim historiography has an eponymous \"Barbar\" as the ancestor of the Berbers, \"the Berbers were the descendants of Barbar, the son of Tamalla, the son of Mazigh, the son of Canaan, the son of Ham, the son of Noah\" (Ibn Khaldun, \"The History of Ibn Khaldun\", Chapter 3). \n\nAnother people called Berbers by medieval Arab, ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian geographers, respectively, were the ancestors of the Somalis. \"Barbara\", an ancient region on the northern coast of Somalia was referred to as Bilad al-Barbar (\"Land of the Berbers\").\n\nThe modern self-designation \"Imazighen\" (singular \"Amazigh\") apparently derives from the name of the \"Mazikes\" mentioned in Byzantine sources.\nThe Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines mentioned various tribes with similar names living in Greater Libya (North Africa) in the areas where Berbers were later found. Later tribal names differ from the classical sources, but are probably still related to the modern \"Amazigh\". The Meshwesh tribe among them represents the first thus identified from the field. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called a few centuries after in Greek Mazyes by Hektaios and Maxyes by Herodotus, while it was called after that the \"Mazaces\" and \"Mazax\" in Latin sources, and related to the later Massylii and Masaesyli. All those names are similar and perhaps foreign renditions to the name used by the Berbers in general for themselves, \"Imazighen\".\n\nLaredo (1954) proposed that the name Amazigh could be derived from the name of the ancestor \"Mezeg\" which is the translation of biblical ancestor Dedan son of Sheba in the \"Targum\". \nAccording to Leo Africanus, \"Amazigh\" meant \"free man\".\nEtymologically, the name may be related to the well attested \"aze\" strong, \"Tizzit\" bravery, or \"jeghegh\" to be brave/courageous. \nFurther it also has a cognate in the Tuareg word \"Amajegh\", meaning \"noble\".\n\n"}

The economic system that existed in the USSR was viewed by PNC members as socialist, but at the same time the political system was seen as non-socialist (neo-Stalinist, bureaucratic), which, in their opinion, represented the classic conflict of Marxism: the conflict between productive forces and the relations of production, and would inevitably lead to a political revolution. PNC members believed that the victory of a group of Joseph Stalin's supporters over their political opponents in the inner-party struggle within VKP (b) in the late 1920s and early 1930s was the reason of the fundamental differences between political and economic systems.\n\nPNC set it as their objective to perform a political revolution and return the country back to pre-Stalinist ideological and political foundations. Students were thought to be the vanguard of the new revolution.\n\nPNC had neither a developed structure, nor official theoretical documents (it was expected that such documents would be adopted by the future party conference). The organisation consisted of just two groups in Moscow and one in the city of Kaliningrad (presently known as Korolyov, a city in Moscow Region). \"The Principles of Neo-communism\" (Russian: Принципы неокоммунизма) written by A. Tarasov in the form of a catechism in November 1973, served as a temporary theoretical and programme document of the party. In some theoretical issues, important from the point of view of PNC members, they were guided by Tarasov's works, written in 1973-1974 and revised after they had been discussed within PNC. Such theoretical issues included: preference of revolutionary approach to the reformist one (based on the work \"Chile, Cyprus crisis and Eurocommunism\"); identification of the new Soviet philistines as representatives of petite bourgeoisie and a major reactionary force in the Soviet society (based on the work \"Swamp Rot. Black Hundreds as Revolutionary Counter-revolutionism of Petit Bourgeoisie\"); incompatibility of representative democracy and communism, the need for direct democracy (based on the work \"Every Man is a King\"). None of these works have survived; they were burnt in January 1975.\n\nPNC members were engaged in sourcing, selecting and distributing illegal literature (\"samizdat\" and literature of the pre-Stalinist period), established contacts among students and young people, promoted their ideas through verbal propaganda (in the 1970s, such propaganda was prosecuted as felony, which carried a penalty of up to seven years in prison under Art. 70 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR).\n\nIn the summer of 1974, PNC members ran a trial graffiti propaganda campaign, when they inscribed in chalk on buildings and fences about fifteen messages that read \"Revolution – here and now!\", \"Remove the seniles from power!\", \"Ten years is enough!\" (referring to long years of Brezhnev's term in office). The campaign proved to be a failure: the inscriptions were fairly dull in colour and were easily washed away by rain. It was decided to abandon the use of graffiti and start printing and distributing flyers.\n\nIn September 1973, PNC established contacts with another underground leftist group, called the Left School, having first concurred with them in their views on the reasons for the defeat of the Chilean revolution of 1970–1973 years, and then on the nature of the political regime in the USSR. In May 1974 PNC and Left School agreed to unite their forces, and in September 1974 they merged into one organization under the name of the Neo-Communist Party of the Soviet Union (NCPSU).\n\nDespite the agreement to merge, de facto PNC and the Left School were operating separately for some time; therefore, when part of the Moscow group of PNC (including its leaders) was arrested by the KGB in January 1975, the unaffected leaders of the Left School took on the task of saving the organisation through increased secrecy. They successfully kept the organization alive deep underground up until 1977, when arrested NCPSU leaders (from among former PNC members) were released to freedom and began to revive the party. Thus, until January 1977, PNC existed as a separate clandestine group effectively controlled by the Left School.\n\n\n"}

Starting in 1900, he attended the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He received a doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1910 and became famous for his Ph.D. dissertation \"La Révolution française et les lettres italiennes\" (1910). \n\nHazard began his career at the University of Lyon in 1910, teaching comparative literature. In 1919 he began teaching also at the Sorbonne. In 1925 Hazard was appointed to the chair of comparative literature at the Collège de France in Paris. In alternating years, from 1932 until 1940, he was a visiting lecturer at Columbia University in New York. During the 1920s and 1930s, Hazard also lectured at other American schools. He was elected to the Académie française in 1939. \n\nAfter finishing his semester of teaching at Columbia in 1940, Hazard voluntarily returned to Nazi occupied France in January 1941. He continued to teach, at Lyon and Paris, and to study. Later that same year Hazard was nominated to the rectorship of the University of Paris, but was rejected by the Nazis as unacceptable. Working under what have been described as cruel circumstances, he completed \"European Thought in the Eighteenth Century\". In the year of his death, an article, \"Pour que vive l'âme de la France\" (\"So That the Soul of France May Live\"), appeared in the clandestine review \"France de demain\". \n\nHazard died in Paris on 13 April 1944.\n\nHazard founded, with Fernand Baldensperger, the \"Revue de littérature comparée\" in 1921. Some of his important writings are \"Histoire illustrée de la littérature française\" (comp. with Joseph Bédier, 2 vol., 1923–24); \"Leopardi\" (1913); \"Lamartine\" (1926); \"Stendhal\" (1927); \"Don Quichotte\" (1931); and \"Les livres, les enfants et les hommes\" (1932) (\"Books, Children and Men\" tr. 1944). This last work has been described as a sensitive appraisal of works written either for very young readers, or taken over by them, covering all Europe over many centuries. In this book, he was the first to point out that Northern Europe surpassed Southern Europe in children's literature. \n\nHazard is known today mainly for two works. The first was \"La Crise de la conscience européenne\", 1935 (\"The European Mind, the Critical Years, 1680-1715, tr. 1952\"). This work examined the conflict between 17th-century Neoclassicism and its ideals of order and perfection and the ideas of the Enlightenment. \n\nThe other was his last completed work \"La Pensée européenne au XVIIIème siècle, de Montesquieu à Lessing\" (1946) (\"European Thought in the Eighteenth Century from Montesquieu to Lessing\", tr. 1954) published posthumously in 1946. This work was a continuation of the subject matter discussed in \"The European Mind\". Apparently, Hazard intended a third volume which would have focused on \"the Man of Feeling. On that enterprise we have already embarked. One day, perchance, we shall complete it. One day, \"si vis suppeditat\", as the Romans used to say.\" (\"European Thought in the Eighteenth Century\", p. xx) Hazard did not live to complete it.\n\n"}

Perelman Building—originally the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company Building—is an annex of the Philadelphia Museum of Art containing exhibition galleries, offices, conservation labs, and the museum library. It is an Art Deco building that features cathedral-like entrances and is adorned with sculpture and gilding. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Perelman Building is located at the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and Fairmount Avenue, facing the Philadelphia Museum of Art's main building across Kelly Drive.\n\nPhiladelphia architectural firm Zantzinger, Borie and Medary, which had collaborated on the Philadelphia Museum of Art, designed the building to be the headquarters for Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company. Construction began in 1926 and the building was completed in 1928. Sculptor Lee Lawrie created its decorative scheme, which features polychrome facades adorned with figures symbolizing attributes of insurance: the owl of wisdom, the dog of fidelity, the pelican of charity, the opossum of protection, and the squirrel of frugality.

In 1982, it was acquired and restored by the Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, which in turn relocated in 1999.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the building in 1999 through the City of Philadelphia. In anticipation of its 125th anniversary in 2001, the museum began a capital campaign that collected $240 million in donations. In recognition of the $15 million contributed by the Perelmans, the annex was renamed the Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman Building in 2000. Gluckman Mayner Architects restored and renovated the historic building, and expanded it with a addition. The Perelman Building opened on September 15, 2007.\n\nThe Perelman Building's six galleries total of exhibition space. \n\n"}

The death of an elder sister and his father within a few months when he was three gave his writing \"a black savagery\". He was raised by his Norwegian mother, who took him on annual trips to Norway, where she told him the stories of trolls and witches present in the dark Scandinavian fables. Dahl was influenced by the stories, and returned to many of the themes in his children's books. His mother also nurtured a passion in the young Dahl for reading and literature.\n\nDuring the Second World War Dahl was a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the subsequent injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C.S. Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use in an article in \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to \"The Gremlins\", a serialised story in \"Cosmopolitan\" about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, \"James and the Giant Peach\", was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964), \"Fantastic Mr Fox\" (1970), \"Danny, the Champion of the World\" (1975), \"The BFG\" (1982) and \"Matilda\" in 1988.\n\nDahl's first script was for a stage work, \"The Honeys\", which appeared on Broadway in 1955. He followed this with a television script, \"Lamb to the Slaughter\", for the \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" series. He also co-wrote screenplays for film, including for \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967) and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968). In 1982 Dahl published the first of three editions of poems—all aimed at children. The following year he edited a book of ghost stories. He also wrote several works of non-fiction, including three autobiographies, a cookery book, a safety leaflet for the British railways and a book on measles, which was about the death of his daughter Olivia from measles encephalitis.\n\nAs at 2015, Dahl's works have been translated into 59 languages and have sold more than 200 million books worldwide. His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008 \"The Times\" placed Dahl 16th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". He has been referred to by an anonymous writer for \"The Independent\" as \"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\" On Dahl's death in 1990, Howard considered him \"one of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation\".\n\nMany of Dahl's works were used as the basis for films or television programmes. The following are where he is credited as the writer of the performed script.\n\n"}

The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems.\n\nThe score tables below only describe points-giving conditions. In cases where the physiological parameters do not match any row, zero points are given. In cases where the physiological parameters match more than one row, the row with most points is picked.\n\nThe quick SOFA score (qSOFA) assists health care providers in estimating the risk of morbidity and mortality due to sepsis.\n\nThe SOFA scoring system is useful in predicting the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients. According to an observational study at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Belgium, the mortality rate is at least 50% when the score is increased, regardless of initial score, in the first 96 hours of admission, 27% to 35% if the score remains unchanged, and less than 27% if the score is reduced.\n\nqSOFA has also been found to be poorly sensitive though decently specific for the risk of death with SIRS possibly better for screening.\n\nThe Quick SOFA Score (quickSOFA or qSOFA) was introduced by the Sepsis-3 group in February 2016 as a simplified version of the SOFA Score as an initial way to identify patients at high risk for poor outcome with an infection. The SIRS Criteria definitions of sepsis are being replaced as they were found to possess too many limitations; the “current use of 2 or more SIRS criteria to identify sepsis was unanimously considered by the task force to be unhelpful.” The qSOFA simplifies the SOFA score drastically by only including its 3 clinical criteria and by including \"any altered mentation\" instead of requiring a GCS <15. qSOFA can easily and quickly be repeated serially on patients.\n\nThe score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points near the onset of infection was associated with a greater risk of death or prolonged intensive care unit stay. These are outcomes that are more common in infected patients who may be septic than those with uncomplicated infection. Based upon these findings, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis recommends qSOFA as a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to be septic.\n\n"}
{"id": "4106285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4106285", "title": "Self-referential encoding", "text": "Self-referential encoding\n\nEvery day, people are presented with endless amounts of information, and in an effort to help keep track and organize this information, people must be able to recognize, differentiate and store information. One way to do that is to organize information as it pertains to the self. The overall concept of self-reference suggests that people interpret incoming information in relation to themselves, using their self-concept as a background for new information. Examples include being able to attribute personality traits to oneself or to identify recollected episodes as being personal memories of the past. The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the \"cocktail party effect\" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of implicit self-esteem). For example, people tend to prefer their own initials over other letters. The self-reference effect (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of self-referential encoding and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential mnemonic properties of self-reference.\n\nResearch includes investigations into self-schema, self-concept and self-awareness as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in memory. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including simulation theory and the effect.\nAfter researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with autism spectrum disorders or those experiencing depression.\n\nSelf-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or schemata. A self-schema is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves. For any given trait, an individual may or may not be \"schematic\"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered \"schematic\" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self. When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory. Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema. Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.\n\nSelf-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data. The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema. When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and recalled. These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema. Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.\n\nSelf-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university). Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.\n\nIn order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks. Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were \"like me\" or \"not like me,\" they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.\n\nHowever, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive. Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.\n\nIn addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure. That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the \"like me\" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.\n\nTwo of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation. The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self. Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly. Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness. The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment. The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.\n\nIn later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge. It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.\n\nIn order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence \"The robber took the money from the bank\". In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory. Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.\n\nIn reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information. Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.\n\nSimilar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between Type A and Type B behavior patterns, focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.\n\nInfluential psychologists Craik and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory. Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and semantic encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive adjectives on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an \"incidental recall task\". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and phonemic tasks lead only to \"shallow\" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to \"deep\" encoding and resulted in better recall.\n\nHowever, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks. Experts suggest that the call on associative memory required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding. The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 \"revisited\" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the \"self\" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.\n\nResearchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding. Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect. Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A meta-analysis by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on semantic encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.\n\nTheorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks. Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory. Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata. Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.\n\nAs research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as \"self-descriptive.\" Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory. In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.\n\nIn a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not. For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive. The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.\n\nWhile a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis. Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self. Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.\n\nElaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory. By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed. Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases. The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace, due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.\n\nThe organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom. This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations. These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall. Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones. Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.\n\nStructural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not. Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior \n\nPsychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval. Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.\nUltimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks. To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing. Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.\n\nOverall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled. The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.\n\nThe field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior. Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics. Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states. Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning. As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.\n\nThe research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval. One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.\n\nMedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information. When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present. The caudate nucleus has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives. The ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative. There is also pCC (posterior cingulate cortex) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.\n\nGiven all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks. The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.\n\nWhile not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the simulation theory of empathy. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves. In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others. The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference. However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the false-consensus effect.\n\nIn addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity. Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.\n\nPrevious research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members into the development of their self-concept. From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible. Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.\n\nIn order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found. Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.\n\nDespite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference. Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.\nBoth experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars. Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks. Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.\n\nGroups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect. We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves. Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self. Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory. This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.\n\nUltimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place. Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.\n\nOnce the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms. Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more \"self-focused.\" That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective. Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compiling them to make a whole picture \n\nNoting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with self-awareness, it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes. Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory. In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: \"the self,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, \"similar close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, \"dissimilar non-close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.\n\nTherefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals. However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.\n\nLombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures. This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.\n\nUltimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can mentalize with others.\n\nThere are three possible relations between cognitive processes and anxiety and depression. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of major depression or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders. Kovacs and Beck (1977) posited a schematic model of depression where an already depressed self was primed by outside prompts that negatively impacted cognitive illusions of the world in the eye of oneself. These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior. The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder. Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives. Those suffering from a more mild case of depression have trouble deciphering between the traits of themselves and others which results in a loss of their self-esteem and their negative self-evaluation. A depressive schema is what causes the negativity reported by those suffering from depression. Kuiper and Derry found that self-referent recall enhancement was limited only to nondepressed content.\n\nGenerally, self-focus is association with negative emotions. In particular private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression than public self-focus. Results from brain-imaging studies shows\nthat during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than\nnon-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.\n"}

The plot involves the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. Frank Graham voiced the wolf, and Colleen Collins voiced Cinderella, with Imogene Lynn providing her singing voice.\n\nAt the beginning, the Big Bad Wolf is chasing the young version of Little Red Riding Hood from the beginning of \"Red Hot Riding Hood\". But then Little Red stops and points out that the two of them are in the wrong cartoon. The Wolf shoos away Little Red and decides to go and meet Cinderella (played by Red from \"Red Hot Riding Hood\"). He takes a taxi to her house and immediately falls in love with her upon seeing her, but she sternly rebuffs him. Eventually, Cinderella calls her Fairy Godmother (played by Grandma from \"Red Hot Riding Hood\") to get rid of him and set her up for that night's ball. The second the Fairy Godmother hears that there's a Wolf, she rushes right over. The Fairy Godmother traps the Wolf, then gives Cinderella a sexy dress and transforms a pumpkin into a Woodie for her to go the ball, but tells Cinderella that she has to get home by midnight (just like in the classic fairy tale).\n\nThe oversexed Fairy Godmother then keeps the Wolf busy. She appears before him in an old-fashioned 1890s swimsuit (\"Miss Repulsive 1898\") and then an evening gown before trying to snuggle up to him on the couch. She chases him all around Cinderella's house, but the Wolf escapes when he gets the Fairy Godmother's wand, turning Cinderella's bathtub into a convertible. He leaves for the nightclub where Cinderella is performing, with the Fairy Godmother in pursuit. Soon after arriving, the Wolf accidentally kisses the Fairy Godmother, thinking she was Cinderella, which only further deepens her lust for the Wolf. Cinderella soon comes out on-stage and performs an exotic dance while singing the song \"Oh Wolfie\" (to the tune of \"Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!\"). The Wolf howls and chases after Cinderella, but the smitten Godmother uses various methods (usually a mallet) to keep him in line.\n\nAfter the performance, more brief chasing ensues until the clock strikes midnight. Cinderella rushes home as the Fairy Godmother's transformation wears off, but she manages to make it home in time--it turns out that Cinderella's a Rosie the Riveter and that the reason she had to be home by midnight was so she wouldn't be late for the night shift. Cinderella's relieved to be rid of the Wolf, but it's revealed that the bus is full of wolves, who start wolf-whistling and catcalling at her.\n\n\nThe short includes wartime references. The motor scooter of the fairy godmother displays an \"A\" gas ration sticker. She later uses a jeep. Cinderella is a welder, working the midnight shift at the Lockweed Aircraft Plant. There is also a female cabdriver depicted, a frequently used motif during the War.\n\n"}

{"id": "70798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70798", "title": "Valkyrie", "text": "Valkyrie\n\nIn Norse mythology, a valkyrie (; from Old Norse \"chooser of the slain\") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess Freyja's afterlife field ), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Odin. There, the deceased warriors become (Old Norse \"single (or once) fighters\"). When the are not preparing for the events of Ragnarök, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.\n\nValkyries are attested in the \"Poetic Edda\" (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the \"Prose Edda\", the (both by Snorri Sturluson) and the (one of the Sagas of Icelanders), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of skalds, in a 14th-century charm, and in various runic inscriptions.\n\nThe Old English cognate terms and appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the Norns, and the , all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.\n\nThe word \"valkyrie\" derives from Old Norse ' (plural ), which is composed of two words: the noun ' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ' (meaning \"to choose\"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse is cognate to Old English '. From the Old English and Old Norse forms, philologist Vladimir Orel reconstructs the Proto-Germanic form . However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the Old English attestations section below.\n\nOther terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include (\"wish maid\"), appearing in the poem and (\"Odin's maids\"), appearing in the . may be related to the Odinic name (roughly meaning \"wish fulfiller\"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.\n\nValkyries are mentioned or appear in the \"Poetic Edda\" poems \"Völuspá\", \"Grímnismál\", \"Völundarkviða\", \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\", \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\" and \"Sigrdrífumál\".\n\nIn stanza 30 of the poem \"Völuspá\", a völva (a travelling seeress in Norse society) tells Odin that \"she saw\" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to \"the realm of the gods\". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: Skuld (Old Norse, possibly \"debt\" or \"future\") who \"bore a shield\", Skögul (\"shaker\"), Gunnr (\"war\"), Hildr (\"battle\"), Göndul (\"wand-wielder\") and Geirskögul (\"Spear-Skögul\"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the \"ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth\".\n\nIn the poem \"Grímnismál\", Odin (disguised as \"Grímnir\"), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young Agnar that he wishes that the valkyries Hrist (\"shaker\") and Mist (\"cloud\") would \"bear him a [drinking] horn\", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says \"bear ale to the einherjar\"; Skeggjöld (\"axe-age\"), Skögul, Hildr, Þrúðr (\"power\"), Hlökk (\"noise\", or \"battle\"), Herfjötur (\"host-fetter\"), Göll (\"tumult\"), Geirahöð (\"spear-fight\"), Randgríð (\"shield-truce\"), Ráðgríð (\"council-truce\") and Reginleif (\"power-truce\").\n\nA prose introduction in the poem \"Völundarkviða\" relates that the brothers Slagfiðr, Egil and Völund dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir (\"wolf dales\"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár (\"wolf lake\"), and \"near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries\". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named Hlaðguðr svanhvít (\"swan-white\") and Hervör alvitr (possibly meaning \"all-wise\" or \"strange creature\"); the third, daughter of Kjárr of Valland, is named Ölrún (possibly meaning \"beer rune\"). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.\n\nIn the poem \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\", a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a burial mound. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as Sváva, King Eylimi's daughter, who \"often protected him in battles\". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name \"Helgi\" (meaning \"the holy one\"). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as \"bright-face lady\", and asks her what gift he will receive with the name she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail. Further into the poem, Atli flytes with the female jötunn Hrímgerðr. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:\n\nAfter Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva \"was a valkyrie just as before\". The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva \"are said to be reincarnated\".\n\nIn the poem \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", the hero Helgi Hundingsbane sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the fell, and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length mail armour is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:\n\nIn the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as \"southern goddesses\") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigrún (\"victory-rune\"), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was \"a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries\", adding that all of the einherjar \"had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account\". Further in the poem, the phrase \"the valkyrie's airy sea\" is used for \"mist\".\n\nTowards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as \"the troll-woman's mount\") consume corpses:\n\nThe battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.\n\nAt the beginning of the poem \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\", a prose narrative says that King Sigmund (son of Völsung) and his wife Borghild (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\"). After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is \"a valkyrie and rode through air and sea\", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated. In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase \"fed the gosling of Gunn's sisters\". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are ravens, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.\n\nAfter stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land. Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that \"there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated\" and that \"Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn\" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of Halfdan; the valkyrie Kára. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work \"Káruljóð\".\n\nIn the prose introduction to the poem \"Sigrdrífumál\", the hero Sigurd rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards \"the land of the Franks\". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, \"as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky\". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a \"skjaldborg\" with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the \"skjaldborg\", and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's corslet is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.\n\nThe woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and that she is a valkyrie.\n\nA narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had \"brought down\" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again \"fight victoriously in battle\", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes, mystic wisdom, and prophecy.\n\nIn the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book \"Gylfaginning\", where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says \"there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups.\" Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem \"Grímnismál\" that contains a list of valkyries. High says \"these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory\". High adds that Gunnr (\"war\"), Róta, and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as \"the youngest norn\"—\"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle\". In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr, with them came the valkyries and also Odin's ravens.\n\nReferences to valkyries appear throughout the book \"Skáldskaparmál\", which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work \"Húsdrápa\" by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:\n\nFurther in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem \"Eiríksmál\" is provided (see the \"Fagrskinna\" section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):\n\nIn chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including \"[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or \"dísir\"\". In chapter 41, while the hero Sigurd is riding his horse Grani, he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a coat of mail. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and \"she is known as Brynhildr, and was a valkyrie\".\n\nIn chapter 48, poetic terms for \"battle\" include \"weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise\", followed by examples of compositions by various skalds that have used the name of valkyries in said manner (Þorbjörn Hornklofi uses \"Skögul's din\" for \"battlefield\", Bersi Skáldtorfuson uses \"Gunnr's fire\" for \"sword\" and \"Hlökk's snow\" for \"battle\", Einarr Skúlason uses \"Hildr's sail\" for \"shield\" and \"Göndul's crushing wind\" for \"battle\" and Einarr skálaglamm uses \"Göndul's din\"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term \"death-maidens\"—Old Norse \"valmeyjar\"—instead of \"valkyries\" is used here), with further examples. In chapter 57, within a list of names of ásynjur (and after alternate names for the goddess Freyja are provided), a further section contains a list of \"Odin's maids\"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, Eir, Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that \"they are called norns who shape necessity\".\n\nSome manuscripts of the feature \"Nafnaþulur\" section of \"Skáldskaparmál\" contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the \"valkyries of Viðrir\"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.\n\nThe fragmentary skaldic poem \"Hrafnsmál\" (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of Harald I of Norway. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a \"high-minded\", \"golden-haired\" and \"white-armed\" maiden speaking with a \"glossy-beaked raven\". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:\n\nThe valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:\n\nThe black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.\n\nIn chapter 157 of \"Njáls saga\", a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called \"Darraðarljóð\", which Dörruð memorizes.\n\nThe song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf (fought outside Dublin in 1014 CE). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, Hjörþrimul, Sanngriðr, Svipul, Guðr and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:\n\nAt the end of the poem, the valkyries sing \"start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!\" The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.\n\nAt the end of the \"Heimskringla\" saga \"Hákonar saga góða\", the poem \"Hákonarmál\" by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died \"among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you\". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, \"words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla\". The poem \"Hákonarmál\" is then provided.\n\nIn \"Hákonarmál\", Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to \"choose among the kings' kinsmen\" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning \"Skögul's-stormblast\" for \"battle\". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that \"groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads\". Haakon hears \"what the valkyries said\", and the valkyries are described as sitting \"high-hearted on horseback\", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:\n\nSkögul says that they shall now ride forth to the \"green homes of the godheads\" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.\n\nIn chapter 8 of \"Fagrskinna\", a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as \"Eiríksmál\". It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse \"Óðinn\"):\n\nThe god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.\n\nA witchcraft trial held in 1324 in Bergen, Norway, records a spell used by the accused Ragnhild Tregagás to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie Göndul being \"sent out\":\n\nThe Old English and appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon , written by Wulfstan II, is used, and considered to appear as word for a human \"sorceress\". An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) glosses with (with meaning \"goddess\"). is used to translate the names of the classical furies in two manuscripts (Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, and the older \"Corpus Glossary\"). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, is also used to gloss the Roman goddess Bellona. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as (meaning \"dark one choosing the slain\"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).\n\nViking Age stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing drinking horns, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because \"they were thought to have protective powers\".\n\nThe Tjängvide image stone from the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.\n\nIn 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that \"there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700\".\n\nSpecific valkyries are mentioned on two runestones; the early 9th century Rök Runestone in Östergötland, Sweden, and the 10th-century Karlevi Runestone on the island of Öland, Sweden, which mentions the valkyrie Þrúðr. On the Rök Runestone, a kenning is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:\n\nAmong the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, Norway, is the \"valkyrie stick\" from the late 14th century. The stick features a runic inscription intended as a charm. The inscription says that \"I cut cure-runes\", and also \"help-runes\", once against elves, twice against trolls, thrice against thurs and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:\n\nThis is followed by \"I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and \"jöluns\" wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself.\" According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription \"seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie\", and they posit the final line appears \"to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman\".\n\nMacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sigrdrífumál\", where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term \"skag\" is unclear, but a cognate exists in \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\" where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a \"\"skass\"-valkyrie\". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like \"supernatural sending\", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also \"sent forth\".\n\nThe Old Norse poems \"Völuspá\", \"Grímnismál\", \"Darraðarljóð\" and the \"Nafnaþulur\" section of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\", provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as \"Sigrún\" (who is attested in the poems \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\" and \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\"). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds.\n\nSome valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name \"Herja\" has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess \"Hariasa\", who is attested from a stone from 187 CE. The name \"Herfjötur\" has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters. The name \"Svipul\" may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or ørlog—a Germanic concept of fate.\n\nRichard North says that the description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army (glossed as ) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of in may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse , but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the \"Corpus Glossary\" instances \"appear to show an Anglo-Saxon conception of that was independent of contemporary Scandinavian influence\".\n\nTwo Old English charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; , a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and \"For a Swarm of Bees\", a charm to keep honey bees from swarming. In , a sudden pain is attributed to a small, \"shrieking\" spear thrown with supernatural strength () by \"fierce\" loudly flying \"mighty women\" () who have ridden over a burial mound:\n\n<poem>They were loud, yes, loud,\nwhen they rode over the (burial) mound;\nthey were fierce when they rode across the land.\nShield yourself now, you can survive this strife.\nOut, little spear, if there is one here within.\nIt stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,\nwhere those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.</poem>\n\nTheories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries. Richard North says that \"though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse .\" Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke \"a prosaic stitch in the side\". Towards the end of \"For a Swarm of Bees\", the swarming bees are referred to as \"victory-women\" (Old English ):\n\n<poem>Settle down, victory-women,\nnever be wild and fly to the woods.\nBe as mindful of my welfare,\nas is each man of eating and of home.</poem>\n\nThe term \"victory women\" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the \"victorious sword\" (the stinging) of the bees.\n\nOne of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings—\"Idisi\"—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:\n\n<poem>Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,\nsome bound fetters, some hampered the army,\nsome untied fetters:\nEscape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.</poem>\n\nThe \"Idisi\" mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that \"these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology\" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name (Old Norse \"army-fetter\"). Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English charm and theorises a similar role for them both.\n\nSimek says that the West Germanic term \"Idisi\" (, , ) refers to a \"dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin \" and that a link to the North Germanic term is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name Idisiaviso (meaning \"plain of the Idisi\") where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name \"Idisiaviso\", the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.\n\nRegarding the , Simek states that Old Norse appears commonly as simply a term for \"woman\", just as Old High German , Old Saxon and Old English , and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, \"several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in I 19 the valkyries are even called \"Odin's \". The are explicitly called dead women in 28 and a secondary belief that the were the souls of dead women (see ) also underlies the of Icelandic folklore. Simek says that \"as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the , like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.\"\n\nJacob Grimm states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a can be both norn and a valkyrie, \"but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs \"ride\" to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods\".\n\nVarious theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as \"demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged\", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred \"when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise\". Simek says that this original concept was \"superseded by the shield girls—Irish female warriors who lived on like the \"einherjar\" in Valhall.\" Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as \"demons of death\". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry, and during this transition were stripped of their \"demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...].\" Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old, and that the names \"mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief.\"\n\nMacLeod and Mees theorise that \"the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the Norns, the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...].\"\n\nHilda Ellis Davidson says that, regarding valkyries, \"evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the seeresses, who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea\". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a \"priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle.\"\n\nDavidson places emphasis on the fact that \"valkyrie\" literally means \"chooser of the slain\". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a \"chooser of the slain\" in his \"Sermo Lupi ad Anglos\" sermon, which appears among \"a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers\", to \"all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions\", and concludes as those \"are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well.\" Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an \"old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon\" (who Fadlan refers to as the \"Angel of Death\") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that \"it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god \"chose\" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war.\" Davidson says that it appears that from \"early times\" the Germanic peoples \"believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain.\"\n\nThe goddess Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in \"Gylfaginning\" where it is said of Freyja \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain\", and interprets \"Fólkvangr\" as \"the field of the Warriors\". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"\n\nSiegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar and the dísir.\"\n\nValkyries have been the subjects of various poems, works of art and musical works. In poetry, valkyries appear in \"\"Die Walküren\" by H. Heine (appearing in \"Romanzero\", 1847), \"\"Die Walküren\" (1864) by H. v. Linge, and \"\"Sköldmon\" (appearing in \"Gömda Land\", 1904).\n\nWorks of art depicting valkyries include \"Die Walküren\" (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, \"Reitende Walküre\" (fresco), previously located in Munich palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, \"Valkyrien\" and \"Valkyriens død\" (paintings, both from 1860), \"Walkürenritt\" (etching, 1871) by A. Welti, \"Walkürenritt\" (woodcut, 1871) by T. Pixis, \"Walkürenritt\" (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), \"Die Walkyren\" (charcoal, 1880) and \"Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten\" (painting, 1882) and \"Walkyrenschlacht\" (oil painting, 1884) by K. Ehrenberg, \"Walkürenritt\" (oil painting, 1888, and etching, 1890) by A. Welti, \"Walküre\" (statue) by H. Günther, \"Walkürenritt\" (oil painting) by H. Hendrich, \"Walkürenritt\" (painting) by F.

Dollman, \"Valkyrie\" (statue, 1910) and \"Walhalla-freeze\" (located in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, 1886–87), \"Walkyrien\" (print, 1915) by A. Kolb, and \"Valkyrier\" (drawing, 1925) by E. Hansen.\n\n"}

This site was formerly available in English via Yahoo!, where it was known as Yahooligans! until December 2006, and in Korean via Yahoo! Korea.\n\nThe website is used for both educational and entertainment purposes. It was established in March 1996 by Yahoo! to give children a venue to find appropriate, safe Internet content. Yahoo! Kids is the oldest online search directory for children.\n\nYahoo! Kids and other less popular products were discontinued in English on April 30, 2013 and Korean earlier in the year, allowing the company to redirect its resources to mobile applications.\n\nYahoo! Kids, originally known as Yahooligans!, was founded in March 1996 by Yahoo! to provide children with a venue to find appropriate, safe Internet content. The website was the oldest online search directory for children. The website's editors stated that Yahoo! Kids was \"cool, goofy, fascinating, fun, hysterical, philosophical, surprising, sedate, silly, seismic, popular, obscure, useful, and interesting\". In October 1999, \"The New York Times\" reporter Michelle Slatalla noted that Yahooligans! was a \"heavily trafficked site\", with 463,000 visitors accessing the website in August 1999. In October 1999, the website received an Alexa Internet rank of 991 out of 22 million content websites.\n\nIn 2004, Yahoo! entered into a partnership with DIC Entertainment to establish Yahooligans! TV, which gave users access to DIC's 3,000 hours of animated children programs. DIC Entertainment president Brad Brooks stated that the partnership \"offer[ed] advertisers a cross platform purchase\". Yahoo! sold the ads and the revenue from the commercials was split between the two companies.\n\nThe website was used for both educational and entertainment purposes. The Yahoo! Kids' portal had directories such as \"Around the World\", \"Arts & Entertainment\", \"Computers & Games\", \"School Bell\", \"Science & Nature\", and \"Sports & Recreation\". Under the directory \"School Bell\", the category \"Homework Answers\" allowed children to access websites pertaining to school subjects such as geography, history, and math. Under \"Around the World\", children could learn about countries, politics, and history. The \"Art Soup\" directory taught children about museums and drama, and the \"Scoop\" let them look at comics and newspapers. It had an Associated Press section to let children read age-appropriate articles.\n\nThe parents' section of the website contained advice about being safe while browsing the Internet and links to services that \"block and filter websites\". The teachers' section contained lesson plans for \"planning, implementing and assessing integrated units\". It was separated into three ranks: kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grade, and sixth to eighth grade.\n\nEducational professionals and former teachers screened each website listed in Yahooligans. The homepage displayed links to games, jokes, news, and sports. For the latter three, the content was crafted for those younger than 12. Yahooligans! directed viewers to child-friendly websites like those from Smithsonian Institution and Louvre. It adopted the persona of Bill Clinton's pet cat, Socks, to introduce viewers to the White House's website in 1995. Games provided on the Yahoo! Kids website included Chinese checkers, Go Fish, and Checkers. Age-appropriate offsite games were also accessible via the links under the \"games\" tab. The website offered an instant messaging gadget that allows children to participate in live chats with notable people, such as Bill Clinton, J. K. Rowling, and Bill Nye the Science Guy.\n\nIn March 2011, Yahoo! Kids partnered with the TV series near the season's finale to have children pose questions to Chewbacca. Question submissions were posted on SurveyMonkey, and Yahoo! Kids posted Chewbacca's answers on March 28. The approximately three-minute long video consisted of Chewbacca pantomiming responses to queries such as \"How do you deal with all that hair?\"\n\nIn August 1996, Greg Mefford of \"The Galveston Daily News\" (later renamed to \"The Daily News\") stated that Yahooligans is \"as much fun as it is educational, with links to darn near everything\". \"Kokomo Tribune\" columnist Amy Irick wrote in January 1998 that Yahooligans! was a \"great alternative to the Yahoo! search engine for younger computer users\". In August 1999, Irick said that Yahooligans! was \"very user friendly, just like its parent Yahoo!\" and that its teachers' guide is a \"must see for teachers\". \"Indiana Gazette\"s John Smathers wrote in June 2002, \"I can't mention kids sites without mentioning Yahooligans.com\", praising the website as a \"great tool to teach kids more about Internet surfing\".\n\nIn June 2005, reviewer Gail Junion-Metz of the \"School Library Journal\" praised Yahooligans! Games, writing that it is \"[o]ne of the best spots to find kid-appropriate games that don't require downloads\". In a September 1998 review of the website, John Hilvert and Linda Bruce of \"PC User\" (now named \"TechLife\") wrote that \"Yahooligans is one of the best specialized engines, particularly for homework answers.\"\n\nIn July 2007, reviewer Holly Gunn of \"Teacher Librarian\" praised Yahoo! Kids for its helpful, comprehensible results but criticized it for having an interface filled with too many ads and that was \"too busy and filled with too many diversions. Useful material is buried amidst entertainment\".\n\nYahoo! Kids closed on April 30, 2013. In February 2013, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer told an investor conference that the company aimed to slash their approximately 60–75 products to about 12, increasing their attention on mobile device applications. In an April 19, 2013, blog post announcing Yahoo! Kids' closure, Yahoo! Executive Vice president of Platforms Jay Rossiter wrote: [W]e want to bring you experiences that inspire and entertain you every day. That means taking a hard look at all of our products to make sure they are still central to your daily habits. As part of that ongoing effort, today we are shutting down a few more products.\n\nHe said that Yahoo! would redirect those resources to newer products like email and weather mobile applications.\n\nRossiter wrote that Yahoo!'s \"youngest users\" could continue using the company's services. Children younger than 13 could create a Yahoo! account through Yahoo!'s Family Accounts program. Young users could also find age-appropriate movies through the \"Family Movies\" section of Yahoo! Movies.\n\n\n\n"}

A native of the national capital Bucharest, she was educated at its main university, going on to become a professor there. Together with a focus on interdisciplinary studies, she was noted for devoting several studies to Mihail Eminescu. Meanwhile, Dumitrescu was a dignitary of the Romanian Communist Party. Following the Romanian Revolution, after several years spent in Rome, she retired to a monastery.\n\nBorn in Bucharest, her parents were Nicolae Dumitrescu, a jurist, and his wife Maria (\"née\" Apostol). In her native city, she attended primary school (1927–1931) and the Central School for Girls (1931–1939). An early lover of music, she was unable to pursue a career in that field due to medical reasons. Enrolling in the University of Bucharest, she studied law from 1939 to 1943 and literature from 1944 to 1948, and earned a doctorate in 1970. Also, from 1947 to 1948, around the time a communist regime was established in her country, she went to the Soviet Union to attend the Gorky Pedagogical Institute. Dumitrescu worked as an editor at Editura de Stat from 1948 to 1949, and at Editura pentru Literatură until 1957. Hired as teaching assistant at her alma mater in 1949, she rose to assistant professor in 1951, associate professor in 1963, full professor in 1971 and began chairing the department of universal and comparative literature in 1975. Critic Alex. Ștefănescu, a former student, recalled her courses as being \"impressive in their erudition and solemnity, and through a veneration of humanist values visibly at odds with the proletarian egalitarianism promoted by the communist regime\".\n\nHaving been a researcher there until 1957, she rose to director of the George Călinescu Institute of Literary History and Theory in 1973. She was admitted to the Romanian Writers' Union in 1963. From 1970 to 1982, she served as vice president of the Social and Political Sciences Academy. She was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1974. In 1975, she became president of the Romanian National Committee for Comparative Literature, from 1973 to 1979 was on the executive board of the International Comparative Literature Association, and in 1972 was visiting professor at the University of Amsterdam. Dumitrescu's rapid ascent in academia drew the ire of Elena Ceaușescu, who eventually decided to halt her progress. She directed two magazines, \"Synthesis\" and \"Revista de istorie și teoria literară\". A comparatist and critic in the Anglo-German mould, her interests included interdisciplinarity and philosophy of culture. Among her books were \"Renașterea: Umanismul și dialogul artelor\" (1971), \"Valori și echivalențe umanistice\" (1973), \"Periplu umanistic\" (1980) and \"Itinerarii prin cultură\" (1982). Dumitrescu also initiated and coordinated several syntheses of literary history for the institute she led. Four books she published between 1964 and 1989 closely analyze the works of poet Mihail Eminescu. A gifted communicator, she spoke widely: before students, in conference halls and on radio and television, emerging as a public intellectual.\n\nDumitrescu joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1966, the year after Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power. She was a member of the party's central committee from August 1969 to November 1974. She served two terms in the Great National Assembly, representing Bucharest districts both times: from 1975 to 1980 and from 1980 to 1985. She was awarded the Order of 23 August, fourth class; this was followed in 1971 by the Cultural Merit Order, second class; and by the special prize of the Writers' Union in 1986 and 1989. She was granted the Order of Cyril and Methodius by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1977, and the following year became a commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. She took the Herder Prize in 1988. In 1990, following the Romanian Revolution, she was elevated to titular membership of the Romanian Academy. From 1991 to 1997, she headed the \"Accademia di Romania\" in Rome.\n\nLate in life, beginning around 2000, she spent most of her time at the Romanian Orthodox Văratec Monastery and ultimately took the vows of a nun, adopting the name Benedicta. She had been introduced to the monastery by Valeria, the widow of writer Mihail Sadoveanu, who invited her to spend summers there. Dumitrescu was herself a widow, having married at age 29, and had no children. She died in Iași and was buried at Putna Monastery. Writing shortly after her death, Ștefănescu claimed that her rapprochement with the regime was motivated by a desire to be left alone, permitted to teach the humanities at home and assert the importance of Romanian culture abroad. He lamented that this stance drew opprobrium in the post-communist period, both from \"maniacal vigilantes bereft of a feeling for nuance\" and from \"poorly educated youths of the sort who deface statues with paint\".\n"}
