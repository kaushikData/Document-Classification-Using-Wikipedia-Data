It is one of the earliest known books printed on the topic specifically, providing detailed instructions and guidelines on window-dressing, drapery and display windows for the use of professional retailers and privately owned homes.\n\nThrough its descriptions of virtual topics in business, marketing techniques associated with window product display, and the use of windows as fashionable parts of residential spaces, the book is considered a seminal work on minute advertising procedures and home decor techniques exercised in late-19th-century Europe.\n\nThrough a lack of general reprinting, the work is considered extremely rare. As of February 2010, WorldCat.org displays only one result for the book in worldwide public libraries – the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library in Buffalo, New York in the United States. A reprinted version was published in 2008 by the rare and out-of-print book publisher Kessinger Publishing under .\n\nThe first edition of \"A Guide to Window-Dressing\" is designated with the OCLC number 39203562.\n\nAccording to the original 1883 text, \"A Guide to Window-Dressing\" was first published earlier that year in a local periodical, \"The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal\". The journal article was written and submitted anonymously, the book citing the periodical's headquarters as \"London: office of 'The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal,' 148 and 149, Aldersgate Street, E.C.\" The book adapted was published by the now defunct W H & L Collingridge publishing house, at the City Press located on the same street.\n\nThe preface to the book states that it was created in response to numerous inquiries to the proprietors of \"The Warehousemen and Drapers' Trade Journal\" for a comprehensive work on window-dressing, and goes on to promote itself by stating the following:\n\"No such book in connection with the drapery trade has, so far as they [the journal proprieters] are aware, been hitherto published, with the exception of a small prize essay published several years ago in connection with the same journal.\"\n\nAccording to Google Books and a library stamp seen on its facsimile of the guide, an extant copy of the first edition was found in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, first placed in the library's collections on 9 March 1987. This copy appears as a full-view readable version on that website, digitised on 1 May 2007.\n\nIllustrations provided in the first edition of the work are, like the author, also uncredited.\n\nThe first edition of the book had been divided into a preface, a table of contents and 15 chapters following them. These are chronicled as follows:\n\n\nEach section of the book addresses different aspects of window-dressing and their respectable applications, and puts forward a common aesthetic value for distinct types of windows and window display.\n\n"}

They are widely used in different sectors of Philippine society. Often, due to long full names of the institutions in the Philippines, acronyms are then utilized to shorten the name of an institution or a company in the country, making it more convenient to the majority of the Philippine population, but sometimes causing ambiguity.\n\nGeography is one area prone to acronyms. Many times, when a group of places is formed, instead of coining a descriptive term for the group, an acronym that stands for the individual places is created. An example outside the Philippines is Benelux, which stands for the countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nA premiere example in the Philippines is \"Luzviminda\". This is an acronym that stands for Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, the three island groupings of the country. Luzviminda is actually used as a name for many Filipino women. Another example in the Philippines is the region CALABARZON. This is a region consisting of the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. CALABARZON was split off from the former Southern Tagalog region in 2002. The region containing the remaining provinces in Southern Tagalog is also named as an acronym, MIMAROPA, which stands for the provinces of Mindoro (Occidental and Oriental), Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan. A last example is CAMANAVA, which stands for Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela—all of which are located in Metro Manila.\n\nAcronyms are not only prevalent in geography.\n\nMany business owners also use acronyms in their company names. The name of the popular clothing company, Bench, is actually an acronym for the company's president, Ben Chan.\n\nAcronyms are even used to name TV shows. Popular noontime variety shows like \"SOP\" and \"ASAP\" have appropriated common acronyms as the name of the TV show.\n\nIn political campaigns, many candidates names become acronyms stating their political platforms. A particularly stilted political acronym used was the slogan used by the People Power Coalition (PPC) in the 2001 senatorial elections: VOT FOR D CHAMPP. The slogan is an acronym that stands for the names of the 13 senator candidates fielded by PPC. The 11 administration senators who voted YES to block the opening of the second envelope during Estrada's impeachment trial were called \"Jose's Cohort\": Jaworski, Osmeña, Santiago, Enrile, Sotto, Coseteng, Oreta, Honasan, Ople, Revilla, Tatad.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19483989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19483989", "title": "Bücherei des Schocken Verlag", "text": "Bücherei des Schocken Verlag\n\nThe Bücherei des Schocken Verlag (\"Library of the Schocken Verlag\" in German) sometimes informally referred to as \"beliebte Reihe der Schocken-Bücherei\" (\"popular series of the Schocken library\") with its distinct, uniform style is widely considered \"one of the most important manifestations of the spiritual life of Jews in Germany between 1933 and 1938\" (\"wichtigsten Erscheinungen des geistigen Lebens\").\n\nConceived by Salman Schocken, in consultation with Buber, Moritz Spitzer, and Lambert Schneider, the series was \"designed to select from the wellsprings of all Jewish literature texts of peculiar relevance to Jewish readers in Nazi Germany. In the spirit of the very first title--Isaiah's prophecies of comfort in the new translation by Buber and Rosenzweig--each selection vibrated with levels of meaning that comprised consolation and instruction.\" Spitzer, in his position as editor of the Verlag, invited Walter Benjamin to help with the series. Schneider, as co-owner, brought with him the backlist from his Lambert Schneider Verlag, including \"Die Schrift\", the Buber-Rosenzweig translation of the Tanakh.\n\nIn a representative assessment of the imprint's impact, Ismar Schorsch writes:\nWhat is most remarkable about this inspired series is its almost unbounded cultural range and the speed at which it was produced. The 83 titles convey a conception of Judaism as a religious civilisation that spans the Bible, rabbinic literature, medieval and modern Hebrew poetry, philosophy and mysticism, folklore and popular culture, letters and memoirs, modern belles lettres and poetry in German and Yiddish, as well as works of Jewish history and historical sources.\n\nMore remarkable still is the fact that the series, which began publishing six months \"after\" the Nazi book burnings, continued activity until the end of 1938, when the events following Kristallnacht made it impossible to continue. The last book in the series, Hermann Cohen's \"Briefe\", although dated 1939, was actually printed in late 1938. The previous summer, volume 68, a reprint of \"Die Judenbuche\", a novel by Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, was (save for a few copies) pulped by the Nazis. (A second volume 68, Schneersohn's \"Die Geschichte von Chajim\" was printed in its place.) From that point on, the series carried the Nazi-imposed \"Jüdischer Buchverlag\" (Jewish Publisher) on the title page of all volumes.\n\nAlthough the planned two volumes a month was realized in only one of the five full years of publication (1935; the first five volumes were published in November and December 1933), \"the production of a German library of 92 volumes of Jewish culture over a period of five years is testimony not only to the urgency of the hour and the dedication of Moritz Spitzer and Lambert Schneider, but also to the very existence of a living cultural legacy.\" All in all, the 83 titles represented over a third of the firm's production before it moved from Berlin to Palestine in 1939. \n\nThe series featured the first appearances (or translations) of major works by authors (such as S.Y. Agnon, Martin Buber, Franz Kafka, Franz Rosenzweig, and Gershom Scholem) who would become internationally recognized when the Verlag moved to New York, became Schocken Books, and began publishing these authors (many of them for the first time) in English.\n"}
{"id": "12977578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12977578", "title": "Camel Club", "text": "Camel Club\n\nThe Camel Club is a group of fictional characters created by American novelist David Baldacci. They are the protagonists of five of his novels: \"The Camel Club\", \"The Collectors\", \"Stone Cold\", \"Divine Justice\", and \"Hell's Corner\". The original members are Oliver Stone, Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, and Milton Farb. The four are political watch-dogs, who are always looking for conspiracies within the government.\n\nOliver Stone is the leader of the Camel Club. Stone is the crypt keeper of the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church. Stone is a false name (his real name, though rarely used, is John Carr), taken because of the real Oliver Stone's conspiracy theory-themed movies. Stone was a former member of the esteemed and fictional \"Triple Six\" division of the CIA that was composed of highly skilled government assassins. Stone himself is also monitored by the government, which constantly has agents watching him. In \"Stone Cold\", people connected to Stone's past are killed by Harry Finn, whose ultimate goal is to kill former CIA Director Carter Gray.\n\nA West Point graduate and Vietnam vet, Reuben worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency but quit and became a war protester. After a few years of drug usage in England, Rhodes returned to the States, where he met Stone, who got him a job unloading trucks. He and Stone are the best marksmen in the group.\n\nCaleb Shaw is an employee of the Rare Book Wing of the Library of Congress. He, like Rhodes, was a protestor of the Vietnam war. Shaw holds twin doctorates in political science and eighteenth century literature. Shaw is also known for always wearing clothing from the 19th century. In \"The Collectors\", Shaw's boss is murdered in the sealed Rare Book Room.\n\nFarb was a child prodigy who suffers from extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoia. As a child, his parents had him act in a side show, adding extremely high numbers in his head and reciting extremely long sections of text without faltering. As is shown in \"Stone Cold\", Farb's gifts allow him to win extremely high amounts of money at casino games, such as blackjack. Farb was hired by the National Health Institute, but was fired after sending a threatening letter to the President. Stone met him and got him on the TV show \"Jeopardy!\" With medication, Farb was able to make a small fortune, with which he started a company for designing Web sites. Farb was the first of the group to warm up to Annabelle Conroy. \n\nAlong with the original four, the Camel Club acquires additional members from people who share similar goals.\n\nA Secret Service agent, Ford helps the group in the first book, \"The Camel Club\", as they try to uncover a conspiracy that involves the kidnapping of President James H. Brennan and a captured Muslim terrorist. He is made a member of the Club at the end of the book. In \"The Collectors\", Oliver Stone asks for Ford's help as part of the climax of the novel. In \"Stone Cold\", he helps Annabelle Conroy in her escape from casino king and mobster, Jerry Bagger.\n\nA lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ), part-time bartender and Alex Ford's girlfriend. She, too, assists the Camel Club in \"The Camel Club\", and becomes a member at the end of the book. She and Ford have broken up by \"Stone Cold\".\n\nA compulsive thief, Conroy runs scams on people to steal large amounts of money, including stealing millions from New Jersey mob boss Jerry Bagger. Conroy was briefly married (annulled) to Jonathan DeHaven, the director of the Rare Book Room at the Library of Congress. DeHaven's house was found to be the hiding place for a first edition of the Bay Psalm Book, which was later revealed to have been stolen by Conroy. During \"Stone Cold\" she joins the Camel Club in the fight against Jerry Bagger and Harry Finn.\n\n"}

It promotes and sponsors the study of the history of collecting.\n\nHoused in the Frick Art Reference Library at 10 East 71st Street (between Madison and Fifth Avenue) in New York City, the Center for the History of Collecting was established in 2007 to encourage and sustain research on the development of public and private art collections in Europe and the United States from the early modern period to the present.\n\nThe center supports a broad range of intellectual initiatives. It organizes and hosts a regular calendar of symposia, specialist lectures, and study days, and it contributes to undergraduate and graduate seminars taught in collaboration with local colleges. It also offers long and short term fellowships in the history of collecting, which attract scholars researching diverse aspects of cultural history. In addition, the center created and continues to expand a major digital archive of art collectors and dealers, and it is collaborating on the creation of software that will aid in the study of visual history. The center has an active publications program and awards a biennial book prize for excellent contributions to the History of Collecting in America.\n\nFrom its inception under the leadership of founding director Inge Reist, the Center has had an advisory committee consisting of academics, collectors, librarians, archivists, and curators. In 2014, a Fellows Committee was introduced to garner financial support and to gather a dedicated community of individuals interested in engaging with collecting practices, especially through visits to the homes of private collectors.\n\n Between 2007- 2015, The Center for the History of Collecting organized the following symposia on the history of collecting:\nThe Center has an active publication program, issuing books that draw on the scholarship presented in the symposia. Many of these have been published in association with Pennsylvania State University Press as volumes of The Frick Collection Studies on the History of Art Collecting in America. Titles include:\n\nThe center also organizes special events such as movie showings and lectures by important scholars, artists, and collectors. For instance, in 2013, the center presented a lecture by artist and author Edmund de Waal, and in 2014, it hosted a conversation between Sir David Cannadine, Lord Rothschild, and Duke of Devonshire.\n\nThe center regularly collaborates with academic institutions, including Barnard College, Columbia University, and New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, to offer graduate and undergraduate seminars and graduate workshops on the history of collecting. Alongside local museums, it also organizes and participates in study days that contextualize major museum exhibitions within the history of collecting. In addition, it facilitates oral and video histories of dealers and collectors who have helped to shape American collecting through the twentieth century. In this effort, it has partnered with the Archives of American Art on a two-year project to produce a series of oral histories of collectors.\n\nThe Center for the History of Collecting created and maintains an archives directory, which is a growing index of collectors, dealers, auction houses and galleries, presented with historical notes and with the locations of their archival materials. In 2011, the Art Libraries Society of North America awarded the Archives Directory its annual Worldwide Books Award for Electronic Resources, which recognizes achievements in digital librarianship or in curating visual resources. The center is also currently collaborating with scholars at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering to develop a digital platform that will facilitate the storage, comparison, and manipulation of digital images.\n\nEach year, the Center grants a total of six short-term and long-term fellowships to pre- and post-doctoral scholars focusing on the history of collecting. It also awards a biennial book prize for a distinguished publication on the history of collecting in America.\nThe book prize honorees include:\n\n"}

{"id": "1424053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1424053", "title": "Children of Lir", "text": "Children of Lir\n\nThe Children of Lir () is a legend from Irish mythology. It is a tale from the post-Christianisation period that mixes magical elements such as druidic wands and spells with a Christian message of faith bringing freedom from suffering.\n\nNamed in Irish as \"Oidheadh Chlainne Lir\", the tale is today often known simply as \"The Children of Lir\" but the title has also been rendered as \"The Tragic Story of the Children of Lir\" or \"The Fate of the Children of Lir\", or, from the earlier title \"Aided Chlainne Lir\", as \"The Violent Death of the Children of Lir\".\n\nIn post 18th-century scholarship the tale has often been grouped with the \"Oidheadh chloinne Uisnigh\" (\"The Fate of the Children of Uisnigh\") and \"Oidheadh chloinne Tuireann\" (\"The Fate of the Children of Tuireann\") as the \"Trí truagha na sgéalaigheachta\", i.e. \"The three sorrows of storytelling,\" also known as \"The Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin.\" Scholar and folklorist Robin Flower has suggested that all three tales may have had a common author sometime in the 14th century, by someone in the circle of the Mac Fhirbhisighs in north-west Connacht.\n\nManuscripts containing early versions of the tales include MS 72.1.38 and MS 72.2.6 at the National Library of Scotland, MS Egerton 164 at the British Library, and MS 24 A 13, and MS E vi 4 at the library of the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nThe legendary historical setting of the story is the end of the dominion of the Tuatha Dé Danann in Ireland, and the corresponding rise of the Milesians.\n\n[2-9] Bodb Derg was elected king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, to the annoyance of Lir, who felt himself should have been chosen; Lir did not swear obedience to the new King, to the annoyance of those that elected him, causing strife, though Bodb sought to appease them. After some time Lir's wife died - to appease Lir, Bodb gave one of his daughters, Aoibh, to him in marriage - Lir agreed that he would yield the lordship, and form an alliance - ending the strike.\n\n[10-13] Aoibh bore Lir four children: one girl, Fionnghuala, and three sons, Aodh and twins, Fiachra and Conn. After the birth of the twins Aoibh died, causing great grief to Lir, though he was bolstered by his love for the four children. Bodb then sent another of his daughters, Aoife, to marry Lir, which he accepted happily. The children were a joy both to Lir and to Bodb.\n\n[14-18] After a short while Aoife became jealous of the affection given to the four step children. Initially she feigned illness for around a year. One day she set out in her chariot with the four children, with design to kill them, and called her entourage to slay them, stating that because of them she had lost Lir's love, and promising them rich rewards. However they would not help, so she drew a sword, but was not able to follow through with the act. Next she took them to Loch Dairbhreach, and made to bathe - once in the water she cast a spell of metamorphosis to transform them in to four white swans.\n\n[19-23] Fionnghuala rebuked her, stating that her magic power was not as great as that of their friends to undo the spell, and warned her of the revenge she would face - he asked her to set a limit on the time of the spell. She set a period of three hundred years as swan on \"Loch Dairbhreach\"; three hundred more on \"Sruth na Maoilé\"; and three hundred at \"Iorrus Domnann\" and \"Inis Gluairé\". She also foretold that by expiration of the period of the spell Lairgenn (the great-grandson of the King of Connacht), and Deoch (the great-granddaughter of the King of Munster) would be wed. Aoife relented a little and allowed the children to retain the power of speech, stating they would sing plaintive songs without equal, and that they would not be distressed by being in the forms of birds. Aoife the returned to court of Bodb -when he asked why the children were not with her she claimed Lir did not trust him with them, but Bodb was suspicious and sent messengers to Lir.\n\n[24-32] On receiving the messenger Lir became sad, realising Aoifé had done some harmful act. He then set out, and at the shores of \"Loch Dairbhreach\" he encountered the swans singing with human voices. They told him of Aoife's evil act, and Lir and his people lamented, though that night they stayed and listened to the swan's song. Lir reached Bodb, and told him of Aoifé's treachery. Bodb cursed her, saying her suffering would be greater than the children's, and asked what the worst form of being was that she could imagine - Aoifé stated a Demon of the air was the worst, and on this Bodh struck her with a druid's wand, metamorphosing her into such a demon - she flew off and remained that way.\n\n[33-45] Bodb and the people of the De Danann went to Loch Dairbhreach and listened to the swan's singing. Milesians came too, and the music calmed and delighted all who heard it. After three hundred years the time came for the swans to go north to the cold Sruth na Maoilé. At this time it was proclaimed that no swan should be killed in Erin. At the Maoilé a cruel storm separated them, and though they eventually re-united their time there was wretched, with extremes of cold and weather to contend with, but they could not leave, as it was their lot to stay in the waters there.\n\n[46-52] Eventually the swans came across a company of the De Danann and of the Milesians who had been seeking them, led by Aodh and Fergus sons of Bodb - near the mouth of the Banna. The swans enquired and received good news about the De Danann, Lir, and Bodb. After the allotted time the swans then left for Iorrus Domhnann. There they encountered a young man who took an account of their adventures.\n\n[53-55] One night at Iorrus the cold and weather became so intense that the waters froze, and their feet froze to the ice. Because of their suffering they pleaded to the \"King of Heaven\" to ease the plight of birds, and having and professing faith in a \"true God, perfect, truly intelligent\" their pleading was heard, and from then they were protected from storms and bad weather. Eventually the time allotted to Iorrus Domhnann passed and they decided to go to \"Sioth Fionnachaidh\", where Lir lived.\n\n[56-61] However once there, they found it deserted, derelict, and overgrown. The next day they set off for \"Inis Gluairé\" - there many birds congregated around them at the lake. Eventually Saint Patrick and Christianity came to Ireland, and one day the holy man \"Mochaomhóg\" arrive at \"Inis Gluairé\" - the swans heard him ringing a bell calling matins, and became frightened at the sound. However Fionnghuala declared the sound of the bell would liberate them from the curse of the spell, and so they listened to it. When it finished they sang a song. The holy man heard their song, and discovered that it was swans that sang it. Speaking to them he asked if they were the Children of Lir, stating that he had travelled to that place for their sake.\n\n[62-66] The swans put their trust in the holy man, and allowed him to bind them with silver chains. The birds felt no fatigue or distress in their situation in the company of the monk. Eventually the account of the swans reached Deoch, the wife of Lairgnen, the King of Connacht - she asked him to get the swans for her. He sent messenger's immediately but the monk Mochaomhóg refused, making Lairgnen angry. He went to Mochaimhóg himself, and attempted to grasp the swans, but on his touch the swan's feathers fell off revealing three very old men, and an old woman, all lean, and very bony. On this Lairgnen left.\n\n[67-70] Fionnghuala asked the monk to baptise them and to bury each, stating he sensed they were close to death. They were baptised, then died, and were buried. Mochaomhóg was sad for them. That was the fate of the children of Lir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". It was used by canonists of the Roman Catholic Church until Pentecost (May 19) 1918, when a revised \"Code of Canon Law\" (\"Codex Iuris Canonici\") promulgated by Pope Benedict XV on 27 May 1917 obtained legal force.\n\nIt was about 1150 that Gratian, teacher of theology at the monastery of Saints Nabor and Felix and sometimes believed to have been a Camaldolese monk, composed the work entitled by himself, \"Concordia discordantium canonum\", but called by others \"Nova collectio, Decreta, Corpus juris canonici\", also \"Decretum Gratiani\", the latter being now the commonly accepted name. He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (theologia practica externa), i. e. the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the Decretum has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection.\n\nIt is divided into three parts (\"ministeria, negotia, sacramenta\"). The first part is divided into 101 distinctions (\"distinctiones\"), the first 20 of which form an introduction to the general principles of canon Law (tractatus decretalium); the remainder constitutes a tractatus ordinandorum, relative to ecclesiastical persons and function. The second part contains 36 causes (\"causæ\"), divided into questions (quæstiones), and treat of ecclesiastical administration and marriage; the third question of the 33rd causa treats of the Sacrament of Penance and is divided into 7 distinctions. The third part, entitled \"De consecratione\", treats of the sacraments and other sacred things and contains 5 distinctions. Each distinction or question contains \"dicta Gratiani\", or maxims of Gratian, and canones. Gratian himself raises questions and brings forward difficulties, which he answers by quoting auctoritates, i. e. canons of councils, decretals of the popes, texts of the Scripture or of the Fathers. These are the canones; the entire remaining portion, even the summaries of the canons and the chronological indications, are called the maxims or dicta Gratiani. It is to be noted that many auctoritates have been inserted in the \"Decretum\" by authors of a later date. These are the \"Paleœ\", so called from Paucapalea, the name of the principal commentator on the \"Decretum\". The Roman revisers of the 16th century (1566–82) corrected the text of the \"Decree\" and added many critical notes designated by the words Correctores Romani.\n\nThe \"Decretum\" is quoted by indicating the number of the canon and that of the distinction or of the cause and the question. To differentiate the distinctions of the first part from those of the third, question of the 33rd cause of the second part and those of the third part, the words de Pœn., i. e. \"de Pœnitentiâ\", and de Cons., i. e. \"de Consecratione\" are added to the latter. For instance, \"c. 1. d. XI\" indicates the first part of the \"Decree\". distinction XI, canon 1; \"c. 1., de Pœn., d. VI,\" refers to the second part, 33rd cause, question 3, distinction VI, canon 1; \"c. 8, de Cons., d. II\" refers to the third part, distinction II, canon 8; \"c. 8, C. XII, q. 3\" refers to the second part, cause XII, question 3, canon 8. Sometimes, especially in the case of well-known and much-quoted canons, the first words are also indicated, e. g., c. Si quis suadente diabolo, C. XVII, q. 4, i. e. the 29th canon of the second part, cause XVII, question 4. Occasionally the first words alone are quoted. In both cases, to find the canon it is necessary to consult the alphabetical tables (printed in all editions of Gratian) that contain the first words of every canon.\n\nGratian () was a canon lawyer from Bologna. He flourished in the mid 12th century. Little else is known about him. \n\nHe is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Franciscus Gratianus, Johannes Gratian, or Giovanni Graziano. For a long time he was believed to have been born at the end of the 11th century, at Chiusi in Tuscany. He was said to have become a monk at Camaldoli and then he taught at the monastery of St. Felix in Bologna and devoted his life to studying canon law, but contemporary scholarship does not attach credibility to these traditions.\nSince the 11th century, Bologna had been the centre of the study of canon law, as well as of Roman law, after the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" was rediscovered in western Europe. \nGratian's work was an attempt, using early scholastic method, to solve seemingly contradictory canons from previous centuries. Gratian quoted a great number of authorities, including the Bible, papal and conciliar legislation, church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, and secular law in his efforts to reconcile the canons. Gratian found a place in Dante's \"Paradise\" among the doctors of the Church: \n\nHe has long been acclaimed as \"Pater Juris Canonici\" (Latin, \"Father of Canon Law\"), a title he shares with his successor St. Raymond of Penyafort.\n\nThe vulgate version of Gratian's collection was completed at some point after the Second Lateran Council, which it quotes. Research by Anders Winroth established that some manuscripts of an early version of Gratian's text, which differs considerably from the mainstream textual tradition, have survived.\nWith later commentaries and supplements, the work was incorporated into the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". The \"Decretum\" quickly became the standard textbook for students of canon law throughout Europe, but it never received any formal official recognition by the papacy. Only the \"Codex Juris Canonici\" of 1917 put it out of use.\n\nAs late as 1997, scholars commonly set the date of completion at 1140, but this accuracy in dating isn't possible after Anders Winroth's groundbreaking scholarship. Research by Anders Winroth shows that the \"Decretum\" existed in two published recensions. The first dates to sometime after 1139, while the second dates to 1150 at the latest. There are several major differences between the two recensions:\nThese differences led Winroth to conclude that Roman law was not as far developed by 1140 as scholars had previously thought. He has also argued that the second recension was due not to the original author of the first recension (whom he calls Gratian 1), but rather another jurist versed in Roman law. However, Winroth's thesis of two Gratians remains controversial.\nThis field of inquiry is hampered by ignorance of the compiler's identity and the existence of manuscripts with abbreviated versions of the text or variant versions not represented by Winroth's two recensions. One of these is the manuscript St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek, 673 (=Sg), which some have argued contains the earliest known version (borrador) of the \"Decretum\", but which other scholars have argued contains an abbreviation of the first recension expanded with texts taken from the second recension.\n\nGratian's sources were Roman law, the Bible, the writings of (or attributed to) the Church Fathers, papal decretals, the acts of church councils and synods. In most cases, Gratian did not obtain this material from a direct reading of the sources, but rather through intermediate collections. Thanks to the research of modern scholars - in particular, Charles Munier, Titus Lenherr, and Peter Landau - we now know that Gratian made use of a relatively small number of collections in the composition of most of the \"Decretum\", these being:\n\nOther sources are known to have been used in the composition of particular sections of the \"Decretum\":\n\nGratian himself named his work \"Concordia Discordantium Canonum\" - \"Concord of Discordancies of Canons.\" The name is fitting: Gratian tried to harmonize apparently contradictory canons with each other, by discussing different interpretations and deciding on a solution. This dialectical approach allowed for other law professors to work with the \"Decretum\" and to develop their own solutions and commentaries. These legalists are known as the decretists.\n\nThese commentaries were called glosses. Editions printed in the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries frequently included the glosses along with the text. Collections of glosses were called \"gloss apparatus\" or \"Lectura in Decretum\" (see also glossator). Systematic commentaries were called \"Summae\". Some of these \"Summae\" were soon in circulation as well and obtained the same level of fame as the \"Decretum\" itself. Early commentators included Paucapalea and Magister Rolandus. The most important commentators were probably Rufin of Bologna (died before 1192) and Huguccio (died 1210). Less well-known was the commentary of Simon of Bisignano, which consisted of the \"Glosses on the Decretum\" and the \"Summa Simonis\".\n\nPeter Lombard borrowed and adapted from the \"Decretum\" when discussing penance in his \"Sentences\" (≈1150).\n\nThe \"Decretum\" served as a model for 12th century jurists in the formation of Western law based on rational rules and evidence to replace barbaric laws which often involved trial by ordeal or battle.\n\nThe \"Decretum\" was called \"the first comprehensive and systematic legal treatise in the history of the West, and perhaps in the history of mankind- if by 'comprehensive' is meant the attempt to embrace virtually the entire law of a given polity, and if by 'systematic' is meant the express effort to that law as a single body, in which all parts are viewed as interacting to form a whole. \"Decretum\" made a direct contribution to the development of Western law in areas that it dealt with such as marriage, property and inheritance. Specific concepts included consent for marriage and wrongful intent in determining whether a certain act constituted a crime.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "236382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236382", "title": "FishBase", "text": "FishBase\n\nFishBase is a global species database of fish species (specifically finfish). It is the largest and most extensively accessed online database on adult finfish on the web. Over time it has \"evolved into a dynamic and versatile ecological tool\" that is widely cited in scholarly publications.\n\nFishBase provides comprehensive species data, including information on taxonomy, geographical distribution, biometrics and morphology, behaviour and habitats, ecology and population dynamics as well as reproductive, metabolic and genetic data. There is access to tools such as trophic pyramids, identification keys, biogeographical modelling and fishery statistics and there are direct species level links to information in other databases such as LarvalBase, GenBank, the IUCN Red List and the Catalog of Fishes.\n\n, FishBase included descriptions of 34,000 species and subspecies, 323,200 common names in almost 300 languages, 58,900 pictures, and references to 55,300 works in the scientific literature. The site has about 700,000 unique visitors per month.\n\nThe origins of FishBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills. Hypotheses, such as this one, could be tested only if large amounts of empirical data were available. At the time, fisheries management used analytical models which required estimates for fish growth and mortality. It can be difficult for fishery scientists and managers to get the information they need on the species that concern them, because the relevant facts can be scattered across and buried in numerous journal articles, reports, newsletters and other sources. It can be particularly difficult for people in developing countries who need such information. Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble and consolidate all the data available in the published literature into some central and easily accessed repository. Such a database would be particularly useful if the data has also been standardised and validated. This would mean that when scientists or managers need to test a new hypothesis, the available data will already be there in a validated and accessible form, and there will be no need to create a new dataset and then have to validate it.\n\nPauly recruited Rainer Froese, and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This database, initially confined to tropical fish, became the prototype for FishBase. FishBase was subsequently extended to cover all finfish, and was launched on the Web in August 1996. It is now the largest and most accessed online database for fish in the world. In 1995 the first CD-ROM was released as \"FishBase 100\". Subsequent CDs have been released annually. The software runs on Microsoft Access which operates only on Microsoft Windows.\n\nFishBase covers adult finfish, but does not detail the early and juvenile stages of fish. In 1999 a complimentary database, called LarvalBase, went online under the supervision of Bernd Ueberschär. It covers ichthyoplankton and the juvenile stage of fishes, with detailed data on fish eggs and larvae, fish identification, as well as data relevant to the rearing of young fish in aquaculture. Given FishBase's success, there was a demand for a database covering forms of aquatic life other than finfish. This resulted, in 2006, in the birth of SeaLifeBase. The long-term goal of SeaLifeBase is to develop an information system modelled on FishBase, but including all forms of aquatic life, both marine and freshwater, apart from the finfish which FishBase specialises in. Altogether, there are about 300,000 known species in this category.\n\nAs awareness of FishBase has grown among fish specialists, it has attracted over 2,310 contributors and collaborators. Since 2000 FishBase has been supervised by a consortium of nine international institutions. To date, the FishBase consortium has grown to twelve members. The GEOMAR - Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research for Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR) in Germany, functions as the coordinating body.\n\n\n\n"}

It begins with a preface in which Keating defends the honour of Ireland against the denigrations of writers such as Giraldus Cambrensis, followed by a narrative history in two parts: part one, from the creation of the world to the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century, and part two, from the 5th century to the coming of the Normans in the 12th century.\n\nIt depicts Ireland as an autonomous, unitary kingdom of great antiquity. The early part of the work is largely mythical, depicting the history of Ireland as a succession of invasions and settlements, and derives primarily from medieval writings such as the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\", the \"Dindsenchas\", royal genealogies and stories of heroic kings. The later part depicts the Normans as the latest in this series of settlers. Keating, a Catholic priest of Anglo-Norman descent, gave Irish people of both Gaelic and Norman ancestry a shared place in the history of the nation, and emphasised the role of the Church as a unifying factor in Irish society.\n\nThe work was extremely popular, surviving in a large number of manuscripts, and its prose style became the standard followed by generations of Irish-language writers. However, it was received critically from the start, with Sir Richard Cox describing it in the 1680s as \"an ill-digested heap of very silly fictions\". Modern scholars view it in the context of the antiquarian tendency of Renaissance humanism, with Keating expounding on ancient Irish sources, whose authority he defends, to provide \"an origin-legend for Counter-Reformation Catholic Ireland.\"\n\n"}

Foreach is usually used in place of a standard [[for loop|for]] [[statement (programming)|statement]]. Unlike other for loop constructs, however, foreach loops usually maintain no explicit counter: they essentially say \"do this to everything in this set\", rather than \"do this \"x\" times\". This avoids potential [[off-by-one error]]s and makes code simpler to read. In object-oriented languages an [[iterator]], even if implicit, is often used as the means of traversal.\n\nThe \"foreach\" statement in some languages has some defined order, processing each item in the collection from the first to the last.\nThe \"foreach\" statement in many other languages does not have any particular order, especially [[array programming]] languages, in order to support [[loop optimization]] in general and in particular to allow [[vector processing]] to process some or all of the items in the collection simultaneously.\n\nSyntax varies among languages. Most use the simple word codice_1, roughly as follows:\n\n[[Programming language]]s which support foreach loops include [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], [[ActionScript]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C++11]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[ColdFusion Markup Language]] (CFML), [[Cobra (programming language)|Cobra]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Daplex]] (query language), [[ECMAScript]], [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (since 1.5, using the [[reserved word]] codice_1 for the for loop and the foreach loop), [[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Objective-C]] (since 2.0), [[ParaSail (programming language)|ParaSail]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[REALbasic]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], [[Tcl]], [[tcsh]], [[Unix shell]]s, [[Visual Basic .NET]], and [[Windows PowerShell]]. Notable languages without foreach are [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[C++]] pre-C++11.\n\n[[ActionScript]] supports foreach loops by key/index and by value:\n\nTypical usage is as shown, but someArray could be any object, and someObject could be an array.\n\n[[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] supports foreach loops as part of the normal [[for loop]]. Say X is an [[Array data structure|array]]:\n\nThis syntax is used on mostly arrays, but will also work with other types when a full iteration is needed.\n\nAda 2012 has generalized loops to foreach loops on any kind of container (array, lists, maps...):\n\nThe language [[C (programming language)|C]] does not have collections or a foreach construct. However, it has several standard data structures that can be used as collections, and foreach can be made easily with a [[C macro|macro]].\n\nHowever, two obvious problems occur:\n\nC string as a collection of char\nC int array as a collection of int (array size known at compile-time)\n\nMost general: string or array as collection (collection size known at run-time)\nIn [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], assuming that myArray is an array of integers:\n\n[[Language Integrated Query]] (LINQ) provides the following syntax, accepting a [[Delegate (CLI)|delegate]] or [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expression]]:\n\n[[C++11]] provides a foreach loop. The syntax is similar to that of [[Foreach loop#Java|Java]]:\n\nCurrently, C++11 range-based for statements have been implemented in [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) (since version 4.6), [[Clang]] (since version 3.0) and [[Visual C++]] 2012 (version 11 )\n\nThe C++ STL also supports for_each, that applies each element to a function, which can be any predefined function or a lambda expression. While the direction of the range-based for is only from the beginning to the end, you can change the direction or range by altering the first two parameters.\n\n[[Qt (software)|Qt]], a C++ framework, offers a macro providing foreach loops using the STL iterator interface:\n\n[[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost]], a set of free peer-reviewed portable C++ libraries also provides foreach loops:\n\nThe [[C++/CLI]] language proposes a construct similar to C#.\n\nAssuming that myArray is an array of integers:\n\nCFML incorrectly identifies the value as \"index\" in this construct; the codice_3 variable does receive the actual value of the array element, not its index.\n\n[[Common Lisp]] provides foreach ability either with the \"dolist\" macro:\n\nor the powerful \"loop\" macro to iterate on more data types\nand even with the \"mapcar\" function:\n\nForeach support was added in [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] 2005, and uses an enumerator variable that must be declared in the \"var\" section.\n\nThe iteration (foreach) form of the [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] loop construct is introduced by the keyword codice_4.\n\nIn this example, every element of the structure codice_5 is printed:\nThe local entity codice_6 is an instance of the library class codice_7. The cursor's feature codice_8 provides access to each structure element. Descendants of class codice_7 can be created to handle specialized iteration algorithms. The types of objects that can be iterated across (codice_5 in the example) are based on classes that inherit from the library class codice_11.\n\nThe iteration form of the Eiffel loop can also be used as a boolean expression when the keyword codice_12 is replaced by either codice_13 (effecting [[universal quantification]]) or codice_14 (effecting [[existential quantification]]).\n\nThis iteration is a boolean expression which is true if all items in codice_5 have counts greater than three:\nThe following is true if at least one item has a count greater than three:\n\n[[Go (programming language)|Go's]] foreach loop can be used to loop over an array, slice, string, map, or channel.\n\nUsing the two-value form, we get the index/key (first element) and the value (second element):\nUsing the one-value form, we get the index/key (first element):\n\n[[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]] supports \"for\" loops over collections like arrays, lists and ranges:\n\nGroovy also supports a C-style for loop with an array index:\n\nCollections in Groovy can also be iterated over using the \"each\" keyword\nand a closure. By default, the loop dummy is named \"it\"\n\n[[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] allows looping over lists with [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] actions using codice_16 and codice_17 (codice_16 with its arguments flipped) from Control.Monad:\n\nIt's also possible to generalize those functions to work on applicative functors rather than monads and any data structure that is traversable using codice_19 (codice_1 with its arguments flipped) and codice_21 (codice_22 with its arguments flipped) from Data.Traversable.\n\nIn [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a foreach-construct was introduced in [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK) 1.5.0.\n\nOfficial sources use several names for the construct. It is referred to as the \"Enhanced for Loop\", the \"For-Each Loop\", and the \"foreach statement\".\n\nFor unordered iteration over the keys in an Object, [[JavaScript]] features the codice_23 loop:\n\nTo limit the iteration to the object's own properties, excluding those inherited through the prototype chain, it is sometimes useful to add a hasOwnProperty() test, [[Comparison of layout engines (ECMAScript)#Object object|if supported by the JavaScript engine]] (for WebKit/Safari, this means \"in version 3 or later\").\n\nIn [[ECMAScript 5]] it is possible to use the keys method of the Object function to iterate over the own keys of an object more naturally.\nIn [[ECMAScript 5]] it's also possible to use the codice_24 method of a native array.\n\nGecko’s JavaScript engine also has a codice_25 statement, which iterates over the values in the object, not the keys.\n\nAlso note that it is inadvisable to use either a codice_23 or codice_25 statement on an Array object in JavaScript, due to the above issue of properties inherited from prototypes, and also because it only iterates over existent keys and is not guaranteed to iterate over the elements in any particular order. A regular C-style for loop should be used instead. The [[EcmaScript 6]] standard has codice_28 for index-less iteration over generators, arrays and more.\n\nIterate only through numerical index values:\nfor index, value in ipairs(array) do\nend\nIterate through all index values:\nfor index, value in pairs(array) do\nend\nIn Mathematica, codice_29 will simply evaluate an expression for each element of a list, without returning any value.\n\nIt is more common to use codice_30, which returns the result of each evaluation in a new list.\n\nFor each loops are supported in Mint, possessing the following syntax:\nThe codice_31 or codice_32 [[infinite loop]]\nin Mint can be written using a for each loop and an [[Infinite set|infinitely long list]].\n\nForeach loops, called [[Objective-C#Fast enumeration|Fast enumeration]], are supported starting in [[Objective-C]] 2.0. They can be used to iterate over any object that implements the NSFastEnumeration protocol, including NSArray, NSDictionary (iterates over keys), NSSet, etc.\n\nNSArrays can also broadcast a message to their members:\n\nWhere [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] are available, an NSArray can automatically perform a block on every contained item:\n\nThe type of collection being iterated will dictate the item returned with each iteration.\nFor example:\n\n[[OCaml]] is a [[functional language]]. Thus, the equivalent of a foreach loop can be achieved as a library function over lists and arrays.\n\nFor lists:\n\nor in short way:\n\nFor arrays:\n\nor in short way:\n\nThe [[ParaSail (programming language)|ParaSail]] parallel programming language supports several kinds of iterators, including a general \"for each\" iterator over a container:\n\nParaSail also supports filters on iterators, and the ability to refer to both the key and the value of a map. Here is a forward iteration over the elements of \"My_Map\" selecting only elements where the keys are in \"My_Set\":\n\nIn [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], ISO standard 10206:1990 introduced iteration over [[Pascal (programming language)#Set types|set types]], thus:\n\nIn [[Perl]], \"foreach\" (which is equivalent to the shorter for) can be used to traverse elements of a list.

The hexafoil design is modeled after the six petal lily, for its symbolism of purity and relation to the Trinity. The hexafoil form is created from a series of compound units, and exists as a more complex variation of the same extruded figure. Other forms similar to the hexafoil include the: trefoil, quatrefoil, and cinquefoil. \n\nOne common form of the hexafoil has a ring of six tangent circles circumscribed by a larger circle. It may be constructed by compass and straightedge, by drawing six circles at the centers of a regular hexagon, with diameter equal to the side of the hexagon. The inner circles of the hexafoil have radius 1/3 that of the outer circle containing them, from which it is possible to derive the area and perimeter of the figure as a mathematical exercise.\n\nA key component to Gothic architecture is a strong design principal involving geometry and harmony. The hexafoil design is implemented in various Gothic buildings constructed in the 12th through 16th century. The traditional design is used in cloisters, triforiums and stained glass windows of famous buildings such as Notre-Dame, Salisbury Cathedral, and Regensburg Cathedral. Stone cut-out hexafoils are displayed in a plate tracery style in the Salisbury Cathedral, creating a pattern along the triforium. \n\nThe hexafoil form can also be see as a framing design in \"Bible moralisée.\" They are often rendered in red, blue, gold or vibrant orange and surround biblical scenes in the bible. The hexafoil style of framing was often used in conjunction with architectural framing to provide the text with more depth, creativity, invention, and volume. Old Testament illustrations were surrounded by hexafoil frames while moralization depictions favored architectural frames.\n\nHexafoil designs are known to have links to folk magic practices in various countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, where a six leaf design with concentric circles have been found in homes and occasionally in public buildings to serve as a sign of protection.\n"}

The home directory can be organized further with the use of sub-directories.\n\nThe content of a user's home directory is protected by file system permissions, and by default is accessible to all authenticated users and administrators. Any other user that has been granted administrator privileges has authority to access any protected location on the filesystem including other users home directories.\n\nSeparating user data from system-wide data avoids redundancy and makes backups of important files relatively simple.

In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself.\"\n\nThe index scores nations on 10 broad factors of economic freedom using statistics from organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Economist Intelligence Unit:\n\nThe 10 factors are averaged equally into a total score.\n\nThe annual \"Economic Freedom of the World\" is an indicator of economic freedom produced by James Gwartney and Robert Lawson, and is published by the Canadian Fraser Institute. This index uses a definition of economic freedom similar to laissez-faire capitalism and it has been more widely used than any measure of economic freedom. Its use stems in part from the longer time period covered (data exists from 1980–2008), and the fact that this index is constructed from third party information (in contrast to the index created by the Heritage Foundation). According to this index, the cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete, and security of privately owned property.\n\nIn practice, the index measures:\n\nThe report uses 42 distinct variables collected from a number of different sources (including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and others). Some examples: tax rates, degree of juridical independence, inflation rates, costs of importing, and regulated prices. Each of the 5 areas above is given equal weight in the final score. Scores are available (largely dependent on data available) for 141 countries.\n\nFreedom House published a measure of economic freedom in 1996, but publication of this measure has been discontinued. They defined economic freedom through two dimensions – lack of state infringements on citizens' rights to exchange goods and services, and state establishment of the rules governing contracts, property rights and other institutional prerequisites required for the conduct of economic affairs. To determine level of economic freedom Freedom House used six indicators:\n\nTwo different measures have been proposed for India, both called Economic Freedom Index for India. One is produced by Bibek Debroy, Shubashis Gangopadhyay and Laveesh Bhandari and places weight on measures of both positive freedom and negative freedom. The other is an adaption of the Fraser Institute measure produced by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies.\n\nIn the 2016 Index of Economic Freedom, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan ranked as \"mostly unfree\" taking 96th and 149th places 178 respectively. Uzbekistan (#166) and Turkmenistan (#174) ranked as \"repressed\". Largest economy in the region, Kazakhstan is ahead of all other Central Asian countries and neighboring Russia. Kazakhstan ranked an overall score of 63.6 out of 100 taking 68th place out of 178 countries, one place better than last year.\n\nIn a review of the literature, Lawson and Hall documented that \"[o]ver two-thirds of these studies found economic freedom to correspond to a 'good' outcome such as faster growth, better living standards, more happiness, etc. Less than 4% of the sample found economic freedom to be associated with a 'bad' outcome such as increased income inequality.\" Furthermore, supporters contend that the size of government has shown correlations with negative growth.\n\n\n"}

Many books detailing specific techniques of martial arts are often erroneously called manuals but were written as treatises.\n\nProse descriptions of martial arts techniques appear late within the history of literature, due to the inherent difficulties of describing a technique rather than just demonstrating it.\n\nThe earliest extant manuscript on armed combat (as opposed to unarmed wrestling) is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (\"I.33\"), written in Franconia around 1300.\n\nNot within the scope of this article are books on military strategy such as Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" (before 100 BC) or Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus' \"De Re Militari\" (4th century), or military technology, such as \"De rebus bellicis\" (4th to 5th century).\n\nSome early testimonies of historical martial arts consist of series of images only. The earliest example is a fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan, showing illustrations of wrestling techniques dating to the 20th century BCE. Similar depictions of wrestling techniques are found on Attic vases dating to Classical Greece.\n\nThe only known instance of a book from classical antiquity is Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466 from the 2nd century CE, detailing Greek wrestling techniques. There are some examples in the Chinese classics that may predate the turn of the Common Era: the \"Records of the Grand Historian\" by Sima Qian (c. 100 BCE) documents wrestling, referring to earlier how-to manuals\" of the Western Han (2nd century BCE), which have however not survived. An extant Chinese text on wrestling is \"Six Chapters of Hand Fighting\" included in the 1st century CE \"Book of Han\".\n\nAll other extant manuals date to the Middle Ages or later. The \"combat stele\" at Shaolin Monastery dates to 728 CE. The earliest text detailing Indian martial arts is the \"Agni Purana\" (c. 8th century), which contains several chapters giving descriptions and instructions on fighting techniques. It described how to improve a warrior's individual prowess and kill enemies using various methods in warfare whether they went to war in chariots, horses, elephants or on foot. Foot methods were subdivided into armed combat and unarmed combat. The former included the bow and arrow, the sword, spear, noose, armour, iron dart, club, battle axe, chakram and trident. The latter included wrestling, knee strikes, punching and kicking methods.\n\nThe oldest extant European martial arts manual is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (c. 1300).\n\n\"Illustrations only\" manuals do not become extinct with the appearance of prose instructions, but rather exist alongside these, e.g. in the form of the Late Medieval German illuminated manuscripts.\n\nFechtbuch (plural Fechtbücher) is Early New High German for \"combat manual\", one of the manuscripts or printed books of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance containing descriptions of a martial art. Usually, the term is taken to include 15th- and 16th-century German manuals, but the nature of the subject matter does not allow a clear separation of these from treatises from other parts of Europe on one hand (particularly from the Italian and French schools), and from manuals of later centuries on the other hand.\n\nA list of \"Fechtbücher\" include: \n\n\nThe Italian school is attested in an early manual of 1410, at which time it is not yet clearly separable from the German school. Indeed, the author Fiore dei Liberi states that he has learned much of his art from one \"Master Johannes of Swabia\". The heyday of the Italian school comes in the 16th century, with the Dardi school.\n\n\nSimilar to the situation in Italy, there is one early manual (c. 1400, dealing with the pollaxe exclusively, and later treatises set in only after a gap of more than a century.\n\n\nThe most ancient European school of fencing is considered to be a Venetian one, since the first time it is mentioned is dated by XII century. Written sources that remained to this day date from the XVI century.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mention of Destreza dates back to the 15th-16th centuries, however the exact date of the Spanish fencing school’s establishment is unknown.\n\nGerard Thibault \"Academy of the sword\", 1628.\n\nApart from three rather opaque texts of the later 15th century, the native English tradition of fencing manuals begins with George Silver's \"Paradoxes of Defense\" (1599).\n\n\n\nScottish manuals detailing the use of the basket-hilted Scottish broadsword, besides other disciplines such as the smallsword and spadroon, were published throughout the 18th century, with early and late examples dating to the late 17th and early 19th centuries, respectively:\n\n\nThere are some manuals containing training advice for the medieval tournament and jousting such as the early Portuguese work \"A ensinança de bem cavalgar em toda a sela\" by Edward of Portugal (1391–1438). A riding instruction manual that also included martial information.\n\n17th-century Spanish Destreza is very much steeped in the Spanish Baroque noblemen mindset, so doesn't contain much graphical explanations of the fencing techniques so much as hard to understand explanations based on mathematics and philosophical sciences in general. The subsequent difficulty on interpreting the theory and practice of Destreza correctly has led many times to this school of fencing being misunderstood.\n\n\nSome texts on unarmed combat survive from Han China (c. 1st century). A list of wrestling techniques is contained in the \"Malla Purana\" of 13th century Gujarat, India. The Chinese \"Jixiao Xinshu\" dates to the 1560s. The Korean \"Muyejebo\" dates to 1598, the \"Muyedobotongji\" dates to 1790. The Japanese \"The Book of Five Rings\" dates to 1645.\n\n\n"}

Produced at the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal, the film uses the technique known as pixilation, an animation technique using live actors as stop-motion objects. McLaren created the soundtrack of the film by scratching the edge of the film, creating various blobs, lines, and triangles which the projector read as sound. Pablo Picasso called this the greatest film ever made.\n\nTwo men, and Grant Munro, live peacefully in adjacent cardboard houses. When a flower blooms between their houses, they fight each other to the death over the ownership of the single small flower.\n\nThe moral of the film is, simply, \"Love your neighbour\" . The moral is also shown in other languages, including:\n\n\"Neighbours\" has been described as \"one of the most controversial films the NFB ever made\". The eight-minute film was politically motivated:\n\"I was inspired to make \"Neighbours\" by a stay of almost a year in the People's Republic of China. Although I only saw the beginnings of Mao's revolution, my faith in human nature was reinvigorated by it. Then I came back to Quebec and the Korean War began. (...) I decided to make a really strong film about anti-militarism and against war.\" — \"Norman McLaren\" \nThe version of \"Neighbours\" that ultimately won an Oscar was not the version McLaren had originally created. In order to make the film palatable for American and European audiences, McLaren was required to remove a scene in which the two men, fighting over the flower, murdered the other's wife and children.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, public opinion changed, and McLaren was asked to reinstate the sequence. The original negative of that scene had been destroyed, so the scene was salvaged from a positive print of lower quality.\n\nNFB founder John Grierson, who had invited McLaren to the NFB to form its first animation unit, would ultimately disparage \"Neighbours\" and McLaren's attempt at political cinema:\n\"I wouldn't trust Norman around the corner as a political thinker. I wouldn't trust Norman around the corner as a philosophic thinker. That's not what Norman is for. Norman is for \"Hen Hop\". Hen Hop. That's wonderful. And so many other things. That's his basic gift. He's got joy in his movement. He's got loveliness in his movement. He's got fancy in his changes. That's enough\"\nThe term 'pixilation' was created by Grant Munro, who had worked with McLaren on \"Two Bagatelles\", a pair of short pixilation films made prior to \"Neighbours.\" While \"Neighbours\" is often credited as an animated film by many film historians, very little of the film is actually animated. The majority of the film is shot with variable-speed photography, usually in fast motion, with some stop-frame techniques. During one brief sequence, the two actors appear to levitate: this effect was actually achieved in stop-motion; the men repeatedly jumped upward but were photographed only at the top of their trajectories. Under the current definition of an animated short, it is unlikely that \"Neighbours\" would qualify as either a documentary short or an animated short.\n\nMcLaren followed \"Neighbours\" with two other films using a similar combination of pixilation, live action, variable speed photography and string-puppets. The first, \"A Chairy Tale\" (1957) was a collaboration with Claude Jutra and Ravi Shankar. The second, \"Opening Speech by Norman McLaren\" (1960) was made for the International Film Festival of Montreal, and starred McLaren himself.\n\nWolf Koenig served as cameraman on the film.\n\n\"Neighbours\" is the winner of both a Canadian Film Award and an Oscar, for the latter of which it was nominated twice, for Short Subject (One-reel) and for Best Documentary (Short Subject). Strangely, it was in the Documentary category that this short, stylized drama won its Oscar. A press release issued by AMPAS states that \"Neighbours\" is \"among a group of films that not only competed, but won Academy Awards in what were clearly inappropriate categories.\" \n\nThis film was designated as a \"masterwork\" by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada’s audio-visual heritage.\n\nIn 2009, \"Neighbours\" was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme, listing the most significant documentary heritage collections in the world.\n\nExtreme's video for the first single, \"Rest in Peace\", from their third album \"III Sides To Every Story\" was closely modelled after \"Neighbours\", except instead of a flower, the neighbors fight over a TV set showing the band performing the song. The NFB took legal action and the matter was settled out of court, with withdrawal of the video from circulation.. However, the withdrawn video was subsequently posted on YouTube where it can be viewed in its entirety.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23144534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23144534", "title": "Oriental Magic", "text": "Oriental Magic\n\nOriental Magic, by Idries Shah, is a study of magical practices in diverse cultures from Europe and Africa, through Asia to the Far East. Originally published in 1956 and still in print today, it was the first of this author’s 35 books. The work was launched with the encouragement of the anthropologist, Professor Louis Marin, who in his preface to the book stressed its “scholarly accuracy” and “real contribution to knowledge”.\n\nMagic had long been considered outside the discipline of academic study, but Shah’s approach, which involved five years of study and field work, was – very unusually for the 1950s – multi-disciplinary and cross-cultural. His documented material came from archaeology, anthropology, history, religion, and psychology, as well as from artefacts, obscure manuscripts, and an impressive range of expert informants, who made (often unpublished) specialist material available to him. As a result, the secrecy and obfuscation around magical operations and practitioners was defused by the author’s informed, dispassionate approach to the array of arcane information he had assembled, some of it printed for the first time. \n\"Oriental Magic\" seems also to have been a clearly stated invitation for magic in general to be investigated as any other subject in the West would be, with coolness, objectivity and scientific method. The book in itself can be seen as providing a ground plan for future researchers, signalling useful directions their investigations might take, and specifying topics which might yield to further study.\n\nThe author examines a vast accumulation of materials on human beliefs, magical practices and ceremonies, from North Africa to Japan. Among much else, these include a conspectus of Jewish, Tibetan, Arabian, Iranian and Indian magic, an account of Sufism and its origins, legends of the sorcerers, examples of alchemy, talismans and magical rites found in the cultures studied, and topics such as love magic, the witchdoctors of the Nile Valley, the ‘singing sands’ of Egypt, subcutaneous electricity, and the prehistoric sources of Babylonian occult practices. There are also personal accounts of, for instance, Shah’s ‘training’ under a Ju-Ju witch doctor, a demonstration of Hindu levitation, and translations of what were considered secret alchemical and magical formulae.\n\nShah finds that magical origins in High Asia have influenced communities halfway across the world, and that the westward drift from that original source might explain the great similarity in magical beliefs, practices and terminology in places as diverse as China, the Near East, Scandinavia and Africa. The type of witch-doctoring (shamanism) practised in the east, for example, is duplicated among the Finns, the Sami, and even the American Indians.\n\nThe author tracks distortions from original sources, winnows fact from supposition, allows for alternative explanations of phenomena, such as physiological and psychological responses which are separate from the apparent “magic”, and shows how much dross has accumulated around many of the practices he inspects. But he suggests there also remains a residue of what, in magical terminology, could be called “pure gold”, and that some of this “gold” is likely to reflect hitherto little-understood forces “which may very possibly be harnessed to individual and collective advantage”.\n\n\"Oriental Magic\" has been in print for more than 50 years. The Book Exchange, referring to its re-publication in 1968, said the book had “come to be regarded as essential reading for those concerned with research in the fields of human beliefs”.\nAt the time of first publication, \"The Times Literary Supplement\" described it as containing a “wealth of illustrative material” for which the lay reader might be grateful. The religious periodical, \"Hibbert Journal\", called it “fascinating and illuminating”, with “a great deal of interesting information”, and said that “the accounts of personal experience in the Sudan and Tibet were “especially … fascinating”. \"Time & Tide\", a general circulation weekly, said it was “a most interesting collection of facts concerning magical practices and their history”, with “an admirable bibliography” and also …. “heaped with various jewels” … [which] “should provide a rich source of data for psychologists, anthropologists and psychical research”. The scientific journal \"Nature\" said Shah’s approach was “a point of view of which too little has been heard in the past”, and recommended the work as “valuable and entertaining reading”. Contemporary Review called it “a serious work of considerable anthropological interest.” Professor Louis Marin wrote: “Oriental Magic deserves to find a wide audience of educated readers”.\n\nIn a review in the \"Journal of Bible and Religion\" (1958), Swami Akhilananda of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in Boston, Massachusetts, wrote that Shah had been \"the first to write on Oriental Magic as it is presented in this fascinating book.\" He praised the breadth of the book's coverage, noting that it covered many different religious traditions, and commented on the fact that Shah had evidently travelled widely to collect his source material.\n\nReviewing the book in the \"Journal of Asian Studies\" (1958), Alan J. A. Elliot wrote that \"Shah obviously has a profound personal interest in the occult, and has gone to very great lengths to collect a great amount on interesting information. His method of exposition is, however, most likely to appeal to the reader without a strongly developed scientific interest in the subject.\" Elliott considered the book too short to do justice to the wide range of practices and traditions it sought to cover, spanning all of Europe and much of Africa and Asia; nevertheless he concluded \"Oriental Magic\" was a \"well-written and interesting book\", and a \"contribution to the study of the occult, whatever the source of a student's interest in the subject may be.\"\n\n\n"}

The polydactyly in these largely aquatic animals is not to be confused with polydactyly in the medical sense, i.e. it was not an anomaly in the sense it was not a congenital condition of having more than the typical number of digits for a given taxon. Rather, it appears to be a result of the early evolution from a limb with a fin rather than digits.\n\nTetrapods evolved from animals with fins such as found in lobe-finned fishes. From this condition a new pattern of limb formation evolved, where the development axis of the limb rotated to sprout secondary axes along the lower margin, giving rise to a variable number of very stout skeletal supports for a paddle-like foot. The condition is thought to have arisen from the loss of the fin ray-forming proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2 or modification of the expression of HOXD13.\n\nEarly groups like \"Acanthostega\" had eight digits, while the more derived \"Ichthyostega\" had seven digits, the yet-more derived \"Tulerpeton\" had six toes. \"Crassigyrinus\" from the fossil-poor Romer's gap in early Carboniferous is usually thought to have had five digits to each foot. The Anthracosaurs, which may be stem-tetrapods or reptiliomorphs, retained the five-toe pattern still found in Amniotes, while further reduction had taken place on other Labyrinthodont lines, leaving the forefoot with four toes and the hind foot with five, a pattern still found in modern amphibians. The increasing knowledge of Labyrinthodonts from Romer's gap has led to the challenging of the hypothesis that pentadactyly, as displayed by most modern tetrapods, is plesiomorphic. The number of digits was once thought to have been reduced in amphibians and reptiles independently, but more recent studies suggest that a single reduction occurred, along the tetrapod stem, in the Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous. However, even the early Ichthyostegalians like \"Acanthostega\" and \"Ichthyostega\" appear to have had the forward ossified bony toes combined in a single stout digit, making them effectively five-toed.\n\n"}

{"id": "54698193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54698193", "title": "September 2, 1692 letter by Cotton Mather", "text": "September 2, 1692 letter by Cotton Mather\n\nIn a letter dated September 2, 1692, Cotton Mather wrote to judge William Stoughton. Among the notable things about this letter is the provenance: it seems to be the last important correspondence from Cotton Mather to surface in modern times, with the holograph manuscript not arriving in the archives for scholars to view, and authenticate, until sometime between 1978 and 1985.\n\nOn August 19, 1692, five accused individuals had been executed in Salem, Massachusetts, bringing the total to eleven (reaching twenty by the end of September.) Cotton Mather had attended this execution and one account shows him giving a speech on horseback that seemed to quiet a crowd that had previously been calling for mercy for the accused.\n\nCotton Mather begins the September 2 letter by writing that he has \"made the world sensible of my zeal to assist... your honour...[in the] extinguishing of as wonderful a piece of devilism as has been seen in the world; and yet... one half of my endeavors to serve you have not been told or seen.\" Further alluding to the delicate care and subterfuge he employs in his presentation, he writes, \"I have laboured to divert the thoughts of my readers, even with something of a designed contrivance...\" He asks for Stoughton's permission and approbation in writing on the specifics of the current trials. This strongly suggests CM's later claim that his book was \"commanded\" by colonial Governor William Phips may have been a bold inversion of the truth, as Phips letter on October 10, 1692 says he \"put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or other.\"\n\nAlong with the letter, CM sends a lengthy portion of the book he has already written, telling Stoughton to feel free to skip the first 34 pages. Yet he says he has \"not included all the papers mentioned in my title.\" Against this backdrop, and the \"swelling public outcry\" of August, Stacy Schiff concludes that Cotton Mather's book must be viewed as \"a propaganda piece\" departing from a common late twentieth century view of the book as a \"defense\" of the trials.\n\nStoughton responded enthusiastically to the letter, and his personal endorsement of the forthcoming \"Wonders\" is re-printed therein. Stoughton may have aided CM in going around Phips's ban by helping him ship the book to England to be published there. But another major goal of CM, as expressed in September 2 letter, seems to have been the hope of obtaining copies of the official trial records, and in this he seems to have been further stalled, as can be seen in his letter to the trial clerk Stephen Sewall on September 20, 1692. CM probably did not receive these records until September 22, 1692 when Stephen Sewall travelled to Boston for a meeting at his brother's house with CM and Stoughton.\n\nThere are some indications that the arrival of the holograph of this letter in the archives may have come as an unwelcome surprise to some twentieth-century scholars of the colonial period. David Levin points out that the letter demonstrates the timeline used by both \"Thomas J. Holmes and Perry Miller\" is off by \"three weeks.\" Writing in the same year as Levin, 1985, Harold Jantz had submitted an essay describing various frauds and fakes and he included the AAS typescript copy of what he calls the \"Stoughton letter\" (September 2, 1692) calling it a \"nasty, pathological\" forgery. But in an addendum to the essay, Jantz writes that just before publication \"barely in time for this added note, new information reached me about the letter... at present the manuscript is firmly labelled as 'original' and 'holograph'\" Yet as Jantz continues the essay, he still seems to harbor suspicions, referring to the letter's \"author\" instead of Cotton Mather. \"What if it should turn out that the Stoughton letter cannot be proved to be a forgery?\" Jantz writes. \"This would make it doubly fascinating, doubly perplexing.\" And \"would require that we rewrite Cotton Mather's biography as two Cotton Mather's biographies.\"\n\nThe same year as the Jantz essay, 1985, Kenneth Silverman had been awarded a Pulitzer and a Bancroft Prize for a biography of Cotton Mather published the year before, 1984. Unlike Jantz, Silverman's introduction to the September 2, 1692 letter in his book of Cotton Mather correspondence (1971) does not directly dispute the authenticity of the letter beyond saying the holograph could not be located, but his basic assessment of Cotton Mather (\"he did not want to defend [the trials]\") suggests that Silverman, like TJ Holmes, Perry Miller, Jantz (and also perhaps Levin, who published a bio of Cotton Mather in 1978), did not previously believe the typescript copy of the letter was authentic and this would have affected work conducted prior to the knowledge of the holograph in 1985.\n\nAlso published in 1985, and written presumably before the holograph of the letter reached the archives, David D. Hall strikes a triumphant note for the revision lead by GL Kittredge at Harvard. \"With him one great phase of interpretation came to a dead end.\" Hall writes that whether the old interpretation favored by \"antiquarians\" had begun with the \"malice of Robert Calef or deep hostility to Puritanism,\" either way \"such notions are no longer... the concern of the historian.\" But David Hall notes \"one minor exception. Debate continues on the attitude and role of Cotton Mather... though none of his recent biographers is at all interested in making him responsible for Salem...\" Hall mentions both Levin and Silverman. In 1991, Hall published \"Witch-hunting in Seventeenth Century New England: A Documentary History.\" Hall does not publish or mention the recently controversial Sept. 2 letter and in a footnote Hall writes, \"The circumstances under which Mather composed \"Wonders\"... are admirably sketched by Thomas J. Holmes...\" \n\nAssociated with the holograph in the Burns Library is a faint one-page typescript leaflet, dated April 7, 1943. The leaflet is a description of three Cotton Mather A.L.S. (Autograph Letter Signed) being offered for sale. The leaflet begins:\n\nThe leaflet concludes:\nMr. Brigham offered me $500 for this which means that it is worth from $1000 to $1500 for he is a good buyer and very conservative in price. He considers this one of the best finds in A.L.S. in years.\n\nOf the three A. L. S. being offered, the letter from which an \"exact copy\" was taken and sent to John Richards is discussed at length. In 1971, Ken Silverman noted that Mather's letter to Richards, dated May 31, 1692, was \"not in Mather's hand.\" A second A.L.S., the \"Return of Several Ministers\" is mentioned only in passing. The third A.L.S., the letter of September 2, 1692 and subject of this article, is not mentioned explicitly at all. Although this letter is of extremely high research value, the seller apparently did not think its value to collectors would be as great as the other two well-known documents. The leaflet also mentions showing the A.L.S. to Mr Brigham of the American Antiquarian Society, offering a clue as to the origin and date of the Society's typescript copy of the Sept 2, 1692 letter.\n\nAccording to Jantz, the original manuscript of the letter was sold by the widow of the collector who once owned it to the Boston College and David Levin had reaffirmed the authenticity and \"double checked with some of the experts who had verified Mather's handwriting at the time of acquisition...\" and found the paper \"of the right age.\" Neither Jantz nor Levin seem to have noted that the letter could be further verified by a line of handwriting by William Stoughton (the AAS typescript also contains this line at the end, copied with a pen) a paraphrased version of this opening line was reprinted by Cotton Mather in his book some weeks later. Stacy Schiff, writing thirty years after Jantz and Levin, seems to be the first person on record to take notice of this fact, \"Stoughton began his fulsome reply on the verso.\"\nSchiff also might be the first scholar, following Jantz and Levin, to note the location of the holograph at the John J. Burns Library of Rare Books and Special Collections at Boston College.\n\nBetween 1985 and 2015, there appears to have been little notice of what Jantz called the \"doubly fascinating, doubly perplexing\" letter, or its location and availability for scholarship in the archives, including the interest that coincided with the tercentary of the trials in 1992.\n\nWriting in 2002, Mary Beth Norton seems to accept the Sept. 2 letter's authenticity and quotes some milder passages, citing the reprint in Silverman (1971). It is unclear whether Norton was aware of the controversy around the letter expressed in 1985. In the citation, Norton does not address the Kittredge-Holmes-Miller lineage, which David D. Hall had praised in early 1985, but Norton distances her work from chapter 13 of Perry Miller's 1953 book (Miller cites TJ Holmes for this chapter). Miller's book, she writes, contains \"an interpretation of Mather's work on \"Wonders\" that differs considerably from mine.\"\n\nClive Holmes in a 2016 essay underscores the importance of the content of the September 2 letter and makes note of the typescript at AAS (but not the holograph at Boston College) and suggests Silverman's abridgement of the letter in 1971 was overly severe. If Silverman was working within a lineage that distrusted the authenticity of the AAS typescript, as the 1985 essays by Jantz and Levin suggest, it would be understandable why his reprint of the letter in 1971 was truncated.\n\nDigital copies of the letter are now available via email from both AAS (original typescript) and Boston College (holograph).\n"}

It is a kind of blood-sucking hag. \n\nThe \"soucouyant\" is a shapeshifting Caribbean folklore character who appears as a reclusive old woman by day. By night, she strips off her wrinkled skin and puts it in a mortar. In her true form, as a fireball she flies across the dark sky in search of a victim. The soucouyant can enter the home of her victim through any sized hole like cracks, crevices and keyholes.\n\nSoucouyants suck people's blood from their arms, legs and soft parts while they sleep leaving blue-black marks on the body in the morning. If the soucouyant draws too much blood, it is believed that the victim will either die and become a soucouyant or perish entirely, leaving her killer to assume her skin. The soucouyant practices black magic. Soucouyants trade their victims' blood for evil powers with Bazil, the demon who resides in the silk cotton tree.\n\nTo expose a soucouyant, one should heap rice around the house or at the village cross roads as the creature will be obligated to gather every grain, grain by grain (a herculean task to do before dawn) so that she can be caught in the act. To destroy her, coarse salt must be placed in the mortar containing her skin so she perishes, unable to put the skin back on. Belief in soucouyants is still preserved to an extent in Guyana and some Caribbean islands, including Dominica, Haiti, Suriname and Trinidad.\n\nThe skin of the soucouyant is considered valuable, and is used when practicing black magic.\n\nSoucouyants belong to a class of spirits called jumbies. Some believe that soucouyants were brought to the Caribbean from European countries in the form of French vampire-myths. These beliefs intermingled with those of enslaved Africans.\n\nIn the French West Indies, specifically the island of Guadeloupe, and also in Suriname, the Soukougnan or Soukounian is a person able to shed his or her skin to turn into a vampiric fireball. In general these figures can be anyone, not only old women, although some affirm that only women could become Soukounian, because only female breasts could disguise the creature's wings.\n\nThe term \"Loogaroo\" also used to describe the soucouyant, possibly comes from the French mythological creature called the Loup-garou, a type of werewolf; often confused with each other since they are pronounced the same. In Haiti, what would be considered a werewolf, is called \"jé-rouges\" (\"red eyes\"). As in Haiti, the Loogaroo is also common in Mauritian culture. In Suriname this creature is called \"Asema\".\n\nAs the legend of the Soucouyant has been verbally passed down over the centuries, the story has changed with the passage of time, so that the Soucouyant is no longer exclusively described as an elderly woman.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Scheduled for demolition in 2009, after a long public campaign to preserve what had become Cardiff's oldest public house, in 2012 it was donated to the National History Museum at St Fagans, where it is being reconstructed.\n\nThe Vulcan Hotel was built in 1853, in the early stages of the expansion of Cardiff and the development of the Adamsdown area of Cardiff, with an original address on Whitmore Lane, Newtown. The name Vulcan, the ancient Roman God of Fire, which it kept throughout its existence, referred to the nearby ironworks.\n\nClose to the bustling railway station of Queen Street and within walking distance of Cardiff Gaol, the pub was south of the Newport Road in the suburb's working-class area. It was frequently busy over lunch times and in the early evening, patronised by working-class people, often of Irish descent.\n\nThe building was substantially rebuilt in about 1900, and internally refurbished in 1914 by local architect F. J. Veall, at which time the building was decorated throughout with green and brown ceramic tiles. With a functional and easy-to-clean internal style, while adjoining Victorian buildings were demolished and redeveloped, twice on one side, it remained untouched, both outside and in, except for an occasional coat of paint. The pub retained its brown ceramic urinals, although the rest of the interior was updated in the 1950s. Local writer John Williams commented in 2011:\n\nThe opening, directly opposite the pub, in November 2007, of the Atrium campus of the University of Glamorgan, home to the Cardiff School of Creative & Cultural Industries, gave the pub a substantial potential new customer base.\n\nThe Vulcan was voted Cardiff Pub of the Year by the local branch of CAMRA in both 1997 and 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Brains Brewery confirmed that they were to terminate their lease on the property. Site owner and freeholder, businessman Derek Rapport via his company Marcol Asset Management, had plans accepted at Cardiff Council for the demolition of the building and subsequent mixed-use redevelopment of the surrounding site, based around a multi-storey car park.\n\nA local campaign began to protect what by then was Cardiff's oldest surviving original public house. A petition was raised that gathered over 5,000 signatures, politicians lobbied, and celebrities including James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers and actor Rhys Ifans actively supported the campaign and visited the premises. The Cardiff band Future of the Left recorded the video for their single \"The Hope That House Built\" on the premises. But Cadw declined to make the pub a listed building, due to the fact that it had been substantially rebuilt in the 1900s and that there were better surviving examples elsewhere. However, as a result of public pressure, the freeholders agreed to a three-year extension of the lease to Brains.\n\nBut in early 2012, Brains confirmed that they would be terminating their lease when it expired in March 2012, stating that the business was commercially unviable. With the building again threatened with demolition, but still with a growing local media campaign to save the building, Marcol Asset Management agreed to donate the building to the St Fagans National Museum of History. Brains subsequently closed the pub as scheduled in May 2012, while the museum started an appeal for photographs, objects and stories relating to the Vulcan and its history.\n\nIn July 2012, building contractors and preservationists were deployed by the National History Museum to start deconstruction of the building by hand, to allow brick by brick movement to St Fagans. By July 2013, the de-constructed parts of the building were held between the museums sites at St Fagans and Nantgarew, awaiting planning permission for the buildings reconstruction, and is estimated to be reopened in 2019. The eventual plan is to reopen the pub with a suitably-styled historic theme, with actors serving historic ales.\n\nhttps://museum.wales/stfagans/buildings/the_vulcan_pub/"}

It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm Stratton Oakmont engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down. Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Joanna Lumley and Jean Dujardin also star. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004), \"The Departed\" (2006) and \"Shutter Island\" (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series \"Boardwalk Empire\" (2010–14).\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was the first to be released entirely through digital distribution. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013. The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use and the use of animals during production. The film also caused controversy due to accusations that it was financed by illegally obtained funds from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction, the comedic performance of DiCaprio and the fast-paced and consistent humor. The film was nominated for several awards including five nominations at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations for DiCaprio and Hill, respectively. The film did not win in any category, although DiCaprio did win Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. It was also recognized by numerous other awards ceremonies, as well as guilds and critics' associations.\n\nIn 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.\n\nJordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. After an exposé in \"Forbes\", hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.\n\nDonnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.\n\nTwo years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a \"cunt\" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.\n\nIn 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio/Warner Bros. won a bidding war against Brad Pitt/Paramount Pictures for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film. During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on \"Shutter Island\". He describes having \"wasted five months of [his] life\" without getting a green light on production dates by the Warner Bros. studio. Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. had offered Ridley Scott to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead, but the studio eventually dumped the project.\n\nIn 2012, a green light was given by the independent company Red Granite Pictures allowing no restrictions to the content development. Scorsese knew that there were no limits to the content that he would produce and therefore came back on board, resulting in an R rating. Red Granite Pictures also asked Paramount Pictures to distribute the film; Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film in North America and Japan, but passed on the rest of the international market.\n\nThe FBI has issued subpoenas to several past and present employees of Red Granite Pictures in regards to allegations that US$155 million was diverted from the Malaysian wealth fund 1MDB to help finance \"The Wolf of Wall Street\". This relates to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. A civil lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to claim \"any rights to profits, royalties and distribution proceeds\" from \"The Wolf of Wall Street\". To settle the civil lawsuit, Red Granite Pictures has agreed to pay US$60 million to the U.S. government.\n\nIn the film, most of the real-life characters' names have been changed from Belfort's original memoir. Donnie Azoff is based on Danny Porush. The name was changed after Porush threatened to sue the filmmakers. Porush maintains that much of the film was fictional and that Donnie Azoff was not in fact an accurate depiction of him. The FBI agent known as Patrick Denham is the stand-in for real-life Gregory Coleman, and lawyer Manny Riskin is based on Ira Sorkin. Belfort's first wife Denise Lombardo is renamed Teresa Petrillo, while second wife Nadine Caridi became Naomi Lapaglia on-screen. In contrast, Mark Hanna's name remains the same as the LF Rothschild stockbroker who, like Belfort, was convicted of fraud and served time in prison. Belfort's parents Max and Leah Belfort's names remained the same for the film. The role of Aunt Emma was initially offered to Julie Andrews, who refused it as she was recovering from an ankle injury, and she was replaced by Joanna Lumley.\n\nIn January 2014, Jonah Hill revealed in an interview with Howard Stern that he made only $60,000 on the film (the lowest possible SAG-AFTRA rate for his amount of work), while his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio (who also produced) received $10 million. Hill didn't care about his settlement though, and wanted to play Donnie Azoff so badly that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the part as it was his dream to be in a Scorsese film.\n\nFilming began on August 8, 2012, in New York. Jonah Hill announced that his first day of shooting was September 4, 2012. Filming also took place in Closter, New Jersey and Harrison, New York. In January 2013, additional scenes were shot at a set built in an abandoned office building in Ardsley, New York. Scenes at the beach house were filmed in Sands Point, New York.\n\nScorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker stated that the film would be shot digitally instead of on film. Scorsese had been a proponent of shooting on film but decided to shoot \"Hugo\" digitally because it was being photographed in 3D; however, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was originally planned to be shot digitally despite being filmed in 2D. Schoonmaker expressed her disappointment with the decision: \"It would appear that we've lost the battle. I think Marty just feels it's unfortunately over, and there's been no bigger champion of film than him.\" After extensive comparison tests during pre-production, eventually the majority of the film was shot on film stock while scenes that used green screen effects or low light were shot with the digital Arri Alexa. The film contains 400–450 VFX shots.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" uses animals including a chimpanzee, a lion, a snake, a fish, and dogs. The chimpanzee and the lion were provided by the Big Cat Habitat wildlife sanctuary in Sarasota County, Florida. The four-year-old chimpanzee Chance spent time with actor Leonardo DiCaprio and learned to roller skate over the course of three weeks. The sanctuary also provided a lion named Handsome because the film's trading company used a lion for its symbol. Danny Porush, Jordan Belfort's real-life partner, denied that there were any animals in the office, although he admitted to eating an employee's goldfish.\n\nIn December 2013, before the film's premiere, the organization Friends of Animals criticized the use of the chimpanzee and organized a boycott of the film. \"Variety\" reported, \"Friends of Animals thinks the chimp ... suffered irreversible psychological damage after being forced to act.\" \"The Guardian\" said, \"Criticism of \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"'s use of a chimpanzee arrives as Hollywood comes under ever-increasing scrutiny for its employment of animals on screen,\" referring to a November 2013 report in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that was critical of the American Humane Association's treatment of animals in films. PETA also launched a campaign to highlight mistreatment of ape \"actors\" and to petition for DiCaprio not to work with great apes.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 17, 2013, followed by a wide release on December 25, 2013. It was previously slated to be released on November 15, 2013, but the date was pushed back after film cuts were made to reduce the run time. On October 22, 2013, it was reported that the film was set for a Christmas 2013 release. Paramount officially confirmed the Christmas Day 2013 release date on October 29, 2013, with a running time of 165 minutes. On November 25, 2013, the length was announced to be 179 minutes. It was officially rated R for \"sequences of strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence\". Scorsese had to edit sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating. By different counts, the film contains between 506 and 569 uses of the word \"fuck\", and currently holds the record for the most uses of the word in a mainstream non-documentary film.\n\nThe film is banned in Malaysia, Nepal, Zimbabwe, and Kenya because of its scenes depicting sex, drugs and excessive use of swear words, and additional scenes have been cut in the versions playing in India. In Singapore, after cuts were made to an orgy scene as well as some religiously profane or denigrating language, the film was passed R21.\n\nThe film marks a change in film history when Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format, eliminating 35mm film entirely. \"\" was the last Paramount production to include a 35mm film version, while \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was the first major movie distributed entirely digitally.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" grossed $116.9 million in North America and $275.1 million internationally, for a total gross of $392 million, making it Scorsese's highest-grossing film worldwide. In North America, the film opened at number five in its first weekend, with $18.4 million in 3,387 theaters, behind \"\", \"Frozen\", \"\", and \"American Hustle\". In Australia, it is the highest grossing R-rated film, earning $12.96 million.\n\nAccording to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio, the film was the most illegally downloaded film of 2014, as it was shared over 30 million times via torrent sites.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 25, 2014. On January 27, 2014, it was revealed that a four-hour director's cut would be attached to the home release. It was later revealed by Paramount Pictures and Red Granite Pictures that the home release would feature only the theatrical release.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" received positive reviews, with critics praising DiCaprio and Hill's performances, Scorsese's direction, and Winter's screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 267 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Funny, self-referential, and irreverent to a fault, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" finds Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their most infectiously dynamic.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine named \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" as the third best film of 2013, behind \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Gravity\" at numbers one and two, respectively. The movie was chosen as one of the top ten films of the year by the American Film Institute. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said \"it is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year.\" \"The Chicago Sun-Times\"'s Richard Roeper gave the film a \"B+\" score, saying the film was \"good, not great Scorsese\".\n\nDana Stevens, a member of the New York Film Critics Circle, wrote that the movie did not work for her after labeling the film \"Epic in size, claustrophobically narrow in scope.\" According to Marshall Fine of \"The Huffington Post\" the story \"wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high\". Some critics viewed the movie as an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown. DiCaprio responded that in his opinion the film does not glorify the excessive lifestyle it depicts.\n\nIn 2016, the film was ranked #78 on the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list. In June 2017, Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" named \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" as the 2nd best film of the 21st century so far, behind Jean-Luc Godard's \"In Praise of Love\" (2001).\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\nThe film received a \"C\" rating from audiences surveyed by CinemaScore, a rating lower than anything else in theaters the opening week of the film. The \"Los Angeles Times\" argues that the film attracted conservative viewers by depicting a more moral tone in its marketing than the film itself depicted.\n\nChristina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis, who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont, wrote an open letter addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticizing the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.\n\nSteven Perlberg of \"Business Insider\" saw an advance screening of the film at a Regal Cinemas near the Goldman Sachs building, with an audience of financial workers. Perlberg reported cheers from the audience at what he considered to be all the wrong moments—\"When Belfort — a drug addict attempting to remain sober — rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers.\"\n\nThe former Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were \"invented\", as for instance \"[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm.\" He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the \"thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars\", not accepting the filmmakers' argument that it would have detracted attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—\"beyond an insult\" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing \"a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company\", and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering \"variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims\".\n\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, Best Adapted Screenplay for Winter, Best Actor for DiCaprio, and Best Supporting Actor for Hill. It was also nominated for four BAFTAs, including Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, and two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. DiCaprio won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" features both original as well as existing music tracks, and was released on December 17, 2013 for digital download.\n\nMore than sixty songs were used in the film, but only sixteen were included on the official soundtrack. Notably, among the exceptions are original compositions by Theodore Shapiro.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1156292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1156292", "title": "Warburg Institute", "text": "Warburg Institute\n\nThe Warburg Institute is a research institution associated with the University of London in central London, England. A member of the School of Advanced Study, its focus is the study of cultural history and the role of images in culture - cross-disciplinary and global. It is concerned with the histories of art and science, and their relationship with superstition, magic, and popular beliefs.\n\nThe researches of the Warburg Institute are historical, philological and anthropological. It is dedicated to the study of the survival and transmission of cultural forms – whether in literature, art, music or science – across borders and from the earliest times to the present including especially the study of the influence of classical antiquity on all aspects of European civilization.\n\nBased originally in Hamburg, Germany, in 1933 the collection was moved to London, where it became incorporated into the University of London in 1944.\n\nThe Institute was formed in Hamburg, Germany, from the library of Aby Warburg (1866–1929), a student of Renaissance art and culture, and a scion of the wealthy Jewish Warburg family.\n\nAs an art historian, Warburg had become dissatisfied with an aestheticising approach to art history and was interested in a more philosophical and interdisciplinary approach. While studying the culture of Renaissance Florence, he grew interested in the influence of antiquity on modern culture, and the study of this second life of the Classical World became his life work.\n\nIn 1900 he decided to establish the Warburg-Bibliothek für Kulturwissenschaft, but, although he had begun collecting books in 1886, he didn't actually establish his library until 1909.\n\nWarburg was joined in 1913 by the Vienna art historian Fritz Saxl (1890–1948). They discussed the possibility of converting the library into a research institute in 1914, but World War I and illness interfered. After Warburg returned to Hamburg in 1924, he and Saxl initiated the process of conversion, and the Warburg-Bibliothek officially opened its doors as a research institute in 1926.\n\nEventually, the privately funded library, built around the interdisciplinary approach, became enormous. Warburg \"famously forfeited his right to a share of his fortune on condition that his younger brother Max would buy him any books he required\".\n\nThe institute was later affiliated to the University of Hamburg. Neo-Kantian Philosopher and professor at the newly founded University Ernst Cassirer used it, and his students Erwin Panofsky and Edgar Wind worked there.\n\nThe original Warburg Library building in Hamburg is now a research institute, Warburg-Haus Hamburg.\n\nIn 1933, under the shadow of Nazism, the Institute was relocated to London, where, with the aid of Lord Lee of Fareham, Samuel Courtauld, and the Warburg family, it was installed in Thames House in 1934. The Institute moved to the Imperial Institute Buildings in 1937. In 1944 it became associated with the University of London.\n\nHenri Frankfort succeeded Saxl as Director in 1949, and in 1955 was succeeded by Gertrud Bing, who had joined the organization in 1922. During her term as Director, the Institute moved to its current home at the University in 1958. Bing was succeeded by Ernst Gombrich in 1959. From 1976 to 1990, J. B. Trapp was Director, and from 1991 to 2001, Nicholas Mann. In 1994 the Warburg became a founding institute of the University of London's School of Advanced Study.\n\nRecent directors have been Charles Hope (2001 to 2010), Peter Mack (2010 to 2014) and David Freedberg (from July 2015 to April 2017).\n\nIn 2011, legal action was started by the University of London together with the Institute's Advisory Council about their disagreement regarding the meaning of the 1944 deed of trust that granted the University the collection; the pledge \"to maintain and preserve the collection 'in perpetuity' as 'an independent unit'\" is problematised by the institute's annual deficit, estimated at half a million pounds. Several students and scholars who had used the Warburg resources or studied there protested this planned merge. A petition on Change.org to save the Warburg's independence was started by Brooke Palmieri, a student of University College London after working on her PhD. thesis at the Warburg. In only two months, the petition had almost twenty five thousand signatures. In recent years, the University has charged a proportion of its total estate expenditure to the Warburg Institute; as a result, the finances of the once solvent Institute have been strongly affected. In November 2014, a judgement established that the University's conduct in this regard was not acceptable.\n\nThe Institute occupies a large building on Woburn Square, in the University of London's Bloomsbury campus in the central London Borough of Camden. Designed by Charles Holden and built in 1957, the building is adjacent to the University of London Student Union, Birkbeck College, School of Oriental and African Studies, and Christ the King Church. It is also the home of the studio of the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London.\n\nThe Warburg Institute maintains a research library of more than 350,000 volumes. These volumes, except for a small number of rare and valuable books, are kept on open shelves and are accessible to all. The Institute also holds a large photographic collection and the personal archives of Aby Warburg. The Institute is notable for its unusual and unique reference system: the Institute's collection is arranged by subject according to Warburg's division of human history into the categories of Action, Orientation, Word, and Image. The photographic collection holds the valuable archive of the Image of the Black in Western Art.\n\nIn addition to its primary purpose as an academic reference library, the Institute accepts a small number of graduate students each year. The Institute awards the degrees of Master of Arts in Cultural and Intellectual History (1300–1650) and Master of Arts in Art History, Curatorship and Renaissance culture, Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy; the first and the second are one-year degrees with taught and research components, the MPhil is a two-year research degree which would usually be expected to lead onto a PhD with further study, and the last is a three-year research degree.\n\nThe emphasis of these programs is on developing interpretative skills in a number of different academic subjects, which follows from the Institute's interdiscplinary mission. Considerable attention is devoted to improving language skills and knowledge of primary sources.\n\nScholars associated with the Warburg Institute include Ernst Cassirer, Rudolf Wittkower, Otto Kurz, Henri Frankfort, Arnaldo Momigliano, Ernst Gombrich, Erwin Panofsky, Edgar Wind, Frances Yates, D. P. Walker, Michael Baxandall, Anthony Grafton, and Elizabeth McGrath. The current group of scholars continues the Institute's tradition of interdisciplinary research into history, philosophy, religion, and art. The permanent staff includes a number of academics and graduate students who hold short and long-term fellowships. Due to the small number of staff, students, and regular users, the Institute prides itself on a friendly and informal teaching and research atmosphere.\n\nTogether with the Courtauld Institute of Art, the Institute publishes \"The Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes\", an annual publication of about 300 pages.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Watson began wrestling in Toronto under his real name. He was a member of the Scarborough Athletic Club in the mid-1930s and was wrestling on what were billed as amateur wrestling shows in Toronto.\n\nFor four years as a teenager, Watson sold the Toronto Daily Star at the corner of Danforth and Dawes Road. He was convinced by his brother George to play hooky from piano lessons one Saturday to attend a wrestling session at the All Hallows Anglican Church gymnasium. The event changed Watson's life. He furthered his wrestling training with Phillip Lawson at the Bowles Athletic Club and later the Central YMCA.\n\nIn 1936, wrestling as Bill Potts, Watson appeared on cards at British Consols Stadium in Toronto that were advertised as amateur wrestling shows. In June of that year, he went on a tour of the United Kingdom along with fellow Toronto wrestlers Tommy Nelson, Al Korman, and Ken \"Tiger\" Tasker and their manager, Harry Joyce. English wrestling often involved hard-nosed shooting and he was sidelined for six months with a fractured shoulder and numerous broken ribs. It was on this tour that William Potts became Billy Watson. Booked by former Olympic Gold Medalist George de Relwyskow, Watson traveled through England and Ireland.\n\nAfter four years abroad, Watson and his wife returned to Canada, and he began wrestling at Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto under 27-year-old promoter Frank Tunney. Watson made his Gardens debut in the opening match of the October 3, 1940. Newspaper reports in November said Watson was frustrated with not getting a main event match in his first six appearances at the Gardens. He appeared in one Gardens main event in February 1941 but his big push came two months later. According to storyline, Watson filed a lawsuit against Tunney for breach of contract, claiming that he had been signed to wrestle a main event against Masked Wolf. When Tunney held an open tournament to determine the number one contender for the world title on May 1, 1941, Watson entered; filing a copy of his entry form with the Ontario Athletics Commission so that Tunney would be unable to claim he did not enter, and then won four matches in one night to win the tournament.\n\nFrom that point on, Watson was positioned as a legitimate main event performer, a position that was cemented during Watson's feud with Nanjo Singh, which began in January 1942. Watson soon became a crowd favourite and within a few years was a mainstream celebrity and one of Toronto's most popular citizens. Frank Tunney estimated that Whipper Watson drew more than five million people in main events of shows in Toronto. As one of the most popular wrestlers in the city's history, Watson spent 31 years entertaining fans. His debut at Maple Leaf Gardens was on October 3, 1940, and his last match was held on November 28, 1971.\n\nWatson defeated Nanjo Singh for the British Empire title on April 30, 1942. He feuded with Bill Longson, Lou Thesz, Yvon Robert, Gene Kiniski, Gorgeous George, and The Sheik, among many others. Watson earned a reputation as someone who was willing to lose clean in the ring. He earned an \"everyman\" image and Watson went on to hold the city of Toronto's regional title and the British Empire title on a regular basis.\n\nTunney cut Watson in on the business side of things. Their combined booking efforts resulted in large fortunes for the two of them. With connections to St. Louis promoter Tom Packs, Watson's notoriety resulted in Watson ending Longson's four year title reign with a victory at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on February 21, 1947. The territory of St. Louis became a home away from home for Watson. More than 10,000 St. Louis fans watched local hero Lou Thesz beat Watson for the world title on April 25, 1947. After Packs retired in 1948, Tunney bought into the territory in St. Louis and this resulted in many more matches for Watson in the city.\n\nWatson became one of a small group of wrestlers to have membership in the National Wrestling Alliance. In 1955, Watson expanded his business ventures by purchasing the Seattle territory from Bob Murray. Wrestlers from Toronto such as Doug Hepburn and Sky-Hi Lee wrestled for Watson in Seattle. Ken Kenneth ran the day-to-day operations for Watson and imported wrestlers from San Francisco to compete in Seattle. The territory folded a few months later.\n\nOn March 15, 1956, Watson ended Thesz's six-year reign as World Champion in front of 15,000 fans. Former boxing champion Jack Dempsey was the referee in the match. Watson traveled throughout North America and took on legends such as Gorgeous George, Pat O'Connor, Dick Hutton, Richard Dempk, Bobo Brazil, Hans Schmidt, Fritz Von Erich, Killer Kowalski and Buddy Rogers. Thesz regained the title from Watson on November 9, 1956 in St. Louis.\n\nHe also trained several wrestlers, including Farmer Brooks, a midget professional wrestler, and Rocky Johnson, a multiple-time tag team champion and father of The Rock.\n\nOutside of wrestling, Watson considered playing football for the Edmonton Eskimos in the 1950s. Watson tested the waters of politics as the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate in York East in the 1965 federal election. Watson placed second with 32% of the vote, falling about 2,500 votes behind Liberal Party of Canada candidate Steve Otto. Watson also promoted his own soft drink brand.\n\nOn November 28, 1971, he teamed with Bulldog Brower at the Gardens to beat Dingo the Sundowner and Man Mountain Cannon in less than five minutes.\n\nWatson was hit by an out-of-control car while placing a fireplace screen in the trunk of his car on November 30 on Rogers Road in Toronto. After a three-hour surgery at Northwestern Hospital, his knee eventually recovered, but Watson could never wrestle again. Although he nearly lost a leg, he continued his fundraising activities into his retirement.\n\nWatson was well known for his contributions to charity. He raised millions for campaigns such as the Easter Seals and was responsible for having 150,000 children join a safety club. He made many public appearances across Canada in support of children with physical disabilities and held an annual Easter Seals skate-a-thon at the Gardens. In 1974, he also started the \"Whipper Watson Snowarama for Timmy\" to raise money for the construction of a therapeutic pool. To date, Snowarama for Easter Seals Kids has raised over 16.1 million dollars provincially to help support children and youth with physical disabilities. Today, his campaign to build The Whipper Watson Therapeutic Pool at Southlake Regional Health Centre is illustrated in a mural in the facility.\n\nAs Watson was quoted in the Sault Star on January 31, 1979, \"They deserve a chance to live life as normally as you or I and we can help them do it. We can tear down some of those needless barriers that the handicapped face everyday. We can give thanks that our kids and families aren't afflicted and we can get out and sincerely work hard to make the 1979 Snowarama the most successful yet.\"\n\nOver the course of the next twelve years, Watson gained 130 pounds to weigh 350 pounds. He died on February 4, 1990 in Orlando, Florida. He is well-remembered in York Region where he lived. W.J. Watson Public School in Keswick, Ontario is named in his honour. He was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nWatson was the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's candidate in York East in the 1965 federal election, losing by 3,000 votes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The other outpost was the Far East Combined Bureau. Codebreakers Wilfred Noyce and Maurice Allen broke the Japanese Army's Water Transport Code here in 1943, the first high-level Japanese Army code broken. John Tiltman broke prewar Russian and Japanese codes at Simla and Abbottabad.\nThe WEC was located in Ramjas College (formerly part of the Delhi University campus), atop a hill called Anand Parbat \"the hill of happiness\" and was several miles out of Delhi and hence secure. Staff were from the Intelligence Corps, the British and Indian armies and the Royal Air Force. Section C under Colonel Marr-Johnson was a radio (wireless) intercept station and decoding section for Japanese codes. There were three outstations: the Wireless Experimental Depot in Abbottabad (where Russian (Soviet) transmissions were monitored in the interwar period), the Western Wireless sub centre at Bangalore and the Eastern Wireless sub centre at Barrackpore. There were also about 88 listening wireless sets around India, and several mobile Y-stations.\n\nWork on BULBUL the IJA air-to-ground code which was first broken at Bletchley Park was transferred to the WEC as it provided valuable tactical information on Japanese air raids.\n\nApart from Section C, the other four sections carried out administration, collating and evaluating signals intelligence, traffic analysis and radio interception. Colonel Aldridge headed the signals section, and had under his command No. 5 Wireless Detachment, Royal Corps of Signals. \n\nLieutenant-Colonel Peter Marr-Johnson was the head of Section C of the Wireless Experimental Centre from 1943. He ran a successful but \"too rigid\" operation, with staff finding him distant and snobbish. He was a regular Army officer, having been commissioned in the Royal Artillery. He showed a talent in languages, and in 1932 with two other officers was sent to Japan as a language student. He received training in cryptography at GC&CS, and was in a BP SLU (Special Liaison Unit) in Singapore and possibly Java (for Wavell). He was sent to Hong Kong in early 1939, and in 1939-40 (as a Captain, then Major) was attached to the FECB in Hong Kong, where he objected to being under Admiralty control. He had little time for war-commissioned officers, referring to one who had been in business before the war as a \"Bombay carpet-bagger\".\n\nMaurice Allen was an Oxford Don who with Wilfrid Noyce broke the Water Transport Code in spring 1943 at the WEC, the first high-level Japanese Army code broken (at the WEC and also at Central Bureau in Melbourne).\n\n"}
{"id": "55105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55105", "title": "World Brain", "text": "World Brain\n\nWorld Brain is a collection of essays and addresses by the English science fiction pioneer, social reformer, evolutionary biologist and historian H. G. Wells, dating from the period of 1936–1938. Throughout the book, Wells describes his vision of the World Brain: a new, free, synthetic, authoritative, permanent \"World Encyclopaedia\" that could help world citizens make the best use of universal information resources and make the best contribution to world peace.\n\nPlans for creating a global knowledge network long predate Wells. Andrew Michael Ramsay described, c. 1737, an objective of freemasonry as follows:\n\n... to furnish the materials for a Universal Dictionary ... By this means the lights of all nations will be united in one single work, which will be a universal library of all that is beautiful, great, luminous, solid, and useful in all the sciences and in all noble arts. This work will augment in each century, according to the increase of knowledge.\n\nThe Encyclopedist movement in France in the mid eighteenth century was a major attempt to actualize this philosophy. However, efforts to encompass all knowledge came to seem less possible as the available corpus expanded exponentially.\n\nPaul Otlet, a contemporary of Wells and information science pioneer, revived this movement in the twentieth century. Otlet wrote in 1935, \"Man would no longer need documentation if he were assimilated into a being that has become omniscient, in the manner of God himself.\" Otlet, like Wells, supported the internationalist efforts of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation.\n\nFor his part, Wells had advocated world government for at least a decade, arguing in such books as \"The Open Conspiracy\" for control of education by a scientific elite.\n\nIn the wake of the first World War, Wells believed that people needed to become more educated and conversant with events and knowledge that surrounded them. In order to do this he offered the idea of the knowledge system of the World Brain that all humans could access.\n\nThis section, Wells's first expression of his dream of a World Brain, was delivered as a lecture at the , Weekly Evening Meeting, Friday, 20 November 1936.\n\nWells begins the lecture with a statement on his preference for cohesive worldviews rather than isolated facts. Correspondingly, he wishes the world to be such a whole \"as coherent and consistent as possible\". He mentions \"The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind\" (1931), one of his own attempts at providing intellectual synthesis, and calls it disappointingly unmatched.\n\nHe expresses dismay at the ignorance of social science among the Treaty of Versailles and League of Nations framers. He mentions some recent works on the role of science in society and states his main problem as follows:\n\nWe want the intellectual worker to become a more definitely organised factor in the human scheme. How is that factor to be organised? Is there any way of implementing knowledge for ready and universal effect?\n\nIn answer he introduces the doctrine of New Encyclopaedism as a framework for integrating intellectuals into an organic whole. For the ordinary man, who will necessarily be an educated citizen in the modern state:\n\nFrom his point of view the World Encyclopaedia would be a row of volumes in his own home or in some neighbouring house or in a convenient public library or in any school or college, and in this row of volumes he would, without any great toil or difficulty, find in clear understandable language, and kept up to date, the ruling concepts of our social order, the outlines and main particulars in all fields of knowledge, an exact and reasonably detailed picture of our universe, a general history of the world, and if by any chance he wanted to pursue a question into its ultimate detail, a trustworthy and complete system of reference to primary sources of knowledge. In fields where wide varieties of method and opinion existed, he would find, not casual summaries of opinions, but very carefully chosen and correlated statements and arguments. [...] This World Encyclopaedia would be the mental background of every intelligent man in the world. It would be alive and growing and changing continually under revision, extension and replacement from the original thinkers in the world everywhere. Every university and research institution should be feeding it. Every fresh mind should be brought into contact with its standing editorial organisation. And on the other hand its contents would be the standard source of material for the instructional side of school and college work, for the verification of facts and the testing of statements—everywhere in the world. Even journalists would deign to use it; even newspaper proprietors might be made to respect it.\n\nSuch an encyclopedia would be akin to a secular bible. Universal acceptance would be possible due to the underlying similarity of human brains. For specialists and intellectuals, the World Encyclopedia will provide valuable coordination with other intellectuals working in similar areas.\n\nWells calls for the formation of an Encyclopaedia Society to promote the project and defend it from exploitation (e.g. by an \"enterprising publisher\" trying to profit from it). This society would also organize departments for production. Of course, the existence of a society has its own risks:\n\nAnd there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may feel and attempt to realise a sort of proprietorship in the organisation, to make a group or a gang of it. But to recognise that danger is half-way to averting it.\n\nThe language of the World Encyclopedia would be English because of its greater range, precision, and subtlety.\n\nIntellectual workers across the world would be increasingly bound together through their participation.\n\nWells wishes that wise world citizens would ensure world peace. He suggests that a world intellectual project will have more positive impact to this end than will any political movement such as communism, fascism, imperialism, pacifism, etc.\n\nHe was a communalist and contextualist and ended his lecture as follows:\n\n[W]hat I am saying ... is this, that without a World Encyclopaedia to hold men's minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality, there is no hope whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory alleviation of any of our world troubles.\n\nThis section was first delivered as a lecture in America, October and November 1937.\n\nThis lecture promotes the doctrine New Encyclopedism described previously. Wells begins with the observation that the world has become a single interconnected community due to the enormously increased speed of telecommunications. Secondly, he says that energy is available on a new scale, enabling, among other things, the capability for mass destruction. Consequently, the establishment of a new world order is imperative:\n\nOne needs an exceptional stupidity even to question the urgency we are under to establish some effective World Pax, before gathering disaster overwhelms us. The problem of reshaping human affairs on a world-scale, this World problem, is drawing together an ever-increasing multitude of minds.\n\nNeither Christianity nor socialism can solve the World Problem. The solution is a modernized \"World Knowledge Apparatus\"—the World Encyclopedia—\"a sort of mental clearing house for the mind, a depot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested, clarified and compared\". Wells thought that technological advances such as microfilm could be used towards this end so that \"any student, in any part of the world, will be able to sit with his projector in his own study at his or her convenience to examine \"any\" book, \"any\" document, in an exact replica\".\n\nIn this lecture Wells develops the analogy of the encyclopedia to a brain, saying, \"it would be a clearing house for universities and research institutions; it would play the role of a cerebral cortex to these essential ganglia\".\n\nHe mentions the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, an advisory branch of the League of Nations, and the 1937 World Congress of Universal Documentation as contemporary forerunners of the world brain.\n\nThis section was first published in \"Harper's Magazine\", April 1937, and contributed to the new \"Encyclopédie française\", August 1937.\n\nIn this essay, Wells explains how current encyclopaedias have failed to adapt to both the growing increase in recorded knowledge and the expansion of people requiring information that was accurate and readily accessible. He asserts that these 19th-century encyclopaedias continue to follow the 18th-century pattern, organisation and scale. \"Our contemporary encyclopedias are still in the coach-and-horse phase of development,\" he argued, \"rather than in the phase of the automobile and the aeroplane.\"\n\nWells saw the potential for world-altering impacts this technology could bring. He felt that the creation of the encyclopaedia could bring about the peaceful days of the past, \"with a common understanding and the conception of a common purpose, and of a commonwealth such as now we hardly dream of\".\n\nWells anticipated the effect and contribution that his World Brain would have on the university system as well. He wanted to see universities contributing to it, helping it grow, and feeding its search for holistic information. \"Every university and research institution should be feeding it\" (p. 14). Elsewhere Wells wrote: \"It would become the logical nucleus of the world's research universities and post-graduate studies.\" He suggested that the organization he was proposing \"would outgrow in scale and influence alike any single university that exists, and it would inevitably take the place of the loose-knit university system of the world in the concentration of research and thought and the direction of the general education of mankind\". In fact the new encyclopedism he was advocating was \"the only possible method I can imagine, of bringing the universities and research institutions around the world into effective cooperation and creating an intellectual authority sufficient to control and direct collective life\". Ultimately the World Encyclopaedia would be \"a permanent institution, a mighty super-university, holding together, utilizing and dominating all of the teaching and research organizations at present in existence\".\n\nThis section provides a brief excerpt of Wells's speech at the World Congress of Universal Documentation, 20 August 1937. He tells the participants directly that they are participating in the creation of a world brain. He says:\n\nThis section was delivered as the Presidential Address to the Educational Science Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 2 September 1937.\n\nWells expresses his dismay at the general state of public ignorance, even among the educated, and suggest that the Educational Science Section focus on the bigger picture:\n\nFor this year I suggest we give the questions of drill, skills, art, music, the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about the world in which they are to live?\n\nHe asks how the \"irreducible minimum of knowledge\" can be imparted to all people within ten years of education—realistically, he says, amounting to 2400 hours of classroom instruction. He suggests minimizing the teaching of names and dates in British history and focusing instead on newly available information about prehistory, early civilisation (without the traditionally heavy emphasis on Palestine and the Israelites), and the broad contours of world history. He suggests better education in geography, with an inventory of the world's natural resources, and a better curriculum in money and economics. He calls for a \"modernised type of teacher\", better paid, with better equipment, and continually updated training.\n\nOne of the stated goals of this Congress, held in Paris, France, in 1937, was to discuss ideas and methods for implementing Wells's ideas of the World Brain. Wells himself gave a lecture at the Congress.\n\nReginald Arthur Smith extended Wells's ideas in the book \"A Living Encyclopædia: A Contribution to Mr. Wells's New Encyclopædism\" (London: Andrew Dakers Ltd., 1941).\n\nIn his 1962 book \"Profiles of the Future\", Arthur C. Clarke predicted that the construction of what H. G. Wells called the World Brain would take place in two stages. He identified the first stage as the construction of the \"World Library\", which is basically Wells's concept of a universal encyclopaedia accessible to everyone from their home on computer terminals. He predicted this phase would be established (at least in the developed countries) by the year 2000. The second stage, the \"World Brain\", would be a superintelligent artificially intelligent supercomputer that humans would be able to mutually interact with to solve various world problems. The \"World Library\" would be incorporated into the \"World Brain\" as a subsection of it. He suggested that this supercomputer should be installed in the former war rooms of the United States and the Soviet Union once the superpowers had matured enough to agree to co-operate rather than conflict with each other. Clarke predicted the construction of the \"World Brain\" would be completed by the year 2100.\n\nIn 1964, Eugene Garfield published an article in the journal \"Science\" introducing the Science Citation Index; the article's first sentence invoked Wells's \"magnificent, if premature, plea for the establishment of a world information center\", and Garfield predicted that the Science Citation Index \"is a harbinger of things to come—a forerunner of the World Brain\".\n\nBrian R. Gaines in his 1996 paper \"Convergence to the Information Highway\" saw the World Wide Web as an extension of Wells's \"World Brain\" that individuals can access using personal computers. In papers published in 1996 and 1997 that did not cite Wells, Francis Heylighen and Ben Goertzel envisaged the further development of the World Wide Web into a global brain, i.e. an intelligent network of people and computers at the planetary level. The difference between \"global brain\" and \"world brain\" is that the latter, as envisaged by Wells, is centrally controlled, while the former is fully decentralised and self-organizing.\n\nIn 2001, Doug Schuler, a professor at Evergreen State University, proposed a worldwide civic intelligence network as the fulfillment of Wells's world brain. As examples he cited Sustainable Seattle and the \"Technology Healthy City\" project in Seattle.\n\nThere are a few similarities that link Wells' World Brain as a precursor to Wikipedia. Two to mention are the noncommercial aspect of both Wikipedia and the World Brain, as well as its international aspect. Wells did not want the Brain to be commercially funded, just as Jimmy Wales has decided not to have advertisements on Wikipedia, ensuring both were free from commercial bias. In addition, Wells envisioned microfilm as a universal format for which people could share information through the World Brain. His intention of using microfilm as the form for the World Brain mimics the use of the internet because he contended that the use of microfilm would abolish the distance between information and knowledge.\n\nA number of commentators have suggested that Wikipedia represents the World Brain as described by Wells. Joseph Reagle has compared Wells's warning about the need to defend the World Encyclopedia from propaganda with Wikipedia's norm:\n\nIn keeping with the universal vision, and anticipating a key Wikipedia norm, H. G. Wells was concerned that his \"World Brain\" be an \"encyclopedia appealing to all mankind,\" and therefore it must remain open to corrective criticism, be skeptical of myths (no matter how \"venerated\") and guard against \"narrowing propaganda.\" This strikes me as similar to the pluralism inherent in the Wikipedia \"Neutral Point of View\" goal of \"representing significant views fairly, proportionately, and without bias.\"\n\n\n"}
